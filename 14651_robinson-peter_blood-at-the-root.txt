peter robinson blood at the root an inspector banks mystery for sheila one i the boys body sat propped against the graffitiscarred wall in a ginnel off market street head lolling forward chin on chest hands clutching his stomach a bib of blood had spilled down the front of his white shirt detective chief inspector alan banks stood in the rain and watched peter darby finish photographing the scene bursts of electronic flash freezing the raindrops in midair as they fell banks was irritated by rights he shouldnt be there not in the rain at half past one on a saturday night as if he didnt have enough problems already he had got the call the minute he walked in the door after an evening alone in leeds at opera norths the pearl fishers alone because his wife sandra had realized on wednesday that the benefit gala she was supposed to host for the eastvale community center clashed with their season tickets they had argued sandra expecting banks to forgo the opera in favor of her gala so stubbornly banks had gone alone this sort of thing had been happening a lot lately going their own ways to such an extent that banks could hardly remember the last time they had done anything together the limpid melody of the au fond du temple saint duet still echoed around his mind as he watched dr burns the young police surgeon start his in situ examination under the canvas tent the sceneofcrime officers had erected over the body police constable ford had come across the scene at eleven fortyseven while walking his beat community policing being a big thing in eastvale these days at first he said he thought the victim was just a drunk too legless to get all the way home after the pubs closed after all there was a broken beer bottle on the ground beside the lad he seemed to be holding his stomach and in the light of fords torch the dark blood could easily have passed for vomit ford told banks he didnt know quite what it was that finally alerted him this was no drunk sleeping it off perhaps it was the unnatural stillness of the body or the silence there was no snoring no twitching or muttering the way drunks often did just silence inside the hiss and patter of the rain when he knelt and looked more closely well of course then he knew the ginnel was a passage no more than six feet wide between two blocks of terrace houses on carlaw place it was often used as a short cut between market street and the western area of eastvale now onlookers had gathered at its mouth behind the police tape most of them huddled under umbrellas pajama bottoms sticking out from under raincoats lights had come on in many houses along the street despite the lateness of the hour several uniformed officers were circulating in the crowd and knocking on doors seeking anyone who had seen or heard anything the ginnel walls offered some protection from the rain but not much banks could feel the cold water trickling down the back of his neck he pulled up his collar it was midoctober the time of year when the weather veered sharply between warm misty mellow days straight out of keats and piercing galeforce winds that drove stinging rain into your face like the showers of blefuscuan arrows fired at gulliver banks watched dr burns turn the victim on his side ease down his trousers and take the rectal temperature he had already had a glance at the body himself and it looked as if someone had beaten or kicked the kid to death the features were too severely damaged to reveal much except that he was a young white male his wallet was missing along with whatever keys and loose change he might have been carrying and there was nothing else in his pockets to indicate who he was it had probably started as a pub fight banks guessed or perhaps the victim had been flashing his money about as he watched dr burns examine the boys broken features banks imagined the scene as it might have happened the kid scared running perhaps realizing that whatever had started innocently enough was quickly getting out of control how many of them were after him two probably at least maybe three or four he runs through the dark deserted streets in the rain splashing through puddles oblivious to his wet feet does he know theyre going to kill him or is he just afraid of taking a beating either way he sees the ginnel thinks he can make it slip away get home free but its too late something hits him or trips him knocks him down and suddenly his face is crushed down against the rainy stone the cigarette ends and chocolate wrappers he can taste blood grit leaves probe a broken tooth with his tongue and then he feels a sharp pain in his side another in his back his stomach his groin then theyre kicking his head as if it were a football hes trying to speak beg plead but he cant get the words out his mouth is too full of blood and finally he just slips away no more pain no more fear no more anything well maybe it had happened like that or they could have been already lying in wait for him blocking the ginnel at each end trapping him inside some of bankss bosses had said he had too much imagination for his own good though he found it had always come in useful people would be surprised if they knew how much of what they believed to be painstaking logical police work actually came down to a guess a hunch or a sudden intuition banks shrugged off the line of thought and got back to the business in hand dr burns was still kneeling shining a penlight inside the boys mouth it looked like a pound of raw minced meat to banks he turned away a pub fight then though they didnt usually end in death fights were common enough on a saturday night in eastvale especially when some of the lads came in from the outlying villages eager to demonstrate their physical superiority over the arrogant townies they would come early to watch eastvale united or the rugby team in the afternoon and by pub chuckingout time they were usually three sheets to the wind jostling each other in the fishandchipshop queues slagging everyone in sight just looking for trouble it was a familiar pattern what are you looking at nothing you calling me nothing get out of that if you can by midnight though most of the boozers had usually gone home unless they had moved on to one of eastvales two nightclubs where for a modest entrance fee you got membership an inedible battered beefburger a constant supply of earsplitting music and most important of all the chance to swill back watery lager until three in the morning it wasnt that banks had no sympathy for the victim after all the boy was somebodys son but solving this case he thought would simply be a matter of canvassing the local pubs and finding out where meladdo had been drinking whom hed been upsetting a job for detective sergeant hatchley perhaps certainly not one for a wet detective chief inspector with bizets melodies still caressing his inner ear one whose only wish was to crawl into a nice warm bed beside a wife who probably still wasnt speaking to him dr burns finished his examination and walked over burns did onscene examinations when the local home office pathologist dr glendenning was unavailable he looked far too young and innocent for the job in fact he looked more like a farmer with his round face pleasant rustic features and mop of chestnut hair but he was quickly becoming conversant with the different ways in which man could dispatch his fellow man to the hereafter well it certainly looks like a boot job he said putting his black notebook back in his pocket i cant swear to it of course thatll be for dr glendenning to determine at the postmortem but it looks that way from what i can make out on first examination one eyes practically hanging out of its socket the nose is pulped and there are several skull fractures in some places the bone fragments might possibly have punctured the brain burns sighed in a way the poor buggers lucky hes dead if hed survived hed have been a oneeyed vegetable for the rest of his days no sign of any other injuries a few broken ribs and id expect some severe damage to the internal organs other than that burns glanced back at the body and shrugged id guess he was kicked to death by someone wearing heavy shoes or boots but dont quote me on that it also looks as if he was hit on the back of the head maybe by that bottle just one person burns ran his hand over his wet hair and rubbed it dry on the side of his trousers im sorry i didnt mean to imply that it was more likely two or three a gang perhaps but one person could have done it as soon as the victim was down on the ground yes thing is though he looks pretty strong it might have taken more than one person to get him down unless of course that was what the bottle was used for any idea how long hes been there not long burns looked at his watch allowing for the weather conditions id say maybe two hours two and a half at the outside banks made a quick backcalculation it was twenty to two now that meant the kid had probably been killed between ten past eleven and eleven fortyseven when pc ford found the body a little over half an hour and a half hour that happened to coincide with pubclosing time his theory was still looking good anyone know who he is banks asked dr burns shook his head any chance of cleaning him up enough for an artists impression might be worth a try but as i said the nose is pulped one eyes practically yes yes thank you doctor burns nodded briskly and walked off the coroners officer directed two ambulance attendants to bag the body and take it to the mortuary peter darby took more photographs and the socos went on with their search the rain kept falling banks leaned back against the damp wall and lit a cigarette it might help concentrate his mind besides he liked the way cigarettes tasted in the rain there were things to be done procedures to be set in motion first of all they had to find out who the victim was where he had come from where he belonged and what he had been doing on the day of his death surely banks thought someone somewhere must be missing him or was he a stranger in town far from home once they knew something about the victim then it would simply be a matter of legwork eventually they would track down the bastards who had done this they would probably be kids certainly no older than their victim and they would by turn be contrite and arrogant in the end if they were old enough they would probably get charged with manslaughter nine years out in five sometimes it was all so bloody predictable banks thought as he flicked his tabend into the gutter and walked to his car splashing through puddles that reflected the revolving lights of the police cars and at that point he could hardly be blamed for not knowing how wrong he was ii the telephone call at eight oclock on sunday morning woke detective constable susan gay from a pleasant dream about visiting egypt with her father they had never done anything of the kind of course her father was a cool remote man who had never taken her anywhere but the dream seemed real enough eyes still closed susan groped until her fingers touched the smooth plastic on her bedside table then she juggled the receiver beside her on the pillow mmm she mumbled susan sir she recognized bankss voice and tried to drag herself out of the arms of morpheus but she couldnt get very far she frowned and rubbed sleep from her eyes waking up had always been a slow process for susan ever since she was a little girl sorry to wake you so early on a sunday banks said but we got a suspicious death after closing time last night yes sir susan raised herself from the sheets and propped herself against the pillows suspicious death she knew what that meant work now the thin bedsheet slipped from her shoulders and left her breasts bare her nipples were hard from the morning chill in the bedroom for a moment she felt exposed talking to banks while she was sitting up naked in bed but he couldnt see her she told herself not to be so daft weve got scant little to go on banks went on we dont even know the victims name yet i need you down here as soon as you can make it yes sir ill be right there susan replaced the receiver ran her fingers through her hair and got out of bed she stood on her tiptoes and stretched her arms toward the ceiling until she felt the knots in her muscles crack then she padded to the living room pausing to note the thickness of her waist and thighs in the wardrobe mirror on her way she would have to start that diet again soon before she went to take a shower she started the coffeemaker and put some old rod stewart on the cd player to help her wake up as the hot water played over her skin she thought of last nights date with gavin richards a dc from regional headquarters he had taken her to the georgian theatre in richmond to see an alan bennett play and after that they had found a cozy pub just off richmond market square where she had eaten cheese and onion crisps and drunk a half pint of cider walking to her car both of them huddled under her umbrella because it was raining fast and like a typical man gavin hadnt bothered to carry one she had felt his warmth felt herself responding to it and when he had asked her back to his house for a coffee she had almost said yes almost but she wasnt ready yet she wanted to oh she wanted to especially when they kissed goodnight by her car it had been too long but they had only been out together three times and that was too soon for susan she might have sacrificed her personal life for her career over the last few years but she wasnt about to hop into bed with the first tasty bloke who happened to come along when she noticed she had been standing in the shower so long that her skin had started to glow she got out dried herself off briskly and threw on a pair of black jeans and a poloneck jumper that matched her eyes she was lucky that her curly blond hair needed hardly any attention at all she added a little gel to give it luster then she was ready to go rod stewart sang maggie mae as she sipped the last of her black sugarless coffee and munched a slice of dry toast still eating she grabbed a light jacket from the hook and dashed out the door it was only a fiveminute drive to the station and on another occasion she might have walked for the exercise especially this morning it was a perfect autumn day scrubbed blue skies and only the slightest chill in the air the recent winds had already blown a few early lemon and russet leaves from the trees and they squished under her feet as she walked to her car but today susan paused only briefly to sniff the crisp air then she got in her car and turned the key in the ignition her red golf started on the first try an auspicious beginning iii banks leaned by his office window his favorite spot blew on the surface of his coffee and watched the steam rise as he looked out over the quiet market square he was thinking about sandra about their marriage and the way it all seemed to be going wrong not so much wrong just nowhere she still hadnt spoken to him since the opera not that shed had much chance really with him being out so late at the crime scene and this morning she had barely been conscious by the time he left but still there was a discernible chill in the house last nights rain had washed the excesses of saturday night from the cobbles just as the station cleaning staff disinfected and mopped out the cells after the overnight drunkanddisorderlies had been discharged the square and the buildings around it glowed pale graygold in the early light banks had his window open a couple of inches and the sound of the church congregation singing we plough the fields and scatter drifted in it took him back to the harvest festivals of his childhood when his mum would give him a couple of apples and oranges to put in the church basket along with everyone elses he often wondered what happened to all the fruit after the festival was over the dalesman calendar on his wall showed healaugh church near york through a farm gate it wasnt a particularly autumnal shot banks was thinking as he heard the tap on his door it was susan gay first to arrive after detective superintendent gristhorpe who was already busy coordinating with regional hq and arranging for local media coverage as usual susan looked fresh as a daisy banks thought just the right amount of makeup blond curls still glistening from the shower while no one would describe susan gay as an oil painting with her small button nose and her serious guarded expression her clear bluegray eyes were intriguing and she had a beautiful smooth complexion not for susan banks thought the wild boozy saturday nights favored by jim hatchley who followed hot on her heels looking like death warmed over eyes bleary and bloodshot lips dry and cracked a shred of toilet paper stuck over a shaving cut thinning straw hair unwashed and uncombed for a couple of days after the two of them had sat down both nursing cups of coffee banks explained how the boy had been killed then he walked over to the map of eastvale on the wall by his filing cabinet and pointed to the ginnel where the body had been discovered this is where pc ford found him he began there are no through roads leading west nearby so people tend to cut through the residential streets then take the carlaw place ginnel over the recreation ground to king street and the leaview estate thing is it works both ways so he could have been heading in either direction we dont know sir said susan you told me on the telephone that hed probably been killed shortly after closing time if hed been out drinking isnt it more likely that he was heading from market street i mean thats quite a popular spot for young people on a saturday night theres a fair number of pubs and some of them have live bands or karaoke karaoke banks felt himself shudder at the thought the only other words that had a similar effect on him were country and western music an oxymoron if ever there was one good point he said so lets concentrate our survey on the market street pubs and the leaview estate to start with if we draw a blank there we can extend the area how much do we know sir sergeant hatchley asked precious little ive already had a look at the overnight logs and there are no reports of any major shindigs weve talked to the occupants of the terrace houses on both sides of the ginnel as well as the people across the street the only one with anything to say was watching television so he didnt hear anything too clearly but he was sure he did hear a fight or something outside during the liverpoolnewcastle game on match of the day what exactly did he hear sir susan asked just some scuffling and grunting then the sound of people running away he thought more than one but he couldnt say how many or which direction he thought it was just the usual drunken yobs and he certainly had no intention of going outside and finding out for himself you can hardly blame him these days can you said sergeant hatchley picking gingerly at the tissue over his shaving cut it started to bleed again some of these yobsd kill you as soon as look at you besides it were a bloody good match anyway banks went on youd better check with traffic too we dont know for certain whether the attackers ran home or drove off maybe they got a parking ticket or got stopped for speeding we should be so lucky muttered hatchley banks pulled two sheets of paper from a folder on his desk and passed one each to susan and hatchley it showed an artists impression of a young man probably in his early twenties with thin lips and a long narrow nose his hair was cut short and combed neatly back despite his youth it seemed to be receding at the temples and looked very thin on top there was nothing particularly distinctive about him but banks thought he could perceive a hint of arrogance in the expression of course that was probably just artistic license the nightshift attendant at the mortuary came up with this he said a few months back he got bored with having no one to talk to on the job so he started sketching corpses as a way of passing the time still lifes he calls them obviously a man of hidden talents anyway he told us this was mostly speculation especially the nose which had been badly broken the cheekbones had been fractured too so he was guessing about how high and how prominent they might have been but the hairs right he says and the general shape of the head itll have to do for now the only things we know for certain are that the victim was a little over six feet tall weighed eleven stone was in fine physical shape an athlete perhaps and he had blue eyes and blond hair no birthmarks scars tattoos or other distinguishing features he tapped the folder well try to get this on the local tv news today and in the papers tomorrow morning for now you can start with the housetohouse then after opening time you can canvass the pubs uniform branch has detailed four officers to help our first priority is to find out who the poor bugger was and the second is to discover who he was last seen with before he was killed okay they both nodded and stood up to leave and take your mobiles or personal radios and stay in touch with one another i want the right hand to know what the left hands doing all right yes sir said susan as for me said banks with a grim smile dr glendenning has kindly offered to come in and do the postmortem this morning so i think one of us should pay him the courtesy of being present dont you iv a lot of detectives complained about housetohouse inquiries much preferring to spend their time in scummy pubs with lowlife informers getting the real feel of the job or so they thought but susan gay had always enjoyed a good housetohouse at the very least it was good exercise in patience of course you got the occasional nutter the boor and the lecherous creep with his hound of the baskervilles straining at the end of its chain once even a naked child had toddled out to see what was happening and peed all over susans new shoes the mother had thought it hilarious then there were those endless hours in the rain wind and snow knocking at door after door your feet aching the damp and chill fast seeping right into the marrow of your bones wishing youd chosen some other career thinking even marriage and kids would be better than this and needless to say every now and then some cleverarse pillock would tell her she was too pretty to be a policeman or would suggest she could put her handcuffs on him anytime she wanted hahaha but that was all part of the game and she didnt mind as much as she sometimes pretended she did to annoy sergeant hatchley as far as susan was concerned the human race would always contain a large number of cleverarse pillocks no matter what you thought and the greatest percentage of them in her experience were likely to be men but on a fine morning like this the valley sides beyond the towns western edge crisscrossed with limestone walls slopes still lush green after the latesummer rains and the purple heather coming into bloom up high where the wild moorland began it was as good a way as any to be earning your daily crust and there was nothing like a housetohouse for getting to know your patch the morning chill had quickly given way to warmth and susan guessed eastvale might hit seventy before the day was over indian summer indeed she took her jacket off and slung it over her shoulder at that time of year in the dales any good day was a bonus not to be wasted tomorrow might come rain flood and famine so seize the moment children played football in the streets or rode around on bicycles and skateboards men with their shirtsleeves rolled up flung buckets of soapy water over their cars then waxed them to perfection groups of teenagers stood around street corners smoking trying to look sullen and menacing and failing on both counts doors and windows stood open some people even sat on their doorsteps reading the sunday papers and drinking tea as susan walked she could smell meat roasting and cakes baking she also heard snatches of just about every kind of music from crispian st peters singing you were on my mind to the opening of elgars cello concerto which she only recognized because it was the same excerpt as the one on the cd she got free with her classicalmusic magazine last month the leaview estate had been built just after the war the houses a mix of bungalows semis and terraces were solid their style and materials in harmony with the rest of swainsdales limestone and gritstone architecture no ugly maisonettes or blocks of flats spoiled the skyline the way they did across town on the newer east side estate and on the leaview estate many of the streets were named after flowers it was almost noon and susan had already covered the primroses the laburnums and the roses without any luck now she was about to move on to the daffodils and buttercups she carried a clipboard with her carefully ticking off all the houses she visited putting question marks and notes beside any responses she found suspicious keeping a keen eye open for bruised knuckles and any other signs of recent pugilism if someone wasnt home she would circle the house number after every street she used her personal radio to report back to the station if hatchley or any of the uniformed officers got results first then the communications center would inform her a boy came speeding around the corner of daffodil rise on rollerblades and susan managed to jump out of the way in the nick of time he didnt stop she held her hand to her chest until her heartbeat slowed to normal and thought about arresting him on a traffic offense then the adrenaline ebbed away and she got her breath back she rang the bell of number two the woman who answered was probably in her late fifties susan guessed nicely turned out hair recently permed only a touch of lipstick face powder maybe just back from church she wore a beige cardigan despite the heat as she spoke she held it closed over her pale pink blouse yes dearie she said susan showed her warrant card and held out the mortuary attendants sketch were trying to find out who this boy is she said we think he might live locally so were asking around to find out if anyone knows him the woman stared at the drawing then tilted her head and scratched her chin well she said it could be jason fox jason fox it sounded like a pop stars name to susan yes mr and mrs foxs young lad well susan thought tapping her pen against her clipboard thats enlightening do they live around here aye just over the street she pointed number seven but i only said it might be its not a good likeness you know love you ought to get a proper artist working for you like my lad laurence now theres an artist for you he sells his prints at the craft center in town you know im sure he yes mrs ingrams the name laurence ingram ill bear him in mind mrs ingram now is there anything you can tell me about jason fox the nose isnt right thats the main thing very good with noses is my laurence did curly watts from coronation street down to a tee and thats not an easy one did you know hed done curly watts right popular with the celebrities is my laurence oh yes very susan took a deep breath then went on mrs ingram could you tell me if youve seen jason fox around lately not since yesterday but then hes never around much lives in leeds i think how old is he i couldnt say for certain hes left school though i know that any trouble jason no quiet as a mouse as i said you hardly ever see him around but it does look like him except for the nose and its easy to get noses wrong as my laurence says thank you mrs ingram said susan glancing over at number seven thank you very much and she hurried down the path wait a minute mrs ingram called after her arent you going to tell me whats happened after all the help ive given you has summat happened to young jason has he been up to summat if jasons the one were looking for susan thought then youll find out soon enough as yet he was only a possible but she knew she had better inform banks before barging in on her own she went back to the corner of the street and spoke into her personal radio v banks walked quickly through the narrow streets of tourist shops behind the police station then down king street toward daffodil rise beyond the leaview estate the town gradually dissolved into countryside the sides of the valley narrowing and growing steeper the farther west they went near eastvale swainsdale was a broad valley with plenty of room for villages and meadows and for the river swain to meander this way and that but twenty or thirty miles in around swainshead it was an area of high fells much narrower and less hospitable to human settlements one or two places like swainshead itself and the remote skield managed to eke out an existence in the wild landscape around witch fell and adams fell but only just the last row of old cottages gallows view pointed west like a crooked finger into the dale bankss first case in eastvale had centered around those cottages he remembered as he hurried on toward daffodil rise graham sharp who had been an important figure in the case had died of a heart attack over the summer banks had heard he had sold his shop a few years ago and it had been run since by the mahmoods whom banks knew slightly through his son brian he had seen them down at the station too recently according to susan someone had lobbed a brick through their window a couple of weeks ago in what used to be empty fields around gallows view a new housing estate was under construction scheduled for completion in a years time banks could see the halfdug foundations scattered with puddles the piles of bricks and boards sun glinting on idle cranes and concrete mixers one or two streets had been partially built but none of the houses had roofs yet number seven daffodil rise really stood out from the rest of the houses on the street not only had the owners put up a little white fence around the garden and installed a paneled natural pinelook door complete with a stainedglass windowpane lunacy banks thought so easy to break and enter they also had one of the few gardens in the street that lived up to the flower motif and because it had been a long summer many of the flowers usually gone by the end of september were still in blossom bees droned around the red and yellow roses that still clung to their thorny bushes just under the front window and the garden beds were a riot of chrysanthemums dahlias begonias and gladioli the front door was ajar banks tapped softly before walking in he had told susan gay over the radio that she should talk to the parents and try to confirm whether the drawing might be of their son before he arrived but not to tell them anything until he got there when banks walked in mrs fox was just bringing a tea tray through from the kitchen into the bright airy living room cut flowers in crystal vases adorned the dining table and the polished wood top of the fakecoal electric fire roses climbed trellises on the cream wallpaper over the fireplace hung a framed antique map of yorkshire the kind you can buy in tourist shops for a couple of quid along the narrowest wall stood floortoceiling wooden shelving that seemed to be full of longplaying records mrs fox was about forty banks guessed sandras age she wore a loose white top and black leggings that outlined her finely tapered legs with welltoned calves and shapely thighs the kind you only got at that age from regular exercise she had a narrow face and her features seemed cramped just a little too close together her hair was simply parted in the middle and hung down as far as her shoulders on each side curling under just a little at the bottom the roots were only a slightly darker shade of blond mr fox stood up to shake hands with banks bald except for a couple of black chevrons above his ears with a thin bony face he wore blackrimmed glasses jeans and a green sweatshirt he was exceptionally skinny which made him appear tall and he looked as if he had the kind of metabolism that allowed him to eat as much as he wanted without putting on a pound banks wasnt quite as skinny himself but he never seemed to put on much weight either despite the ale and the junk food tea poured mrs fox sat down on the sofa with her husband and crossed her long legs husband and wife left enough space for another person to sit between them but banks took a chair from the dining table turned it around and sat resting his arms on the back mr and mrs fox were just telling me susan gay said getting her notebook out that jason looks like the lad in the drawing and he didnt sleep here last night she wont tell us anything mrs fox appealed to banks with her small glittering eyes is our jason in any trouble has he ever been in trouble before banks asked she shook her head never hes a good boy he never caused us any problems has he steven thats why i cant understand you coming here weve never had the police here before werent you worried when jason didnt sleep here last night mrs fox looked surprised no why should i be werent you expecting him look whats happened whats going on jason lives in leeds chief inspector steven fox cut in he just uses our house when it suits him a bit like a hotel oh come on steven his wife said you know thats not fair jasons grown up hes got his own life to live but hes still our son when it suits him what does he do in leeds banks cut in hes got a good job said steven fox and theres not many as can say that these days an office job at a factory out in stourton i assume hes also got a flat or a house in leeds too yes a flat can you give dc gay the address please and the name and address of the factory of course steven fox gave susan the information do either of you know where jason was last night banks asked or who he was with mrs fox answered no she said look chief inspector cant you please tell us whats going on im worried is my jason in trouble has something happened to him i understand that youre worried banks said and ill do everything i can to hurry things up please bear with me though and answer just a few more short questions just a few more minutes okay they both nodded reluctantly do you have a recent photograph of jason mrs fox got up and brought a small framed photo from the sideboard only this she said he was seventeen when it was taken the boy in the photo looked similar to the victim but it was impossible to make a positive identification teenagers can change a lot in three or four years and heavy boots do a great deal of damage to facial features do you know what jason did yesterday where he went mrs fox bit her lip yesterday she said he got home about twelve oclock we had sandwiches for lunch then he went off to play football like he usually does where he plays for eastvale united steven fox said banks knew the team they were only amateur players but hed taken brian to see them once or twice and they had demonstrated the triumph of enthusiasm over talent their matches had become quite popular with the locals and they sometimes managed to draw two or three hundred to their bumpy field on a few acres of waste ground between york road and market street hes a striker said mrs fox with pride top goal scorer in north yorkshire last season amateur leagues that is impressive said banks did you see him after the game yes he came home for his tea after hed had a quick drink with his mates from the team then he went out about seven oclock didnt he steven mr fox nodded did he say whether hed be back no does he normally stop here on weekends sometimes mrs fox answered but not always sometimes he drives back to leeds and sometimes he doesnt come up at all does he have his own key mrs fox nodded what kind of car does he drive oh my god its not a car crash is it mrs fox put her hands to her face oh please dont tell me our jasons been killed in a car crash at least banks could assure her of that honestly its one of those little renaults said steven fox a clio bloody awful color it is too shiny green like the back of some sort of insect where does he park when hes here mr fox jerked his head theres a double garage round the back he usually parks it there next to ours have you looked to see if the cars still there no id no call to did you hear it last night he shook his head no we usually go to bed early before jason gets back if hes stopping the night he tries to be quiet and were both pretty heavy sleepers would you be kind enough to show dc gay where the garage is banks asked steve fox and susan if the cars there see if he left the keys in it steven fox led susan out through the back door does jason have a girlfriend banks asked mrs fox while they were gone she shook her head i dont think so he might have someone in leeds i suppose but he never mentioned her or brought her here no i dont think he had anyone steady do you think he would have told you if he had i cant see any reason why he wouldnt how do you and jason get along she turned away we get along just fine susan and steven fox came back from the garage its there all right susan said a green clio i took the number and no keys what is it mrs fox asked if jason wasnt in a car crash did he hit someone was there an accident no said banks he didnt hit anyone he sighed and looked at the map over the fireplace he couldnt really hold back telling them any longer the best he could do was play up the uncertainty aspect i dont want to alarm you he said but a boy was killed last night probably in a fight dc gay showed you the artists impression and someone suggested it might resemble jason thats why we need to know his movements and whereabouts banks waited for the outburst but it didnt come instead mrs fox shook her head and said it cant be our jason he wouldnt get into fights or anything like that and you cant really tell from the picture can you banks agreed im sure youre right he said hes probably gone off somewhere for the weekend with his mates without telling you kids no consideration sometimes have they would jason do something like that mrs fox nodded oh yes never tells us owt our jason does he steven thats right mr fox agreed but banks could tell from his tone that he wasnt quite as convinced as his wife about jasons not being the victim he wondered why in his experience mothers often held more illusions about their children than fathers did does jason have any friends on the estate he might have gone out with banks asked anyone local mrs fox looked at her husband before answering no she said see weve only been living in eastvale for three years since we moved from halifax besides jason doesnt drink well not hardly when did he get this job in leeds just before we moved i see said banks so he hasnt really spent much time here had time to settle in and make friends thats right said mrs fox does he have any other relations in the area he might have gone to visit an uncle perhaps someone like that only my dad said mrs fox thats why we moved here really to be nearer my dad my mam died two years ago and hes not getting any younger where does he live up in lyndgarth so hes not far away in case of emergencies like eastvale was the closest town steven could get a transfer what kind of work do you do mr fox building society abbey national that big branch on york road just north of the market square banks nodded i know the one look its just a thought but does jason spend much time with his grandfather might he be stopping with him mrs fox shook her head hed have let us know dad would hes got a telephone didnt want one but we insisted besides jasons car would your father know anything more about jasons friends and his habits i dont think so said mrs fox fidgeting with her wedding ring they used to be close when jason were a young lad but you know what its like when kids grow up she shrugged banks did he well remembered preferring the company of his grandparents to that of his mother and father when he was young they were more indulgent with him for a start and would often give him a tanner for sweets which hed usually spend on sherbet gobstoppers and a threepenny lucky bag he also liked his grandfathers pipe rack the smell of tobacco around the darkpaneled house the tarnished silver cigarette case with the dint where a german bullet had hit it saving his grandfathers life or so his grandfather had told him he had loved the stories about the war not the second but the first and his grandfather had even let him wear his old gas mask which smelled of rubber and dust they had spent days walking by the river nene standing by the railway tracks to watch the sleek streamlined flying scotsman go by but all that had changed when banks entered his teens and he felt especially guilty about not seeing his granddad for a whole year before the old man died while banks was at college in london are there any other family members he asked brothers or sisters only maureen my daughter shes just turned eighteen where is she nurses training school up in newcastle would she be able to help us with any of jasons friends no theyre not particularly close never were different as chalk and cheese banks glanced over at susan and indicated she should put her notebook away would you mind if we had a quick look at jasons room he asked just to see if theres anything up there that might help us find out what he was doing last night steven fox stood up and walked toward the stairs ill show you the tidiness of the room surprised banks he didnt know why stereotyping no doubt but hed been expecting the typical teenagers room like his son brians which usually looked as if it had just been hit by a tornado but jasons bed was made sheets so tightly stretched across the mattress you could bounce a coin on them and if he had dirty washing lying around as brian always had then banks couldnt see it against one of the walls stood shelving similar to that downstairs also stacked with longplaying records and several rows of s jason likes music i see banks said actually theyre mine said steven fox walking over and running his long fingers over a row of lps my collection jason says its okay to use the wall space because hes not here that often its mostly sixties stuff i started collecting in when love me do came out ive got everything the beatles ever recorded all originals all in mint condition and not only the beatles ive got all the rolling stones grateful dead doors cream jimi hendrix the searchers if you can get it on vinyl ive got it but i dont suppose youre interested in all that banks was interested in mr foxs record collection and on another occasion he would have been more than happy to look over the titles just because he loved opera and classical music in general didnt mean he looked down on rock jazz or blues only on country and western and brass bands this latter opinion was regarded as a serious lapse of taste in yorkshire banks was well aware but he felt that anyone who had had to endure an evening of brassband renditions of mozart arias as he once had was more than entitled to it apart from steven foxs record collection the room was strangely spartan almost an ascetics cell and even on such a warm day it seemed to emanate the chill of the cloister there was only one framed print on the wall and it showed a group of three naked women according to the title they were supposed to be norse goddesses but they looked more like bored housewives to banks there was no television or video no stereo and no books maybe he kept most of his things in his flat in leeds steven fox stood in the doorway as banks and susan started poking around the spotless corners the dresser drawers were full of underclothes and casual wear jeans sweatshirts tshirts by the side of the bed lay a set of weights banks could just about lift them but he didnt fancy doing fifty bench presses in the wardrobe he found jasons football strip a couple of very conservative suits both navy blue and some white dress shirts and sober ties and that was it so much for any clues about jason foxs life and friends back downstairs mrs fox was pacing the living room gnawing at her knuckles banks could tell she was no longer able to keep at bay the terrible realization that something bad might have happened to her son after all jason hadnt come home his car was still in the garage and now the police were in her house a part of banks hoped for her sake that the victim wasnt jason but there was only one way to find that out for certain two i frank hepplethwaite reached for his inhaler aimed it at the back of his throat and let off a blast of nitro within seconds the pain in his chest began to abate along with that suffocating sense of panic that always came with it frank sat completely still in his favorite armchair the one that edna had been constantly nagging him to get rid of true the seat cushion was worn and it bulged like a hernia through the support slats underneath and true the frayed upholstery had long since lost whatever pattern it might have had and faded to a sort of dull brown with a worn greasy spot where he had rested the back of his head year after year but he had never found anywhere else quite so comfortable to sit and read in all his seventysix years and though he was seventysix his eyes were as good as theyd ever been well almost if he put his reading glasses on better than his teeth and his heart at any rate when he felt steady enough again he rested his palms on the threadbare patches of fabric and pushed himself up slowly to standing position five foot ten in his stockinged feet and he still weighed no more than ten stone face it though frank he told himself as he wrapped his scarf around his neck and reached for his tweed jacket on the hook behind the door you wont be able to go on like this by yourself much longer even now mrs weston came in once or twice a week to tidy up and make his meals and his daughter josie came over from eastvale to do his washing and to vacuum he could still manage the little domestic tasks like boiling an egg washing what few dishes he used and remaking his bed in the morning but he couldnt change the sheets and any sort of elaborate meal was well beyond him not that he lacked the ability he had been a passable cook in his time he merely lacked the stamina and for how much longer would he be able to manage even the little necessities how long would it be before a simple visit to the toilet was beyond him a bowel movement too much of a strain on his heart best not think about that he told himself sensing the abyss that awaited him beyond this point be monsters at least edna had gone first bless her soul and while he missed her every minute he continued to live at least he wouldnt have to worry about her coping after hed gone frank went into the hall and paused at the front door he rarely got any letters these days so he was surprised to see one lying on the carpet it must have arrived yesterday saturday he hadnt been out since friday hadnt even had cause to go into the hall so it was no wonder he hadnt noticed it bending carefully knees creaking he picked it up and slipped it in his inside pocket it could wait it wasnt a bill at least it didnt look official it didnt have one of those windows he opened the door sniffed the air and smiled well well another taste of summer with just a hint of peat smoke from the village what strange weather the dale had been having these past few years global warming the papers said damage to the ozone layer greenhouse effect whatever all that was bloody grand anyway he decided to be devilmaycare today and took off his scarf then he walked down the road toward the green pausing by the whitewashed facade of the swainsdale heifer to watch out for traffic hurtling across the blind corner the way it did despite the warning signs then he walked on the broad cobbled area in front of the gift shop the small barclays bank branch and the estate agents office past the kings head to the third pub in the village the black bull it would have to be the bloody farthest pub from his house he always grumbled to himself but the black bull had been his local for over forty years and he was damned if he was going to change it now even if the walk did sometimes put him out of breath and even if the new landlord didnt seem to give a toss for anyone but tourists with plenty of readies to flash around frank had seen a dozen landlords come and go he was all right in his way was old jacob a london jew born of one of the few families lucky enough to escape to england from germany just before the war and he had his living to make but he was a tight old skinflint a drink or two on the house now and then would make an old mans pension go a lot farther the last landlord had understood that not jacob he was as close with his brass as old len metcalfe had been over ten years back frank pushed the heavy door which creaked as it opened and walked across the worn stone flagging to the bar double bell s please he said hello there frank said jacob how are you today frank touched his chest just a twinge or two jacob he said just a twinge other than that im right as rain he took his drink and wandered over to his usual small table to the left of the bar where he could see down the corridor to the machines and the billiard table on the raised area at the far end as usual he said hello to mike and ken who were sitting on stools at the bar agonizing over a crossword puzzle and to that poncy southern windbag clive who was sitting a stool or two down from them puffing on his bloody pipe and pontificating about sheep breeding as if he knew a bloody thing about it a few of the other tables were occupied by tourists some of them kitted out for a days walking or climbing it was sunday after all and a fine one at that frank took a sip of bells winced at the sharpness and hoped the burning he felt as it went down was just the whiskey not the final heart attack then he remembered the letter he had put in his pocket he put on his reading glasses reached his hand in and slipped it out the address was handwritten and there was no indication of who had sent it he didnt recognize the writing but then he hardly ever saw handwriting these days everything you got was typed or done on computers he couldnt make out the postmark clearly either but it looked like brighouse or maybe bradford it could even be brighton or bristol for all he knew posted on thursday carefully he tore the envelope open and slid out the single sheet of paper it had type on both sides in columns and a large bold heading across the top at first he thought it was a flyer for a jumble sale or something but as he read he realized how wrong he was confused at first then angry he read the printed words long before he had finished tears came to his eyes he told himself they were scotch tears just the burning of the whiskey but he knew they werent he also knew who had sent him the flyer and why ii some of the more modern mortuaries were equipped with video cameras and monitor screens to make it easier for relatives to identify accident or murder victims from a comfortable distance not in eastvale though there the attendant still slid the body out of the refrigerated unit and slipped back the sheet from the face which was odd banks thought as the mortuary was certainly the most recently renovated part of that drafty old pile of stone known as eastvale general infirmary steven and josie fox had at first been unwilling to come and view the body banks could see their point if it was jason they would have to face up to his death and if it wasnt then they would have gone through all the unpleasantness of looking at a badly beaten corpse for nothing reluctantly though they had gone refusing bankss offer of a police car and choosing to walk instead susan gay had returned to the station because the hospital was small and old and too close to the tourist shops another much larger establishment was under construction on the northern edge of the town but for now eastvale general was all there was every time he walked up the front steps banks shuddered there was something about the dark rough stone even on a fine day that made him think of operations without anesthetic of unsterilized surgical instruments of plague and death he led the foxes through the maze of high corridors and down the stairs to the basement where the mortuary was banks identified himself to one of the attendants who nodded checked his files and touched mrs fox lightly on the arm please follow me he said they did along a whitetiled corridor into a chilled room there the attendant checked his papers again before sliding out the tray on which the body lay banks watched the foxes they werent touching one another at all not holding hands or clutching arms the way many couples did when faced with such a situation could there really be such distance between them that even the possibility of seeing their son dead at any second couldnt bridge it was remarkable banks had often thought how people who no longer have any feelings for one another can keep on going through the motions afraid of change of loneliness of rejection he thought of sandra then pushed the thought aside he and sandra were nothing like the foxes they werent so much separate as independent they gave one another space besides they had too much in common had shared too much joy and pain over the years simply to go through the motions of a failed marriage hadnt they the attendant pulled back the white sheet to reveal the corpses face josie fox put her hand to her mouth and started to sob steven fox pale as the sheet that covered his son simply nodded and said its him its our jason banks was surprised at what a good job the mortuary had done on the boys face while it was clear that he had been severely beaten the nose was straight the cheekbones aligned the mouth shut tight to cover the shattered teeth the only wrong note was the way that one eye stared straight up at the ceiling and the other a little to the left at mr and mrs fox banks could never get over the strange effect looking at dead people had on him not bodies at the crime scene so much they sometimes churned his guts especially if the injuries were severe but they were essentially work to him they were human beings robbed of something precious an insult to the sanctity of life on the other hand when he saw bodies laid out in the mortuary or in a funeral parlor they had a sort of calming effect on him he couldnt explain it but as he looked down at the shell of what had once been jason fox he knew there was nobody home the pale corpse resembled nothing more than a fragile eggshell and if you tapped it hard enough it would crack open revealing nothing but darkness inside somehow the effect of all this was to relieve him just for a few welcome moments of his own growing fear of death banks led the dazed foxes out into the open air they stood on the steps of the hospital for a moment silently watching the people come out of the small congregationalist church banks lit a cigarette is there anything i can do he asked after a few moments steven fox looked at him what oh sorry he said then he shook his head no theres nothing ill take josie home now make her a nice cup of tea his wife said nothing they walked down king street still not touching banks sighed and turned up toward the station at least he knew who the victim was now first he would let his team know and then they could begin the investigation proper iii detective sergeant jim hatchley would normally have enjoyed nothing more than a pub crawl any day of the week any hour of the day or night but that sunday all he wanted to do as he walked into his fifth pub the jubilee at the corner of market street and waterloo road was go home crawl into bed and sleep for a week a month nay a bloody year for the past two weeks his daughter april named after the month she was born because neither hatchley nor his wife carol could agree on any other name had kept him awake all night every night as those bloody inconvenient lumps of calcium called teeth bored their way through the tender flesh of her gums with flagrant disregard for the wee bairns comfort or for his and he hadnt been wellenough prepared for it in fact he hadnt been prepared for it at all the first year or so of aprils life you would never have known she was there so quiet was she at worst shed cry out a couple of times when she was hungry but as soon as carols tit was in her mouth she was happy as a pig in clover and why not thought hatchley who felt exactly the same way about carols tit himself not that hed been getting much of that lately either but now april had suddenly turned into a raging monster and put paid to his sleep he knew he looked as if hed been on the piss every morning he went into work he could see the way they were all looking at him but if truth be told he hadnt had a drink in weeks a real drink in a pub that was he remembered some story an old wifes tale probably about rubbing whiskey on a teething babys gums to quieten it down well carol wouldnt let him do that she said she had enough on her plate with one boozer in the family so he had rubbed it on his own gums so to speak or rather let it caress them briefly and gently on its way down to his stomach sometimes that helped him get a tenminute nap between screaming sessions but he never had more than two or three glasses a night he hadnt had a hangover in so long that not only had he almost forgotten what they felt like he was actually beginning to miss them so it was with both a sense of nostalgia and a feeling that hed rather be anywhere else especially asleep in bed that sergeant hatchley entered the jubilee that sunday lunchtime contrary to rumors around the station hatchley didnt know the landlord of every pub in eastvale apart from the queens arms the stations local he tended to avoid the pubs near the town center especially those on market street which always seemed to be full of yobs if there was trouble on a saturday night which there often was these days you could bet it would be on york road or market street the jubilee was also a chain pub all fruit machines theme nights trivia and overpriced food overpriced ale too rock bands played there on friday and saturday nights and it had a reputation for getting some of the best upandcoming bands in yorkshire not that hatchley gave a toss about rock music being a brassband man himself the jubilee was also reputed to be a fertile hunting ground for birds and drugs on sunday lunchtimes though it became a family pub and each family seemed to have about six children in tow all of them screaming at once hatchley leaned over the bar and presented his warrant card to the barmaid as she pulled someone a pint any trouble here saturday night love he asked she jerked her head without looking up at him better ask his nibs over there i werent working hatchley edged down the bar and shoved his way through the drinkers standing there getting a few dirty looks on the way he finally caught the barmans attention and asked for a word cant you see im rushed off my feet the man protested what is it you want like everyone else behind the bar he wore black trousers and a blueandwhitestriped shirt with the jubilee stitched across the left breast when hatchley showed his card the man stopped protesting that he was too busy and called one of the other bar staff to stand in for him then he gestured hatchley down to the far end of the bar where it was quiet sorry about that he said i hate bloody sunday lunchtimes especially after working a saturday night he scratched his thinning hair and a shower of dandruff fell on his shoulders how bloody hygienic hatchley thought my names ted by the way aye well ted lad hatchley said slowly im sorry to disturb you but we all have our crosses to bear first off was there any trouble in here on saturday night what do you mean trouble fights barneys slanging matches hairpulling that sort of thing ted frowned nowt out of the ordinary he said i mean we were busy as buggery so there was no way i could see what were going on everywhere at once especially with the bloody racket that band were making i appreciate that said hatchley who had had the same conversation five times already that morning and was getting steadily sick of it he slipped the sketch from his briefcase recognize him he asked the barman squinted at the drawing then passed it back to hatchley could be any number of people couldnt it hatchley wasnt sure why but he felt the back of his scalp prickle always a sign something wasnt quite right aye but its not he said its an amateur artists reconstruction of a lads face a face that were booted to a bloody pulp after closing time last night so any help you could give us would be much appreciated ted ted turned pale and averted his eyes before answering well seeing as you put it like that but im telling you the truth nothing happened hatchley shook his head why dont i find myself believing you ted can you answer me that look ted held his hand up palm out i dont want any trouble hatchley smiled showing stained and crooked teeth and im not here to give you any its just frightened of something no its not that ted licked his lips i mean i wouldnt want to swear to owt but there were a lad looked a bit like that in last night it couldve been him what was he doing having a drink with a mate what did this mate look like about my height thats five foot six stocky build toughlooking customer you know like he lifted weights or summat short fair hair almost skinhead but not quite and an earring one of them loops like pirates used to have in old films had you seen them before only the one in the drawing if it is him sometimes comes in on a weekend after a match like just for a quick one with the lads plays for united aye so ive heard troublemaker no not at all not even much of a boozer hes usually gone early its just ted scratched his head again sending more flakes of dandruff onto the polished bar there was a bit of a scuffle saturday night thats all no punches he shook his head far as i can tell the lad in the picture bumped into another lad and spilled some of his drink the other lad said something and this one replied like and gave him a bit of a shove for good measure thats all that happened honest pushing and shoving it were all over before it began nobody got beat up could it have continued outside i suppose it could have as i said though it seemed like summat and nowt to me this other lad the one whose drink got spilled did he have any mates with him there were three of them hatchley pointed to the sketch again did you see this lad and his mate leave aye i remember them because i had to remind them more than once to drink up were they drunk mebbe a bit they werent arse over tit if thats what you mean they could still walk in a straight line and speak without slurring like i said id seen the one in the picture a few times before and he werent much of a drinker he might have had a jar more than usual but who hasnt had by closing time on a saturday night and it wasnt till after eleven oclock that you got rid of them right aye about quarter past i know some places are a bit lax but theres no extension of drinkingup time in the jubilee the manager makes that clear what about the other three theyd gone by then were they drunk too no at least they didnt act it anything else you can tell me about them ted looked away why do i get the impression youre still holding something back ted i dont know do i i think you do is it drugs worried well close the place down and youll lose your job no way look like i said i dont want to cause any bother what makes you think youd be causing bother by telling me the truth ted all right let me guess if its not drugs then youre probably frightened these three hooligans are going to come back and wreck your pub if they find out you ratted on them is that it partly i suppose but they werent hooligans oh who were they then did you recognize them aye i recognized them two of them anyroad names i dont know their names but one of thems that lad from the shop off cardigan road you know the one opposite the bottom of the leaview estate and the other ones dad owns that new restaurant in the market square the himalaya hatchley raised his eyebrows see what i mean ted went on see what im worried about now i dont want to get stuck in the middle of some bloody racial incident do i the lad in your picture called one of them a paki bastard and told him to get out of the fucking way thats what happened iv gallows view déjà vu banks thought as he pulled up outside the mahmoods shop of course the street had changed a lot in six years and the wire mesh that covered the display windows was one of the changes inside the smell of cumin and coriander was another the mahmoods were one of three asian families in eastvale in these parts of yorkshire north of leeds and bradford you saw very few visible minorities even in the larger cities like york and harrogate mahmood had enlarged the shop banks noticed originally it had occupied the ground floor of only one cottage and the sharps had used the other as their living room but now the shop had been extended to take up the frontage of both cottages complete with extra plateglass window and a new freezer section the mahmoods sold a whole range of products from bread eggs cigarettes milk and beer to washingup liquid tights magazines lipstick stationery and toothpaste they also rented out videos pretty soon when the new estate was finished the shop would be a little gold mine unlike most people the racist bigots refer to as pakis charles mahmood actually did hail from pakistan or rather his father wasim mahmood did wasim and family emigrated to england in shortly after partition charles was born in bradford in around the time of queen elizabeths coronation and he was naturally given the name of her only male child because the mahmoods were proud of their new country and its royal heritage unfortunately for charles when his own son was born in the prince of wales had yet to marry and produce offspring to name his child charles had to take the devious route of stealing one of the princes middle names he chose george why he didnt choose philip which might have been easier on the lad at school nobody knew as for george himself he said he was only glad his dad hadnt called him arthur which would have seemed even more oldfashioned than george to his classmates banks knew all this because george had been a contemporary of his own son brian at eastvale comprehensive and the two had become good friends during their last couple of years there george had spent quite a bit of time at the banks household and banks remembered his love of music his instinctive curiosity about things and his sense of humor they had all laughed at the story of the family names for example now the kids seemed to have lost touch drifted apart as people do and banks hadnt seen george for a while brian had just started his third year at college in portsmouth and george was still in eastvale pretty much unemployed as far as banks knew apart from helping his dad out at the shop even though they hadnt see one another in a while banks still felt a little uneasy about interviewing george in connection with a criminal matter charles mahmood greeted banks with a smile of recognition his wife shazia waved from the other side of the shop where she was stacking shelves with jars of instant coffee is it about that brickchucking asked charles in his broad west yorkshire accent banks told him it wasnt but assured him that the matter was still under investigation whats up then charles asked george in george he flicked his head upstairs why whats happened banks didnt think she could have heard but shazia mahmood had stopped putting jars on shelves and seemed to be trying to eavesdrop we dont know yet banks said theres nothing to worry about id just like to talk to him okay charles mahmood shrugged fine with me hows he doing these days charles nodded toward the stairs youd better ask him see for yourself hes in his room problems not really just a phase hes going through another sevenday wonder banks smiled remembering the way his father used to say that about every hobby he took up from meccano to stamp collecting hed been right too banks still felt that he lurched restlessly from interest to interest what particular phase is this one he asked youll find out soon enough id better go talk to him then said banks the curiositys killing me he walked upstairs aware of shazia mahmoods eyes drilling into his back and didnt realize until he got to the top that he didnt know which room was georges but it didnt matter by then at the end of the hallway beside the bathroom a door stood slightly ajar and from inside the room banks could smell sandalwood incense and hear piano music it was jazz certainly but not monk bill evans or bud powell no one like that it didnt even resemble the wild flights of cecil taylor one of whose records banks had made the mistake of buying years ago on the strength of a review from a usually reliable critic this music was repetitive and rhythmic a sort of catchy jangling melodic riff played over and over again with very few changes it was vaguely familiar he tapped on the door and george mahmood opened it george was a goodlooking boy with thick black hair long eyelashes and loambrown eyes he looked at banks a moment then said youre brians dad arent you the copper it wasnt exactly the warm welcome banks had hoped for he had thought george might have remembered him with more affection still attitudes change a lot in three years especially when youre young he smiled right thats me the copper mind if i come in is this a social call not exactly i didnt think so george stood aside better come in anyway i dont suppose i could stop you even if i wanted banks entered the bedroom and sat on a hardback chair at the desk george slouched in an armchair but not before he had turned down the music a couple of notches he was wearing baggy black trousers and a white top with a nehru collar who is that playing banks asked why i like it its abdullah ibrahim hes a south african pianist now that george mentioned the name banks realized he had heard of ibrahim and his music before didnt he used to be called dollar brand he asked thats right just like muhammed ali used to be called cassius clay banks hadnt heard of cassius clay in years and he was surprised that someone as young as george had ever heard of alis old name at all they made a little uneasy small talk about brian then banks got quickly to the point he had come for george he said ive come to ask you about saturday night what about it george looked away toward the window and my names not george anymore thats a stupid name just my fathers postcolonial genuflection my names mohammed mahmood as he spoke george turned to look at banks again and his eyes shone with defiant pride now banks saw what charles mahmood meant now it made sense dollar brandabdullah ibrahim the koran lying on the bedside table george was exploring his islamic roots well banks told himself be tolerant not all muslims support death threats against writers he didnt know much about the religion but he supposed there must be as many different forms of islam as there are of christianity which runs a pretty broad spectrum if you include the sandemanians the methodists the quakers and the spanish inquisition why then did he feel so uncomfortable as if he had lost someone he had known not a close friend certainly but a person he had liked and had shared things with now he was excluded he could see it in georges eyes he was the enemy there would be no more music laughter or understanding ideology had come between them and it would rewrite history and deny that the music laughter and understanding had ever happened in the first place banks had been through it once before with an old school friend who had become a bornagain christian they no longer spoke to one another or more accurately banks no longer spoke to him okay mohammed he said did you go to the jubilee with a couple of mates on saturday night what if i did i thought muslims werent supposed to drink banks could swear he saw george blush i dont he answered well not much im stopping who were you with why is there any reason you dont want to tell me george shrugged no it doesnt matter i was with asim and kobir are they from around here asim is asim nazur his dad owns the himalaya they live in the flat above it i know the place said banks who had eaten there on more than one occasion he also knew that asim nazurs father was some sort of bigwig in the yorkshire muslim community and the other lad kobir hes asims cousin from bradford he was just visiting so we took him out to listen to some music thats all look why are what time did you leave the pub i wasnt looking at my watch before closing time yes where did you go we bought some fish and chips at sweaty bettys just down market street then we ate them in a shop doorway because it were pissing down after that we went home why you went your separate ways course we went separate ways youd have to do wouldnt you if you lived in opposite directions which way did you walk home same way i always do from up there cut through the carlaw place ginnel over the rec what time would this be im not sure probably elevenish by then not later no a bit before if anything the pubs hadnt come out mum and dad still up no they were asleep when i got back they close the shop at ten on a saturday theyd been up since before dawn did you see anyone on your way not that i remember doesnt it worry you walking alone across the rec at night not particularly i can handle myself against how many ive been taking lessons martial arts since when since some bastard chucked a brick through our window and cut me mum they might accept whats going on but i wont what do you mean whats going on there was scorn in his voice racism pure and simple we live in a racist society it doesnt matter that i was born here and my mum and dad before me its the color of your skin people judge you on not everyone shows how much you know the police are part of it anyway geor sorry mohammed i didnt come here to argue the politics of racism with you i came to find out about your movements on saturday so whats happened why are you picking on me i understand there was an altercation in the jubilee altercation yes a disagreement i know what it means im not some ignorant wog just got off the boat you know im trying to remember do you mean that stupid pillock who bumped into me and called me a paki bastard thats right so what what do you mean so what youre telling me you just let it go at that you with all your martialarts training george puffed up his chest well i was all for doing the pair of them over but asim and kobir didnt want any trouble so you just let it go by a racial slur like that when you look like i do you get used to it but you were angry george leaned forward and rested his palms on his knees of course i were bloody angry every time you hear something like that said about you you just get filled with anger and indignation you feel dehumanized he shrugged its not something youd understand because im white george slumped back in his chair you said it but you listened to your friends this time yes besides we were in a crowded pub just about everyone else in the place was white apart from a couple of rastas selling drugs and the last thing those bastards would do was come to our aid if anything happened theyd probably join in with the whiteys what made you think they were selling drugs thats what they do isnt it talk about racism banks thought he moved on did you know the lad who insulted you ive seen him around once or twice arrogantlooking pillock always looked down his nose at me lives on the leaview estate i think why you going to arrest him for racism not exactly said banks hes dead georges jaw dropped hes wha hes dead mohammed his name was jason fox someone unknown or several someones unknown kicked seven shades of shit out of him in the carlaw place ginnel sometime after eleven oclock last night well it wasnt me are you sure are you sure you werent so upset by what jason called you that you and your friends waited in the ginnel you just admitted you knew jason lived on the leaview estate so it would be a pretty good guess that hed take the same short cut home as you wouldnt it you waited there the three of you and when jason came along you gave him whatfor im not saying you intended to kill him just teach him a lesson but he is dead george and theres no remedy for that george looked so stunned he didnt even bother to correct banks over his name im not saying owt more he said i want a solicitor this is a fitup come on george it doesnt have to be like this like hell it doesnt if youre accusing me and my mates of killing someone then youd better arrest us and get us a lawyer and i told you my names mohammed not george look mohammed if i do what youre asking ill have to take you down to the station and your mates george stood up do it then im not afraid if you think im a killer youd be taking me anyway wouldnt you oh bloody hell banks thought he didnt want to do this but the silly bugger had left him no choice he stood up come on then he said and wed better take the shoes and clothes you wore last night along with us too three i the crosswinds on the a just south of aberford almost blew banks off the road he felt relieved at last when he was able to edge out from between the two juggernauts that had him sandwiched and exit onto wakefield road it was another of those changeable days with galeforce winds blowing a series of storms from the west between the bouts of rain the sky would brighten and banks had even seen a double rainbow near the ripon turnoff even though wakefield road was busy banks still felt able to relax a little after the ordeal of the a he had been playing a clifford brown tape finding the sound of the trumpet suited the weather but he had hardly been able to listen for concentrating on the road the ride of the valkyries would have been more apt for his drive so far with the big vans and lorries spraying up dirty rain all over his windscreen now however he found gertrudes bounce a fine accompaniment for the wind blowing the leaves off the distant trees it was monday morning and banks was on his way to leeds to talk to jason foxs employer george mahmood and his friends were in custody at eastvale station where they could be kept for another six or seven hours yet all claiming racial discrimination and refusing to say anything though banks felt sorry for them especially for george he was also bloody irritated by their attitude and it was jason fox who deserved his pity he reminded himself not the cowardly bastards who had booted him to death if they had done it banks couldnt see george mahmood as a killer but then he had to admit he was prejudiced and george had changed nevertheless he was willing to keep an open mind until an eyewitness or forensic evidence tipped the balance one way or the other in the meantime he needed to know more about jason foxs life starting with where he worked and where he lived he could have phoned the factory but he really wanted a facetoface chat with someone who knew something about jason banks entered the industrial landscape of southeast leeds he turned down clifford brown and concentrated on traffic lights and directions as he headed toward stourton just off pontefract road he found the long fenced laneway that led to the plastics factory where jason had worked ahead the horizon was a jumble of factory buildings and warehouses a row of powerstation cooling towers the hourglass shape of which always reminded banks of old corsets adverts spewed out gray smoke into the already gray air between the factories and the power station ran the sluggish river aire delivering its load of industrial effluent to the humber estuary and the north sea beyond banks identified himself to the guard at the gate and asked where he could find the personnel department human resources the guard told him pointing over there he should have known everyone used to call it personnel a few years back but now even the north yorkshire police had their human resources department why the change had personnel suddenly become insulting to some pressure group or other and therefore exiled to the icy wastes of the politically incorrect a hundred yards or so farther on banks pulled up in front of the threestory office block the human resources office was much like any other untidy desks computers filing cabinets and constantly ringing telephones a darkhaired young woman looked up and smiled as banks walked in can i help you she asked hope so banks showed her his card if she was surprised she didnt show it what is it she asked my names mary by the way mary mason ive come about one of your employees a lad called jason fox id like to speak to his boss and workmates if i can mary mason frowned i dont believe i know the name still theres a lot of people work here and im quite new to the job she smiled do you know what department hes in the foxes hadnt been that specific banks remembered all he knew was that jason worked in an office well mary said at least that lets out the shop floor doesnt it just a minute she tapped away at her computer a few moments later she swiveled away from the screen and said no its not just me we dont have a jason fox working here banks raised his eyebrows in disbelief are you sure according to payroll records computers make mistakes sometimes mary laughed dont i know it every once in a while my mouse starts running wild all over the place nobodys managed to work out why yet but they call it mad mouse disease in this case though id tend to believe the computer are you sure he was on the clerical staff banks scratched the scar beside his right eye he wasnt sure of anything now thats what i was told would it be too difficult to check all your employees mary shook her head no itll take just a little longer one of the benefits of computers they do things fast then you can spend the rest of your time varnishing your fingernails ill bet mary tapped a few keys and did the ouijaboard thing with her mouse which wasnt running wild today as far as banks could tell then clicked the buttons a few times and squinted at the screen nope she said shaking her head no jason fox anywhere in the company maybe he worked for another branch you have other branches rochdale coventry middlesbrough no his parents definitely said he lived and worked in leeds look are there any back records you can check just in case it was probably pointless but it was worth a look while he was here i can search the files for the past few years if youve got a bit of patience left banks smiled if you would please ive got plenty of patience mary returned to her computer banks found himself tapping his foot on the floor as he waited he wanted a cigarette no chance in here you just had to sniff the air finally with a frown creasing her brow mary whistled and said well what do you know youve found him i have indeed and jason fox cant be two i dont suppose i doubt it well according to our records he left the company two years ago after working for us for only one year now it was bankss turn to frown he left i dont understand why mary stared at the screen and pressed her lips together in thought then she looked at banks with her warm dark eyes smiled and said look i appreciate that youre a policeman and a pretty senior one at that i also appreciate this might be important even though you havent told me a thing but personnel records are private im afraid i cant just go around giving people any information they want at the drop of a hat or a warrant card im sure you could get a court order if you really want to know but im only doing my job im sorry i couldnt tell you any more even if i knew i appreciate that said banks can you tell me anything at all about his time here about his friends she shook her head as i said it was before my time ive never heard of him she turned to face the others in the office anyone remember a jason fox used to work here all she got in return was blank stares and shaking heads apart from one woman who said the name sounds familiar youre thinking of jason donovan someone else said and they laughed can you at least tell me what department he worked in banks asked that i can tell you mary said he was in sales domestic youll find them in the old office building across the yard and she said smiling you should also find some of the people he worked with are still there try david wayne first hes one of the regional sales managers now just a minute came a voice from the back of the office jason fox you said now i remember it was a couple of years back id just started here there was some trouble some sort of scandal something hushed up ii the sound of the car pulling up woke frank from his afternoon nap slowly he groped his way back to consciousness it seemed to take longer every time as if consciousness itself were slowly moving farther and farther away from him and walked over to the window there they were the three of them struggling up the path against the wind well he supposed they would have to come sometime josie had already telephoned and told him what had happened to jason he answered the knock let them in and told them to make themselves comfortable while he went to put the kettle on the good old english custom of a nice cup of tea he thought had helped people avoid many an embarrassing moment not that they should be embarrassed about what had happened of course but yorkshire folk especially often fell short of words when it came to strong emotions josie gave him a silent hug when he came through from the kitchen then she sat down grief suited her in a way he thought she had always looked a bit pinched to him these days she had also started to look more like mutton dressed as lamb too with that makeup her roots showing and those figurehugging outfits she wore at her age her mother would have been ashamed of her steven looked as lackluster as ever couldnt josie he wished again have chosen someone with a bit of spunk in him then there was maureen goodnatured bustling hardworking nononsense maureen the best of the lot of them in his book a proper bonny lass too shed break a few hearts in her time with her laughing eyes and smiling lips and hair like spun gold all the way down to her waist well not today but that was how he remembered her she had cut her hair short just after she started nurses training a real shame that he thought whens the funeral he asked thursday josie answered oh you should have seen what theyd done to him dad she sniffled our poor jason frank nodded nay lass police getting anywhere even if they were josie sniffed they wouldnt tell us would they the kettle boiled frank moved to rise but maureen sprang to her feet ill get it granddad stay where you are thanks lass he said gratefully and sank back into his armchair what have they told you theyve got some lads helping them with their inquiries josie said pakistanis she sniffed they think it might have started as an argument in a pub and that these lads followed our jason or waited for him in the ginnel and beat him up the police think they probably didnt mean to kill him what do you think frank asked maureen came back with the teapot and raised her eyebrows at the question we havent really had much time to think about it at all yet granddad she said but im sure the police know their business aye what is it steven fox said speaking for the first time you dont think theyll do a good job i wouldnt know about that frank said well what is it then josie fox repeated her husbands question maureen started pouring milk and tea into mugs spooning in sugar nowt said frank he fingered the folded creased sheet of paper in his top shirt pocket and pulled it out whats that granddad maureen asked just something i got in the post maureen frowned but what i dont oh for crying out loud said frank his patience with them finally snapping dont you know what happened dont you know anything did you all turn your bloody backs he turned toward maureen what about you he snapped id have expected more of you maureen started to cry frank felt the familiar pain almost an old friend now grip his chest hand shaking he tossed the sheet toward josie go on he said read it iii banks crossed the factory yard dodging puddles rainbowed with oil crates and chunks of old machinery were stacked up by the sides of long onestory buildings with rusty corrugated iron roofs machine noises buzzed and roared from inside forklifts beetled back and forth across the uneven yard carrying boxes on pallets the place smelled of diesel oil and burned plastic he soon found the old office building which had probably been adequate in the early days before the company grew there was no receptionist just a large open area with desks computers telephones and people filing cabinets stood against the walls at the far end of the room several small offices had been partitioned off their lower parts wood and the upper parts above waist height glass a woman dashed by banks on her way to the door a couple of file folders stuffed under her arm when he asked her if david wayne was around she nodded and pointed to the middle office banks walked between the rows of desks attracting no attention at all then knocked on the door that bore the nameplate david c wayne the man who invited him in was younger than banks had expected late twenties early thirties at the most he wore a white shirt with a garish tie wavy brown hair falling over his collar he had one of those high foreheads with little shiny red bumps at each side that made his hairline seem to be prematurely receding and he smelled of old spice a dark sports jacket hung over the back of his chair he frowned as he studied bankss warrant card then gestured to the spare chair and said how can i help you banks sat down im making inquiries about jason fox he said i understand he used to work here wayne s frown deepened thats going back a bit but you do remember him oh yes i remember jason all right wayne leaned back in his chair and put his feet on the desk the telephone rang he ignored it in the background banks could hear the hubbub of the office through the flimsy partition why do you want to know wayne asked much as banks hated parting with information it would do no harm in this case he thought and it might get wayne to open up more quickly he could already sense that something was not quite right and the woman in the human resources department had implied some sort of coverup so he told wayne that jason had been found dead and that his parents had said he worked for this company after all this time wayne shook his head slowly amazing why did he leave he didnt leave not exactly he was fired no made redundant no banks sighed and shifted position look mr wayne he said i didnt come here to play a guessing game i came to get information that might be important in a serious police investigation im sorry said wayne scratching his head its all still a bit embarrassing you see embarrassing in what way i wasnt in management back then i was just one of jasons coworkers i had more experience though in fact i was the one who trained him was he a poor worker on the contrary he was very good at his job bright energetic quick to learn showed an extraordinary aptitude for computers considering hed had no formal training in that area still thats often the case then what the job isnt everything chief inspector wayne went on quickly oh its important ill grant you that you can put up with a lot of idiosyncrasies if someones as good as jason was weve had our share of arseholes in our time and by and large if theyre competent hardworking arseholes you just tend to put up with them but it was different with jason yes in what way it was his attitude wayne explained i suppose youd call it his political beliefs which were to put it in a nutshell jason was a racist white power and all that and it didnt take a lot to get him on his hobby horse just some item in the newspaper some new opinion poll or crime statistics what exactly did he say you name it asians and west indians were his chief targets according to jason if something wasnt done soon the immigrants would take over the country and run it into the ground anarchy would follow chaos the law of the jungle he said you only had to look around you to see what damage theyd done already aids drugs unemployment he put them all down to immigrants wayne shook his head again it was disgusting really sick some of the things he came out with is that why he left wayne nodded as i said he didnt exactly leave it was more of a mutual parting of the ways maybe a little more desired on our side than his but the company paid him off adequately and got rid of him no blemish on his references either i suppose whoever employed him next found out what the bugger was like soon enough i mean its all very well to crack the odd you know offcolor joke have a bit of a laugh we all do that dont we but jason was serious he didnt have a sense of humor about these things just hatred a palpable hatred you could feel it burning out of him when he spoke see it in his eyes wayne gave a little shudder do you know where he got it from no idea where do people get these things from are they born like that do we blame the parents peers at school the recession society he shrugged i dont know probably a bit of everything but i do know that it was always there with jason always just beneath the surface if it wasnt actually showing and of course we have a number of asian and west indian employees here did he ever insult anyone to their face wayne rubbed his forehead and glanced away from banks out at the bustling business activity through his window mostly he just made them feel uncomfortable he said but once he went too far that was enough one of the secretaries milly nice woman from barbados jason usually kept her at arms length anyway she got pregnant and at some point so she said when it started to show jason made some remark to her about all her kind could do was procreate and there were too many of them already milly was upset understandably and she threatened to report him to the race relations board well the directors didnt want that you know the whole operation under the microscope racism in the workplace and all that so they asked jason to leave they offered him money a fair settlement just what he would have got if hed been made redundant and he went quietly wayne nodded could i speak to milly shes no longer with the company do you have her address i suppose i can tell you i shouldnt but given the circumstances he got up pulled out a file from one of the cabinets against his wall and told banks the address then he sat down again do you know where jason went after he left here banks asked wayne shook his head not a clue he never got in touch again and i cant say i was exactly eager to seek him out so when he left here he disappeared from your life yes did he have any close friends here not really i wasnt even particularly close to him myself he was a bit of a loner never talked about his outside interests family girlfriends that sort of thing he had no patience with the usual office chitchat except football he loved to talk about football mad about it on a monday morning hed talk about the weekend games for so long it was sometimes hard to get him working at all people listened then the same ones who were sickened by his racism wayne spread his hands what can i say theres nothing like an enthusiasm for sports to make a person seem more human and we seem able to overlook an awful lot in our sports heroes dont we i mean look at gazza the bugger beats up his wife and hes still a national hero what about enemies wayne raised his eyebrows probably just about every immigrant in the country at least the ones who knew what he was anyone in particular not that i can think of what was he like as a person how would you describe him wayne put a pencil against his lips and thought for a moment then he said jason was one of those people who can frighten you with their intensity i mean mostly he was withdrawn quiet in his own world on first impressions he seemed rather shy but when he did come out whether to talk about a football game or comment on some political article in the paper then he became very passionate very fervent he had charisma you could imagine him speaking to groups swaying their opinions a budding hitler then interesting banks closed his notebook and stood up he could think of nothing more to ask thanks for your time he said holding out his hand i might want to talk to you about this again wayne shook hands and nodded ill be here and banks walked through the busy office back out into the bleak factory yard the oil smell the machinery noise overflowing skips the rainbowed puddles just as he got to the car his mobile beeped iv no gavin i cant possibly go out for a drink with you tonight were very busy the boy wonder got you working overtime then i wish you wouldnt call him that susan heard gavin chuckle over the line whos he got pegged for this one then our local mp leader of the hunt he laughed again susan felt herself flush thats not very funny she hated it when gavin made fun of banks how about saturday we can go maybe susan said maybe saturday ill have to see got to go now gavin work to do okay see you saturday i said maybe just a minute whats that susan could hear sounds of shouting and scuffling and they seemed to be coming from downstairs got to go gavin she said ill ring you back susan whats susan dropped the receiver on its cradle and walked to the top of the stairs the scene below was utter chaos every asian in eastvale all nine or ten of them seemed to be pushing through the front doors george mahmoods parents ibrahim nazur owner of the himalaya and a handful of students from eastvale college a number of uniformed officers were holding them back but they wanted to see the detectives and susan was the only cid officer in the station would you please not all shout at once susan yelled from halfway down the stairs what are you going to do about our children asked an angry charles mahmood you cant just lock them up for nothing this is racism pure and simple were british citizens you know please believe me mr mahmood said susan advancing down the stairs were only keeping them until we get no yelled ibrahim nazur its not fair one law for whites and another law for us that met a chorus of agreement and they surged forward again suddenly the front doors opened and a loud voice bellowed what in gods name is going on here it had enough authority to command silence then susan saw over the crowd the shiny bald head of chief constable jeremiah jimmy riddle and for the first time ever she was grateful for the sight sergeant rowe she heard riddle say would you please order your officers to remove these people from the police station tell them if theyll kindly wait outside well have some news for them in just a few minutes then riddle made his way through the silent crowd cutting a swath rather like moses parting the red sea behind him sergeant rowe muttered yes sir and ordered three constables to usher the group out onto the street they went without putting up a fight thats better said riddle approaching susan its dc gay isnt it yes sir wheres dci banks leeds sir pursuing inquiries pursuing inquiries is he shopping more bloody like that classical record shop of his anyone else here no sir just me riddle jerked his head right you upstairs susan turned and started walking up the stairs feeling she imagined somewhat like a prisoner being sent down by the judge it could hardly be a worse time to piss off jimmy riddle susan had passed the first parts of her sergeants exam the written almost a year ago but police promotion is a longdrawnout process the last stage consisted of an appearance before the promotion board presided over by an assistant chief constable and a chief superintendent from regional hq that was six months ago now but susan still broke into a cold sweat every time she remembered the day of her board she had spent weeks reading up on policy national guidelines and equal opportunities but none of it prepared her for what lay behind the door of course they kept her waiting in the corridor for about half an hour just to make her extra nervous then the chief superintendent came out shook her hand and led her in she could have sworn there was a smirk on his face first they asked her a few personal questions to get some idea of her overall bearing confidence and articulateness she thought she managed to answer clearly without mumbling or stuttering except when they asked what her parents thought of her choice of career she was sure that she flushed but rather than flounder around trying to explain she simply paused to collect herself and said they didnt approve sir next came the scenarios and her interviewers added complications changed circumstances and generally did everything they could to confuse her or get her to change her mind one of the men on your shift is regularly late in the morning the acc began putting extra pressure on his mates what do you do have a private word with him sir ask him why hes being late all the time the acc nodded his mothers dying and she needs expensive care he cant afford it on a coppers salary so hes playing in a jazz band until the wee hours to make a bit extra then id tell him he needs permission to work outside the force and advise him to get help and support from our welfare department sir he thanks you for your concern but he keeps on playing with the band and turning up late then id think some disciplinary action would be in order sir the acc raised his eyebrows really but his mother is dying of cancer he needs the extra income surely this is a reasonable way of earning it after all its not as if hes taking bribes or engaging in other criminal acts susan stuck to her guns hes causing problems for his fellow officers on the shift sir and hes disobeying police regulations i think disciplinary action is called for if all other avenues have been exhausted and she passed now she was due to go up before the chief next week for her official promotion and that chief of course was chief constable riddle still she reminded herself as she walked into the small office she shared with sergeant hatchley there was nothing riddle could do now to block her promotion she had already earned it and the next step was purely a formality a bit of pomp and circumstance unless of course she really screwed up then she supposed he could do whatever he wanted he was after all the chief constable and if nothing else he could certainly make her life uncomfortable the office seemed crowded with riddle in it the mans restless pentup energy consumed space and burned up the oxygen like a blazing fire susan sat in her chair and riddle perched on the edge of hatchleys desk he was a tall man and he seemed to tower over her who authorized the arrest he asked theyre not exactly under arrest sir susan said just detained for questioning very well who authorized their detention susan paused then said softly i think it was dci banks sir banks i knew it riddle got up and started to pace until he found out there was not enough room to do so then he sat down again his pate a little redder banks always said you could tell how angry riddle was by the shade of his bald head and susan found herself stifling a giggle as she thought she could see it glow it was like one of those mood rings that were a fad when she was a child only riddles mood never softened to a peaceful green or calm cool blue on what evidence riddle continued thered been some trouble earlier in the pub sir the jubilee it involved the mahmood boy and the victim jason fox when dci banks questioned george mahmood about it he refused to cooperate so did his friends they asked for a lawyer and did they get one no sir well not until this morning it was sunday any rough stuff no sir riddle slid his hand across his head well lets at least be thankful for small mercies have you any idea who ibrahim nazur is owner of the himalaya sir more than that he owns a whole bloody chain of restaurants all over yorkshire and the himalaya s just the latest hes also a highly respected member of the muslim community and one of the prime movers in that new mosque project down bradford way ah said susan ah indeed anything from forensics nothing conclusive sir not yet witnesses none sir not so far were still looking riddle stood up right i want the three of them out of here now do you understand susan stood too yes sir she said and tell banks ill be seeing him very soon susan nodded yes sir and with that jimmy riddle straightened his uniform and marched downstairs to face his public v late that afternoon banks walked up to the bar of the black bull in lyndgarth and ordered a double bell s for frank hepplethwaite and a half of theakstons xb for himself according to susan who had phoned banks earlier hepplethwaite was jason foxs granddad and he said he had some information about jason he insisted on talking to the man in charge banks had phoned frank and finding out that he didnt own a car agreed to meet him in the black bull before setting off back for swainsdale though banks had called at the leeds address jason foxs parents had given him and found that jason hadnt lived there for at least eighteen months the flat was now occupied by a student called jackie kitson and she had never heard of jason fox there the trail ended the barman of the black bull was a skinny hunched crookedshouldered fellow in a motheaten illfitting pullover his greasy black hair and beard obscured most of his face except the eyes which stared out in a way reminiscent of photos of charles manson he served the drinks without a word then took down bankss order for one chickenandmushroom pie and one old peculier casserole the black bull was one of those rare exceptions to the nofoodaftertwooclock rule that blights most pubs banks took the drinks and joined frank at a round table by the door at the bar one man started telling the barman how much more cozy it was now most of the tourists had gone he had a whiny southern accent and actually lowered his voice when he said tourists the barman who clearly knew it was the tourist business that kept the place going grunted aye without looking up from the glass he was drying two other barstool regulars working at a crossword puzzle seemed overjoyed to discover that episcopal was an anagram of pepsi cola to the left down the far end where the billiard tables were two american couples were stuffing coins in the fruit machine shifting occasionally to the video trivia game opposite you must know mr gristhorpe young lad said hepplethwaite after thanking banks for the drink banks nodded hes my boss lives here in lyndgarth he does well i suppose you know that cant say i know him well mind you im a fair bit older myself and hes been away a lot good family though the gristhorpes got a good reputation around these parts anyroad he nodded to himself and sipped his bell s frank hepplethwaite had a thin lined face all the lines running vertically and a fine head of gray hair his skin was pale and his eyes a dull bottlegreen he looked as if he had once had quite a bit more flesh on his bones but had recently lost weight due to illness anyway he said thank you for coming all the way out here i dont get around so well these days he tapped his chest angina banks nodded im sorry no problem mr hepplethwaite call me frank of course he went on tapping his glass i shouldnt be indulging in this he pulled a face but theres limits to what a sick man will put up with he glanced at the table where banks had unconsciously rested his cigarettes and lighter smoke if you like lad i like the smell of tobacco and secondhand smoke be buggered banks smiled and lit up nice state of affairs isnt it said hepplethwaite when a man has to indulge his vices by proxy banks raised his eyebrows the words sounded familiar but he couldnt place them raymond chandler said hepplethwaite with a sly grin general sternwood at the beginning of the big sleep one of my favorite films bogey as philip marlowe must have seen it about twenty times know it by heart so that was it banks had seen the film on television just a few months ago but he had never read the book ah well another one for the lengthening list as a rule he didnt read detective fiction apart from sherlock holmes but hed heard that chandler was good im sorry about what happened to your grandson he said the old mans eyes misted over aye well nobody deserves to die like that he must have suffered like hell he took a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and passed it to banks this is why i asked you to come banks nodded he took the sheet opened it and spread it on the table in front of him it looked professionally printed but most things did these days with all the laser printers and desktop publishing packages around banks could remember the time not so long ago when all the copying in a police station was done from spirit masters on one of those old machines that made your fingers all purple even now as he remembered it he fancied he could smell the acrid spirit again the masthead in very large bold capitals read the albion league and underneath that it said in italics fighting the good fight for you and your country banks drew on his silk cut and started to read friends have you ever looked around you at the state of our oncegreat nation today and wondered just how such terrible degradation could have come about can you believe this nation was once called great britain and what are we now our weak politicians have allowed this oncegreat land to be overrun by parasites you see them everywhere in the schools in the factories and even in the government sapping our strength undermining the fabric of our society how could this be allowed to happen many years ago enoch powell foresaw the signs saw the rivers of blood in our future but did anyone listen no and so it went on columninch after columninch of racist drivel it ended and so we ask you the true english people heirs to king arthur and saint george to join us in our struggle to help us rid this great land of the parasite immigrant who crawls and breeds his filth in the bellies of our cities of the vile and traitorous jew who uses our economy for his own purposes of the homosexual deviants who seek to corrupt our children and of the deformed and the insane who have no place in the new order of the strong and the righteous to purify our race and reestablish the new albion in the land that is rightfully ours and make it truly our homeland once again banks put it down even a long draft of theakstons couldnt get the vile taste out of his mouth reluctantly he turned back to the pamphlet but he could find no sign of an address no mention of a meeting place obviously whoever wanted to join the albion league would first have to find it at the bottom of the pamphlet however in tiny print in the far righthand corner he could make out the letters httpwwwalblguecomindexhtml a website address everyone had them these days next he examined the envelope and saw that it had been posted in bradford last thursday their food arrived and they continued to speak between mouthfuls what makes you think jason sent you this banks asked tapping the sheet frank hepplethwaite turned away to face the dark wood partition between their table and the door one of the americans complained loudly that too many of the trivia questions dealt with english sports i mean how the hell am i supposed to know which player transferred from tottenham hotspurs to sheffield wednesday in what game do they play anyway and what kinda name is that for a sports team sheffield wednesday he shook his head these brits frank turned back to banks and said because it arrived only a couple of days after i let something slip for which may god forgive me what did you let slip first you have to understand frank went on that when jason was just a wee lad we were very close they used to come up here for summer holidays sometimes him maureen and my daughter josie jason and i would go for long walks looking for wildflowers on the riverbanks listening for curlews over fremlington edge sometimes wed go fishing up the reservoir or visit one of the nearby farmers and help out around the yard for an afternoon collecting eggs or feeding the pigs we always used to go and watch the sheepshearing he used to love his times up here did little jason you mentioned his mother and sister what about his father frank took a mouthful of casserole chewed swallowed and scowled that long streak of piss to be honest lad i never had much time for him and he never had much time for jason do you know he never listens to those records he collects never listens to them still wrapped in plastic i bloody ask you what are you supposed to think of a bloke who buys records and doesnt even listen to them not much banks thought chewing on a particularly stringy piece of chicken frank was obviously going to tell his story in his own time his own way sorry to interrupt he said what happened frank paused for breath before continuing time mostly thats all i got old too old to walk very far and jason got interested in other things stopped visiting did he still come and see you occasionally oh aye now and then but it were only in passing like more of a duty when was the last time you saw him he drove out here the weekend before last itd be just a week before he died did he ever talk about his life in leeds his job friends not really no once said he was learning about computers or something of course i know nowt about that so we soon changed the subject did he say where he was learning about computers no his parents told me he worked in an office frank shrugged could be all i remember is him once saying he was learning about computers and in all his visits banks went on didnt he ever talk about this sort of thing he tapped the pamphlet with his knuckle frank closed his eyes and shook his head never that was why it came as such a shock why do you think he never spoke to you about it i cant answer that one perhaps he thought id be against it until i said what i did and gave him his opening perhaps he thought i was an old man and not worth converting i am his granddad after all and we had a relationship of a kind we didnt say much to each other when we did meet up these past few years id no idea what he was up to mostly hed just have time to drop by and buy me a drink and ask if i was doing all right before he was off to his football or whatever banks finished his pie what makes you think you gave jason an opening to send you this pamphlet he asked what was it you said aye well we were sitting in here one day just like you and me are now frank lowered his voice the landlord heres called jacob bernstein not that fellow there jacobs not in right now anyway i made a remark about jacob being a bit of a tightfisted old jew what did jason say nowt not right away he just had this funny sort of smile on his face partly a smile partly a sort of sneer as soon as i said it i felt id done wrong but these things slip out dont they like saying jews and scotsmen have short arms and deep pockets you dont think about it being offensive do you you dont really mean any harm by it anyways after a minute or so jason says he thinks he might have something to interest me and a few days later this piece of filth turns up in the post who else could have sent it who else indeed said banks remembering what david wayne had told him that morning in leeds did you ever meet any of jasons circle no so theres no way you can help us try and find out who killed him i thought you already had the lads who did it banks shook his head we dont know if it was them not for sure at the moment id say were keeping our options open sorry lad said frank it doesnt look like i can help then does it he paused and looked down into his glass it was a real shock he said when i read that thing and knew our jason were responsible i fought in the war you know i never made a fuss about it and i dont want to now it were my duty and i did it id do it again what service raf tail gunner banks whistled between his teeth his father had been a radio operator in the raf so he had heard what a dangerous task tail gunner was and how many had died doing it aye said frank anyroad like i said i dont want to make a fuss about it i said something terribly wrong about someone i consider a friend and it shames me but it shames me even more when my grandson thinks id have the time of day for this sort of rubbish i fought the bloody nazis for crying out loud and for what so my own grandson could become one of them there were tears in his eyes and banks feared for his heart calm down mr hepplethwaite he said putting his hand on franks skinny wrist frank looked at him through the film of tears then gave a small nod and took a sip of bell s he coughed patted his chest and forced a smile dont worry lad he said its not quite time gentlemen please for this old codger yet vi an emergency meeting of the albion league had been called for that monday evening not everyone was invited of course just the cell leaders and one or two of neville motcombes current favorites like craig about fifteen in all they came from leeds and bradford from halifax keighley cleckheaton heckmondwike batley dewsbury brighouse and elland skinheads for the most part aged between sixteen and twentyfour racists all and these fifteen were the pick of the crop craig knew each cell had between five and twelve members these were the drones football hooligans and otherwise violent skins and motcombe hardly ever came into contact with them except at rallies and at other large gatherings when he addressed them from a distance mostly he relied on his cell leaders to make sure his orders were communicated and carried out and maybe more important still to make sure the cash kept trickling in after all the league was an expensive operation to run they met in the upstairs room of a pub in bingley and as he sat sipping his lager craig wondered if the landlord knew exactly what was going on up there if he did he might not have been so quick to let them use it on the other hand the prospect of selling a few extra pints on a slow monday night might tempt even the best of us to leave our ethics and politics at the door nothing much surprised craig anymore not after what motcombe had drawn him into even though the window was half open the place was still full of smoke craig could hear rain falling in the street outside a pale streetlight halo glowed through the gauze of moisture occasionally a car sloshed through the gathering puddles meanwhile nev himself erstwhile leader of the league clad in his usual shiny leather jacket was on his feet whipping his members into a frenzy he didnt need to shout and wave his arms around like hitler there was enough power and conviction in his regular speaking voice mostly it was the eyes they were the kind that trapped you and wouldnt let you go unless they were certain of your loyalty theyd even made craig tremble once or twice in the early days but he was too good at his job to let it get to him murdered motcombe repeated disgust and disbelief in his tone he slapped the table one of us three of them three to one they say one of his eyes was hanging out of its socket by the time the paki bastards had finished with him stirrings and mumblings came from the crowd one skin started rattling his glass on the table motcombe shushed him with an economic hand gesture then pulled a slip of paper out of his pocket and started to read george mahmood he began with the accent on mood asim nazur this time the name sounded like a sneer people began to snicker and kobir mukhtar sounds about right that one doesnt it muckytar sycophantic laughter came from the cell leaders and do you know what happened several of them craig included shook their heads the police let them go thats what howls of outrage oh yes they did this very afternoon our glorious warrior jason is probably lying on some mortuary table cut open from thnave to thchops as we speak and the three bastards who put him there the three brown bastards who put him there are out walking the streets he slammed the table again what do you think about that aint fair one of the cell leaders chimed in typical claimed another get away with bloody murder they do these days what we gonna do asked another craig lit a cigarette and leaned forward this promised to be interesting as far as he was concerned jason fox was an evil little pillock who deserved all he got first off said motcombe i want a special edition of the newsletter out pronto black border the lot and i want to see some oomph in it ray one of the leeds cell leaders looked up from his pint and nodded you see to that motcombe went on now jasons no longer with us im afraid were left to rely on your rather more pedestrian prose style but you can do it ray im sure you can you know the kind of thing i want outrage yes but make sure you emphasize the reason this all happened the underlying causes what were all about and make sure you mention the pakis names well send each of them a copy if they know that the entire national socialist alliance knows who they are that should give them a fucking sleepless night or two okay ray smiled and nodded and print extra copies next id like geoff and keith to start working on a memorial concert for jason a big bash youve got the contacts so pick some appropriate bands four or five of them rent a large space and make arrangements soon as you can okay geoff and keith nodded and scribbled some notes now as soon as i find out the details about the funeral motcombe went on ill be contacting several members to accompany me in a tribute of honor for our fallen hero for make no mistake about it jason fox is a martyr and his murder should provide us with a rallying point weve got a chance to turn adversity into fortune here if we choose to seize it by all means let us grieve and mourn our lost comrade indeed grieve we must but let us also as he would have wished use his death to spur us on to greater things to faster growth you all knew jason you know what he stood for lets do credit to his memory a few of them nodded and muttered their agreement then the brighouse cell leader asked are we gonna crack some heads open then a number of ayes went up but motcombe shushed them again dont worry he said thatll be taken care of in time but for the moment well just publish their names and leave it at that lets think of the longterm mission and lets use our golden opportunity to gain a bit of public sympathy think of the hundreds of blokes at home just sitting on the fence right now they know were right but they dont want to make that final move and admit it something like this could increase our membership tenfold nice pure aryan lad with his whole future ahead of him murdered by paki immigrant scum thatll turn a few fencesitters in our direction several members murmured in agreement but we cant leave jasons murder unavenged can we one of them said theyll think were weak sometimes you have to postpone your vengeance for the greater good mick thats all i am saying and theres strength in that not weakness believe me therell be plenty of time for revenge down the road remember the bastards who killed jason got away with it because our corrupt legal system is on their side but what would happen if one of us got picked up for clobbering a paki right now eh answer me that one no one did they all looked as if they knew the answer already motcombe looked at his watch now ill have to be on my way soon ive got a lot to attend to but theres no reason why you lot cant stay and enjoy a wake for jason if you like youve all got your orders meeting adjourned then motcombe tossed back the rest of his orange juice unlike the others craig had noticed he never drank alcohol or smoked people got up and moved around the room some of them heading down to the bar to buy more pints the last craig saw of motcombe he was walking out of the room with two bradford cell leaders an arm draped over each ones shoulders deep in quiet conversation liked his private meetings did nev keeping the left hand and the right hand separate whatever he was talking to them about or asking them to do you could bet it would have nothing to do with what he and craig had been talking about over the past few weeks craig tossed his cigarette out of the window into the rainy night took a deep breath and went over to mourn jasons death with ray from leeds and dogface russell from horsforth vii it was late when banks got home that evening after stopping off at the station on his way from lyndgarth and he was tired sandra was sitting at a table at the back of the living room sorting through some transparencies holding them up to the desk light scrutinizing each one in turn her long blond hair tucked behind her ears drink banks asked she didnt look up no thanks fine banks went to the cocktail cabinet and poured himself a finger of laphroaig thought about it for a moment then added another finger he picked up the evening paper from the coffee table and sat on the settee hard day he asked not bad sandra said without looking away from the transparency she was holding busy banks looked at the paper for a few minutes without taking anything in then went over to the stereo he chose a cd of arias by angela gheorghiu a few seconds into the first one sandra looked over and raised a dark eyebrow must you whats wrong do we really have to listen to this what harm is it doing sandra sighed and turned back to her transparency really banks pressed on i want to know what harm is it doing is it too loud no its not too loud then whats the problem sandra dropped the transparency on the table a little harder than necessary its bloody opera is the problem you know it gets on my nerves sometimes it was true that sandra had once taken a magnet to one of his götterdämmerung tapes but that was wagner an acquired taste at the best of times who could possibly object to angela gheorghiu singing verdi sandra had even been with him to see la traviata last month and she said she enjoyed it i didnt think you found it that offensive banks said walking back to the stereo no leave it sandra said youve put it on youve made your point just leave it what point what point you know what point no i dont enlighten me sandra snorted opera bloody opera the most important thing on your agenda in your life for all i know banks sat down and reached for his scotch oh were back to that again are we yes were back to that again well go on then go on what get it off your chest oh youd like that wouldnt you what do you mean youd like me to get it off my chest let the little lady yell at you for a couple of minutes so you can tell your mates what a bloody fishwife she is pretend to listen be all contrite then just carry on as if nothing had happened its not like that banks protested if youve got a problem tell me lets talk about it sandra picked up another transparency and pushed a few loose strands of hair back behind her ears i dont want to talk about it theres nothing to talk about angela gheorghiu had moved onto the aubade from chérubin now but its beauty was lost on banks look im sorry he said i didnt realize it was that important to you sandra glanced sideways at him thats just it isnt it she said what is you never do you never do consider how important something might be to me its always your needs that come first like bloody opera you never bother asking me what i might want to listen to do you you just go straight to your bloody opera without even thinking banks stood up again look i said im sorry okay ill take it off if it bothers you so much i told you to leave it it doesnt matter now its too late too late for what oh alan give it a rest cant you see ive got work to do she gestured at the transparencies spread out across the table fine said banks fine youre pissed off but you dont want to talk about it you hate opera but you want me to leave it on im the one who never considers your needs or feelings but right now youve got work to do well just bloody fine banks tossed back the rest of his laphroaig grabbed his coat from the hall stand and slammed the front door behind him four i banks was first to arrive at tuesday mornings cid meeting in the boardroom of eastvale divisional police hq shortly followed by dc susan gay superintendent gristhorpe and finally sergeant hatchley having been warned by susan banks was dreading that jimmy riddle himself would show up riddle was a notorious early riser and the thirty miles or so of country roads from regional hq to eastvale at such an hour would mean nothing to him especially if it gave him an opportunity to cause banks grief banks knew he would have to face the cc before long gristhorpe said he had already received his bollocking for letting his dci too far off the leash but he just didnt want it first thing in the morning never his favorite time of day especially after hed gone down to the queens arms after his argument with sandra the previous evening and had a jar too many he hadnt handled that situation well he knew he hadnt been at all reasonable he had lived with sandra long enough to know that when she lashed out like that which was rare it meant she had something important on her mind and he hadnt bothered to find out what it was instead he had stormed out like a petulant teenager as it happened jimmy riddle hadnt turned up by the time coffee and biscuits were served that probably meant he wouldnt come banks thought with relief usually riddle liked to be first there sparkling and spotless to get a jump on everyone right said gristhorpe what have we got so far alan have you talked to the lab banks nodded nothing yet theyre still trying but they havent found anything on the shoes or clothes we sent over for analysis theres a lot of mud on george mahmoods shoes consistent with walking over the rec in the rain and some sort of substance that looks a bit suspicious but the lad was wearing trainers for christs sake hardly what youd choose if you were intending to kick someones head in but we dont know that he was intending to do anything do we gristhorpe pointed out true still itd be difficult to kick someone to death wearing trainers dr glendenning specified heavy boots or doc martens something like that wouldnt the rain have washed any traces of blood away susan asked lab says not if theres enough of it which there was and if it gets in the stitching and seeps between the sole and upper they say its damn near impossible to get rid of susan nodded vic mansons working on fingerprints too banks said to gristhorpe but he doesnt hold out a lot of hope fingerprints from where the broken bottle according to the postmortem there were fragments of broken glass embedded in the back of jason foxs skull and they match the fragments we found near the body it looks as if he was hit with a bottle and then kicked anyway vic says the rain has probably buggered up his chances but hes busy spraying superglue into aquariums and lord knows what else what did you find out yesterday gristhorpe asked quite a lot banks told them in detail about jason foxs losing his job his false address in leeds and the albion league i also checked out this milly and her boyfriend he went on the west indian woman jason insulted at work seems shes gone back to live with her family in barbados chalk up one victory to jason fox then said gristhorpe any idea where jason lived when he wasnt at his parents house banks smiled and produced an address in rawdon how did you find out telephone directory it doesnt seem as if jason was making any particular secret out of where he lived he just neglected to let his parents know hed moved for eighteen months banks shrugged jasons relationship with his parents obviously wasnt close theres a lot they dont know about him im not entirely sure whether they didnt want to know or whether he didnt want them to from what ive seen so far the foxes arent a particularly close family how did he make his living these past two years gristhorpe asked do we know that banks shook his head no but according to the dss he wasnt on the dole his grandfather mentioned something about him studying computers too so that might be something hes got into ive asked ken blackstone to give us a hand down there checking the local college courses and we can check tax records see if he got another job somewhere gristhorpe nodded know anything about this albion league bankss only experience with neonazis had been with the national front in the seventies when he was a young copper on the met he had read about the more recent smaller and tougher groups like combat and blood and honour with all their concomitant whitepower rock bands and magazines but he hadnt actually come across any of them in the line of duty not yet he said and nobody else around here seems to have heard of them either anyway i faxed the yard theyve got a special squad dealing with neonazi groups lets keep our fingers crossed have you got anything to add sergeant hatchley the uniformed lads canvassed the whole market street area again yesterday said hatchley pubs cafés fishandchip shops bedandbreakfasts the lot some people remember georgie mahmood and his two mates in the fishandchip shop all right but no one saw them heading for the ginnel and no one remembers seeing jason and his mate weve managed to get an artists impression of the lad who was with jason but i wouldnt expect too much hatchley scratched his nose im wondering if it was something to do with drugs sir the jubilee being the sort of place it is a deal gone wrong maybe have we got anything from the drugs squad on the victim or suspects hatchley shook his head no sir ive already checked with records but still well well bear it in mind anyway anything else aye sir i had a chat with a couple of jasons teammates from eastvale united he had a jar with them after the game right enough but none of them admit to seeing him saturday night and none of them recognize the lad in the artists impression why hasnt jasons mate come forward gristhorpe mused aloud does he even know whats happened its possible he doesnt sir said hatchley if he lives far off like doesnt watch much telly or read the papers gristhorpe nodded and turned to face everyone either that or he did it lets dig a little deeper into the background here first off find out if george mahmood and jason fox really did know each other better than george is letting on maybe theyd crossed swords before lets also find out what we can about asim nazur and that cousin of his kobir whats his name mukhtar sir said susan right someone get in touch with bradford cid and find out if theyve got anything on kobir mukhtar ive already done that sir said susan there was nothing on the computer so i put in a request for information while we still had them in custody just before before the cc came round yesterday sir and nothing sir seems clean all right gristhorpe frowned susan dont i recollect something about an incident involving the mahmoods recently yes sir about a month ago someone stole a brick from the building site by gallows view and lobbed it through the mahmoods window theyd covered the shop windows with wire mesh a while back after a previous incident so the yob responsible chucked this brick through the bedroom window anyone hurt mrs mahmood sir she was undressing for bed at the time the brick missed her head by several inches but a long sliver of glass broke free and sliced into her upper arm she was bleeding pretty badly when her husband hurried her to eastvale general it took fourteen stitches and the doctor insisted they call the police they werent going to they were reluctant sir susan said her husband said it would only cost them time and trouble and they didnt expect any results in return apparently this kind of thing had happened before when they ran the shop in bradford and nobody ever did anything about it well this isnt bloody bradford said gristhorpe any leads theyd had a customer a teenage girl earlier in the day who complained about getting the wrong change when mrs mahmood insisted she was right the girl swept the newspapers and sweets off the counter and stalked out we finally tracked her down but she was in penrith at the time of the incident after that nothing could it have been jason fox given his views on immigrants i suppose so susan said it happened about half past ten on a saturday night and we know jason came to eastvale on weekends but we didnt know that then i mean wed no reason to suspect him and george mahmood couldnt have known it was him couldnt he maybe he had his suspicions maybe he even saw him but youre right we should avoid too much speculation at this point perhaps you should have another word with jasons family susan see if theyre a bit more forthcoming after that you can try the mahmoods again then the nazurs at the himalaya see if they can tell you anything else about what happened on saturday night he looked at his watch then smiled at susan time it right lass and you might be at the himalaya just around lunchtime hatchley laughed and susan blushed that just about covers it gristhorpe rubbed his bristly chin but wherever we go he said we tread carefully on eggs remember that chief constable riddle is taking a personal interest in this case he cleared his throat by the way he apologized for not being with us this morning banks overheard hatchley whisper to susan gay breakfast television gristhorpe ignored them what weve all got to bear in mind at this point he said is that while this case looked simple at first things have changed its got a lot more complicated and however odious a character jason fox is beginning to sound remember he didnt get a chance to fight back thats voluntary manslaughter at the very least and more than likely its murder dont forget weve got all the ingredients of a racial incident here too white victim handy asian suspects picked up interrogated and locked in the cells overnight when you add to that the fact that jason fox was a racist george mahmood is busy exploring his muslim roots and asim nazurs dad is a pillar of the community then youve got a powder keg and i dont want it going off on my patch jimmy riddle or no jimmy riddle now lets get to it ii it was quicker to walk to the leaview estate than to drive around eastvales confusing oneway system so susan nipped out of the fire exit and took the winding cobbled streets behind the police station down to king street she passed the infirmary then the gothic pile of eastvale comprehensive on the right with its turrets clock and bell tower and the weedy overgrown rec on her left before entering the leaview estate the weather was overcast today windy too with occasional drizzle but at least it wasnt cold the foxes garden looked less impressive in the dull light susan thought as she rang the doorbell yet the roses still seemed to burn with an inner glow of their own she felt like picking one to take home but she didnt that wouldnt look good at all she could just see the headlines policewoman steals prize roses from grieving family jimmy riddle would just love that his pate would turn scarlet and bang would go her promotion josie fox had her hair tied back today and her face looked pale and drawn lips bloodless without makeup she was wearing a baggy olive jumper and black jeans oh its you come in she said listlessly standing aside im sorry to intrude susan said following her into the living room but i have a few more questions of course sit down susan sat josie fox followed suit folding her long legs under her she massaged the bridge of her nose with her thumb and forefinger wheres your husband today susan asked she sighed stevens at work i told him not to go in but he said hed be better off with something to do rather than just being stuck in the house all day i cant say im not glad to see the back of him for a few hours i couldnt face going in myself my daughter maureens come down from newcastle to stay with us so im not alone is she in at the moment upstairs yes why will you call her down please josie fox frowned then shrugged and went to the bottom of the stairs to call a minute or so later maureen fox joined them susans first impression was of a rather bossy probably very fastidious sort of girl she was attractive too in a sort of bouncy blond healthy athletic way with a trim figure that looked good in the tight jeans she wore and symmetrical features plump red lips a creamy complexion though maureen fox was obviously grieving there was still a kind of energy emanating from her that she couldnt hide it showed itself in the way her foot kept tapping on the floor or one leg jerking when she crossed them in her constant shifts of position as if she were uncomfortable no matter how she sat susan wondered if jason had been at all like her probably not if susans own family were anything to go by her brother the stockbroker who could do no wrong and her sister the solicitor apple of her fathers eye susan had nothing in common with either of them and sometimes she thought she must have been a changeling why did you let them go josie asked you had them in jail the ones who did it and you let them go we dont know that they did it susan said and we cant just keep people locked up indefinitely without evidence its because theyre colored isnt it thats why you had to let them go it wouldve been different if you thought jason had killed one of them wouldnt it mother maureen cut in oh maureen dont be so naive everybody knows what its like these days the authorities bend over backward to help immigrants you ought to know that being in nursing its all opportunities for ethnics not for decent hardworking white folks look what happened to your dad what did happen to mr fox susan asked oh said maureen with a flick of her head dad got passed over for promotion blamed it on some asian bloke i see well youre right in a way mrs fox susan went on looking at josie the police do have to be very careful about how they treat people these days especially visible minorities we try to handle everyone the same way no matter what color they are she knew it was eyewash in the overall scheme of things racism along with sexism was alive and thriving in the police forces of the nation but damn it that was what she tried to do in this case though she went on we simply have no evidence yet to connect the suspects to the crime no witnesses no physical evidence nothing does that mean they didnt do it josie asked it raises doubts said susan thats all im afraid i cant say any more about it at the moment you havent given up have you certainly not were investigating a number of leads thats why im here she paused im afraid we turned up a couple of disturbing facts about your son josie fox frowned disturbing like what did you know about jasons racist views what do you mean did he never talk about his opinions to you he never really talked about anything much she said especially not these past few years were you aware of what he thought about asians and blacks well said josie fox lets put it this way i knew he had some opinions that might be unpopular you know about foreigners immigrants and such but i wouldnt say they were particularly extreme lots of people think the way jason does and it doesnt make them racists that was a new one on susan having racist views doesnt make you a racist did jason ever mention belonging to any sort of an organization she asked a group of likeminded people it was maureen fox who broke the silence no jason never mentioned it but he did belong to a group that is we only found out about it yesterday maureen oh mother jason was a creep and you know it thats why he could never keep a girlfriend i dont care if i am speaking ill of the dead i could never stomach him even when he was at school back in halifax all his talk about bloody racial purity making the country great again it made me want to puke it was those skins he hung around with at school you know them and their masters the ones who prey on schoolkids in depressed areas you should have done something you and dad like what josie fox beseeched her what could we have done to change him how do i know what you should have done but youre his parents you should have done something she turned to susan yesterday we went to visit my granddad she said he showed us a pamphlet he thought jason had sent him in the post he was very upset about it the albion league you know susan nodded your grandfather told dci banks yesterday evening maureen looked at her mother there i told you granddad wouldnt be able to keep it to himself she turned to susan mum thought we should keep it in the family to protect the family name but she shrugged well the cats out of the bag now isnt it i still dont see what this has to do with anything josie fox protested now youre making out my jason was the villain but he was the victim are you suggesting those boys might have killed him because of his beliefs could they have known what do you mean susan paused for a moment then continued softly jason wasnt here very often mrs fox he didnt put down roots didnt get to know people could those boys have known about him about what he believed they could have found out somehow i suppose theyre asians so i suppose they have their own gangs their own networks dont they maybe he did talk to one of them that one in the shop do you know if he ever shopped there i dont know but he might have done its not far away especially if you go to the bus stop down on cardigan drive but jason had a car doesnt mean he never took the bus does it anyway all im saying is he might have gone in the shop it wasnt far away thats all do you remember about a month ago when someone threw a brick now wait a minute said josie youre not going to blame that on our jason oh no be nice and easy for you that wouldnt it blaming a crime on someone who cant answer for himself just so you can make your crime figures look better write it off your books susan took a deep breath thats not my intention mrs fox im trying to establish a link between jason and george mahmood if there is one given jasons feelings about asians it doesnt seem entirely beyond the realm of possibility that he chucked the brick and george knew about it well youll never know will you susan sighed perhaps not do you know if jason gave out any of those pamphlets to anyone on the estate josie fox shook her head i shouldnt think so no im fairly certain he didnt id have heard about it ill bet you would susan thought did any of jasons colleagues ever call here i told you the other day no we didnt know his friends for a moment susan had imagined a scene like the one in the krays east london home the boys upstairs planning murder and mayhem while good old mum comes in with a tray of tea and biscuits beaming at them obviously not youd almost think he was ashamed of us josie fox added or of them said susan look he was seen drinking with this lad in the jubilee on saturday night she turned to face maureen again and showed her the picture were trying to trace him he might be able to help us find out what happened have you ever seen jason with anyone like that maureen shook her head no mrs fox no you told us jason was working at a plastics factory in leeds did you know that he left there two years ago that he was asked to leave because of his racist views josie foxs jaw dropped and she could only shake her head slowly eyes disbelieving even maureen paled do you know where he went after that susan pressed on no said mrs fox her voice flat defeated as far as we knew thats where he worked did he ever mention anything about studying computers not to me no do you know where jason lived in leeds i gave you the address susan shook her head he hasnt been living there in eighteen months he moved to rawdon did you never visit him again she shook her head no how could we we were both working during the week jason too besides he came to visit us at weekends did you never telephone him no he said it was a shared telephone out on the landing and the people in the other flats didnt like to be disturbed hed usually ring us if he wanted to tell us he was coming up what about at work no his boss didnt like it jason would always ring us i dont understand this is all why didnt he tell us i dont know mrs fox said susan tears welled in josie foxs eyes how could he i mean where did it come from him joining such a group not telling us anything we used to be such a close family we always tried to bring him up properly decently where did we go wrong maureen raised her eyes and sat rigidly arms folded over her breast staring at a spot high on the wall as if she were both embarrassed and disgusted by her mothers display of emotion where did we go wrong it was a question susan had heard many times both in the course of her work and from her own parents when they complained about her chosen career she knew better than to try to answer it a lot of prejudices were inherited her father for example to all outside appearances he was a decent and intelligent man a regular churchgoer a respected member of the community yet he would never eat in an indian restaurant because he thought he was being served horse meat dog or cat and that the hot spices were used to mask the taste of decay susan had inherited some of his attitudes she knew but she also knew she could fight against them she didnt have to be stuck with them forever so she went to lots of indian restaurants and got to love the food that was why superintendent gristhorpes crack about having lunch at the himalaya had made her blush it was exactly what she had been thinking at the time onion bhaji and vegetable samosas mmmm whatever she did though it was always there at the back of her mind that feeling inherited from her father that these people werent quite like us that their customs and religious beliefs were barbaric and primitive not christian where did we go wrong who knew the answer to that one giving up on the foxes for now susan closed her notebook and walked back out onto daffodil rise it had started to rain again iii the traffic on the leeds ring road wasnt too bad and banks made it to rawdon by eleven oclock number seven rudmore terrace was an uninspiring stoneclad semi just off the main road to leeds and bradford airport it had a small bay window frostedglass panes in the door and an overgrown garden first banks headed for number nine where he noticed the lace curtains twitch as he walked up the path of course when he knocked and a woman answered she made a great pretense of being surprised to receive a caller and left the chain on as she checked his warrant card before inviting him in you cant be too careful these days she said cheerfully as she put the kettle on a woman in the next street was attacked just two weeks ago raped she mouthed the word rather than speaking it out loud as if that somehow lessened its power in the middle of the day no less im liza williams by the way liza was an attractive woman in her early thirties with short black hair a smooth olive complexion and light blue eyes she led banks through to the living room the carpet of which was covered with childrens toys the room smelled vaguely of plasticine and warm milk jamies taken the twins over to their grannies for the morning she said surveying the mess to give me a breather like two twoandahalfyearolds can be a bit of a handful mr banks in case you didnt know that already banks smiled i didnt know theres a couple of years between my boy and girl but believe me one twoandahalfyearold was bad enough i cant imagine two liza williams smiled oh its not so bad really i complain but i wouldnt want to be without them now i dont suppose you came here to talk about children is it about that woman in the next street no im north yorkshire cid said banks thatd be west yorkshire yes of course i should have noticed the card she frowned that just makes me even more puzzled its about next door mrs williams she paused then her eyes widened oh i see yes thats so sad isnt it and him so young im sorry you mean about the boy who was killed dont you jason in eastvale thats north yorkshire isnt it you knew well we were neighbors even if we werent especially close ones they say good fences make good neighbors mr banks and you need a big one to keep that ugly garden of his out of view but fairs fair he was quiet and considerate and he never complained about the twins look do you think we could just back up for a minute and get a few things straight of course jason fox lived next door at number seven right yes thats what i was telling you okay and you read in the paper that jason was killed in eastvale on saturday night saw it on telly actually how else would i know soon as i heard it was him you could have knocked me over with a feather how did you know it wasnt some other jason fox well its not that common a name is it and even if the sketch they showed on the news wasnt very good i could still recognize him from it the kettle boiled and liza williams excused herself to make tea she came back with a tray a pot and two mugs why didnt you call the police banks asked she frowned police but why should i did i do something wrong no im not accusing you of anything just curious well i never thought why would i i didnt really know anything about jason anyway i was really very sorry to hear about what happened but it didnt have anything to do with me did it its none of my business i mean ive never even been to eastvale but didnt you think the police might want to have a look around the house where jason lived maybe ask you a few questions about him well i i dont know what to say im sorry i just assumed if the police wanted to ask me anything theyd have asked me when they were round earlier i thought youd done what you had to do i dont know what happens to peoples houses after just a minute said banks sitting on the edge of his seat did you say the police have already been around yes plainclothes didnt you know obviously not or i wouldnt be asking you all these questions liza williams didnt look or sound like a stupid woman what could she be thinking of when was this sunday morning before id even heard what happened why is something wrong no no its all right banks scratched the scar beside his right eye liza poured the tea meeting his eyes as she did so and splashing a little tea on the tray she handed banks a steaming mugful did they talk to you he asked no they just went into jasons house two of them they seemed to have a key seemed to know what they were doing how did you know they were police i didnt i just assumed the way they seemed so purposeful then later that night when i saw about jason on the telly it seemed to make sense what time was this when they came must have been about ten oclock jamie had just come back from the newsagents with the papers we dont have them delivered bec banks tuned her out at first he had considered the possibility however remote that west yorkshire had been playing left hand to north yorkshires right but susan gay hadnt even discovered jason foxs identity until lunchtime on sunday and the foxes hadnt officially identified him until after that so who had known who the victim was before the police did and how had they found out banks blew on his tea took a sip then leaned forward again this is very important mrs williams he said can you tell me anything about these men iv steven fox clearly wasnt expecting susan and his face showed surprise and suspicion when she turned up in his office at the building society time for a word she asked smiling he looked at his watch i suppose so its almost lunchtime anyway my treat said susan she sighed inwardly realizing shed have to forgo the himalaya steven fox put on his raincoat and they walked along york road to the el toro coffee bar on the opposite side of the market square from the police station the el toro with its dim lighting castanetclicking muzak bullfight posters and smell of espresso wasnt renowned for its food but the sandwiches were decent enough susan treated herself to prawn and tomato and steven fox settled for ham and cheese once they had taken a bite or two and sipped some coffee susan began would you be surprised to hear that jason was no longer working where you told us he was steven fox paused and rubbed his glasses steamed up by the coffee to be honest he said nothing much would surprise me about jason he was a law unto himself his mother was surprised maybe she had more illusions that might explain susan thought why steven fox had seemed quicker to accept that jason might have met a violent end than josie had been and you she asked jason was a peculiar lad we never had a very close relationship i dont know why did you know anything about his affiliation with the albion league not until yesterday no steven fox shook his head slowly when jason left home he said that was it we never really knew what he was up to after then still i dont suppose its the kind of thing you do tell your parents is it i mean can you imagine your son sitting down at the dinner table one night and saying guess what mum dad i joined a neonazi party today not unless he thought you shared his views steven banged his coffee cup down on the saucer spilling some now hold on a minute thats quite an allegation i resent that im not a racist susan held her hand up im not alleging anything mr fox i simply want to know well he didnt get it from me or his mother do you have any ideas as to where he did get it from well that kind of thing do you really think its as simple as you know just picking up or imitating someones mannerisms or figures of speech no i dont but he had to start somewhere what about this promotion business josie told you about that maureen actually steven fox shrugged back in halifax i lost out on a promotion to a fellow from bengal nice chap but it was that what do you call it positive discrimination aye only giving jobs to immigrants and women sorry but i had more experience and id put in more years anyway it gave us some hard times not enough money coming in that sort of thing i think jason took it more to heart than i did maybe because he already had some problems of his own at school there were a lot of asians there recent immigrants for the most part some of them with poor language skills and jason got into trouble once for suggesting to a teacher that they were holding back the rest and ought to be put together in a special class how long ago was that in his last year there just before we moved didnt that concern you well it i mean in a way i suppose he was right wasnt he maybe he should have put it more diplomatically lord knows as i said im no racist but it seems to me that if you keep on catering to the demands of foreign cultures and other religions over your own then you do sort of weaken your own dont you for crying out loud they dont even sing a hymn and say the lords prayer at morning assembly anymore susan moved on quickly do you know the people who run the shop on gallows view the mahmoods i know who you mean ive nipped in there for a tin of soup from time to time but i cant say i know them remember about a month ago when someone chucked a brick though their window i read about it in the local paper why was jason up that weekend oh come on said steven surely you cant imagine hed do something like that why not he wasnt a hooligan but he was a racist still anyway i dont remember if he was here or not and arent you supposed to be looking for his killers every little bit helps mr fox he wasnt living at the address you gave us in leeds did you know that not living there steven fox shook his head bloody hell no i just assumed i mean why would he lie about that i dont think he lied he just omitted to let you know maybe he thought you werent interested steven fox frowned you must think us terribly neglectful parents susan said nothing but jason was over eighteen he went on he led his own life so you said he still visited home though he came home on weekends to get his washing done and get a free meal like lots of kids do you said earlier that you and jason were never close why was that i dont know really when he was younger he was always more of a mothers boy then in his teens he got involved in football ive never been much interested in sports myself i was never very good at games at school always the last one to be picked that sort of thing i suppose i should have gone to watch him play you know shown more support enthusiasm its not that i wasnt proud of him he shook his head maybe i was selfish i had my record collection to catalog jason had his football we just didnt seem to have anything in common but i couldnt see where any of it was leading how could i know he looked at his watch look i really do have to get back i cant tell you anything more honestly if those boys really did kill jason you know those immigrants you had to let go i hope you find some evidence against them if theres anything else i can do and he got up to leave susan nodded more than happy to see the back of him for the second time that day shed had to restrain herself from screaming that george asim and kobir werent immigrants that theyd been bloody well born here and their fathers before them but she didnt what was the point and now she had to go to the himalaya and talk to asim nazur and his parents they would certainly be thrilled to see her still wicked though it sounded maybe she still had room for a small samosa after all just the one for a simple pub fight gone wrong she thought this case was turning into a hell of a confusing affair v the little pane of glass in the front door smashed easily enough when banks applied his elbow he stuck his hand through carefully and turned the lock he had a warrant to search the place and as jasons pockets had been emptied of everything including his house keys this seemed the easiest way to get in inside the house was so quiet that all he could hear was the hissing of blood in his ears there wasnt even a clock ticking he imagined it wasnt always like that not with the twins next door he started in the living room to his right threepiece suite upholstered in tan corduroy wallpaper with thin green and brown stripes mirror over the mantelpiece fakecoal electric fire television and video selection of tapes mostly science fiction and horror by the look of them a few paperbacks ayn rand tom clancy michael crichton and that was it there was a sideboard against one wall and in one of the drawers banks found a couple of bills addressed to jason fox nothing else the kitchen was spotless dishes all in cupboards mugs hanging from hooks over the counter very little in the fridge a tub of i cant believe its not butter cheddar cheese turning blue at the edges sliced white bread boiled ham limp celery lettuce tomatoes more the kind of stuff for sandwiches than hot meals maybe jason did most of his eating out there were three bedrooms one no bigger than a cupboard really that one was completely empty the other two showed some signs of occupation just as at the house in eastvale jasons bed was tightly made and a similar selection of clothes hung in the wardrobe the dresser drawers were full of socks underwear and tshirts along with an unopened box of condoms and a bottle of aspirin the third bedroom looked like a guest room with single bed empty drawers and not much else except the computer but banks didnt trust himself not to screw something up if he started messing around with that so he made a note to get someone else in to give it the onceover back in the hall banks could only marvel at the sheer emptiness of the place there was no personality youd expect if jason was a member of a white power organization at least a few skrewdriver cds and maybe one or two copies of the order strewn around the place but it was as if someone had been there and stripped away all signs of character if there had been any and maybe someone had two men liza williams had said and they had left with some cardboard boxes unfortunately it had been raining in leeds that sunday morning and they had both been wearing flat caps black or navy blue one of them wore a black leather jacket and jeans the other a donkey jacket the one in the leather jacket was taller than the other no liza admitted they werent particularly well dressed but then she watched a lot of police programs on telly so she didnt expect real policemen to be any better dressed than their fictional counterparts no she couldnt say how old they were hadnt seen their faces but she got the impression by the way they moved that they were probably fairly young and fit and that was about all she could say she was sorry she had after all only glimpsed them and as she noticed they used a key to get in she didnt worry about them being burglars or rapists she first thought they were friends of jasons he sometimes had friends to stay and then after she heard of his death she just assumed theyd been policemen come to return his belongings to his family or something no her husband hadnt seen them he had already settled down with the sunday papers and once he did that the only thing she had noticed was a blue car parked outside which she thought belonged to the men but she didnt know what make it was let alone the number she did say it was clean though banks sighed as he closed the door behind him he would have to get someone from west yorkshire to fix the pane of glass hed broken and perhaps to question some of the other people in the street whatever theyd noticed it had to be more than liza williams had vi by midafternoon susan was wet tired and no further ahead than she had been in the morning the nazurs and the mahmoods had been sullen and uncommunicative as expected and she had flinched at the clear accusations of racism in their eyes no jason fox had never been in the mahmoods shop as far as they knew and the nazurs had never seen him in their restaurant and they knew nothing about any albion league sergeant hatchley was still out pounding the streets so at least she got the opportunity to warm herself up with a cup of coffee and take a little quiet time for herself she had just put her cold wet feet on the radiator to warm them when one of the staff from the murder room came in bearing a fax just arrived he said susan thanked him and looked at the single sheet all it said was the albion league along with a telephone number a london number curious susan picked up the phone and dialed she remembered that banks had faxed a request for information about the albion league to scotland yard so she wasnt surprised when someone there answered after a bit of shuttling around and a lot of waiting she finally got to someone who knew what she was talking about when she mentioned the albion league his name he said was crawley is your boss there love he asked susan bristled gripping the receiver tightly but she said nothing well crawley repeated im afraid detective superintendent gristhorpe is out of the office at the moment susan finally managed between gritted teeth and youre dc gay yes at least he didnt make any cracks about her name i suppose youll have to do then not her day thanks a lot she said dont take offense love ill try not to sweetie pie now how about the albion league she heard crawley laugh at the end of the line then he cleared his throat yeah well its a neonazi organization white power thats why were interested see in why you want to know id have thought it was a simple enough inquiry susan said true enough love but nothing to do with those bastards is simple theyre flagged flagged any time their name comes up certain people have to be informed that sounds very mysterious does it yes anyway dont worry im sure dci banks will send you a full report hes heading the field investigation but would you mind just for the moment humoring a poor dc could you give me some general idea of what this particular neonazi organization is all about what they want she heard another brief chuckle down the line then crawley said want thats easy same as all the rest of them really the usual things racial purity repatriation of immigrants and all ethnics keep britain white oh and they want the trains to run on time too some hope of that tell me about it seriously though love its not so much what these people want thats usually predictable enough but what theyre willing to do to get it what means theyll use how theyre organized what connections they have with other groups whether theyre armed what international links they have if any that sort of thing see what i mean yes said susan and the albion league how do they fit into all that there was a pause then crawley said im sorry but im really not authorized to tell you any more than that have your boss give me a bell when he comes in will you love and the line went dead vii by the time banks had finished coordinating with west yorkshire police it was late afternoon he decided to drop by tracys residence and see what she was up to she had only been at the university of leeds for a little over two weeks but already he missed her maybe he could take her for a spot of dinner or something that way he would also avoid the rushhour traffic on the way home and spending time with tracy might also make him forget about his problems with sandra for a short while when he got to the student residence building beside woodhouse moor he was pleased to find that not just anyone could walk in you had to know whom you wanted to see banks found a porter on duty showed his identification and said hed like to visit his daughter impressed with bankss credentials the garrulous porter who said he had been a policeman himself some years ago before a leg injury forced him to retire let him in as banks walked up the two flights of stairs he wondered if he should have announced himself first what if tracy was with a boy or something having sex but he dismissed the idea he couldnt imagine his daughter doing that either shed be out at a lecture or shed be studying in her room when he got to her door he knocked he could hear music from down the hall but not a sound from tracys room itself he knocked again more loudly this time nothing he felt disappointed she must be at a lecture just as he was about to walk away the adjacent door opened and a young touslehaired girl stuck her head out oh sorry she said in a husky voice i thought you were knocking on my door sometimes you cant tell if youve got some music on or something then her eyes twinkled hey you werent knocking at my door were you no said banks she made a mock pout pity you looking for tracy then im her father the detective shes talked a lot about you the girl twisted a tendril of red hair around her index finger i must say though she never told me you were quite so dishy im fiona by the way pleased to meet you she held out her hand and banks shook it he felt himself blush any idea where tracy might be fiona looked at her watch probably in the pack horse with the others by now she said with a sigh id be there myself cept im on antibiotics for my throat and im not supposed to drink and its no fun if you cant have a real drink she wrinkled her nose and smiled its just up the road you cant miss it banks thanked her and leaving the car parked where it was set off on foot he found the pack horse on woodhouse lane close to the junction with clarendon road not more than a couple of hundred yards away he felt too formally dressed for the place even though he had taken off his tie and was wearing casual trousers and a zippered suede jacket the pub had the polished wood brass and glass look of a real victorian alehouse it also seemed to be divided into a maze of rooms most of them occupied by noisy groups of students it wasnt until the third room that banks found his daughter she was sitting at a cluttered table with about six or seven other students a pretty even mix of male and female the jukebox was playing a beatles oldie ticket to ride he could see tracy in profile chatting away over the music to a boy beside her god she looked so much like sandra the blond hair tucked behind her small ears black eyebrows tilt of nose and chin the animated features as she talked it made his heart ache banks didnt like the look of the boy beside her he had one of those expressions that always seem to be sneering at the world something to do with the twist of the lip and the cast of the eyes either tracy didnt notice or it didnt bother her or worse she found it attractive as she spoke she waved her hands about stopping now and then to listen to his response and sip from a pint glass of pale amber liquid nodding in agreement from time to time her drink could have been lager but banks thought it was most likely cider tracy had always enjoyed nonalcoholic cider when theyd stopped for pub lunches during family holidays in dorset or the cotswolds but this glass of cider was probably alcoholic and why not he told himself she was old enough at least she wasnt smoking then as he stood there in the doorway a strange emotion overwhelmed him as he watched his daughter talk laugh and drink oblivious to her fathers proximity a lump came to his throat and he realized he had lost her he couldnt go over to the table and join the crowd simply couldnt do it he didnt belong his presence would only embarrass her a line had been reached and crossed tracy was beyond him now and things would never be the same and he wondered if that was the only line that had been crossed lately banks turned away and walked outside the wind made his eyes water as he went in search of somewhere else to enjoy a quiet smoke and a drink before setting off back home viii that tuesday night the albion league was holding one of its regular bashes in a small rented warehouse near shipley dim and cavernous it was the same kind of place people went to for raves but without the ecstasy here craig guessed the only drugs were the lager that flowed from the kegs like water from a hosepipe nicotine and maybe the odd tab of amphetamine but one way or another everyone was pumped up guitars drums and bass crashed at breakneck pace simple threechord sequences interrupted occasionally by a howl of unplanned feedback from the amps the albion league themselves were playing tonight a makeshift white power band consisting of whoever felt like picking up the instruments at the time at the moment the lead singer was growling white is white black is black we dont want em send em back subtle craig wished he could wear earplugs from his table craig watched motcombe work the room he was good no doubt about it slick there must be at least a couple of hundred people in the place craig guessed and nev was walking around the tables patting a back here leaning over for a smile and a word of encouragement there it was a miracle he managed to make himself heard with the band making so much bloody noise some of the older members chronically unemployed factory workers and aging skins had settled into a far corner as far away from the source of the racket as possible what did they expect craig wondered the black dyke mills band playing deutschland über alles or wagners ring cycle it was the rock bands that got the kids in and got the message across through sheer volume and repetition the real trouble with this gig craig thought as he looked around was that there was no chance of a bit of nooky for some reason girls didnt have much to do with white power freaks and most of the kids in turn seemed content enough with a celibate existence fueled by sheer race hatred alone the only females craig could see tonight were a few peroxide scrubbers like superannuated biker girls hanging out with the older crowd and a table of skinny birds with shaved heads and rings through their noses he sighed and drank some lager cant have everything a jobs a job the music stopped and the singer said they were going to take a short break thank god for that thought craig trying to keep one eye on motcombe he turned to the three skins at the table with him christ he thought they couldnt be more than sixteen one of the leeds cell leaders had spotted them causing a bit of aggro to a telephone box on their way home from a football match he had joined in with them then invited them to the show thick as two short planks all three of them what did you think of that then craig asked lighting up not bad said the spotty one who went by the name of billy ive heard better guitar players mind you yeah well craig said with a shrug theyre pretty new need a bit more practice ill admit see with this lot though its the words that count most trouble is most rock bands dont really pay any attention to what theyre saying know what i mean im talking about the message what message the slackjawed one asked well see if you were listening craig went on youd have heard what they were saying about that we should send all the pakis and niggers back home and get this country on its feet again oh yeah said billy whites white blacks black we dont want em send em back thats right craig smiled so you were listening great thats what i mean billy most rock music is selfindulgent crap but this is real music music with a purpose its truthtelling music this is it tells it like it is yeah said slackjaw i think i see what you mean in your fucking dreams thought craig from the corner of his eye he saw motcombe about five tables away whispering in someones ear he couldnt make out who it was how many irons did this one have in the fire even though the band had stopped playing music still blared out of a sound system and the level of conversation was loud so what do you think he asked the message well yeah said pointyhead speaking up for the first time it sounds all right send em all back like i mean it sounds good to me he grinned showing bad teeth and looked around at his friends i mean kick the fuckers out right eh send the black bastards back to the jungle kick the fuckers out right said craig youve got it thing is theres not much a person can do by himself all alone if you see what i mean except wank slackjaw grinned ah a true wit craig laughed yeah except wank and you dont want to be wankers do you anyway see if you get organized like with others who feel the same way then theres a lot more you can achieve right right said billy stands to reason dont it okay craig went on noticing the band picking up their instruments again think about it then about what billy asked what ive just been saying about joining the league where you get a chance to act on your beliefs we have a lot of fun too a screech of feedback came from the amp billy put his hands over his ears yeah i can see he said he was clearly the leader of the three craig thought the alex of the group the others were just his droogs if billy decided it was a good idea theyd go along with him craig noticed motcombe glance around the room then walk out of the fire exit at the back with one of the leeds cell leaders he stood up and leaned over the three skins keep in touch then he said as the music started again he pointed see that bloke at the table there over by the door billy nodded if you decide you want to sign up tonight hes the man to talk to right he patted billy on the back got to go for a piss see you later casually he walked toward the toilets near the front door the band had started their tribute to ian stuart late leader of skrewdriver who blood and honour claimed had been murdered by the secret service and now the albion league had a martyr on their hands he wondered how quickly someone would write a song about jason fox anyway the toilets were empty and most people were either talking loudly or listening to the band so no one saw craig nip out the front door not that it mattered anyway the room was so hot and smoky that no one could be suspect for going out for a breath of fresh air instead of just standing there and enjoying the smell of the cool damp night he walked around the back of the building toward the big car park glancing around the corner he saw motcombe and the leeds skin standing by motcombes black van talking the car park was badly lit so craig found it easy enough to crouch down and scoot closer hiding behind a rusty old metro watching them through the windows it didnt take long to figure out that they were talking about money as craig watched the leeds skin handed motcombe a fistful of notes motcombe took a box out of his van and opened it then he placed the bills inside the skin said something craig couldnt catch then they shook hands and he went back inside motcombe stood for a moment glancing around sniffing the air craig felt a twinge of fear as if motcombe had twitched his antenna sensed a presence but it passed motcombe opened the box took out a handful of notes and stuffed them in his inside pocket then he squared his shoulders and strutted back in to work the crowd again five i the albion league said gristhorpe in the boardroom on wednesday morning his game leg resting on the polished oval table thatch of gray hair uncombed banks hatchley and susan gay sat listening cups of coffee steaming in front of them ive been on the phone to this bugger crawley for about half an hour but somehow i feel i know less than when i started know what i mean banks nodded hed spoken to people like that still some had said the same thing about him too anyway gristhorpe went on theyre exactly what they sound like in their pamphlet a neonazi fringe group albions an old poetic name for the british isles you find it in chaucer shakespeare spenser and lots of other poets anyway according to crawley this lot took it from william blake who elevated albion into some sort of mythical spirit of the race is this blake a nazi then sir sergeant hatchley asked no sergeant gristhorpe answered patiently william blake was an english poet he lived from to youd probably know him best as the bloke who wrote jerusalem and tyger tyger tyger tyger burning bright said hatchley aye sir i think we did that one at school most likely you did and we sometimes used to sing the other one on the coach home after a rugby match but isnt jerusalem in israel sir was this blake jewish then again sergeant no ill admit it sounds an ironic sort of symbol for a neonazi organization but as i said blake liked to mythologize things to him jerusalem was a sort of image of the ideal city a spiritual city a perfect society if you like of which london was a pale fallen shadow and he wanted to establish a new jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land was he green then sir one of them environmentalists no he wasnt banks could see gristhorpe gritting his teeth in frustration he felt like kicking hatchley under the table but he couldnt reach the sergeant was trying it on of course but hatchley and gristhorpe always seemed to misunderstand one another you wouldnt have thought they were both yorkshiremen under the skin blakes albion was a powerful figure ruler of this ideal kingdom gristhorpe went on a figure of which even the heroes of the arthurian legends were mere shadows how long have they been around banks asked gristhorpe turned to him clearly with some relief about a year he said they started as a splinter group of the british national party which turned out to be too soft for them and they think theyre a cut above combat who they regard as nowt but a bunch of thugs well theyre right on that count banks said whos the grand poohbah bloke called neville motcombe aged thirtyfive youd think hed be old enough to know better wouldnt you any form one arrest for assaulting a police officer during a bnp rally years back and another for receiving stolen goods any connection with george mahmood and his friends banks asked gristhorpe shook his head other than the obvious none surely the albion league isnt based in eastvale sir susan gay asked gristhorpe laughed no thats just where jason foxs parents happen to live luck of the draw as far as were concerned their headquarters are in leeds an old greengrocers shop in holbeck but theyve got cells all over west yorkshire especially in places where theres a high percentage of immigrants as i said before theyre not above using the yobs but theres also that element of a more intellectual appeal to disaffected white middleclass kids with chips on their shoulders lads like jason fox with a few bobs worth of brains and nobbut an aporth of common sense how strong are they banks asked hard to say according to crawley theres about fifteen cells give or take a couple one each in smaller places like batley and liversedge but two or three in a larger city like leeds we dont really know how many members in each cell but as a rough estimate lets say maybe eighty to a hundred members in all not a lot is it where does this motcombe bloke live pudsey down by fulneck way apparently hes got a nice detached house there banks raised his eyebrows ladida any idea how theyre financed apart from receiving stolen goods crawley says he doesnt know do you believe him gristhorpe sniffed and scratched his hooked nose i smell politics in this one alan he said and when i smell politics i dont believe anything i see or hear do you want jim and me to have a poke around in leeds banks asked just what i was thinking you could pay the shop a visit for a start see if theres anyone around clear it with ken blackstone first make sure youre not treading on anyones toes banks nodded what about motcombe gristhorpe paused before answering i got the impression that crawley didnt want us bothering mr motcombe he said slowly in fact i think crawley was only detailed to answer our request for information because they knew down there that wed simply blunder ahead and find out anyway the bullinachinashop approach he was very vague indeed and he asked us to proceed with caution so what do we do a wicked grin creased gristhorpes face well he said tugging his plump earlobe id pay him a visit if i were you rattle his chain a bit i mean its not as if weve been officially warned off banks smiled right one more thing before you all go these letters at the bottom of the albion leagues flyer gristhorpe lifted the pamphlet from the table and pointed httpwwwalblguecomindexhtml now you all know im a bloody luddite when it comes to computers but even i know thats a web page address dont ask me what a web page looks like mind you question is can we do anything with it is it likely to get us anywhere susan it might do said susan gay unfortunately we dont have access to the internet over the station computers oh why not i dont know sir just slow i suppose south yorkshires even got their own web page and west mercia gristhorpe frowned what do they do with them susan shrugged put out information community relations crime stoppers chief constables opinion on the state of the county that sort of thing its an interface with the community is it indeed gristhorpe grunted sounds like a complete bloody waste of time to me still if this albion league things worth a try is there some way you could have a peek or should i say surf susan smiled browse actually sir you surf the net but you browse the web and is there any wonder ive no patience with the bloody machines gristhorpe muttered whatever you call it can you get a look at it susan nodded ive got a hookup from home she said i can certainly give it a try then do it and let us know what you find alan did those lads from west yorkshire find anything on jason foxs computer banks shook his head clean as a whistle clean as in somebody washed it thats what they said gristhorpe grimaced as he shifted his bad leg and shook it to improve the circulation before standing up right then he said thats about it for now lets get cracking ii susan enjoyed the unexpected surprise of being able to go home during working hours even though she knew she was there to work first she kicked off her shoes and put on the kettle then she looked through her collection of different tea varieties and settled on autumn a black tea dotted with small pieces of apple perfect for the drizzly blustery day on impulse she put a pinch of cinnamon in the pot too while the tea was brewing she put on her cd of andrew lloyd webbers greatest hits smiling as she thought how much banks would hate it then she poured herself a cup of tea and got down to work the computer was in her bedroom because her flat was so small it was the one room where she never received visitors at least not yet but she wasnt going to allow herself to think about dc gavin richards right now cup of appleandcinnamonscented tea steaming beside her and dont cry for me argentina drifting in from the living room susan curled her feet under her on the office chair and logged in then she typed in the address from the flyer and clicked her mouse the screen remained blank for a long time as the various bits and pieces of the document coming in over the telephone line added up then suddenly it turned black next a multicolored image began to appear line by line from the top of the screen down and soon the albion leagues emblem a swastika made out of burning golden arrows appeared in full probably susan thought remembering superintendent gristhorpes words and the blake song it was some sort of image of blakes arrows of desire around the top of the swastika the words the albion league curled in a semicircle of bold gothic script it took a couple of minutes for the rest of the document to transfer when it was complete susan started browsing through it memory floated in from the living room unlike pages in a book web pages have an extra dimension provided by hypertext links highlighted words or icons you can click on to go to another related site at first susan ignored these links and concentrated on reading the text it was much the same as the pamphlet she had seen only there was more of it the first paragraph welcomed the reader to the page and explained that the albion league was a fastgrowing group of concerned citizens dedicated to ethnic purity freedom of speech law and order and the establishment of the true english homeland after that came a number of links some were closely related sites such as the british national partys home page or combat and some were american or canadian such as stormfront aryan nation and the heritage front they varied from the fairly literate to the downright unreadable but some of the graphics were imaginatively conceived susan had never thought members of whitepower groups to be particularly creative or intelligent she had to remind herself that these days you didnt have to be an einstein to work a computer almost any kid could do it she opted for the leagues news icon and was soon treated to a number of recent stories from the unique perspective of the albion league the first item concerned the amount of public money being channeled toward the huge new mosque under construction between leeds and bradford and contrasted it with the shocking state of disrepair of most of britains churches the second contended that a leading academic had proved humans were actually descended from paleskinned northern tribes rather than from hairy africans and so it went on a tory mp known for his stand on morality and family values had been surprised by a police raid on a homosexual brothel in sheffield wearing only a blond wig and a tutu leeds city council had voted to rename one of the citys streets after a black revolutionary scumexample after example of government hypocrisy just deserts and cultural decay one story concerned a white schoolboy who had been stabbed just outside the gates of a bradford comprehensive school by three members of an asian gang it was a sadenough tale and susan remembered reading about it in the yorkshire post only a couple of weeks ago but according to the albion league the tragic stabbing had occurred because the local council was dominated by ethnics and by their brainwashed politically correct white lackeys who had all known about the schools problems for years but had never done anything the victim could therefore be seen as a sacrifice to the multiracial society susan wondered what they would make of jason foxs death she paused and took a sip of cold tea to soothe her stomach the lloyd webber had finished ages ago and she had been too absorbed to go into the living room and put something else on though she hadnt actually learned much more about the albion league and its members from the web page she had learned enough to make her question how she felt about freedom of speech these people would claim all attempts to silence them violated their basic democratic freedom yet given any power at all they would silence everyone but straight white males at the end of the leagues page susan found as with many sites a hypertext link to the pages designers in this case the name was fox wood designs curious susan clicked on the name again she was disappointed she had expected names and addresses but all she got was a stylized graphic image of a fox peering out from some dark trees along with an email address still she thought as she made a note of the address there was a slight chance that if one half of the team was mr fox then the other half was mr wood and if she could track down mr wood then she might just find one person who knew something about jason foxs life and his death as soon as susan hung up her modem the telephone rang it was gavin susan whereve you been ive been trying to phone you all morning i bumped into jim hatchley in the station and he told me you were working at home thats right susan said what do you want charming and i was going to invite you to lunch lunch yes you know that stuff you eat to keep you alive i dont know said susan oh come on even a hardworking dc needs a spot of lunch now and then surely come to think of it susan was hungry half an hour if thats all you can spare me it is then ill take it and youre paying im paying susan grinned to herself right see you at the hope and anchor in ten minutes iii the old greengrocers turned out to be a former corner shop at the end of a street of backtobacks between holbeck moor and elland road the windows were boarded with plywood on which various obscenities swastikas and racist slogans had been spraypainted drizzle suited the scene perfectly streaking the sootcovered red brick and the faded sign over the door that read arthur gelderd greengrocer banks wondered what arthur gelderd greengrocer would have thought if he knew what had become of his shop like frank hepplethwaite arthur gelderd had probably fought against hitler in the war and forty years or more ago before the supermarkets this place would have been one of the local neighborhood meeting places and a center of gossip it would also have provided gelderd and his family with a modest living now it was the headquarters of the albion league banks and hatchley looked the building over in the slanting drizzle for a moment cars hissed by on ingram road splashing up dirty rainwater from the gutters the window in the shop door was protected by wire mesh and the glass itself was covered with old adverts for omo and lucozade so you couldnt see inside in the center was a cardboard clock face to show the time the shop would next be open it was set at nine oclock and it would probably be set at that time forever sergeant hatchley knocked with his hamlike fist the door rattled in its frame but no one answered he tried the handle but the place was locked in the silence after the knocking banks thought he heard a sound inside what do we do hatchley asked knock again hatchley did so harder this time it did the trick a voice from behind the door shouted what do you want police said banks open up they heard someone remove a chain and turn a key in a lock then the door opened for some reason the new occupants hadnt removed the bell that hung on its pliant arc of metal at the back of the door and it jangled as banks and hatchley walked in the sound reminded banks of childhood errands to his local corner shop the way he used to watch hypnotized as mrs bray turned the handle on the machine and the bacon swung back and forth in the slicer making a whooshing sound every time the whirling wheel blade carved off a slice he remembered the smoky smell of the cured meat in the air mingled with fresh bread and apples what he smelled when he walked in now soon put such nostalgia out of his mind burned carbon from the photocopier and laser printer recent paint smoke and freshcut paper the place didnt even resemble a shop anymore what must have been the counter was covered with stacks of paper more copies of the flyer by the looks of it and a computer hummed on a desk beside a telephone on the walls were a framed poster of adolf hitler in full spate addressing one of the nuremberg rallies by the look of it and a large image of a swastika made out of burning arrows a short young man with lank black hair antique national health glasses and a spotty face shut the door behind them always happy to help the local police he said with a stupid grin were on the same side we are fuck off sonny said banks whats your name the young man blinked at the insult and stepped back a pace theres no need name banks repeated as he and hatchley advanced backing the young man up against the counter the kid held his hands up all right all right dont hit me its des des parker were just going to have a little look around des if thats all right with you banks said des frowned dont you need a search warrant i mean i know my rights banks stopped and raised his eyebrows he looked at hatchley hear that jim des here knows his rights aye said hatchley walking toward the telephone and picking up the receiver shall i do the honors sir des looked puzzled what honors whats he doing getting a search warrant banks explained in about half an hour well have fifty flatfoots going over the place with a finetooth comb sergeant hatchley and i will stay here with you until they arrive maybe youd like to inform the buildings owner if its not you while we wait he might want to be here to make sure his rights arent violated des gulped mr motcombe he wouldnt like that so what whats going on des who the fuck is this is there a problem the new speaker came out of the back room zipping up his fly accompanied by the sound of a toilet flushing this one looked a few years older than des parker and at least fifty brain cells brighter tall and skinny he was wearing a black tshirt jeans and red braces and his dyedblond hair was cut very close to his skull he also wore a diamond stud in one ear and spoke with a strong geordie accent definitely not the lad whod been in the jubilee with jason fox last saturday no problem at all banks said showing his warrant card again wed just like a quick shufti around if thats all right with you and you are the newcomer smiled of course weve got nothing to hide im ray ray knott but ray des parker protested mr motcombe we cant just let shut it des theres a good lad said ray with another smile as i said weve nothing to hide he turned to banks sorry about my mate he said pointing to his temple hes none too bright isnt des few bricks short of load banks picked up a copy of the flyer whats this then ray the albion league a new football league perhaps out to rival the premier are you very funny said ray but he wasnt laughing tell us about jason fox banks prompted jason what about him hes dead kicked to death by pakis you lot let them go hatchley still poking around brushed against the huge stack of pamphlets on the counter they fell to the floor scattering all over the place ray and des said nothing sorry said hatchley clumsy of me banks marveled at him full of contradictions and surprises was jim hatchley while hed pin photos of halfnaked women on his corkboard at least he did before susan moved in he hated pornographers and while hed join in with lads laughing at racist jokes and was certainly a casual bigot himself he didnt like neonazis either of course none of it seemed like a contradiction to him the way he put it he wasnt prejudiced he hated everyone were not sure who killed him yet said banks where were the two of you at that time ray laughed you cant be serious us kill jason no way he was one of us so it wont do you any harm to tell me where you were would it i were at home des said by yourself no i live with me mum and im sure shes really proud of you des address des stuttering told him what about you ray ray folded his arms and leaned against the counter one leg crossed over the other big grin on his face drinking in my local which is the oakwood up gipton way witnesses ray grinned six or seven at least local darts championship i won congratulations what about sunday morning sleeping it off why alone yes banks made some notes then said there was no contact address on your flyer youre not a secret society are you no but we have to be careful we have a position we want to get across and we know its not popular with a lot of people so we dont exactly go around shouting about our existence to everyone ill bet you dont not everyone understands im sure they dont how does a person join then why you interested just answer the fucking question all right all right no need to get shirty just my little joke we recruit people where ray shrugged wherever we can find them its no secret schools youth clubs football matches rock concerts the internet we vet them pretty thoroughly too of course if they express any interest tell me ray what are your duties banks asked pacing around the small room as he talked how high up the totem pole are you ray grinned me not very high mostly i hand out pamphlets and ill be doing some of the writing now jasons dead propaganda was that his job one of them the goebbels of the group eh come again never mind ray before your time anything else i do some training what sort of training country weekends you know survival skills camping hiking physical fitness that sort of thing real duke of edinburghs award stuff if you like weapons ray folded his arms now you know that would be illegal right how silly of me to ask anyway ray back to jason fox how well did you know him not very you mean the two of you didnt share your ideas on immigration policy and sing the occasional verse of the horst wessel song together after a couple of jars no said ray and you can sneer all you like im getting fed up of this look why dont you go get your search warrant and call in your bully boys either that or get the fuck off our property banks said nothing i mean it ray went on im calling your bluff either bring in the bluebottles or bugger off banks thought for a moment as he engaged ray in a staring match he decided that there was nothing more to be learned here besides he was getting hungry all right ray he said weve finished with you for the time being jim what oh sorry sergeant hatchley managed to knock over a halffull mug of tea on the counter banks turned and watched as the dark stain spread around the bottom few pamphlets left on the counter and began to rise up as the paper absorbed it then with hatchley behind him he opened the door and they headed out to the car the drizzle had stopped now and a brisk wind had sprung up allowing the occasional shaft of sunlight to slant through puffy gray clouds we didnt have to leave sir hatchley said as they got in the car we could have leaned on them a bit more i know that we can always go back if we need to but i dont think well find any answers there think they had anything to do with jasons death i dont know yet i cant honestly see why they would me neither what next banks lit a cigarette and slid the window down a couple of inches well have a word with neville motcombe this afternoon he said but before that how do you fancy lunch with ken blackstone there was something young adolf said back there that gave me an idea iv when susan got to the hope and anchor just around the corner on york road gavin was already looking over the menu a full pint beside him susan waved stopped at the bar for her usual st clements and went over to join him she put the copy of classic cd that shed bought at the newsagents on the bench beside her what brings you to town then she asked i had a couple of boxes of stuff to deliver to your records officer its not all computers you know the place was fairly quiet and soon they had both ordered the lasagnaandchips special gavin raised his glass cheers cheers susan smiled at him a little over six foot and only a couple of years older than her gavin was a goodlooking fellow with a strong chin soulful eyes and a mop of shaggy chestnut hair he played fullback for the police rugby team so gavin said you are the sergeant when a call is received that there is a small nuclear device in the swainsdale centre a validated code word has been given it is a busy time of day and you have twenty minutes to hand over every packet of rice krispies in eastvale at a designated spot what do you do susan laughed get in my car and drive like hell out of there sorry dc gay you fail it was a running joke between them they had met just after doing their boards and since then they had been coming up with progressively more absurd versions of the scenarios they had been given to solve whats that gavin asked pointing at the magazine just a music magazine i can see that bring it along in case the conversation gets boring did you idiot susan grinned i picked it up on the way i thought i might have to wait for you gavin picked up the magazine classical music with a free compact disc cecilia bartoli sir simon rattle i say alan bennett plays are one thing but i didnt know you were such a culture vulture susan snatched the magazine back its something i picked up from dci banks she said i get to hear a lot of classical stuff traveling in the car with him and i thought well some of its really interesting this is just an easy way of finding out more about it thats all you get snippets of things on the disc and if i like them sometimes ill go and buy the whole thing ah the ubiquitous dci banks i should have known his hand would be in this somewhere and where might golden boy be today hes gone to leeds and i told you not to call him that leeds again know what i think gavin leaned forward and narrowed his eyes i think hes got a fancy woman down there thats what i think dont be absurd hes married gavin laughed well ive never known that to stop a bloke before what about this violinist you told me about is banks bonking her youre disgusting her names pamela jeffreys and shes a violist not a violinist for your information dci banks is a decent bloke hes got an absolutely gorgeous wife she runs the art gallery at the community center im certain hes faithful to her he wouldnt do anything like that gavin held his hand up all right all right i know when im beaten if you say so hes a saint i didnt say that either susan said through gritted teeth then she glared at him their food came and they both tucked in susan concentrated on her lasagna and tried to ignore the chips not entirely successfully ill tell you one thing though gavin said your banks is definitely not a saint in chief constable riddles books jimmy riddles a pillock thats as may be but hes also chief constable pillock and your golden boy has been pissing him off mightily of late just a friendly word of warning thats all are you talking about those asian kids we brought in gavin nodded could be something to do with them yes that and near causing a race riot a race riot in eastvale she laughed it was a storm in a teacup gavin i was there and wed good reason to detain those three kids theyre still not off the hook you know the lab found something suspicious on george mahmoods shoe theyre still working on it probably dog shit i think youll need a lot more than that to convince the cc they think it might be blood anyway you know as well as i do that jimmy riddle only ordered their release because of political pressure dont underestimate political pressure susan it can be a powerful motivator especially in a persons career even so youre probably right about his reasons gavin pushed his empty plate aside to be honest i cant say ive ever heard the cc have a good word to say for darkies in private but the public face is another matter sure they only got off because theyre colored this time and because mustapha camel or whatever his name is is some big wallah in the muslim community but theres a large section of the public especially some of the more liberal members of the press who say they were only arrested in the first place because they were colored take your pick you cant win anyway you might just want to warn dci banks that the cc is on the warpath susan laughed whats new i think he already knows that she glanced at her watch maybe thats why hes gone to leeds dci banks isnt scared of jimmy riddle well maybe he should be susan wasnt certain from his expression whether gavin was being serious or not it was often difficult to tell with him ive got to go she said standing up you cant you havent finished your chips theyre fattening but ive not had my full half hour yet isnt life unfair susan said smiling as she pecked him on the cheek and turned to leave saturday he called out after her maybe she said six i di ken blackstone west yorkshire cid was already waiting when banks and hatchley arrived at the pub hed suggested over the telephone a seedylooking dive near kirkgate market at the back of the millgarth police headquarters most days there was an openair market near the bus station behind the huge edwardian market hall and today in the drizzle a few lost souls in macs wandered around the covered stalls fingering samples of fabric and fruit thumbing through tattered paperback romances and considering the virtues of buying that genuine antique brass door knocker but no one showed much enthusiasm not even the vendors who were usually keen to sing out the praises of their wares and draw customers to their stalls today most of them stood to the side wearing flat caps and waxed jackets drawing on cigarettes and shuffling from foot to foot the pub wasnt very busy either blackstone had assured them the cook did a decent yorkshire pudding and gravy and luckily it turned out to be true in deference to duty banks and blackstone drank halves hatchley unwilling to miss what was a rare opportunity these days had a full pint of tetleys bitter a giant jukebox stood in one corner of the lounge bar but it was silent at the moment so they didnt have to shout well alan said blackstone echoing gavin richardss sentiments youve been spending so much time down here this past year or two im surprised youre not thinking of moving banks smiled i wont say it hasnt crossed my mind oh not seriously well maybe just a little bit seriously with both brian and tracy gone the house just seems too big and much as i love eastvale i think sandra misses bigcity life and i wouldnt mind being a bit nearer opera north when he mentioned sandra he felt a pang they hadnt talked since their argument the other night and opera north had certainly played its part in that blackstone smiled its not such a bad place you could do a lot worse banks looked at hatchley who had done a stint on the west yorkshire force several years ago jim hes right hatchley agreed and it might not be a bad career move he winked its a long way from jimmy riddle wed miss you of course stop it youll make me cry banks said pretending to reach for a handkerchief all right said hatchley we wont miss you then anyway banks asked hows crime much the same as usual said blackstone weve had a spate of steamings lately five or six young lads will go into a shop then when the shopkeepers got his cash register open they rush into action create chaos all around while they grab what they want from customers and till alike kids for the most part fifteen and under most of them theyve also taken to doing building societies and post offices the same way banks shook his head sounds american to me you know how it goes alan first america then london then the rest of the country what else weve had a few too many muggings at cash dispensers too and to cap it all it looks like were heading for another drug war in chapeltown banks raised his eyebrows blackstone sighed bloke goes by the name of deevaughan spelled like the county devon anyway devon came up from london about a month ago and sussed out the scene pretty quickly already it looks like we can put down one murder to him cant prove anything of course course not he was in a pub with twenty mates when it happened this ones bad alan crack cocaine the usual stuff of course but word also has it hes a big heroin fan he spent the last few years in new york and toronto and theres rumors of death follow him around wherever he goes still want to move here banks laughed ill think about it anyway you didnt come to talk about my problems how can i help you this time banks lit a cigarette know anything about neville motcombe runs a whitepower group called the albion league lives out pudsey way offices in holbeck blackstone shook his head ive heard of him but i cant really say i know much not offthecuff bit out of my bailiwick to be honest what is neonazis or pudsey blackstone laughed both i suppose with his thinning sandy hair still enough left to curl around his ears wirerimmed glasses long pale face and cupidsbow lips blackstone reminded banks more of an academic than a copper except that he was always welldressed today he wore a dazzling white shirt its brightness outdone only by his gaudy tie and a pinstripe suit that looked tailormade not offthepeg with a silk handkerchief poking out of the top pocket banks didnt even wear a suit and tie unless he had to and he always kept the top button of his shirt undone today he was wearing his favorite suede jacket again and his tie hung askew how did you come to hear about him banks asked blackstone laughed bit of a joke around the station actually seems he tried to flog a stolen stereo to one of our offduty pcs at a carboot sale last year luckily for us it was one of our honest pcs and he traced it to a currys breakin a couple of months earlier what happened nothing motcombe swore blind hed bought it at the market and we couldnt prove otherwise got a light rap on the knuckles and thats the lot did you know about the albion league ive heard of it yes i try at least to stay abreast of possible troublemakers and you think theyre likely ones blackstone pursed his lips mmm id say theyve got potential yes weve had a few unattributed racial incidents this past year or so we cant tie them in to him and his group yet but i have my suspicions anything in particular know that big mosque theyre putting up out bradford way banks nodded theres been a few small acts of sabotage nothing much stolen building materials spraypainted racist slogans slashed tires scratched paintwork that sort of thing and you suspect motcombes lot well itd be surprising if there werent some sort of organized group behind it what really worries me is what level of violence theyre likely to rise to a bomb something like that blackstone shrugged well if the ira can do it anyway its just speculation at the moment want me to dig around a bit more banks nodded id appreciate it ken right now anything is better than nothing were getting nowhere fast what about those asian lads you had in custody theyre not off my list yet you said earlier you had an idea sergeant hatchley prompted banks ah yes banks stubbed out his cigarette and looked at blackstone its probably just a minor thing really we talked to two of motcombes cronies in holbeck ray knott and des parker blackstone nodded we know ray knott he said used to be a dab hand at taking and driving away used to be blackstone shrugged anyway banks went on at one point knott let slip that the albion league or motcombe himself actually owned the property im wondering if thats true or whether it was simply some sort of figure of speech you know the way someone might say get off my property even if its only rented and youd like me to check it out if you would may i ask why because id like to know if moneys involved if motcombe owns property and lives in a nice house in pudsey maybe theres some scam involved blackstone nodded hmmm good thinking ill do what i can as a matter of fact ive got a couple of mates in the town hall and they owe me a favor or two banks raised his eyebrows whats this ken have you been tipping them off when their brothels going to be raided blackstone laughed not exactly theres an address in rawdon id like you to check too if its not too much trouble jason fox lived there as far as we know he hasnt been employed this past couple of years so wed like to know how he could afford it will do said blackstone he looked at his watch look i should get back to the station i can make a couple of phone calls get working on it pretty much straightaway we should be moving along too said banks looking at hatchley who started swigging the last of his ale in expectation of an imminent departure were going to pay mr motcombe a visit and theres another thing ken blackstone raised his eyebrows we still havent been able to track down the lad jason fox was drinking with the night he was killed if the albion league or neville motcombe himself does actually own the holbeck building or the rawdon house do you think you could check and see if he owns any other property in the city who knows it might lead us to jasons mystery pal who may or may not know something banks smiled and nudged hatchley ever the optimist our ken isnt he jim hatchley laughed west yorkshire does that to you can do said blackstone standing up ill call you soon as i get anything appreciate it said banks i owe you one ill remember that if you ever transfer here ii after lunch susans wednesday afternoon was becoming every bit as frustrating as tuesdays had been she had telephoned the service provider that gave internet and web access to fox wood designs but she couldnt get a name and address out of them over the phone a court order would see to that of course but what grounds had she to seek one a vague hunch that it might lead her to someone who might know something about a mysterious death every once in a while she left her computer terminal stretched and paced around the flat for a while she put on the disc that came with her magazine and arias followed solo piano pieces which in turn followed symphonic movements from monteverdi to maxwell davies it was all very confusing like banks she wondered about george mahmood and his mates had they done it they certainly could have and maybe not many people would blame them the reporters had been around the station in droves of course and there was sure to be an article on police racism in the weekly eastvale gazette due out on friday susan turned back to her desk still working on the assumption that if fox was jason fox then wood might turn out to be a real person too she phoned directory assistance and discovered as she suspected that in leeds alone there were pages of woods well she supposed she could try them all and what would she say ask each one if he knew jason fox if this wood person didnt want the police to know he knew jason he would hardly be likely to tell her over the telephone would he there had to be an easier way tax records business registries maybe foxwood designs was incorporated or had registered their design as a trademark suddenly she realized there might be an even easier way than that subterfuge she hurried back to the computer where she typed away for a few minutes then sat back to survey her handiwork not bad she made one or two small changes correcting a typo here and an awkward phrase there when she had finished the message read to foxwood designs from gayline fashions i have just started my own fashiondesign business and im looking for ways to find a wider audience for my products i noticed your work recently on a web page and was very impressed by what i saw i realized that the web is an ideal way to achieve my aims and from what i saw i realized your company would be more than capable of handling the graphics necessary for the sort of page i have in mind i would really like to talk to you about this as soon as possible do you think you could supply me with your address so that i could come around and discuss the possibility of our working together i would much appreciate the opportunity to get myself established on the world wide web without delay susan gay sole proprietor gayline fashions susan read it over it wasnt perfect english had never been her strong point at school but it would do she saved the message and logged in again then when all the preliminaries were done with she took a deep breath pressed enter and sent her message bouncing around the worlds computer systems to the email address she had taken from the bottom of the fox wood designs page iii before banks and hatchley even had time to ring motcombes doorbell they saw the figure approaching through the frosted glass mr motcombe said banks showing his identification thats me said motcombe im surprised it took you so long please come in they followed him through to the living room youve been expecting us banks asked ever since jasons tragic demise but you didnt bother to call us motcombe smiled why should i have i dont know anything that can help you but that doesnt keep you away from me does it sit down please hatchley sat in one of the deep armchairs and took out his notebook banks walked over to the window at the far end of the room the house was perched on a hillside the back window looked over toward the village of tong not much more than a mile away past park wood the smoking chimneys of bradford stood to the right and leeds sprawled to the left yes its impressive isnt it banks heard motcombe say behind him its one of the things that helps me remember what were fighting for that all isnt lost motcombe was standing so close that banks could smell peppermint toothpaste on his breath banks turned and walked past him glancing around at the rest of the room the furniture looked solid and wellcrafted a table chairs sideboard and a glassfronted cabinet all dark shiny wood while there were no posters of hitler or swastikas on the bright floral wallpaper inside the cabinet was obviously motcombes collection of nazi memorabilia armband bayonet german officers cap all bearing the swastika a series of dogeared photographs of hitler and what was probably a wartime edition of mein kampf again with the swastika on the front hitler was an inspiration dont you think motcombe said he made mistakes perhaps but he had the right ideas the right intentions we should have joined forces with him instead of sending our forces against him then we would have a strong united europe as a bulwark against the corruption and impurity of the rest of the world instead of the motheaten ragbag we do have banks looked at him he supposed motcombe was imposing enough tall and gaunt wearing a black poloneck jumper tucked into matching black trousers with sharp creases and a broad belt with a plain square silver buckle he had closely cropped black hair shorter even than bankss own a sharp nose and lobeless ears flat against his skull his eyes were brown and there was a gleam in them like the winter sun in a frozen mud puddle a constant sly smile twitched at the corners of his thin dry lips as if he knew something no one else did and as if that knowledge made him somehow superior he reminded banks of a younger norman tebbit thats all very interesting banks said at last resting the backs of his thighs against the table but if you dont mind weve got some questions for you why should i mind as far as im concerned were on the same side motcombe sat crossed his legs and put his hands together in front of him fingertips touching as if in prayer how do you work that one out banks asked thinking it odd that was the second time hed heard the same thing today easy jason fox was killed on your patch you did your job as best you could under the circumstances you found his killers quickly but you had to let them go he narrowed his eyes and gazed at banks just for a moment banks fancied he saw a gleam of something in them conspiracy condescension whatever it was he didnt like it how that must have sickened you motcombe went on his voice a low hypnotic monotone having to bow to political pressure like that believe me i know how your hands are tied i know about the conspiracy that renders our police ineffective you have my every sympathy banks took a deep breath it smelled like a nonsmoking room but at this point he didnt care he lit up anyway motcombe didnt complain look said banks after he blew out his first mouthful lets get something straight from the start i dont want your sympathy or your opinions lets stick to the facts jason fox motcombe shook his head slowly you know i half expected something like that deep down most people agree with us just listen to the way they talk in pubs the jokes they tell about chinks pakis niggers and yids listen to the way you talk when you let your politically correct guard down he pointed toward the window theres a whole silent nation out there who want what we want but are afraid to act we arent most people just dont have the courage of their convictions we do all i want to do is make it possible for people to look into their hearts and see whats really there to know that there are others who feel the same way then to give them a way they can act on it a goal to aim for a white england is that such a bad thing if you put your prejudices aside for just a few moments and really think about it is that such a terrible dream to pursue look at whats happened to our schools our culture our religious trad didnt you hear me the first time banks asked his voice calm but hard lets stick to the facts motcombe favored him with that conspiratorial condescending smile as if he were regarding a wayward child of course he said inclining his head slightly please chief inspector go ahead ask your questions and theres an ashtray on the sideboard just behind you i dont smoke myself but my guests occasionally do secondhand smoke doesnt bother me banks picked up the ashtray and held it in his left hand while he spoke tell me about jason fox motcombe shrugged what is there to say jason was a valued member of the albion league and we will miss him dearly how long had you known him let me see now about a year perhaps a little less how did you meet at a rally in london jason was flirting with the british national party i had already left them as they didnt adequately serve my vision we talked at the time i was just about to start setting up the league making contacts a few months later when we got going jason and i met again at a conference i asked him and he joined us were you close motcombe tilted his head again i wouldnt say close no not in the personal sense you understand in ideas yes he tapped the side of his head after all thats where it counts so you didnt socialize with him no what was jasons specialty i heard he was your minister of propaganda motcombe laughed very good yes i suppose you could put it like that he wrote most of the pamphlets he also handled the computer an essential tool in this day and age i fear banks showed him the vague drawing of the boy jason had been drinking with the night he was killed do you know him he asked is he one of yours i dont think so motcombe said its almost impossible to tell but i dont think i recognize him where were you on saturday night motcombes black eyebrows shot up and he laughed again me do you mean im a suspect too how exciting im almost sorry to disappoint you but as a matter of fact i was in bradford at a tenants meeting in a block of council flats where some people are becoming very concerned about who or should i say what theyre getting for neighbors crime is you can prove this i suppose if i have to here he got up and took a slip of paper from the sideboard drawer this is the address of the block where the meeting was held check up on it if you want any number of people will vouch for me banks pocketed the slip what time did the meeting end about ten oclock actually a couple of us went on to a pub and carried on our discussion until closing time in bradford yes have you ever been to eastvale motcombe laughed yes ive been there on a number of occasions purely as a tourist you understand and not for about a year its a rather pretty little town im a great lover of walking the unspoiled english countryside whats left of it have you ever heard of george mahmood what a ridiculous name have you ever heard of him as a matter of fact i have hes one of the youths responsible for jasons death we dont know that oh come on chief inspector motcombe winked theres a big difference between what you can prove and what you know you dont have to softsoap me wouldnt think of it did jason ever mention any racial problems in eastvale no you know youre lucky to live there chief inspector as i understand it these mahmoods are about the only darkies in the place i envy you then why dont you move too much work to be done here first one day perhaps did jason ever mention george once or twice yes in what context i honestly dont remember but youd remember if he said he chucked a brick through their window motcombe smiled oh yes but jason wouldnt have done a thing like that for what it was worth it was probably the first positive link between jason fox and george mahmood that banks had come across so far but what was it worth so jason had noticed george in eastvale and mentioned him to motcombe that didnt mean george knew jason was a neonazi and everything motcombe said could have come from the newspapers or television there had been plenty of local coverage of the detainment and release of the three asian suspects ibrahim nazur had even appeared on a local breakfast television program complaining about systemic racism what about asim nazur he asked motcombe shook his head doesnt sound familiar kobir mukhtar motcombe sighed and shook his head chief inspector you have to understand these do not sound like the kind of people i mix with i told you i remember jason mentioned a certain george mahmood once or twice thats all i know by name yes by name the mahmood part jason might have known from the shop sign but george how could he have known that perhaps from the report in the eastvale gazette after the brickthrowing incident as banks recollected george had been mentioned by name then if motcombe was lying then he was playing it very cautiously careful not to own to knowing too much just enough obviously a story of a fullblown conspiracy between the three asians to attack jason fox would be even better for propaganda purposes but it would be much more suspicious a jet flew across the valley a bright flash of gray against the gray clouds suddenly someone else walked into the room nev have you got sorry didnt know youd got company whos this this said motcombe is detective chief inspector banks and detective sergeant hatchley and now weve got that out of the way said banks maybe youd care to tell us who you are this is rupert said motcombe rupert francis come in rupert dont be shy rupert came in he was wearing a khaki apron the kind banks had to wear for woodwork classes at school his hair was cut short but that was where his resemblance to jasons mystery friend ended in his mid to late twenties banks guessed rupert was at least six feet tall and thin rather than stocky also there was no sign of an earring and as far as banks could make out no hole to hang one from im a carpenter a cabinetmaker said motcombe though its more in the form of a hobby than a true occupation im afraid anyway ive converted the cellar into a workshop and rupert helps me out every now and then hes very good i think the traditional values of the craftsman are very important indeed in our society dont you rupert smiled and nodded at banks and hatchley pleased to meet you he said whats it about its about jason fox said banks didnt happen to know him did you vaguely i mean i saw him around we werent mates or anything saw him around here down the office holbeck on the computer banks slipped the drawing from his briefcase again know this lad rupert shook his head never seen him before can i go now im halfway through finishing a surface go on said banks turning to motcombe again you really must try believing us chief inspector he said you see banks stood up are you sure theres nothing else you can tell us about jason about his problem with george mahmood no said motcombe im sorry but that just about covers it i told you when you first came that i couldnt tell you anything that would help oh i wouldnt say you havent helped us mr motcombe said banks i wouldnt say that at all sergeant hatchley put his notebook away and got to his feet well said motcombe at the door i suppose ill see you at the funeral banks turned what funeral motcombe raised his eyebrows why jasons of course tomorrow he smiled dont the police always attend the funerals of murder victims just in case the killer turns up who said anything about murder i just assumed you make a lot of assumptions mr motcombe as far as we know it could have been manslaughter why are you going to show support for a fallen colleague fallen in the course of our common struggle and we hope to gain some media coverage as you said yourself why waste a golden opportunity to publicize our ideas therell be a small representative presence at the graveside and well be preparing a special blackborder pamphlet for the event he smiled dont you realize it yet chief inspector jason is a martyr bollocks said banks turning to leave jasons just another dead nazi thats all motcombe tuttutted really chief inspector at the door banks did his columbo impersonation just one more question mr motcombe motcombe sighed and leaned on the doorpost folding his arms fire away then if you must where were you on sunday morning sunday morning why where were you here at home alone yes can you prove it is there any reason i have to just pursuing inquiries im sorry im afraid i cant prove it i was alone sadly my wife and i separated some years ago are you sure you didnt visit number seven rudmore terrace in rawdon of course im sure why should i because that was where jason fox lived we have information that two men went there on sunday morning and cleaned the place out i was just wondering if one of them happened to be you i didnt go there motcombe repeated and even if i had done i wouldnt have broken any law these men had a key mr motcombe a key in all likelihood taken from jason foxs body i know nothing about that i have a key too though he grinned at banks as a matter of fact i happen to own the house well banks thought that was one question answered motcombe did own property but you didnt go there on sunday morning he said no did you give or lend a key to anyone no i think you did i think you sent some of your lads over there to clean up after jasons death i think he had stuff there you didnt want the police to find interesting theory such as what files perhaps membership lists notes on upcoming projects and the computer had been tampered with well even if i did what you say said motcombe im sure you can understand how i would be well within my rights to go to a house i own to pick up property that essentially belongs to me in my capacity as leader of the albion league oh i can understand that completely banks said motcombe frowned then what im sorry i dont understand well then banks said slowly let me explain the thing that bothers me is that whoever went there went before anyone knew that the victim was jason fox anyone except his killers of course that is bye for now mr motcombe no doubt well be seeing you again soon seven i it was a long time since frank had worn a suit and the tie seemed to be choking him trust the weather to brighten up for a funeral too it was indian summer again warm air tinged with that sweet smoky hint of autumns decay sun shining hardly a breeze and here he was in the back of the car next to his daughter josie who was dressed all in black sweat beading on his brow despite the open window the drive to halifax from lyndgarth where steven had picked him up was a long one and a bloody ugly one once you got past skipton too frank thought as they drove through keighley talk about your dark satanic mills he had wondered why they couldnt just bury the lad in eastvale and have done with it but josie explained stevens family connections with st lukes church where his forebears were buried going back centuries bugger yon streak of piss and his forebears frank thought but he kept his mouth shut nobody said very much on the journey josie sobbed softly every now and then putting a white handkerchief to her nose steven who for all his sins was a good driver kept his eyes on the road and maureen sat stiffly arms folded beside him looking out the window frank found himself drifting down memory lane jason aged four or five down by the leas one spring afternoon excited as he caught his first stickleback in a net made of old lace curtain and a thin strip of cane the two of them stopping for ice cream one hot still summer day at the small shop in the middle of nowhere halfway up fremlington hill melting ice cream dripping over his knuckles an autumn walk down a lane near richmond jason running ahead kicking up piles of autumn leaves which made a dry soughing sound as he plowed through them standing freezing in the snow in ben rhydding watching the skiers glide down ilkley moor whatever jason had become frank thought he had once been an innocent child as awestruck by the wonders of man and nature as any other kid hang on to that he told himself not the twisted misguided person jason had become they arrived at the funeral home on the outskirts of halifax with time to spare frank stayed outside watching the traffic rush by because he could never stand the rarefied air of funeral homes or the thought of all those corpses in caskets makeup on their faces and formaldehyde in their veins jason he suspected would have needed a lot of cosmetic attention to his face finally the cortege was ready the four of them piled into the sleek black limousine the home provided and followed the hearse through streets of dark millstonegrit houses to the cemetery in the distance tall mill chimneys poked out between the hills after a short service they all trooped outside for the graveside ceremony frank loosened his tie so he could breathe more easily the vicar droned on in the midst of life we are in death of whom may we seek for succor but of thee o lord who for our sins are justly displeased thou knowest lord the secrets of our hearts a fly that must have been conned into thinking it was still summer buzzed by his face he brushed it away steven stepped forward to cast a clod of earth down on the coffin the vicar read on for as much as it hath pleased almighty god of his great mercy to receive unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed it should have been josie dropping the earth frank thought steven never did get on with the kid at least josie had loved her son once before they grew apart and she must still feel a mothers love for him a love which surely passes all understanding and forgives a multitude of sins all of a sudden frank noticed josie look beyond his shoulder and frown through her tears he turned to see what it was there by the line of trees stood about ten people all wearing black polonecks made of some shiny material belts with silver buckles and black leather jackets despite the warmth of the day over half had skinhead haircuts some wore sunglasses the tall gaunt one looked older than the rest and frank immediately guessed him to be the leader they didnt have to announce themselves frank knew who they were as sure as he knew jason was dead and in his grave he had read the tract as the vicar drew close to the end of his service the leader raised his arm in a nazi salute and the others followed suit frank couldnt help himself before he could even think about what he was doing he hurried over and grabbed the leader the man just laughed and brushed him off then as frank attempted to get at least one punch in he was surrounded by them jostling pushing shoving him between one another as if he were a ball or as if they were playing pass the parcel at some longago childrens party and they were laughing as they pushed him calling him granddad and old man frank flailed out but he couldnt break away all he saw was a whirl of grinning faces shorn heads and his own reflection in the dark glasses the world was spinning too fast out of control he was too hot his tie felt tight again even though he had loosened it and the pain in his chest came on fast like a vise gripping his heart and squeezing he stumbled away from the group clutching his chest the pain spreading like burning needles down his left arm he thought he could see maureen laying into one of youths with a piece of wood he could just hear her through the ringing and buzzing in his ears leave him alone you bullies leave him alone you fascist bastards cant you see hes an old man cant you see hes poorly then something strange happened frank was lying on the ground now and gently slowly he felt himself begin to float above the pain or away from it more like deeper into himself detached and light as air yes that was it deeper into himself he wasnt hovering above the scene looking down on the chaos but far inside seeing pictures of himself in years long gone a number of memories flashed through his mind flak bursting all around the bomber like bright flowers blooming in the night as frank seemed to hang suspended above it all in his gun turret the day he proposed to edna on their long walk home in the rain after the helmthorpe spring fair the night his only daughter josie was born in eastvale general infirmary while frank was stuck in lyndgarth without even a telephone then cut off from the world by a vicious snowstorm but his final memory was one he had not thought of in decades he was five years old he had trapped his finger in the front door and he sat on the freshly scoured stone step crying watching the black blood gather under the fingernail he could feel the warmth of the step against the backs of his thighs and the heat of his tears on his cheeks then the door opened he couldnt see much more than a silhouette because of the bright sunlight but as he shaded his eyes and looked up he knew it was the loving compassionate allhealing figure of his mother bending over to sweep him up into her arms and kiss away the pain then everything went black ii ah banks here you are at last as soon as he heard the voice behind him on his way back to his office from the coffee machine banks experienced that sinking feeling still he thought it had to happen sometime might as well get it over with gird his loins at least he was on his own turf their enmity went back for some time in fact banks thought it probably started the moment they met riddle was one of the youngest chief constables in the country and he had come up the fast way accelerated promotion right from the start banks had made dci fairly young true but he had made it the hard way sheer hard slog a good case clearance record and a natural talent for detective work he didnt belong to any clubs or have any wealthy contacts nor did he have a university degree all he had was a diploma in business studies from a polytechnic and that from the days before they were all turned into secondstring universities for riddle it was all a matter of making the right contacts mouthing the correct buzzwords he was a beancounter at his happiest looking over budget proposals or putting a positive spin on crime figures on look north or calendar as far as banks was concerned jimmy riddle hadnt done a days real policing in his life hand on the doorknob banks turned sir riddle kept advancing on him you know what im talking about banks where the hell do you think youve been these past few days trying to avoid me wouldnt think of such a thing sir banks opened the door and stood aside to let riddle in first the chief constable hesitated for a moment surprised at the courtesy then stalked in as usual he didnt sit but started prowling about touching things straightening the calendar eyeing the untidy pile of papers on top of the filing cabinet looking at everything in that prissy disapproving way of his he was immaculately turned out he must have a clean uniform for each day banks thought sitting behind his rickety metal desk and reaching for a cigarette however strict the antismoking laws had become lately they still hadnt stretched as far as a chief inspectors own office where not even the chief constable could stop him to his credit riddle didnt try he didnt even make his usual protest instead he launched straight into the assault that must have been building pressure inside him since monday what on earth did you think you were doing bringing in those asian kids and throwing them in the cells you mean george mahmood and his mates you know damn well who i mean well sir said banks i had good reason to suspect they were involved in the death of jason fox theyd been seen to have an altercation with him and his pal earlier in the evening at the jubilee and when i started to question george mahmood about what happened he asked for a solicitor and clammed up riddle ran his hand over his shiny head did you have to lock all three of them up i think so sir i simply detained them within the strict limits of the pace directive none of them would talk to us as i said they were reasonable suspects and i wanted them where i could see them while forensic tests on their clothing were being carried out at the same time detective sergeant hatchley was trying to locate any witnesses to the assault but didnt you realize what trouble your actions would cause didnt you think man banks sipped some coffee and looked up trouble sir riddle sighed and leaned against the filing cabinet elbow on the stack of papers youve alienated the entire yorkshire asian community banks had you never heard of ibrahim nazur dont you realize that harmony of race relations is prioritized in todays force funny that sir said banks and i thought we were supposed to catch criminals riddle levered himself away from the cabinet with his elbow and leaned forward palms flat on the desk facing banks his pate seemed to be pulsing on red alert dont be bloody clever with me man ive got my eye on you one false move one more slip the slightest error of judgment and youre finished understand ill have you back in traffic very well sir said banks does that mean you want me off the case riddle moved back to the filing cabinet and smiled flicking a piece of imaginary fluff from his lapel off the case you should be so lucky no banks im going to leave your chestnuts in the fire a bit longer so what exactly is it that you want sir for a start i want you to start behaving like a dci instead of a bloody probational dc and i want to be informed before you make any move thats likely to to embarrass the force in any way any move is that clear the last bit is sir but what i mean riddle said pacing and poking at things again is that as an experienced senior police officer your input might be useful but let your underlings do the legwork let them go gallivanting off to leeds chasing wild geese dont think i dont know why you grab every opportunity to bugger off to leeds banks looked riddle in the eye and why is that sir that woman the musician and dont tell me you dont know who im talking about i know exactly who youre talking about sir her names pamela jeffreys and she plays viola in the english northern philharmonia riddle waved his hand impatiently whatever im sure you think your private life is none of my business but it is when you use the forces time to live it banks thought for a moment before answering this was way out of order riddle was practically accusing him of having an affair with pamela jeffreys and of driving to leeds during working hours for assignations with her it was untrue of course but any denial at this point would only strengthen riddles conviction banks wasnt sure of the actual guidelines but he felt this sort of behavior far exceeded the chief constables authority it was a personal attack despite the cavil about abusing the forces time but what could he do it was his word against riddles and riddle was the cc so he took it filed it away said nothing and determined to get his own back on the bastard one day what would you like me to do then sir he asked sit in your office smoke yourself silly and read reports the way youre supposed to and stay away from the media leave them to superintendent gristhorpe and myself banks cringed he hated it when people used myself instead of plain old me he stubbed out his cigarette i havent been anywhere near the media sir well make sure you dont you want me to sit and read reports thats it riddle stopped prowling a moment and faced banks for heavens sake man youre a dci youre not supposed to be gadding off all over the place interviewing people coordinate there are plenty more important tasks for you to carry out right here in your office sir what about the new budget for a start you know these days weve got to be accountable for every penny we spend and its about time the annual policing plan was prepared for next year then theres the crime statistics why is it that when the rest of the countrys experiencing a drop north yorkshires on the rise hey these are the sort of questions you should be addressing not driving off to leeds and treading on peoples toes wait a minute sir said banks whose toes dont tell me neville motcombes in the lodge as well as soon as the words were out banks regretted them it was all very well to want his own back on riddle but this wasnt the way to do it he was surprised when riddle simply stopped his tirade and asked who the hells neville motcombe when hes at home banks hesitated having put his foot in his mouth how could he avoid not shoving it down as far as his lower intestine and did he care hes an associate of jason foxs one of the people i was talking to in leeds yesterday what does this motcombe have to do with the lads death if anything banks shook his head i dont know that he does its just that his name came up in the course of our inquiries and riddle began pacing again dont flannel me banks i understand this jason fox belonged to some rightwing racist movement is that true yes sir the albion league riddle stopped and narrowed his eyes would this neville motcombe have anything to do with the albion league no flies on jimmy riddle actually banks said hes their leader riddle said nothing for a moment then he went back and resumed his pose at the filing cabinet does this have anything to do with the jason fox case at all or are you just tilting at windmills as usual i honestly dont know banks said its what im trying to find out it might have given george and his pals a motive to attack jason have you any proof at all that the three asians knew jason fox belonged to this albion league no but i did find out that jason knew george mahmood its a start its bloody nothing is what it is were still digging riddle sighed have you got any real suspects at all the asians are still our best bet the lab hasnt identified the stuff on georges trainers yet because there are so many contaminating factors but they still havent discounted its being blood hmm what about the other lad the one who was supposed to be with jason fox in the pub were still looking for him any idea who he is yet no sir that was another thing i well bloody well find out and quickly riddle strode toward the door and remember what i said which bit would that be sir about tending to your duties as a dci so you want me to find out who jasons pal was at the same time as im reading reports on budgets and crime statistics you know what i mean banks dont be so bloody literal delegate and he walked out slamming the door behind him banks breathed a sigh of relief too soon the door opened again riddle put his head round pointed his finger at banks wagged it and said and whatever you might think of me banks dont you ever dare imply again that i or any of my fellow masons fraternize with fascists is that clear yes sir said banks as the door closed again fraternize with fascists indeed he had to admit it had a nice ring to it must be the alliteration in the peace and silence following riddles withdrawal banks sipped his coffee and mulled over what hed been told he knew riddle had a point about the way he did his job and that certainly didnt make him feel any better as a dci he should be more involved in the administrative and managerial aspects of policing he should spend more time at his desk except that wasnt what he wanted when he had been a di on the met and got promoted to dci on transferring to eastvale it was on the understanding given by both detective superintendent gristhorpe and chief constable hemmings jimmy riddles predecessor that he was to take an active part as investigating officer in important cases even the assistant chief constable crime also since retired had agreed to that recently when the powers that be had considered abolishing the rank of chief inspector banks was ready to revert to inspector at the same pay rather than try for superintendent where he was far more likely to be deskbound but it had never happened the only rank to be abolished was that of deputy chief constable now jimmy riddle wanted to tie him to his desk anyway what could he do was it really time for another move but he didnt have time to think about these matters for very long not more than two minutes after riddle had left the phone rang iii susan arrived ten minutes late for lunch at the queens arms where the object was to discuss leads and feelings about the jason fox case over a drink and a pub lunch an informal brainstorming session banks and hatchley were already ensconced at a dimpled coppertopped table between the fireplace and the window when susan hurried in they were both looking particularly glum she noticed she stopped at the bar and ordered a st clements and a salad sandwich then joined the others at the table hatchley had an almostempty pint glass in front of him while banks was staring gloomily into a half they scraped their chairs aside to make room for her sorry im late sir she said banks shrugged no problem we went ahead and ordered without you if you want something its all right sir theyre doing me a sandwich susan glanced from one to the other excuse me if im being thick or something but it cant be the weather thats making your faces as long as a wet sunday afternoon is something wrong i feel as if ive walked in on a wake in a way you have said banks he lit a cigarette you know frank hepplethwaite jasons granddad yes at least i know who he is was i just got a call from the halifax police he dropped dead at jasons funeral what of heart attack oh no said susan she had never met the old man but she knew banks had been impressed with him and that was enough for her what happened motcombe brought nine or ten of his blackshirts to the graveside and frank took umbrage made a run at them he was dead before his granddaughter could get them to back off so they killed him you could say that banks glanced sideways at hatchley who drained his pint shook his head slowly and went to the bar for another banks declined his offer of a second half smoke from his cigarette drifted perilously close to susans nose she waved her hand in the air to waft it away sorry said banks it doesnt matter look sir im having a bit of trouble understanding all this it sounds like manslaughter to me are we pressing charges against motcombe or not banks shook his head its west yorkshires patch and theyre not why not because frank hepplethwaite attacked motcombe and his lot were merely defending themselves ten of them against an old man with a bad heart thats not on sir i know said banks but apparently they didnt punch or kick him they just pushed him away they were protecting themselves from him it still sounds like manslaughter west yorkshire dont think they can get the cps to prosecute the crown prosecution service as susan knew were wellknown for their conservative attitude toward pursuing criminal cases through the courts so motcombe and his bully boys just walk away scotfree thats it hatchley returned from the bar at almost the same time glenys the landlords wife appeared with the food susans sandwich plaice and chips for hatchley and a thick wedge of game pie for banks not exactly said banks stubbing out his cigarette at least not immediately they were taken in for questioning their argument was that they were simply attending the funeral of a fallen comrade when this madman started attacking them and they were forced to push him away to protect themselves the fact that frank was an old man didnt make a lot of difference to the charges or lack of them some old men are pretty tough and they didnt know he had a bad heart isnt there anything we can do susan turned to hatchley he shook his head piece of breaded plaice on his fork in midair it doesnt look like it then he glanced at banks who looked up from his pie and nodded it gets worse hatchley went on were in no position to charge motcombe it seems but motcombe has brought assault charges against maureen fox jasons sister it seems she attacked him and his mates with a heavy plank she picked up from the graveside and cracked a couple of heads open including motcombes susans jaw dropped and theyre charging her aye said hatchley i shouldnt imagine much will come of it but its exactly the kind of insult motcombe and his sort like to throw at people and at the justice system banks added there were times susan had to admit when she hadnt much stomach for the justice system even though she knew it was probably the best in the world justice is always imperfect and it was a lot more imperfect in many other countries even so once in a while something came along to outrage even what she thought was her seasoned coppers view all she could do was shake her head and bite on her salad sandwich in the background the cash register chinked and a couple of shop workers on their lunch break laughed at a joke someone won a few tokens on the fruit machine any more good news susan asked aye said hatchley the lab finally got back to us on that stuff they found on george mahmoods trainers and animal blood must have stepped on a dead spuggy or summat while he was crossing the rec well susan said this is all very depressing but i think ive got at least one piece of good news banks raised his eyebrows susan explained about the message she had left with the foxwood designs page thats why i was late she said when i first checked the reply hadnt come through so i thought id give it just a few minutes more and try again and said banks and were in luck well its a start anyway susan brought the folded sheet of paper out of her briefcase and laid it on the table banks and hatchley leaned forward to read the blackedged message dear valued customer many thanks for your interest in the work of foxwood designs unfortunately we have had to suspend business for the time being due to bereavement we hope you will be patient and bring your business to us in the near future and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you yours sincerely mark wood mark wood so weve got a name said banks susan nodded as i said its not much but its a place to start this could be the lad who was with jason in the jubilee at the very least hes jasons business partner he ought to know something maybe said banks but he still might prove to have nothing to do with the case at all but dont you think its a bit fishy that he hasnt come forward yet no matter who he is yes said banks but liza williams didnt come forward either jasons neighbor in rawdon she didnt see any reason to nor did motcombe well sir susan went on i still think we should try and find him as soon as possible oh i agree banks reached for his briefcase dont mind me susan im just a bit down in the dumps about what happened to frank hepplethwaite susan nodded i understand anyway banks went on theres one thing we can check for a start i got a fax from ken blackstone listing motcombes properties and tenants i havent had time to have a good look at it yet he pulled the sheets of paper out and glanced over them seems motcombe owns a fair bit of property he said after a few moments four houses in addition to his own two of them divided into flats and bedsits the semi where jason fox lived and a shop with a flat above it in bramley he also owns the old grocers shop where the albion league operates from as we thought finally a few seconds later he shook his head in disappointment theres no mark wood listed among the tenants maybe that would have been too easy i wonder where motcombe got his money from susan said members dues hatchley chipped in hardly likely said banks with a grim smile maybe he inherited it ill get in touch with ken again see if he can work up some more background on mr motcombe for us you dont really think he did it do you susan asked kill jason honestly no for a start he doesnt seem to have a motive and even if he did have something to do with it he certainly didnt do it himself i doubt hes got the bottle or the strength remember jason was a pretty tough customer but lets have a closer look at him anyway i dont like the bastard or what he stands for so any grief we can give him is fine with me even a traffic offense besides id look a right prat if we overlooked something obvious wouldnt i and thats the last thing i need right now the chief constable susan ventured banks nodded himself in the flesh so id better get back to my desk and coordinate iv banks felt boneweary when he arrived home that evening shortly after six oclock he was still upset about frank hepplethwaites senseless death his runin with jimmy riddle was still niggling him and the lack of progress in the jason fox case was sapping his confidence well hed done the best he could so far if only the lab boys or vic manson could come through with something sandra wasnt home in a way that made him feel relieved he didnt think he could deal with another argument right now or the cold shoulder he made himself a cheese omelet there wasnt any real cheese in the fridge so he used a processed slice it tasted fine shortly after eight when banks was relaxing with così fan tutte and a small laphroaig sandra got back anxious to avoid another scene banks turned the volume on the stereo very low but sandra didnt seem to notice the opera playing softly in the background at least she didnt say anything she seemed distracted banks thought as he tried to engage her in conversation about the day when he offered to take her out for a bite to eat the omelet not having filled him up nearly as much as hed hoped she said shed already eaten with a couple of friends after the arts committee meeting and she wasnt hungry all bankss conversational gambits fell on deaf ears even his story of jimmy riddles bollocking failed to gain an ounce of sympathy finally he turned to her and said whats wrong is this because of the other night are you still pissed off at me about that sandra shook her head the blond tresses danced over her shoulders im not pissed off she said that kind of thing is always happening with us thats the real problem dont tell me you havent noticed how little we see of one another these days how we both seem to go our separate ways have our separate interests how little we seem to have in common especially now tracys gone banks shrugged its only been a couple of weeks he said ive been busy so have you give it time i know but thats not it were always busy what do you mean work yours mine oh thats not the real problem weve always been able to deal with that before youve never expected a dutiful little wife staying at home all day cooking and cleaning ironing sewing buttons on and i thank you for that but even thats not it she took one of his cigarettes something she did so rarely these days that the gesture worried him ive been thinking a lot since the other night and i suppose what im saying is that i feel alone i mean in the relationship i just dont feel im part of your life anymore or that youre part of mine but thats absurd is it is it really she looked at him frowning black eyebrows crooked in the furrow of her brow then she shook her head slowly i dont think it is alan what was saturday all about then and the other night i think if youre honest with yourself youll agree this house feels empty cold it doesnt feel like a home it feels like the kind of place that two people living separate lives use to sleep and eat in occasionally passing one another on the landing and saying hello maybe stopping for a quick fuck if theyve got time thats not fair and you know it i think youre just feeling depressed because both the kids have grown up and flown the coop itll take time to get used to next thing youll be saying im feeling this way because its that time of the month said sandra but youre wrong its not that either she thumped her fist on the arm of the chair youre not listening to me you never really listen to me i am listening but im not sure i understand what im hearing are you sure this isnt still about last saturday no its not about last bloody saturday yes all right i admit i was angry i thought for once you might just forsake your sacred bloody opera to do something that i thought was important something for my career but you didnt fine and then the other night you go and put your opera on the stereo but youve always been selfish selfishness i can deal with this is something else what what ive been trying to tell you were both independent people always thats why our marriage worked so well i wasnt waiting and fretting at home for you to come back from work worrying that your dinner might get cold worrying that something might have happened to you though lord knows that was something i never could put out of my mind even though i tried not to let on to you too much and if i was out and there was no dinner if your shirt wasnt ironed you never complained you did it yourself not very well maybe but you did it i still dont complain when dinners not ready i made a bloody processedcheese omel sandra held her hand up let me finish alan cant you see whats happened what used to be our strength our independence now its driving us apart weve led separate lives for so long we take it for granted thats how a relationship should be as long as youve got your work your music your books and the occasional evening with the lads at the queens arms then youre perfectly happy and what about you are you happy with your gallery your photography your committee meetings your social evenings sandra paused a long time long enough for banks to pour them both a stiff laphroaig before she answered yes she said finally in a soft voice thats just it yes maybe i am for a while ive been thinking theyre all i do have you just havent been here alan not as a real factor banks felt as if a hand made of ice had slid across his heart it was such a palpable sensation that he put his hand to his chest is there someone else he asked on the stereo fiordiligi was singing quietly about being as firm as a rock suddenly sandra smiled reached out and ran her hand over his hair oh you sweet silly man she said no theres no one else then her eyes clouded and turned distant there could have been perhaps but there isnt she shrugged as if to cast off a painful memory banks swallowed then what she paused as i said ive been thinking about it a lot lately and ive come to the conclusion that we should go our separate ways at least for a while she reached forward and held his hand as she spoke which seemed to him like the smile an outofplace gesture what the hell was wrong banks snatched his hand back you cant be serious he said weve been married over twenty years and all of a sudden you just decide to up and walk out but i am serious and its not all of a sudden think about it youll agree this has been building up for a long time alan we hardly ever see one another anyway why continue living a lie you know im right banks shook his head no i dont i still think youre overreacting to tracys leaving and to saturday night give it a little time maybe a holiday he sat forward and took her hand now it felt limp and clammy when this case is over lets take a holiday just you and me we could go to paris for a few days or somewhere warm back to rhodes maybe he could see tears in her eyes alan youre not listening to me youre making this really difficult you know ive been trying to pluck up courage to say this for weeks now its not something ive just come up with on the spur of the moment a holidays not going to solve our problems she sniffled and ran the back of her hand under her nose oh bugger she said look at me now i didnt want this to happen she grabbed his hand and gripped it tightly again this time he didnt snatch it away he didnt know what to say the icy touch was back and now it seemed to be creeping into his bones and inner organs im going away for a while sandra said its the only way the only way both of us can get a chance to think things over where are you going my parents mums arthritis is playing her up again and shell appreciate an extra pair of hands around the place but thats not the reason we need time apart alan time to decide whether theres anything left to salvage or not so this is just a temporary separation you have in mind i dont know a few weeks anyway i just know i need to get away from the house from eastvale from you what about the community center your work jane can take over for a while till i decide what to do then you might not come back alan im telling you i dont know i dont know what to do dont make it harder for me im at my wits end already the only sensible thing is for me to get away then after a while we can talk about it decide where we want to go next why cant we talk now because its all too close here thats why pressing in on me please believe me i dont want to hurt you im scared but weve got to do it its the only chance weve got we cant go on like this for crying out loud were both still young too bloody young to settle for anything less than the best banks sipped more laphroaig but it failed to warm the icy hand now busy caressing the inside of his spine when are you going he asked his voice curiously flat sandra avoided his eyes as soon as possible tomorrow banks sighed in the silence he heard the letter box open and close odd at that time of night it seemed like a good excuse to get out of the room for a moment before he started crying himself or said things he would regret so he went to see what it was on the mat lay an envelope with his name typed on the front he opened the door but it was quiet outside in the street and there was no one in sight he opened the envelope inside he found a plane ticket from leeds and bradford airport to amsterdam schiphol leaving late the following morning a reservation for a hotel on keizersgracht and a single sheet of paper on which were typed the words jason fox shhhhh eight i the dutch coast came into view first the dullbrown sandbars where the gray sea ended in a long white thread then the dikes marking off the reclaimed land protecting it from the water level banks turned off his walkman in the middle of stop breaking down he always listened to loud music when flying which wasnt very often because it was the only thing he could hear over the roar of the engines and he hadnt played exile on main street in so long hed forgotten just how good it was the rolling stones raucous rhythm and blues he found also had the added advantage of blocking out depressing thoughts the plane banked lower over the patchwork of green and brown fields and banks could soon make out cars on the long straight roads rooftops glinting in the midday sun it was as lovely an autumn day in the netherlands as it had been in yorkshire banks rubbed his eyes he had spent a sleepless night in brians room because sandra had insisted it would only make things more difficult if they slept together she was right he knew but still it rankled it wasnt even a matter of sex somehow it seemed so unfair when threatened with the loss of someone you had loved for over twenty years that you didnt even get that one last night of warmth and companionship together to remember and cherish it felt like all the things you had left unsaid when someone died no matter how long sandra said that she had been grappling with the problem her decision had come as a shock to banks perhaps as she had argued that was a measure of how much he had turned his back drifted away from the relationship but somehow her words didnt soften the blow now more than anything he felt numb a pathetic figure floating around in zero gravity when he thought of sandra he thought mostly of the early days in london where they lived together for about a year before they got married it was the midseventies banks was just finishing his business diploma already thinking about joining the police and sandra was taking a secretarial course every sunday if he didnt have to work they went on long walks around the city and its parks sandra practicing her photography and banks developing his coppers eye for suspicious characters somehow in his memory it was always autumn on these walks sunny but cool with the leaves crackling underfoot and when they got back to the tiny notting hill flat theyd play music laugh talk drink wine and make love then came marriage children financial responsibilities and a career that demanded more and more of bankss time and energy most of his friends on the force were divorced before the seventies were over and they all asked in wonder and envy how he and sandra managed to survive he didnt really know but he put a lot of it down to his wifes independent spirit sandra was right about that she wasnt the kind of person who simply hung around the house and waited for him to turn up fretting and getting angrier by the minute as the dinner was ruined and the kids screamed for bedtime stories from daddy sandra went her own way she had her own interests and her own circle of friends naturally more responsibility for the children fell on her shoulders because banks was hardly ever home but she never complained and for a long time it worked after bankss near burnout on the met and a long rocky patch in the marriage they moved to eastvale where banks thought things would settle down and the two of them would enjoy a rural peaceful and loving drift into middle age together the kind of thing that most couples married as long as they had been experience wrong he looked at his watch sandra would be on the train to croydon now and whatever happened whatever she finally decided things would never be the same between them again and there was nothing he could do about it not a damn thing he picked up that mornings yorkshire post from the empty seat beside him and looked at the headline again world war two hero dies at grandsons funeral neonazis responsible says granddaughter there was no photograph but the basic facts were there the nazi salute frank hepplethwaites attack maureen foxs spirited defense all in all it made depressing reading and then there was the brief sidebar interview with motcombe himself motcombe deeply regretted the pointless death of war hero frank hepplethwaite he began while pointing out how ironic it was that the poor man had died attacking the only people who dared demand justice for his grandsons killers naturally on further thought neither he nor any member of his organization had any intention of pursuing charges against maureen fox even though the head wound she gave him required five stitches things had just got out of hand in the heat of the moment and he could quite understand her attacking him and his friends with a plank grief makes people behave irrationally he allowed of course motcombe went on everyone knew who had killed jason fox and everyone also knew why the police were powerless to act that was just the state of things these days he was sympathetic but unless the government finally decided to act and do something about immigration then jason was a martyr of the struggle every true englishman should honor him if more people listened to motcombes ideas then things could only change for the better the reporter to give her due credit had managed to stop motcombe from turning the entire interview into propaganda either that or the copy editor had made extensive cuts even so it made banks want to puke if anyone was the martyr in this it was frank hepplethwaite frank reminded banks of his own father in many ways both had fought in the war and neither spoke very much about it their racial attitudes were much the same too bankss father might complain about immigrants taking over the country changing the world he has known all his life making it suddenly alien and unfamiliar threatening even and in the same way frank might have let slip a remark about a tightfisted jew but when it came down to it if anyone needed help black or jewish bankss dad would have been first in line with frank hepplethwaite probably a close second as unacceptable as even these racial attitudes were banks thought they were a hell of a long way from those held by neville motcombe and his like bankss dads view like franks was based on ignorance and anxiety on fear of change not on hatred perhaps in motcombes case the hatred sprang from an initial fear but in most people it never went that far just like a lot of people have bad childhoods but they dont all become serial murderers the wheels bumped on the runway and soon banks was drifting into the arrivals hall with the crowds he was traveling light with only one holdall so he didnt have to wait at the baggage claim the place was like a small city bustling with commerce complete with its shops bank post office and touristinformation desk a colleague had told him a while ago that even pornography was on sale openly at schiphol he had neither the time nor the inclination to look for it the first thing banks needed when he got off a plane alive was a cigarette he followed the signs to the bus stop and found he had a fifteenminute wait perfect he enjoyed a leisurely smoke then got on the bus soon it was speeding along the motorway under grids of electrical wires and tall street lamps the excitement of arrival pushed bankss problems into the background for the moment and he began to take some pleasure in his rebellion his little act of irresponsibility so that no one would feel he had disappeared completely into thin air he had rung susan gay and told her he was taking the weekend off to go to amsterdam and should be back sometime monday susan had sounded puzzled and surprised but she had made no comment what could she say anyway banks was her boss now as the bus sped toward the city center he began to savor the coming hours whatever they might bring it could hardly be worse than life in eastvale right now he had been to amsterdam once before with sandra one summer when they were both between college and jobs he remembered the bicycles canals trams and houseboats the place was full of leftover sixties spirit back then and they had tried it all while they could the paradiso the milky way the vondelpark the drugs well marijuana at least as well as taking in all the museums and the tourist sights stationsplein looked much the same the air was warm tinged only faintly with the baddrains smell from the canals trams clanked about in all directions a perspexcovered boat set off on its canal tour arrows of ripples hit the stone quay mixed with the lateseason tourists and ordinary folk were all the posthippie youth styles punk spikes a green mohawk studded leather vests short bleached hair earrings nose rings pierced eyebrows banks found the taxi rank nearby he would have liked to walk after being cooped up on the plane and the bus but he hadnt got his bearings yet he didnt even know how to get to the hotel or how far it was the taxi was clean and the driver seemed to recognize the name of the hotel soon he had negotiated his way out of the square and they were heading along a broad busy street lined with trees arcades shops and cafés the pavements were crowded with tourists even in early october and banks noticed that some of the cafés and restaurants had tables out on the street he opened the window a little and the smell of freshbrewed coffee came in god it was like a summers day the driver turned crossed a picturesque bridge then continued along one of the canals finally after a few more turns he pulled up in front of the hotel on keizersgracht banks paid what seemed like an exorbitant amount of guilders for such a short trip then hefted his holdall out of the boot he looked up at the unbroken row of buildings in front of him the hotel was small and narrow about six floors high with a yellow sandstone facade and a gabled roof it was wedged in a long terrace of uneven seventeenth and eighteenthcentury buildings that had once banks guessed probably been merchants houses some were built of red brick some of stone some had been painted black or gray some had gables some had flat roofs all of them seemed to have plenty of windows banks dodged a couple of cyclists and walked into the hotel lobby the man at the desk spoke good english banks remembered from his previous trip that most people spoke good english in amsterdam they had to do after all how many english people bothered to learn dutch yes the man said his room was ready and he was delighted to be able to offer a canal view breakfast would be served in the groundfloor lounge between seven oclock and nine he was sorry that the hotel had no bar of its own but there were plenty of fine establishments within a short walking distance he hoped mr banks would be comfortable when banks pulled out his credit card the clerk waved it away telling him the room was fully paid for until monday morning banks tried to discover who had paid for it but the clerk became extremely coy and his english went downhill fast banks gave up then the clerk handed him a message a single sheet of paper bearing a typed message that read de kuypers hr banks asked what de kuypers meant and was told it was a brown café a sort of dutch local pub about a hundred meters to his left along the canal it was on a quiet street corner and would probably have a few tables outside a very nice place he couldnt miss it the room was a gabled attic up five flights of narrow stairs when banks got there he was panting and beads of sweat had broken out on his forehead though there was hardly room to swing a dead cat and the bed was tiny the room was clean with black timber beams and pale blue wallpaper it smelled pleasantly of lemon air freshener a blue ashtray stood on the bedside table beside the reading light and telephone there were also a small television set and en suite facilities the canal view more than made up for any inadequacies banks particularly liked the way the ceiling and the blackpainted beams sloped down toward the gabled window drawing the eye to its perspective and sure enough he looked down on keizersgracht and the tall elegant facades of the buildings opposite the room was a little too warm and stuffy so he opened the window letting in hints of distant street sounds he looked at his watch just after two plenty of time for a shower and a nap before the mystery meeting but first he headed for the telephone there was always a chance that sandra had changed her mind ii susan gay was worried about banks kicking her heels back in her office with black coffee and a soverysinful kitkat she thought about the brief puzzling phone call what the hell did he think he was doing taking a few days off in the middle of a major investigation just when they were getting close to tracking down mark wood all right so it was the weekend or almost but didnt he know that jimmy riddle would go spare if he found out even superintendent gristhorpe would be annoyed there had to be more to it the way he had sounded on the phone bothered her abrupt distracted not like him at all was it the amsterdam thing is that what had him so worried was there some danger involved or something illegal banks didnt often act outside the law not like some coppers susan had known but he did sometimes they all did if he felt there was no other way was he up to something well she concluded she didnt know and there was probably no way of finding out until he got back and revealed all if he did until then the best thing to do was get on with her work and stop behaving like a mother hen she hadnt had a lot of luck tracking mark wood down so far it would take her forever to check out all the listings in the telephone directory even then he might not live in the leeds area or have a telephone sergeant hatchley was in leeds today with one of his old cronies from millgarth visiting the properties motcombe owned maybe they would turn up something but she doubted it she was just about to pick up the phone and start dialing down her list when it rang is that dc gay the voice said susan yes she didnt know who it was its vic here vic manson from fingerprints ah of course sorry i didnt recognize your voice for a moment hows it going i was trying to call alan but apparently hes not in his office all i could get at home was his answering machine do you know where he is im afraid he wont be in at all today not ill i trust can i help vic yes yes of course do you know much about fingerprints not a lot have you got some news well yes in a way though its not very good im afraid not as good as id hoped for im listening right well when i talked to alan earlier in the week i was testing the glass from the broken bottle found near jason foxs body i remember susan said he said something about spraying it with superglue in an aquarium manson laughed yes cyanoacrylate fuming as a matter of fact ill take your word for it yes well im sorry but it didnt work we found nothing on the glass probably because of the rain and thats it not entirely do you know anything at all about ninhydrin isnt it a chemical for getting prints from paper sort of yes what ninhydrin does is it makes visible the amino acids you deposit with sweaty fingers especially on paper i see but i thought we were concerned with glass here vic not paper ah yes said manson we were that is until it got us nowhere but i found a couple of fragments of glass that were also covered by part of the label and luckily two of them were under the body label side up but not touching the victims clothing quite protected from the rain amino acids are watersoluble you see anyway i dont want to get too technical about it but it took a long time and i destroyed one fragment completely but after i brought a smudge or two out with ninhydrin treatment i was able to get much better ridge detail under laser light you got a fingerprint now hold on wait a minute said manson i told you from the start its not a major breakthrough what i got was a partial fingerprint very partial even with computer enhancement i couldnt do a hell of a lot more with it and remember any number of people could have handled that bottle the cellarman the landlord the bartender anyone so youre saying its worthless not completely oh it certainly wouldnt stand up in a court of law not enough points of comparison i mean it could almost be mine at a pinch well i exaggerate but you see what i mean yes said susan disappointed she began to feel impatient has this got us anywhere at all well manson went on i ran it through the new computerized matching system and i got a list of possibles i confined the search to yorkshire and of course it only applies to people whose prints we have on file and the print could belong to any person on the list technically yes at least as far as court evidence is concerned im sorry i can send it over anyway if youd like just a minute said susan feeling her pulse quicken a little do you have it in front of you the list yes lets try a hunch could you check for a name of course try wood mark wood it was worth a try susan could hear her heart beating fast in the silence that followed finally after what seemed like a millennium manson said yes yes there is a mark wood i dont have all the details here of course but west yorkshire have probably got a file on him west yorkshire yes thats where he lives castleford area if hes still at the same address that is youve got the address yes he read it out to her and let me guess susan said he was convicted for football hooliganism or some sort of racial incident er no actually said manson what then drugs drugs susan repeated interesting thanks a lot vic no problem and tell alan i called will you susan smiled will do although vic manson said the evidence wouldnt stand up in court that didnt matter to susan at the moment the link between the partial print on the beer bottle and jason foxs webpage design partner was just too strong to be coincidence at first susan had thought the other lad must have either run away or left jason before the attack now though the picture looked very different indeed maybe they couldnt convict mark wood on the basis of the fingerprint but they could try for a confession or some sort of physical evidence for a start the people in the jubilee should be able to identify him but first susan thought reaching for her jacket and her mobile they would have to find him already she was feeling tremors of excitement the thrill of the chase and she was damned if she was going to be stuck by herself in eastvale while sergeant hatchley had all the fun and glory iii with his hair still damp banks stepped out into the lateafternoon warmth sandra hadnt been home when he called hadnt changed her mind it was what he had expected really though he felt a tremendous sense of disappointment when all he got was his own voice on the answering machine after an hour or so spent listening to some mozart wind quintets on the walkman though followed by a long hot shower he started to feel more optimistic than he had on the plane sandra would come back eventually give her a few days at her parents to get over the tiff and then things would soon return to normal well almost theyd have a lot of talking to do a lot of sorting out but theyd manage it they always had as he walked onto keizersgracht he still had that disconnected feeling he had experienced on arriving as if all this canal bicycles houseboats were somehow not quite real not connected with his life at all could he be living some sort of parallel existence he wondered another life going on at the same time as he was back in eastvale talking over the future with sandra or was he timetraveling after feeling as if hed been away for a year would he suddenly find himself back in eastvale only seconds after he had left or worse would he land back right in the middle of that terrible conversation last night moments before the magic envelope arrived he tried to shake off the feeling as he admired the facades of the old buildings along the canal rows of bicycles were parked on the stone quay and a couple of small houseboats were moored nearby that must be an interesting existence banks thought living on the water maybe hed try it now he was a free agent once again he supposed he could do whatever he wanted live where he pleased as long as he had a source of income of course still there was always europol or interpol the sun had disappeared behind a gauze of cloud giving a slightly hazy misty effect to the light it was still warm though and he slung his jacket over his shoulder as he walked two pretty young girls passed him by students by the look of them and the one with long hennaed hair smiled definitely a flirtatious smile banks felt absurdly flattered and pleased with himself as well as a bit embarrassed here he was in his early forties and young girls were still giving him the eye he supposed he must look young enough despite the hint of gray at the temples of his closely cropped black hair and he knew he was in fairly good shape for his age still lean in physique with the suggestion of wiry compact strength casually dressed in jeans trainers and a light blue denim shirt he probably seemed younger than he was and while his rather long sharply angled face was not handsome in any regular sense of the word it was the kind of face women seemed to notice sandra had always said it was because of his lively striking dark blue eyes he reached a small stone bridge with black iron railings a flower vendor stood at the corner and the musky scent of roses filled the air it took him back to a vivid memory the way smells do something to do with one of his walks with sandra many years ago but he cut it off he stood for a moment leaning on the railings and looking down into the murky water with its floating chocolate wrappers and cigarette packets scattered among the rainbows of diesel oil then took a deep breath and turned back to the street there was the pub de kuypers right on the corner as the desk clerk had said it had an exterior of dark brown wood and smoked plateglass windows with the name painted in large white letters a few small round tables stood outside all empty at the moment banks glanced inside the dark woodpaneled bar saw no one he knew or who took any interest in him then went out again he patted his jacket pocket to make sure he had his cigarettes and wallet with him then slung it over the back of a chair and sat down he was early for the meeting as he had intended while he didnt really expect any danger not here in the open on a warm afternoon he wanted to be able to cover as many angles as possible his table was perfect for that from where he sat he could see all the way along the curving canal past the hotel he had walked from and a fair distance in the other direction too he also had a clear view of the opposite bank somewhere in the distance he could hear an organgrinder when the whiteaproned waiter came by banks ordered a bottle of de koninck a dark belgian beer he had tried and enjoyed once at belgo a london restaurant with the beer in front of him he lit a cigarette and settled back to wait watching the people walk to and fro laughing and talking along the canal he already had his suspicions about who would turn up as it happened he didnt have long to wait he had just lit his second cigarette and worked about halfway through the beer when he noticed someone out of the corner of his eye coming down the narrow side street it was a familiar figure and banks congratulated himself for getting it right none other than detective superintendent richard dirty dick burgess in the flesh a little more flesh than on their previous meeting by the look of it most of it on his gut and his hair was now almost as gray as his cynical eyes burgess worked for special branch or something very close to it and whenever he appeared on the scene banks knew there would be complications banks me old cock sparrow said burgess putting on the cockney accent banks knew hed lost years ago then he clapped banks on the back and took a chair mind if i join you iv a steady drizzle had settled in by the time susan passed the garforth exit and she had to switch on her windscreen wipers to clean off all the muck the lorries churned up castleford wasnt far though and soon the enormous cooling towers of ferrybridge power station came into sight she found the road to ferry fryston without much trouble and pulling over into the car park of a large pub to consult her map pinpointed the street she was looking for mark wood lived in a prefab on one of the earlypostwar council estates these were houses mostly semis or short terrace blocks built of concrete prefabricated in the factory then assembled on the site in this area they were built originally to house colliery workers but since all the local pits had been closed during the thatcher years they were up for grabs a source of cheap housing the houses themselves werent up to much they had no central heating and the walls were damp in the rain susan thought the concrete looked like porridge susan negotiated her way through the maze of avenues rises terraces and drives which curved and looped in great profusion then she spotted hatchleys darkgreen astra just around the corner from woods house as they had arranged over the phone susan pulled up behind him turned off her engine then dashed over and jumped in beside him sorry if i kept you waiting sarge she said threecar accident near the york junction thats all right said hatchley stubbing out a cigarette in the already overstuffed ashtray just got here myself bugger of a place to find bugger of a place to live too if you ask me how shall we play it hatchley squirmed in his seat and ran his pudgy fingers under the back of his collar as if to loosen it why dont you start the questioning he said itll be good experience now youre going to be a sergeant ill jump in if i think its necessary fine said susan smiling to herself she knew that hatchley hated carrying out formal interviews unless he was talking either to an informant or a habitual criminal with wood they just didnt know yet so hatchley would let her lead then he would follow if she got somewhere interesting or fill in the gaps if she missed something as it turned out hatchley had even more reason for assigning the interview to susan when they knocked on the door a young woman opened it and hatchley was useless at interviewing women susan finessed their way inside easily enough showing her warrant card after learning that mark had just nipped out to the shop for some cigarettes and would be back in a few minutes good she thought it gave her a chance to talk to the girlfriend alone first inside the house was clean and tidy enough but susans sense of smell always sensitive reacted at once to the mingled baby odors warm milk mushy food and of course the whole mess when it all comes out transformed at the other end plus the kitty litter sure enough a blackandwhite cat prowled the room and a baby slept in its cot in the corner occasionally emitting a tiny sniffle or cry as if disturbed by dreams one of the walls was damp and the wallpaper was peeling off near the ceiling whats it all about the woman asked im shirelle marks wife that was susans first shock shirelle was afrocaribbean and she didnt look a day older than fourteen she was small in stature with a flat chest and slim hips and her pale brown face was framed by long braided black hair that cascaded over her shoulders looking at her sitting there in the worn old armchair it was hard to believe she was old enough to be a mother weve just a few questions to ask your mark love said susan in as reassuring a tone as she could manage when shirelle didnt answer she went on maybe you can help do you know jason fox she frowned no ive never met him mark mentioned him once or twice they work together but hes never brought him here im not surprised susan thought did mark ever tell you anything about him like what what hes like how they get on that sort of thing well i dont think mark likes him all that much they havent been working together for long and i think marks going to break with him apparently this jason has some peculiar ideas about immigrants and stuff you could say that again doesnt that bother you im not an immigrant i was born here how long have they been working together a few months how did they meet they were both doing a computer course in leeds at the same time and neither of them could get a job after i think this jason had a bit of money to put into starting a business mark was top of the class so jason asked if he wanted to join him like i say i dont think marks going to stick with him its just a start thats all its hard to get started when you dont have the experience hows the business doing susan asked shirelle looked around her and snorted what do you think hardly made enough to pay for this place and you can see what a dump it is now she neither looked nor sounded like a fourteenyearold the cat tried to climb on susans knee but she pushed it away its not that i dont like cats shirelle she said but im allergic to them shirelle nodded tina come here she said but the cat as cats do gave her a youmustbejoking look and ignored her finally shirelle shot forward scooped up tina and deposited her in the next room closing the door thanks said susan have you heard of the albion league shirelle shook her head whats that when its at home do you know where mark was last saturday night shirelle glanced away for just long enough that susan knew she was going to tell a lie why had her husband told her to or did she want to avoid trouble with the police with some people it was habitual whatever the reason as soon as she said he was here at home susan asked her to think carefully about her answer what time do you mean shirelle asked after a few moments hesitation because he might you know have nipped down the pub for a jar or two with his mates which pub would that be hare and hounds at the corner thats his local shirelle seemed distracted by sergeant hatchley who had said nothing so far but just sat next to susan on the sofa watching the whole proceedings still as a statue occasionally nodding encouragement and making a note in his black book she kept looking at him then turned her large frightened eyes away back to susan and if we were to ask there at this hare and hounds susan said then theyd remember mark from last saturday night would they i i dont at that moment the front door opened and a male voice called out sheri sheri then mark wood entered the room stocky build muscular short hair loop earring and all early twenties the man in the picture hello mark said susan weve been wanting a word with you ever since last saturday when mark saw susan and hatchley he stopped in his tracks and his jaw went slack who but it was obvious he knew who they were even if he hadnt been expecting them he put the packet of cigarettes on the table and sat in the other armchair what about he asked jason wed have thought you might have got in touch with us you know since jason died jason what shirelle burst in she looked at mark jasons dead you never told me that mark shrugged well susan asked well what what do you have to say even if your wife didnt know you knew jason was dead didnt you read about it in the paper but its nothing to do with me is it isnt it you were there mark you were in eastvale drinking with jason you left the jubilee with him shortly after closing time what we want to know is what happened next i was never there mark said i was here at home now weve got little connor i dont get out as much as i used to i cant just leave sheri alone with him all the time can i besides as you can probably tell were a bit short of the readies too ill bet you own a car though dont you just an old banger a van i need it for the business designing web pages thats not all we do we do a bit of retail refurbish systems set up networks troubleshoot that sort of thing so you havent been out dealing drugs for a while you know about that do you we do our research what do you expect mark shifted in his chair and shot a quick glance at shirelle yeah well it was years ago now its behind me ive been clean ever since were you selling drugs at the jubilee last saturday night no i told you i wasnt even there besides i served my time youre right said susan nine months if i read the record right its nice to know there really is such a thing as rehabilitation thats not what were interested in anyway all we care about is what happened to jason fox what about the albion league mark are you a member mark scoffed that bunch of wankers that was jasons thing not mine he looked at shirelle or isnt that obvious enough to you already did jason ever introduce you to their leader neville motcombe or any of the other members no he kept asking me to go to meetings but thats all i think he picked up that i wasnt really interested but the two of you produced the web page for them jason did that in his spare time by himself thought it was a good idea to put the companys logo at the bottom said it could bring us more business he shrugged business is business even if some of it does come from crackpots and did it did it what bring in more business nah not much to be honest i think hardly anyone even looked at it i mean would you but you were friends with jason too werent you i wouldnt really say that i understand he provided the capital to start the business mark looked at shirelle susan guessed he was probably trying to work out exactly what his wife had told them already yes he said i didnt have any money but jason put in a few hundred quid just to get us going only a loan mind you so you wouldnt say you were friends no its not as if we actually socialized together but you were socializing last saturday night in eastvale i told you i wasnt there i was here all evening didnt you even nip out for a jar susan asked shirelle here said she thought you might have done mark looked to his wife for guidance i i dont she said theyve been confusing me mark was it saturday i dont remember i only said he might have gone out for a few minutes did you go out mark susan repeated no said mark then he turned to shirelle dont you remember love when we went in town shopping in the afternoon we picked up a couple of bottles at the offie then we rented that steven seagal video and we just stayed in and watched it dont you remember oh yes thats right said shirelle yes i remember now we stayed in and watched a video together susan ignored shirelle she was lying again and she thought it interesting that no matter how poor people seemed how short of the readies they were they always had enough money for booze cigarettes videos and pets cars even so you werent in eastvale at all last saturday night then mark mark shook his head no i suppose the video rental shop will have a record i suppose so theyre computerized all the latest gear so they ought to i never asked i mean i didnt think anyone would be interested but you could still be lying couldnt you susan went on in fact it doesnt matter at all whether you rented a video on saturday afternoon or not does it you could have gone to eastvale on saturday evening met jason in the jubilee and booted him to death you could have watched the video after you got home i told you i didnt do anything of the sort i wasnt anywhere near there besides why would i do a thing like that i already told you jason was my business partner why would i kill the goose that lays the golden eggs you tell me i understand you were going to dump him again mark looked at shirelle who stared into her lap look he said im telling you i didnt do anything i wasnt anywhere near eastvale ive never even been there in my life suddenly hatchley lurched to his feet making even susan jump lets cut the bollocks lad he said putting his notebook back in his inside pocket we know you were there people saw you in the pub and weve got a clear set of your fingerprints on the murder weapon what have you got to say about that mark looked from side to side as if seeking an escape route shirelle started to cry oh mark she wailed what can we do shut up blubbering he said then turned back to susan and hatchley i want a lawyer later said hatchley first were going to fill a plastic bag with your shoes and clothes then were going to go back to eastvale for a nice long chat in a proper police interview room how do you feel about that mark said nothing connor stirred in his cot and started to cry v tell me one thing banks said why the hell have you dragged me all the way to amsterdam burgess smiled flipped open his tin of tom thumb cigars and selected one everything will be made clear in time shit its good to see you again banks he said i knew i could rely on your curiosity to get you here i cant think of a better man for a case like this he lit the small cigar and blew out a plume of smoke what case would that be asked banks who had learned over the years to trust burgess about as much as he would trust a politician in an election year oh dont be coy the jason fox case of course the waiter came out burgess asked banks what he was drinking banks told him hed have another de koninck filthy stuff said burgess then he turned to the waiter still bring him another one will you mate if thats what he wants ill have a lager whatever youve got on tap banks noticed for the first time that burgess had his graying hair pulled back and tied in a ponytail bloody typical the agingstud look beautiful day isnt it burgess said when the waiter came back with their drinks arent you glad i got you the ticket banks im overwhelmed with delight and gratitude said banks but i wouldnt mind knowing what its all about just a hint maybe to start with thats my banks burgess jerked forward all his motions seemed jerky and clapped him on the shoulder always anxious to get down to business you know you could have made super by now who knows even chief super if only you werent such a bolshie bastard you never did learn to be nice to the right people did you banks smiled and you did burgess winked i mustve done something right mustnt i anyway enough about me sometime earlier this week you or someone in your division set off an alarm bell id placed on a certain file the albion league whos a clever boy then yes the albion league i got a bloke called crawley good chap to answer and instructed him to give away as little as possible see i wanted to know why you were so interested in the league its not as if theyve got a big operation in north yorkshire after all then i found out about the jason fox killing and things sort of fell into place you knew jason was a member of course i bloody did he was neville motcombes righthand man hotly tipped for future führerdom himself now jason getting himself killed like that was a very bad thing because it set off all kinds of warning bells all over the place which is why im here you too a couple of young blond girls walked by one of them was wearing a tight tshirt and highcut turquoise shorts she was pushing her bicycle as she chatted with her friend jesus christ would you look at that ass said burgess lapsing into his habitual american slang gives me such a hardon i dont have enough skin left to close my eyes he gave a mock shudder anyway where was i warning bells yes i dont know how much you know about him banks but motcombe is a nasty piece of work just because hes a fucking fruitcake it doesnt mean you should underestimate him id have thought that you would have had every sympathy with him banks said in fact im surprised youre not a member of the albion league yourself burgess laughed oh what a cheap shot you know what banks youre so very predictable do you know that thats one of the reasons i like you ive been waiting for a remark like that ever since i sat down he settled back in his chair and puffed on his tom thumb do i think were letting too many foreigners in yes do i think weve got a problem with our immigration policy damn right i do but do i think a gang of goosestepping football hooligans are the answer no i dont look at this lot he waved his arm around as if to indicate the dutch in general look at the problems theyve had with their darkies and theyve only got dutch guiana to worry about suriname said banks whatever and i think youll find they also colonized a lot more of the world than just that listen banks stop being a bloody smartarse thats not the point and you know it you cant convince me that england wouldnt be a damn sight more civilized and lawabiding if we hadnt let so many of the buggers in to start with civilized and lawabiding as in football hooligans oh its no fucking use arguing with you is it got an answer for everything havent you let me put it in a nutshell while i think this albion league might have some pretty good ideas i dont like getting dressed up like an idiot and hanging around with skinheads and leatherfetishists without two brain cells to rub together between them credit me with a bit more sense than that banks whatever i am burgess concluded thrusting his thumb toward his chest i am not a fucking loony burgess was actually wearing his trademark scuffedup black leather jacket but banks let that one go by anyway burgess went on after a long swig of generic lager back to neville motcombe we know hes got connections with other rightwing groups in europe and america over the past four years hes traveled extensively in germany france spain italy and holland hes also been to greece and turkey i wouldnt have thought a neonazi would find much to interest him in turkey banks said youd be surprised there are plenty of rightwing turkish groups with access to arms get them cheap off the russians in azerbaijan or armenia very strategically located for lots of nasty things is turkey and dont forget johnny turks a slimy bastard anyway motcombe has also visited a number of militia training camps in the southwestern united states and hes been spotted entering the nazi party headquarters in lincoln nebraska that for your information is where most of the instructions on bombs and explosives come from so this guy has talked to the sort of people who blew up that government building in oklahoma city burgess pointed his cigar at banks whatever you do banks dont underestimate neville motcombe besides when you get right down to it this isnt really about politics at all theres something else what money one of the turkish rightwingers motcombe has been communicating with frequently of late via the internet is a suspected international drug dealer heroin mostly and we happen to know hes looking for new outlets in england they met when motcombe was in turkey during the summer and electronic traffic between them has increased dramatically over the past three weeks the wires are hot you might say what do these messages say ah well theres the problem our computer whizzes have been keeping an eye on these cybernazis as theyre called we know some of their passwords so we can read a fair bit of the traffic until they get on to us and change the passwords that is problem is some of the really hot stuff is encrypted they use pgp and even more advanced encryption programs i kid you not banks these things make enigma look like a fucking doddle so you cant decipher the messages well maybe theyre just chatting away about holocaust denial or some such rubbish we cant exactly decipher their messages but knowing the turk i doubt it id say hes found the pipeline he was looking for banks shook his head and jason fox he said do you think this could have something to do with his death burgess shrugged well its a bit of a coincidence isnt it and i know you dont like coincidences i thought you should be filled in thats all what a load of bollocks said banks and dont give me all this cloakanddagger shit encrypted email vague suspicions is this what you dragged me all this way for burgess looked offended no he said well not entirely as it happens i dont know much about it yet myself so why am i here because a very important person is here has to be here for at least a week because its essential you talk to this person before you go any further in your investigation and because it wouldnt do for you to be seen together back home believe me hell be able to tell you a lot more than i can good enough what about the telephone oh give me a break banks if they can eavesdrop on charlie and di they can bloody well eavesdrop on you telephones arent secure quit bellyaching and enjoy yourself it wont be all work i mean what are you complaining about youve got yourself a free weekend in one of the most exciting cities in the world okay banks thought for a moment watching the bicycles and cars passing by on the canal side he lit a cigarette so what happens next he said tomorrow afternoon i get uptodate on whats going on then im off on my holidays believe it or not i think ill just go out to schiphol and take the first flight somewhere tropical in the evening you have a very important meeting burgess told him to be at a bar near sarphatipark at eight oclock but not whom he would find when he got there and make sure youre not followed he added banks shook his head at the melodrama burgess just loved this cloakanddagger crap then burgess clapped his hands showering ash on the table but until then were free agents two happy bachelors and notice i didnt say gay with the whole night ahead of us he lowered his voice now what i suggest is that we find a nice little indonesian restaurant shovel down a plate or two of rijsttafel and swill that down with a few pints of lager then well see if we can find one of those little coffee shops where you can smoke hash he rested his arm over bankss shoulder and after that i suggest we take a stroll to the redlight district and get us some nice tight dutch pussy its all perfectly legal and aboveboard here you know and the girls have regular checkups tried and tested stamped prime grade a he turned to banks and squinted now i know youve got that lovely wife of yours waiting at home sandra isnt it but there really is nothing quite like a little strange pussy once in a while take my word and what she doesnt know wont hurt her my lips will be eternally sealed i can promise you that how about it as usual banks thought the bastard showed his unerring instinct for finding the spot that hurt like a dentist prodding at an exposed nerve there was no way burgess could know what had happened between banks and sandra the previous evening nobody knew but the two of them yet here he was right on the mark well to hell with him fine said banks youre on then he raised his glass and finished his beer but first i think ill have another one of these nine i im sorry we had to take you away from your wife and child mark said gristhorpe lets hope it wont be for long wood said nothing he just looked sullen and defiant anyway gristhorpe went on id like to thank you for sparing us the time he balanced a pair of reading glasses on his hooked nose and flipped through some sheets of paper in front of him glancing up over the top of his glasses from time to time theres just a few points wed like to get cleared up and we think you can help us ive already told you wood said i dont know anything susan sat next to gristhorpe in the interview room faded institutional green walls high barred window metal table and chairs bolted to the floor pervading odor of smoke sweat and urine susan was convinced they sprayed it in fresh every day two tape recorders were running making a soft hissing sound in the background it was dark outside by the time they actually got around to the interview gristhorpe had already given the caution wood had also phoned a solicitor in leeds giles varney and got his answering machine youd be lucky to find a lawyer at home on a friday evening in susans experience still he had left a message and steadfastly refused the duty solicitor hardly surprising susan thought given that giles varney was one of the bestknown solicitors in the county she would have thought he was way out of marks league yes said gristhorpe taking off his glasses and fingering the papers in front of him i know that thing is though that sometimes when people come into contact with the police they lie he shrugged and held his hands out palms up now i can understand that mark maybe they do it to protect themselves or maybe just because theyre afraid but they lie and it makes our job just that little bit more difficult im sorry i cant help you said wood good sign susan noted gristhorpe had the lad apologizing already now gristhorpe went on the last time you got into trouble you told the police that you had no idea the van you were driving was used for carrying drugs or that some of the people you were involved with were dealing drugs is that true do you mean is that what i said yes mark nodded yes and is the statement true mark grinned well of course it is its what i told the court isnt it a matter of public record its hardly my fault if the magistrate didnt believe me course not mark innocent people get convicted all the time its one of the problems with the system nothings perfect but with so many lies going around you can understand why we might be just a bit wary a little bit overcautious and perhaps not quite as trusting as youd like cant you i suppose so yes gristhorpe nodded good the superintendents interview technique susan noticed was in direct contrast to bankss with whom she had more experience of questioning subjects banks would sometimes needle his interviewees and when hed got them confused and vulnerable he would subtly suggest possible scenarios of how they had committed the crime and why he sometimes even went so far as to explain to them their feelings and state of mind while they were doing it then if they were new to the world of crime he would sometimes describe in graphic detail what kind of life they could expect in jail and after banks worked on his subjects imaginations he used words to paint images unbearable to the hearer gristhorpe seemed to concentrate more on logic and reasoned argument he was polite softspoken and unrelenting he seemed slower than banks too as if he had all the time in the world but susan was keen to get it over with she had already pulled a couple favors to get the lab working overtime on mark woods shoes and clothing and if they came up with some solid forensic evidence or if gristhorpe got a confession there was a good chance they could wrap things up before tonight jimmy riddle would be pleased about that as a bonus she would have the weekend free for once and she might get her saturday night out with gavin she had considered phoning him earlier even picked up the phone but no she told herself it wouldnt do to seem too keen too easily available let him cajole her seduce her win her you see gristhorpe went on thats one of our main problems sorting out the lies from the truth thats why we have science to help us do you know what forensic means wood frowned and tugged on his earring it means science doesnt it like blood types footprints dna and fingerprints thats a common error gristhorpe said toying with his glasses on the table actually it means for use in a court of law its from the latin related to the word forum so one of the best systems we have to help us tell the lies from the truth is a complex and broadranging branch of science dedicated solely to presenting scientific evidence in court now of course before we get to court we use this forensic evidence to help us identify the people who should be on trial and in your case im afraid the evidence tells us that you should be in court for the murder of jason fox what do you have to say about that mark nothing what can i say ive done nothing wood was taken aback by gristhorpes gentle and erudite logic susan could tell but he was cool she noticed that gristhorpe let the silence stretch until wood started squirming in his chair well you must have something to say lad gristhorpe went on putting on his glasses again and slipping a photograph from the file in front of him this is an image of a fingerprint found on the label of a beer bottle he said turning it around so wood could see it clearly it was developed by a very painstaking process forensic science doesnt produce miracles mark but sometimes it seems to come close now im sure youre an intelligentenough lad to know that fingerprints are unique so far no two fingers have been found to possess the same ridge characteristics isnt that amazing wood said nothing his eyes were glued to the photo anyway gristhorpe went on whats particularly interesting about that fingerprint is that it came from a fragment of a broken bottle found at the scene of jason foxs murder but perhaps im being precipitous in referring to it as a murder so soon because that hasnt been proven yet you do know that theres a big difference between homicide and manslaughter dont you mark wood nodded yes good and theres also a big difference in jail sentences but we wont let that detain us for the moment anyway the point is that it is a close match for your fingerprint one we already have on file and that it was found in the ginnel by the rec on a fragment of a broken beer bottle under jason foxs body id like you to tell me how it got there wood licked his lips and glanced at susan she said nothing he looked back into gristhorpes guileless blue eyes well er i suppose i must have touched it mustnt i if its got my prints on it he smiled gristhorpe nodded aye i suppose so when might that have happened mark i gave it to jason wood said finally when when we came out of the pub you see i thought i wanted another beer so i bought a bottle from outsales as we were leaving but then i remembered i had to drive back down the a so i just gave it to jason he said he was walking home ah said gristhorpe so you gave the bottle of beer to jason when you parted outside the jubilee thats right i was parked just down the street the pub was on market street is that right thats the one gristhorpe looked at susan who raised her eyebrows whats wrong wood asked susan scratched the cleft of her chin nothing really mark she said its just that youve confused me a bit when i talked to you earlier you denied being in eastvale at all last saturday night dont you remember she pretended to read from the paper in front of her you bought a couple of bottles of beer at the offlicense and rented a steven seagal video which you and your wife watched that evening you didnt even nip out to the hare and hounds for a quick one thats what you said mark yeah well its like he said earlier isnt it he looked at gristhorpe what would that be mark gristhorpe asked about people ly about people not telling the exact truth sometimes when the police come after them so you didnt tell the truth not exactly why not i was scared wasnt i what of that youd fit me up for it because ive been in trouble before ah yes said gristhorpe shaking his head the classic fitup thats another one of the problems we constantly have to fight against the publics perception of the police mostly formed by the media especially television well i wont deny it mark there are police officers who wouldnt stop at forging a notebook entry or altering a statement in order to convict someone were all embarrassed about the birmingham six you know thats why there are so many laws now to help people in your position we cant beat you up we cant force a confession out of you we have to treat you well while youre in custody feed you allow you exercise give you access to a solicitor that sort of thing its all covered in the pace guidelines gristhorpe spread his hands you see mark were just humble public servants really gentle custodians here to see that your rights arent abused in any way by the way you must be a bit hungry by now arent you i know i am how about i send out for some coffee and sandwiches fine with me long as theyre not salmon im allergic to salmon no problem susan would you ask one of the uniformed officers to nip over to the queens arms and ask cyril to do us two or three hamandcheese sandwiches and have one of the lads up front bring us a pot of fresh coffee please of course sir susan popped her head out of the door and made the request then she went back to her chair while were waiting though said gristhorpe and if you dont mind mark lets get back to what happened last saturday night shall we as i understand it youve changed your original story which quite understandably you now admit was a lie because i was scared youd fit me up right because you were scared wed fit you up well i hope ive put your mind at rest about that wood leaned back in his chair and smiled youre a lot nicer than those bastards from west yorkshire who nabbed me on that drugs charge bloody hell thought susan the old mans even getting compliments out of his suspects now let alone mere apologies well said gristhorpe inclining his head modestly west yorkshire have a lot more problems than we do being a lot more urban and all they sometimes have to cut corners a bit roughly youre telling me but thats all behind you now mark isnt it i see youve been a good lad since then you took a course and then you went into business admirable but now theres just this little spot of bother and the sooner we get it cleared up the sooner you can get back to leading a normal and productive life with your family did jason ever try to interest you in the albion league sometimes hed spout a load of garbage about how the holocaust didnt really happen how most of the jews died of typhoid and the showers were just ways of disinfecting them like not really death camps at all i must admit it made me a bit sick then i lost interest and didnt pay much attention after that half the time i thought he couldnt even be serious i understand your wife is afrocaribbean her familys from jamaica yes how did you manage to reconcile this with doing business with a racist like jason i never thought much about it really not at first like i said i thought jason spouted a load of silly rubbish i figured hed probably grow out of it you said at first what about after that yeah well it started getting to me sheri being jamaican and all we had a couple of arguments i was on the verge of ditching him when when what mark well you know he died ah yes did you tell him you were married to a jamaican woman are you joking and listen to him prattle on about that he really had a bee in his bonnet about mixed marriages no i kept my private life and my business activities completely separate gristhorpe adjusted his glasses again and took a moment or two to look over some sheets of paper then he looked back at wood held his glasses in his hand and frowned but you knew that jason was doing this computer work for the league the food came and they took a moments break to pass around sandwiches and pour coffee yes i knew wood answered but what he did in his own time was up to him even if you didnt agree it bore the trademark of the business you ran together didnt it we could use all the business we could get right so you let your name be used for neonazi propaganda even though you found the idea loathsome your wife is black for crying out loud mark what do you think jason fox and his ilk would do with her if they got half a chance what does that make you mark are you ashamed of her now hold on a minute gristhorpe leaned forward he didnt raise his voice at all but he fixed mark with his eyes no mark you hold on a minute you were drinking with jason fox on the night he got killed now youve already lied to us once or twice but well let that go by for the moment your latest story is that you were with jason but the two of you parted outside the jubilee at which time you gave him the bottle of beer youd bought from outsales because you remembered you had to drive home is that right yes and the two of you werent close friends no ive told you we worked together thats all so what were you doing pubbing with him in the jubilee eastvales a long way from your normal stamping ground isnt it can you explain that he said he was going up to eastvale to play football i felt like a night out thats all somewhere different just for a change sheri knew id been a bit down lately like about the business and all and she said she didnt mind staying home with connor the jubilee gets really good bands on a saturday night and i like live music so you drove all the way up from castleford to spend a social evening with a business associate you didnt particularly like someone who believed your wife and all her kind should be packed off in boats back to the caribbean mark shrugged i went to see the band jason said hed come along as hed be in town anyway thats all i thought it might make a change from razors edge and celtic warrior and all that other crap he listens to hear some decent music for once the jubilees got a good reputation all over the north just ask anyone and its not that far straight up the a doesnt take more than a hour and a half or so each way thats three hours driving mark so i like driving where did you go after you left jason i drove straight back home i wasnt over the limit if thats what youre thinking but you still came all this way knowing youd be drinking and having to drive back wood shrugged im not a big boozer i can handle three or four pints over the course of an evening are you sure you didnt have more than that mark i had three pints four at the most if that put me over the limit charge me are you sure you didnt have too much to drink and ask jason if you could stay at his house are you sure you didnt walk down no i told you i drove straight home all right mark if you say so i do however have one more question for you before i leave you to think over our little discussion whats that if you gave jason the beer bottle and he drank from it on his way home then why didnt we find his fingerprints on it too ii the girl was incredibly beautiful banks thought part oriental she had long sleek black hair a golden complexion a heartshaped face with perfect full lips and slightly hooded eyes she couldnt have been more than nineteen or twenty years old at the moment she was sitting on a chair bathed in the red neon glow wearing dangling silver earrings and a black lace bra and panties nothing else her slender legs were parted slightly at the inner thighs so the plump mound of her pudendum was clear to see she had a tiny tattoo a butterfly it looked like on the inside of her left thigh and she was smiling at banks no said burgess not that one shes got no tits banks smiled to himself and came back to earth lovely as the girl was he could no more think of sleeping with her than he could with one of tracys friends though he was quite happy to wander around the redlight district windowshopping with burgess he had never intended to buy anything on offer there nor he suspected did burgess when it came right down to it and after three or four pils with jenever chasers it was doubtful whether either of them was even capable of much in that direction anyway amsterdam was especially beautiful at night banks thought with the necklaces of lights strung over the bridges mirrored in the canals and the glowing candlelit interiors of glasscovered lovers tour boats spilling mantovani violins as their wake made the reflections shimmer in the dark oily water he wished sandra were with him and not burgess they would wander the canals all night and get hopelessly lost again just as they had done all those years ago at night the redlight district had much more of an edge than during the day when it was basically just another stop on a sightseeing tour most tourists stayed away at night but as far as banks could tell it wasnt any more dangerous than soho his wallet was safely zipped in the inside pocket of his suede jacket and he had nothing else worth stealing and if it came to violence he could handle himself though he felt a bit lightheaded he wasnt drunk they wandered along jostled by the crowds stopping to look into the occasional window and surprised more often than not by the beauty and youth of the prostitutes on display at one point someone bumped into burgess and banks had to step in and prevent a fight wouldnt go down well that he thought senior scotland yard detective arrested for assault in amsterdams redlight district maybe he thought with a smile he should have let it go on after a while the crowds had a claustrophobic effect on banks and he was thinking of going back to his hotel when burgess said fuck it you know what banks what hate to admit it but i probably couldnt even get it up if i tried lets have another drink a nightcap that seemed like a good idea to banks who fancied a sitdown and a smoke so they nipped into a bar on a street corner and burgess promptly ordered pils and jenever again for both of them they chatted about mutual friends on the force over the loud music some sort of modern europop banks thought and watched the punters come and go sailors punks prostitutes the occasional dealer shifting some stuff when theyd finished their drinks burgess suggested another round but banks said they should find somewhere nearer the hotel while he could still remember his way fuck the hotel we can take a taxi anywhere we want burgess protested i dont know where the nearest taxi rank is besides its not far the walkll do you good burgess was truly over the top by now he insisted on just one more jenever which he downed in one and then after a bit more grumbling he agreed to walk and stumbled out after banks into the street they soon got out of the redlight district and onto damrak which was still busy with burgess meandering from side to side bumping into people banks remembered that dirty dicks second nickname on the met was bambi on account of the way his physical coordination went all to pieces when he was pissed got a joke burgess said nudging banks in the ribs this bloke goes into a pub with an octopus and he says to the lads in the band ill bet any of you a tenner my pet here can play any instrument you care to give him they took one of the narrow streets that crossed the canals toward keizersgracht banks found his attention wandering burgesss voice in the background so one of the lads brings him a clarinet and the bloody octopus plays it like he was benny goodman another bloke brings him a guitar and its django fucking reinhardt banks fancied a coffee and wondered if he could get one at the hotel if not there was bound to be a café nearby he looked at his watch only ten oclock hard to believe theyd done so much in such a short time a small café would actually be better than the hotel he decided he would dump burgess pick up his graham greene and find a place to sit read and peoplewatch for a while anyway this goes on for ages instrument after instrument bongos trombone saxophone you name it bring him a ukulele and its george formby the octopus plays them all like a virsh a virsh a virtyouohso finally one of the musicians hes had enough and he goes out and finds a set of bagpipes he gives them to the octopus and the octopus looks at them frowns turns them every which way then back again looks like youre about to lose your tenner mate the musician says christ i need a piss burgess tottered toward the quayside hands working at his fly head halfturned to look back at banks a crooked smile on his face so the guy says hang on a minute mate when he finds out he cant fuck it hell play it get it argh shiit it happened so quickly that banks didnt even have a chance to take half a step one moment burgess was pissing a long noisy arc into the canal the next he had toppled forward with an almighty splash followed by a string of garbled oaths ten i by saturday morning susan guessed mark wood must be feeling like one of those mice that has wandered into a humane trap it cant find its way back out and it is just beginning to realize that its in a trap even when the mice do get released she realized they generally find themselves a long way from home your solicitor mr varney rang said gristhorpe hes sorry he was out last night anyway hes on his way up from leeds what can we do for you in the meantime coffee danish wood reached forward and helped himself to a pastry i dont have to talk to you until he gets here he said true said gristhorpe but remember that caution i read you yesterday if you dont say anything now it could go very badly for you later when you try to change your story again what do you mean you know what i mean youre a liar mark youve already given us half a dozen old wives tales the more lies you tell the lower your credibility rating falls im offering you a chance to sweep the board clean forget the lies and tell me the truth once and for all what happened after you and jason fox left the jubilee last saturday night your solicitor will only give you the same advice tell the truth and ill turn on the tape recorders but ive already told you gristhorpe shook his head you lied the bottle the fingerprint mark the fingerprint susan hoped to hell that gristhorpe did get somewhere before giles varney arrived because hed milked that fingerprint for far more than it was worth already they couldnt be certain it was woods and gristhorpe had framed his references to it with great care when the tapes were running saying it was a close match rather than an identical one even close match was pushing it a bit one of the first things varney would do was look at the forensic evidence and tell his client just how flimsy it was then wood would clam up susan had phoned the lab just a few moments ago and while they said they might get some results before the morning was out it certainly wouldnt be within the hour even then she knew these would only be preliminary results but they might at a pinch at least be able to determine whether there was human blood on woods clothing and whether it matched jason foxs general type for more specific and solid evidence such as dna analysis they would have to wait much longer even a general grouping susan thought along with an identification and statement from the landlord of the jubilee would be more than they had right now and it might be enough to convince the magistrates to remand wood for a while longer nobody touched that bottle but you mark gristhorpe went on the fingerprint proves that what about the bloke i bought it off why werent his fingerprints on it thats not important mark what matters is that your fingerprints were on it and jasons werent theres no getting away from that solicitor or no solicitor if you tell me the truth now things will go well for you if you dont well itll be a jury youll have to explain yourself to and sometimes you can wait months for a trial years even so what id be out on bail and you cant prove anything true susan thought wrong gristhorpe said i dont think youd get bail mark not for this it was a vicious murder very nasty indeed you said it might not be murder that depends the way things are looking now youd have to confess to make us believe it was manslaughter mark youd have to tell us how it really happened convince us it wasnt murder otherwise weve got you on a murder charge concealing evidence not coming forward lying it all looks bad to a jury wood chewed on his lower lip susan noticed the crumbs of pastry down the front of his shirt he was sweating youre a clever lad arent you mark what do you mean you know all about computers and the internet and all that stuff so now me i dont know a hard drive from a hole in the ground but i do know youre lying and i do know that your only way out of this tissue of lies youve got yourself well and truly stuck in is to tell me the truth now finally wood licked his lips and said look i didnt kill anyone all right i was there i admit it i was there when it started but i didnt kill jason youve got to believe me why do i have to believe you mark gristhorpe asked softly because you do its true why dont you just tell me what happened can i have a smoke no said gristhorpe after youve told me if i believe you he turned on the dual cassette recorder and made the usual preamble about the time date and who was present wood sulked and chewed his lip for a moment then began we left the jubilee just after closing time like i said i had a bottle with me jason didnt he didnt drink much in fact he had a thing about drink and drugs into health and fitness was jason anyway we took the short cut at least thats what he told me it was through some streets across the road and where the streets ended theres a ginnel that leads between two terrace blocks to some waste ground the rec said gristhorpe if you say so i didnt know where the fuck we were why were you also heading in that direction i thought you said your car was parked on market street it was jason asked me back to his place for a drink thats all i know i shouldnt have been drinking so much when i was driving but he grinned anyway it was like you said yesterday if i thought id had too much i wouldve stopped the night at jasons house his parents house yes carry on well the ginnel looked a bit creepy to me but jason went ahead then all of a sudden they came at us three of them from where theyd been waiting at the other end the rec end three of them thats right asian lads i recognized them jason had had a minor runin with one of them earlier in the pub what happened next i dropped the bottle and scarpered fast i thought jason was right behind me but by the time i looked back he was nowhere in sight you didnt see what happened to him no and you didnt go back no way all right what did you do next i kept going until i got to the car then i drove home why didnt you call the police wood scratched his neck and averted his eyes i dont know i suppose i didnt think of it really and id been drinking but your friend sorry your business associate was in danger he could at least expect a severe beating and all you could do was scarper come on mark you cant expect me to believe that surely youve got more bottle a fit lad like you believe what you want i didnt know jason was in danger did i for all i knew hed run off in a different direction id have been a proper wally to go back there and get my head kicked in like jason yeah well i didnt know what happened did i did you really believe that jason had got away too he could have done couldnt he okay now tell me if youd done nothing wrong why didnt you come forward later after you knew jason had been killed mark scratched the side of his nose i didnt know till i read it in the papers a couple of days later by then i thought it would look funny if i came forward gristhorpe frowned look funny yeah suspicious why because i hadnt said anything at the time isnt that something makes you blokes suspicious gristhorpe spread his hands mark were simple souls really were just thrilled to bits when someone decides to tell us the truth yeah well i must admit i wasnt too proud of myself what for running away deserting your mate when he needed your help wood looked down at his hands clasped on his lap yes any other reason you kept out of it well if they killed jason whether they meant to or not i mean ive got a wife and kid know what i mean i wouldnt want to put any of us in danger by testifying if there were likely to be you know recriminations recriminations by the three attackers by them yes or people like them other pakistani youths well yeah i mean they stick together stand up for one another dont they i didnt want to put my wife and kid at risk gristhorpe shook his head slowly this isnt making any sense to me mark you look like a strong lad why didnt you stay and fight with jason give him a bit of support i told you i was thinking of sheri and connor i mean how would they manage without me if i got hurt put in hospital same way theyll have to manage without you when you get put in jail i suppose said gristhorpe youre telling me you ran away out of concern for your wife and child woods face reddened im not saying thats what i thought straight off it was instinctive i didnt have much choice did i and like i said i thought jason was right behind me it was three against two it was three against one after you ran off mark what sort of choice did jason have the two of you could have taken those three easily id have put my money on you wood shook his head are you telling me youre a coward mark stronglooking lad like you bet you lift weights dont you yet when it comes to the crunch you bugger off and leave your mate to die alone look will you shut up about that wood leaned forward and banged his fist down the metal table rattled the point is that i didnt do anything it doesnt matter whether i ran away or why i ran away all that matters is that i didnt kill jason calm down mark gristhorpe raised his hand palm out what youre saying is true technically at any rate what do you mean technically well if what youre telling us is the truth at last it is then you didnt kill jason in any legal criminal sense of the word but id say youre morally responsible wouldnt you i mean you could have saved him but you didnt even try i told you to stop it with that you cant prove it would have done any good if id stayed maybe id have got killed too what good would that have done anyone i dont care about fucking morality theres nothing you can charge me with how about leaving the scene thats crap and you know it maybe so gristhorpe admitted nevertheless deserting your mate the way you did thats something youll have to live with forever isnt it mark gristhorpe went to the door and asked the two uniformed officers to come in and take wood back to his cell then he and susan picked up their coffees and left the stuffy interview room for gristhorpes office up there in a comfortable chair with plenty of space and clean air to breathe susan felt herself relax what do you think of his story gristhorpe asked susan shook her head hes certainly a bit of a chameleon isnt he i hardly know what to think ill tell you one thing though sir i think i caught him in at least one more lie gristhorpe raised his bushy eyebrows oh aye and which lie would that be mark told us that when they left the jubilee jason invited him back to his house for a drink and maybe to stop overnight jason wouldnt have done that his parents insisted he never brought his friends to their house hmm maybe theyre the ones who are lying i dont think so sir why should they if you think about it jason lived most of his life in leeds he only came home on weekends occasionally mostly to play football for united spend a little time with his parents get his washing done maybe visit his granddad he never told any of them what he was up to in leeds its easy to see why he wouldnt want to mention neville motcombe or explain how he got fired from the plastics factory and that meant he couldnt mention the computer business either he could have simply lied from the start told them hed left the factory of his own free will for something better but he didnt didnt want to face the questions i suppose after that all the lies became interconnected who knows what mark might have let slip to jasons parents she shook her head unless mr and mrs fox are lying which i doubt then its hardly likely jason would suddenly decide to take one of his leeds mates back to the eastvale house on a whim too risky and theres another thing jason didnt keep anything to drink at the eastvale house in fact according to all accounts he hardly drank at all maybe he was intending to give mark some of his dads scotch or something its possible sir susan said but as i say i doubt it and maybe he would have bent the rules a bit if his mate had had too much to drink and needed somewhere to sleep it off that might also explain why mark didnt drive down from market street to jasons place again sir said susan its possible but youre not convinced do you think he did it i dont know sir i just dont trust his story make that stories all right ill bear your reservations in mind i cant say i like them much either he shook his head slowly anyway wed better arrange to bring in george mahmood and his pals again even though the forensic evidence supports georges story even so chief constable riddle will love that sir the way i see it susan weve got no choice mark wood says he saw three asian lads attack jason fox unless we can prove hes lying it doesnt matter what we think we have to bring them in susan nodded i know sir and give the lab another call ask them to get their fingers out if all they can tell us is theres human blood on the clothes id be satisfied for the time being because if we dont get something positive soon mark wood is going to walk out of here in less than an hour and im still not happy with a word hes told us ii banks made it down to breakfast with just minutes to spare before the nineoclock deadline getting a frosty look from the stout waitress in the hotel lounge for his trouble first he helped himself to coffee from a table by the window then he sat down and looked around a large no smoking symbol hung over the lacecurtained window he doodled away at yesterdays yorkshire post crossword while he sipped the rich black coffee and waited eventually the waitress returned and with a dour glance she deposited a glass of orange juice and a plate in front of him on the plate lay a few slices of cold ham a chunk of edam cheese a hardboiled egg a couple of rolls and some butter the dutch breakfast banks tucked in he felt fortunate in having only the mildest of hangovers the slight ache behind his eyes had been easily vanquished with the aid of two extrastrength paracetamols from his travelers emergency kit and he suspected that the minor sense of disorientation he felt was still more due to being in a foreign city than to the residual effects of alcohol whatever the reason he felt fine at least physically only as he sipped the last of his coffee did he realize he hadnt thought of his domestic problems at all last night even now in the mornings light everything felt so distant so disembodied he could hardly believe that sandra had really gone was it a question of not being there to see the tree fall in the woods or was it what the psychologists of grief called denial maybe he would ask his psychologist friend jenny fuller when she got back from america jenny now if sandra really had gone did that make him a free agent what were the rules best not think about it too much maybe he would ring home again before going out just to see if she had come back he was the only person sitting in the spotless lounge with its dark wood smelling of polish its lace doilies ticking clock and knickknacks stuffed in alcoves as he had hoped burgess had either breakfasted earlier or hadnt even got out of bed yet banks suspected the latter thank the lord a passerby had stopped to help him haul burgess out of the canal last night dirty dick had stood there dripping the foul water and complaining loudly about the canalbuilding dutch engineers most of whom according to him had only one parent a mother with whom they had indulged in unspeakable sexual relations banks finally managed to persuade him to calm down and walk back to the hotel before the police arrived and arrested them that they succeeded in doing and their arrival attracted only a puzzled frown from the man at the desk as they traipsed through the lobby burgess still trailed dirty canal water as he went his shoes squelching with every step he held his head high like w c fields trying to pretend he was sober and walked with as much dignity as he could muster after that he went straight up to his room on the second floor and that was the last banks had seen or heard of him after breakfast banks went all the way back up to his room and phoned home again still nothing not that he had expected sandra to get the first train back home but one lives in hope he didnt leave a message for himself as he trod carefully back down the steep narrow stairs tiptoeing over the landing near burgesss room he reflected on how he had enjoyed himself last night how against all expectations he had enjoyed his night of freedom he hadnt done anything he wouldnt normally have done except perhaps drink too much and get silly but he had felt differently about it for the first time he found himself wondering if sandra wasnt perhaps right maybe they both did need a little time to maneuver and regroup after all the changes of the past few years especially sandras new and more demanding job at the gallery and the loss of the children not children now banks reminded himself grownups he thought back to that evening in the pack horse only a few days ago when he had watched tracy with her friends and realized he couldnt cross the lounge to be with her then he remembered a telephone call he had once made from weymouth to his son in portsmouth realizing then for the first time how distant and independent brian had become well there was nothing he could do about it any of it except to make damn sure he kept in touch with them helped them the best he could became a friend and not a meddlesome irritation to them he wondered how they would take the news of their parents separation for that matter who would tell them would sandra should he he walked out onto keizersgracht the sun glinted on the parked bicycles on the quay and on the canal making a rainbow out of a pool of oil reflections of trees shimmered gently in the ripples of a passing boat his mysterious meeting was set for eight oclock tonight well he thought in the meantime on a day like this tourist map in hand he could walk the city to his hearts content iii youve got to admit superintendent that your evidence is pretty thin giles varney mark woods solicitor sat in gristhorpes office later that saturday morning staring out over the market square as he talked outside a sunny morning had brought plenty of tourists to the bustling open market but now it was clouding over and to susans welltrained nose getting ready to pour down before the day was out she had already seen the gusts of wind which would later bring the rain clouds billowing the canvas covers of the market stalls varney wasnt a pinstripe lawyer like the one theyd had to deal with last year in the deborah harrison murder he was casually dressed in jeans and a sports shirt and his very expensive light wool jacket hung on a stand in the corner he was young probably not much older than susans own twentyseven in good shape and handsome in a craggy outdoorsy kind of way he looked as if he were on his way to go hanggliding there was something susan didnt like about him but she couldnt put her finger on it an arrogance perhaps or overconfidence whatever it was it put her on her guard i realize that mr varney said gristhorpe but im sure you can see our predicament varney smiled with all due respect its not my job to see your predicament its my job to get my client out of jail supercilious prat susan thought and its our job countered gristhorpe to get to the bottom of jason foxs death your client admits he was at the scene only prior to the crime he couldnt have had any knowledge of what was going to happen oh come off it mr varney if three kids came at you in a dark alley i think youd have a pretty good idea what was about to take place wouldnt you thats beside the point and since when has saving your own skin been regarded as a criminal act technically my client is not guilty of any crime i expect you to release him immediately i trust you have the real criminals in custody on their way again muttered gristhorpe varney raised an eyebrow yes i understand you had these same chaps in custody once before and let them go had to gristhorpe said no evidence youd have approved varney smiled again not having much luck with evidence these days are you superintendent there is one other small matter said gristhorpe varney glanced at his rolex with irritation yes your client has now become an important witness i trust youd have no objection to his remaining here in order to identify the suspects when weve brought them in varney narrowed his eyes i dont know what youre up to superintendent but something smells still how could i have any objection and im sure my client will be more than willing to help sort out this mess for you as long as hes released from his cell this very minute and treated as a witness rather than as a criminal he also has to know that hes free to go home whenever he wants susan breathed a sigh of relief she knew that gristhorpe was playing for time trying to find some reason to keep mark wood in eastvale until the lab came up with something or with nothing this way at least they might get another hour or so out of him especially if they had him write another formal statement after the identification maybe a lot more time than that if they put together an identification parade which would mean importing a few more asians of similar build to george kobir and asim as it turned out they hardly had to wait at all just as gristhorpe was about to leave the office and take varney down to release mark wood the phone rang gristhorpe excused himself picked up the receiver grunted a few times then beamed at susan thats the lab he said theyve found traces of blood between the uppers and the soles of mark woods doc martens and it matches jason foxs blood group im afraid mr varney weve got a few more questions for your client varney sniffed and sat down again gristhorpe picked up his phone and called downstairs bert have young mark wood brought up from the cells would you yes the interview room giles varney insisted on having a private talk with mark wood before the interview susan waited with gristhorpe in his office where they went over all woods previous statements planning their strategy the rags of cloud had drifted in from scotland now and the air that blew in through the partially open window was beginning to smell like a wet dog susan walked over and watched some of the tourists looking at the sky then heading for the pubs or for their cars hungry gristhorpe asked i can wait sir said susan a few less calories wont do me any harm me neither grinned gristhorpe but at my age you dont worry about it so much there was a brisk tap at the door and giles varney walked in finished gristhorpe asked varney nodded for the moment my client wishes to make a statement another one look said varney with a thin smile the blood evidence isnt much to write home about so far you have to admit and the fingerprint rubbish is even less you should be grateful for what you can get in a few days gristhorpe countered well have dna on the blood and i suspect your client knows that will prove its jason foxs at the moment i think weve got enough to hold him varney smiled thats what i thought youd say what you hear might change your mind how after a certain amount of reflection on the advice of his solicitor my client is now willing to explain exactly what happened last saturday night right said gristhorpe getting up and glancing over at susan lets get to it then they went into the interview room where mark wood sat chewing his fingernails went through the preliminaries and turned on the tape recorders right lad said gristhorpe mr varney here says you wish to make a statement i hope its the truth this time now what have you got to say wood looked at varney before opening his mouth varney nodded i did it wood said i killed jason it was an accident i didnt mean to why dont you tell us what happened mark gristhorpe coaxed him slowly take your time wood looked at varney who nodded we were going back to his place like i said before jason was going on about those pakis back in the jubilee what he thought should be done with them we started arguing i told him i didnt like that racist crap jason was going on about how i was really a racist deep down just like him and why didnt i admit it join the group i laughed and told him id never join that band of wankers in a million years i was pretty mad by then so i told him that my wife was from jamaica then he started insulting her calling her a black bitch and a whore and calling little connor a halfbreed mutant we were getting near the ginnel now and jason was really laying into me really crude stuff like id betrayed the white race by marrying a nigger and shit like that mark paused and rubbed his temples id had a few drinks more than i admitted and more than jason at any rate and sometimes i well ive got a bit of a temper when im pissed i just lost it thats all he came at me i had the bottle in my hand and i just lashed out with it and hit him what happened next he didnt go down just put his hand to the side of his head and swore then he came at me again he was strong was jason but i reckon im probably stronger anyway we started fighting but i think the head wound had sort of weakened him and i managed to knock him down i thought about what hed said about sheri and connor and i just saw red the next thing i knew he wasnt moving and i ran off and left him there yes i didnt know he was fucking dead how could i i thought id just put him out of action for a while why did you empty his pockets i didnt why would i do that because the whole thing was a lot more deliberate than youre saying because you wanted to make it look like a mugging you tell me mark superintendent varney chipped in my client is offering a voluntary statement if he says he didnt empty the victims pockets then i suggest you believe him he has no reason to lie at this point ill be the judge of that mr varney said gristhorpe he looked at mark again mark shook his head i dont remember doing that honest gristhorpe sniffed and riffled through some sheets of paper in front of him mark he said finally jason foxs injuries included a fractured skull and a ruptured spleen yet you say you only knocked him down thats how it happened i admit i lost it i was in a rage but i didnt mean to kill him all right mark said gristhorpe is this the statement you want to make yes my client will be pleading to the charge of manslaughter superintendent varney said and i think there might be some room for mitigating circumstances plenty of time for charges later said gristhorpe lets just go through the story again first gristhorpe turned to susan and sighed susan go and make sure george mahmood and his friends are released immediately the poor sods wont know whether theyre coming or going susan nodded and got up as she left the interview room she heard gristhorpe say wearily right then mark once more from the top iv using a street map hed bought that afternoon banks walked to the address burgess had given him though he felt silly doing it he had looked over his shoulder once in a while and taken a very circuitous route it was another brown café this one on a street corner by sarphatipark the park itself was a dark rectangle wedged between blocks of tenements it looked familiar he was sure he had seen it before with sandra it reminded him of the kind of square youd find in bloomsbury or edinburgh the café itself wasnt the kind of place listed in the tourist guides the wood was dark and stained with years of tobacco smoke and most of the tables were scratched and blackened here and there where cigarettes had been left to burn one or two locals sitting at the bar workingmen by the look of their clothes turned and glanced at banks as he walked in and found a table in the far corner one of them said something to the man behind the bar who shrugged and laughed then they paid him no further attention only a few tables were taken and only one of those by a young man and a woman it was pretty much of a mens pub by the look of it accordion music was playing quietly behind the bar welcome to hell the table wobbled banks took a beer mat and placed it under one leg that helped not wanting a repeat of last night he decided he was going to stick with beer and not even drink many of those that jenever could be deadly he ordered an amstel lit a cigarette and settled down to wait back to the wall eyes on the door after a day spent walking around the city stopping only at a café now and then for a coffee and a cigarette banks was also glad of the chance to rest his legs as he waited he reflected on the curious and unsettling experience he had had that afternoon one of the places hed walked by was a canalside coffeehouse he remembered visiting with sandra all those years ago the kind of place that also sold hash and grass it didnt seem to have changed at all at first he thought it couldnt possibly be the same one but it was curious he turned back and wandered inside at the back where it was darker piles of cushions lay scattered on the floor you could lie back smoke your joint look at the posters on the wall and listen to the music he noticed a young couple there in the far corner and for one spinetingling moment in the dim light he felt he was looking down on himself and sandra when they were young and he hadnt even smoked any hash shaken he walked out into the sunshine and went on his way it was a good five or ten minutes before he could get rid of the spooky feeling he and sandra had smoked some hash there with some americans he remembered dylans blonde on blonde album had been playing the long sadeyed lady of the lowlands later they had made love in their sleeping bag in the vondelpark hidden away from other nighthawks by some bushes memories would he never escape them just as he was lighting his second cigarette someone walked through the door and for the second time that day banks felt gobsmacked if he wasnt mistaken it was the man he had last seen in neville motcombes house rupert francis the tall gangly woodworker he obviously noticed bankss surprise you can close your mouth now sir he said it really is me banks shook his head slowly so i see rupert francis right and whats with the sir actually im ds craig mckeracher sir he said shaking hands that makes you my senior officer pleasure to make your acquaintance he smiled sheepishly and sat down im sorry about all the cloakanddagger stuff sir but if they found out who i really am theyd kill me banks shook hands and collected his thoughts the waiter came over and craig ordered a beer i think we can drop the sir said banks craig nodded if you like i must admit you gave me the shock of my bloody life when i saw you at nevs place the other day i thought the game was up right there and then you didnt have to show yourself i know but i heard voices so i thought up an excuse and came up to see what was going on part of my brief after all to keep my eyes and ears open just as well youd never seen me before how long have you been undercover there about five months nev trusts me rupert francis has an impeccable background with the neonazi movement bnp fringe groups the whole kit and caboodle hes even been done on firearms and explosives charges in addition to that hes got a long and varied criminal record assault burglary drugs you name it thats something nev also trusts how would he know about your record craig sipped some beer from the bottle before answering his adams apple bobbed in his skinny throat hes got a man on the inside somewhere west yorkshire some pc or dc sympathetic to the cause believe me there are plenty of blokes on the job whod have no ax to grind with neville motcombes ideas however he does it he has no problem checking out criminal records so its you who wants me here not burgess yes after id seen you i got in touch with dirty with superintendent burgess soon as i could hes my controller but with things getting so hot lately weve not had the chance for much more than minimal telephone contact and youve got to be really careful over the phone anyway i told him i wanted to talk to you as soon as possible but i didnt want to risk doing it locally then i thought this would be a perfect opportunity know why im here havent a clue said banks im helping to organize an international conference on race and iq if you can swallow that anyway superintendent burgess said not to worry hed make the arrangements craig grinned in fact he said hed enjoy it you should have heard him when i told him youd walked right into nevs front room i gather the two of you know each other you and the super that is banks stubbed out his cigarette and sipped some beer you could say that he likes you honest he does respects you thats what he told me i reckon he thinks youre a bit naive but he was glad to hear it was you on the fox case and not someone else maybe we should start a mutual admiration society craig laughed anyway banks asked why all this interest in the albion league because of neville motcombe and his contacts with known international terrorists when he left the bnp and decided to start his own fringe group we thought itd be a good idea to keep an eye on him banks sipped some amstel and did he live up to your expectations in some ways yes in others he exceeded them the albion leagues nowhere near as politically active as we thought it would be as combat are for example im not saying there havent been violent incidents there have and ive even heard talk of a pipe bomb to sabotage the mosque opening now we know about that possibility we can tighten security and make sure it doesnt happen but mostly as far as revolutionary action is concerned theyve been pretty tame so far more like a fucking boys club than anything else i wondered about that what is it with motcombe and these young boys is he gay or something the waiter came over and they ordered two more beers when he had gone again craig said no no nevs not gay ill confess i had my own suspicions when i first met him and he invited me down the cellar to help with his woodwork like come and see my etchings but hes not if anything id say he was asexual his wife left him if you ask me it was because he spent more time licking envelopes than licking her hes that kind of person power is more important to him than romantic or sexual relationships the youth thing is just part of his shtick he actually used to be involved in church groups youth clubs that sort of thing he was even a boys brigade leader at one time always did like paramilitary organizations and uniforms what happened he got kicked out for trying to recruit kids to the bnp anyway a big part of his thing is the emphasis on the old british values and virtues war games in the pennines crafts camping hiking survival techniques a healthy mind and healthy body that sort of thing badenpowell with swastikas if you like he even throws in a bit of environmentalist stuff to hook the greenies you know preserve the traditional english village against pollution that sort of thing thing is to him pollution isnt only a matter of destroying the ozone layer and the rain forests or what have you it includes most nonaryan racial groups perhaps nevs only saving grace as a human being is that his overriding trait is greed what do you mean craig rubbed his cheek and frowned just an observation of mine havent you sometimes thought that peoples vices are often the only things that make them interesting as a pure neonazi nev would simply be a bore a sick and dangerous bore perhaps but a bore nonetheless predictable its the other stuff thats interesting the stuff we didnt expect burgess mentioned drugs is that right craig nodded finished his beer and slid the bottle aside fancy walking why not they paid their bill and walked outside there were still plenty of people on the streets especially along albert cuypstraat where they walked through the debris of that afternoons market wilted lettuce leaves a squashed tomato chicken bones a piece of cardboard that said f on it the smell of fish still infused the evening air now banks knew why sarphatipark had felt so familiar he and sandra had been there they had spent an hour or two one afternoon wandering the market stalls like i said craig went on nev got to trust me take me into his confidence i think he liked the fact that according to my criminal record i didnt mind doing anything as long as it was profitable and it didnt take me long to work out that nev likes profit more than anything so its money with him not politics mmm not entirely maybe its both at the same time if he can get it that way if not then id say money comes out distinctly on top like i said nevs a greedy bastard greedy for power and greedy for cash first thing i found out when i got involved was that he was organizing some of his younger and thicker recruits into groups of thieves turning their gains over to him of course for the good of the league and they did this craig snorted sure they did lets face it most of these kids are pretty dense five or six of them would go into a shop say and as soon as steaming you know about it ive heard the term and i know its been a problem for west yorkshire cid recently along with muggings at cash dispensers i didnt know motcombe was behind it some of it im sure there are plenty of freelancers out there too but what nev does is he takes these kids anger and channels it he gives them someone to hate he gives their rage some structure and provides them with real targets rather than nebulous ones so they end up believing theyre committing theft assault and vandalism for a good cause isnt that what terrorism is basically all about anyway add a few olde worlde patriotic values a lot of guff about the true english homeland and a bit of green to the mix and it makes them feel like downright responsible and virtuous citizens the only ones who really care about their country you make it sound easy they turned right toward the neogothic mass of the rijksmuseum dark and solid against the night sky streetlights cast long shadows a breeze stirred wafting a smell of decay from the canal banks could hear music in the distance see tv screens flickering through peoples curtains craig shrugged its not as hard as you think thats the sad thing recruiting isnt anyway take rock concerts for example invitation only makes people feel privileged and exclusive right off the bat then the whitepower bands get the kids all worked up with their rhythm and energy and someone like me moves in to bring the message home and they target schools particularly schools that have a large number of immigrant pupils they hang around outside in the street and pass out leaflets then they hold meetings in different venues they also hang out in the coffee bars where some of the kids go on their way home you know start chatting give them a sympathetic shoulder for their problems with ali or winston they get a surprising number of converts that way some of whom motcombe organizes into gangs of thieves some yes but not all he laughed one or two of the lads in the know have nicknamed him fagin banks raised his eyebrows youve got to pick a pocket or two he sang a passable imitation of ron moody in oliver i imagine hed just love that craig smiled ill bet thing is theres a lot of money to be made one way or another steaming and mugging are just part of the bigger picture these rightwing political groups finance themselves in any number of ways some deal in arms and explosives for example then theres the rock angle these bands record cds that means people produce record manufacture and distribute them that can be big business and where theres rock theres drugs theres a lot of money to be made out of that motcombe has an arrest for receiving doesnt he yes his one big mistake a couple of his lads broke into a currys and ran off with a few videos and stereos under their arms they didnt tell nev where theyd got the stuff from anyway since then its been cash only and he skims off the top too ive seen him stuff the notes into his own pocket craig shook his head if theres one thing worse than a nazi its a bent nazi how does jason fox fit in was he one of the thieves craig paused and leaned on a bridge as they crossed to hobbemakade looking down at the reflections of the lights banks stood beside him and lit a cigarette it was quiet now apart from a few cars and the whir of an occasional bicycle no jason never went out steaming not his style too smart jason was a thinker he was good at recruiting at propaganda in general the thing about jason was he was basically an honest kid a straight dedicated nazi one of those boring fascists without vices craig laughed almost not exactly boring though in some ways he was naive in his sincerity and that made him almost likable almost but he was also more dedicated more driven than most of the others frightening see when you come down to it nevs not much more than a petty crook with delusions of grandeur jason on the other hand was the genuine article real dyedinthewool neonazi probably even read mein kampf i thought even hitlers most fanatical followers couldnt get through that craig laughed true have you any ideas as to why jason was killed was he involved in this drug deal they moved away from the bridge and headed down the street banks flicked his cigarette end in the water immediately feeling guilty of pollution no craig said not at all jason was violently antidrug in fact if you ask me thats where you might want to start looking for your motive because he certainly knew about it v another bottle of wine i shouldnt said susan placing her hand over her halffilled glass why not youre not driving true and youve just wrapped up a case you should be celebrating all right all right you silvertongued devil go ahead gavin grinned called the waiter and ordered a second bottle of chablis susan felt her heart give a slight lurch the way it did when she first jumped the strid at bolton abbey as a teenager it happened the moment her feet left the ground and she found herself hurtling through space over the deep rushing waters because that was the moment she had committed herself to jumping despite all the warnings so what had she committed herself to by agreeing to a second bottle of wine she took another mouthful of filopastry parcel stuffed with brie walnuts and cranberries and washed it down with the wine she had left in her glass it hadnt even been there long enough to get lukewarm already she was beginning to feel a little lightheaded but in a pleasant way as if a great burden had been lifted from her they were in a new bistro on castle walk looking west over the formal gardens and the river a high moon silvered the swirling current of water far below and frosted the tips of the leaves on the trees the restaurant itself was one of those hushed places where everyone seemed to be whispering and food and drink suddenly appeared out of the silence as if by magic white tablecloths a floating candle in a glass jar on every table it was also she thought far too expensive for a couple of mere dcs still you had to push the boat out once in a while didnt you she told herself just to see how far it would float she stole a glance at gavin busy finishing his venison he caught her looking and smiled she blushed he really did have lovely brown eyes she thought and a nice mouth so how does it feel gavin asked putting his knife and fork down the success i understand it was largely due to your initiative oh not really susan said it was teamwork how modest of you he teased but seriously susan it was you who found the killers name what was it mark something or other mark wood yes but superintendent gristhorpe got him to confess id still say you get a big gold star for this one susan smiled the waiter appeared with their wine gave gavin a sip to test then poured for both of them and placed it in the ice bucket good god susan thought an ice bucket in yorkshire what am i doing here i must be mad she had finished her food now and concentrated on the wine while she studied the dessert menu sweets her weakness why she was a few inches too thick around the hips and thighs but she didnt think she could resist nutty toffee pie and she didnt chief constable riddles pretty damn chuffed gavin said later as they tucked into their desserts and coffee sunday or not its my guess hell be down your neck of the woods again tomorrow dishing out trophies and giving a press statement as far as hes concerned this solution has gone a long way toward diffusing racial tensions well he was certainly keen to get everything signed sealed and delivered this afternoon ill tell you something else golden boy isnt exactly top of the pops as far as the cc is concerned whats new susan said and i told you i wish youd stop calling him that where is he by the way gavin went on rumor has it he hasnt been much in evidence the last couple of days not like him to miss being in at the kill is it hes taken some time off pretty inconsiderate time to do that isnt it im sure he has his reasons susan pushed her empty dessert plate aside mmm that pie was divine how very mysterious gavin said is he often like that sometimes he can be a bit enigmatic when he wants can the dci anyway im glad jimmy riddles happy but this just isnt the sort of solution that makes you feel exactly wonderful you know why not i cant help feeling a bit sorry for mark wood sorry i thought he was supposed to have kicked his mate to death yes i know isnt that about as vicious as it gets i suppose so but he was provoked anyway i dont mean that its not so much him i feel sorry for its his family he has a young wife and a baby poor devils i cant help but wonder how theyre going to manage without him he should have thought of that before he killed jason fox shouldnt he susan drank some more wine it tasted thin and acidic after the sweetness of her dessert i know she said but you should have seen where they live gavin its a dump thin walls peeling wallpaper damp cramped living space and its a dangerous neighborhood especially for a young woman alone with her baby gangs drugs and it was partly because he was defending his wife her race that he ended up killing jason gavin shook his head i never took you for a bleeding heart susan you cant allow yourself to start getting sentimental itll make you soft hes a villain and youve done your job now lets just hope the court puts him away where he belongs povertys no excuse plenty of people have it tough and they dont go around booting their pals to death my dad was a miner for crying out loud and more often out of work than in but that doesnt give me an excuse to go around acting like a yob if you want anything in this life you go out and get it you dont idle around moaning about what a bad hand youve been dealt i suppose so susan said she refilled her wineglass and smiled anyway enough of that cheers they clinked glasses cheers gavin said to success to success susan echoed why dont we pay the bill and go gavin said leaning forward his hand touched hers she felt the tingle right down to her toes ill walk you home susan looked at him for a moment those soft sexy brown eyes long lashes he had too all right she said her hand turning to clasp his yes id like that vi no more than a few hundred miles away over the north sea banks and craig mckeracher had passed the rijksmuseum and were walking down the quiet streets toward prinsengracht basically craig was busy explaining nev met this rightwing loony in turkey who had a load of heroin he wanted to shift and he wondered if nev could help nev couldnt of course he knows buggerall about dealing drugs doesnt know a fucking joint from a tab of acid but hes always one to leave the door a little ajar so he tells this bloke hang on a while let me see what i can do now theres only two people he knows with any brains who have ever had anything to do with drugs one of thems yours truly and the others mark wood banks paused wait a minute motcombe knew mark wood yes this is jasons business partner craig snorted some partnership thatd be there wasnt a lot of love lost between them as far as i could see is mark a member of the league craig shook his head no he wouldnt have anything to do with them then how mark and jason met on this computer course and they got on well enough at first they were both good at it too anyway when they finished mark couldnt get a job i understand hes got a wife and kid and lives in a shithole out castleford way so he was pretty desperate by then nev finances jason in the computer business only because he knows its something hell be able to use to his advantage down the line and jason decides hell take mark on as partner seeing as he came top of the class naturally because nevs putting money into the business hes curious about mark so jason arranges a meeting i wasnt there but i gather nev had got details of his record by then and quizzed him about the drug arrest what were the details mark used to be a roadie for a leeds band a mixedrace band like ub and one of the jamaicans a chapeltown bloke was into dealing in a big way used the group van and got mark involved they got caught end of story so nev finds out that mark has some contacts in chapeltown who might know someone wholl be interested if the price is right this wouldnt involve a bloke called devon would it craig raised his eyebrows yeah howd you know about him same source i heard about the steaming just a lucky guess carry on right well like i said living in this shithole with his wife and kid mark was definitely interested in making money even though he didnt give a flying fuck for nevs politics but he made a perfect gobetween devon and his mates probably wouldnt be any too happy if they knew their supplier was a fascist bastard who thought they should all be sent home to rot in the sun at best but mark got on with the black community okay and they seemed to accept him and he wasnt a member of the league banks nodded okay that makes sense they spotted a vendor at the street corner and as neither had eaten that evening they bought bags of chips with mayonnaise something banks would never think of eating back in eastvale here they tasted wonderful but how did jason square all this with his politics banks asked as they walked on you said he was dedicated straight he didnt thats the point ill get to it in a minute see in general neonazis arent only racist theyre also antidrug same way theyre antigay even though many of hitlers lot were homosexuals or junkies craig laughed you cant expect logic or consistency from these buggers ill give nev his due though normally he could make raping and murdering old ladies sound like a good thing to do for the cause a true politician a week or so later when marks out of the way he has another meeting with just me and jason and he tells us about this idea he came up with after traveling in america and talking to fellow strugglers there what he thinks is that by providing a steady and cheap supply of heroin you weaken and destroy the fabric of the black community making them much poorer and more vulnerable when the big day comes blahblahblah its his version of the smallpox blankets the whites gave the american indians or more recently that newspaper story about the cia financing the crack business in southcentral los angeles as a bonus the blacks become complicit in their own destruction thats the kind of irony nev cant resist and all the while he makes a tidy profit out of it too couldnt be better jason fell for this crap craig kicked at an empty cigarette packet in the street ah not exactly theres the rub motcombe needed one of us someone inside the league just to keep an eye on mark and make sure everything was going ticketyboo he didnt fully trust mark jason being marks partner seemed a natural choice but jason didnt go for it jason wasnt interested in profit hed have starved for the cause nev seriously underestimated his righthand mans dedication jason didnt fall for all that rubbish about weakening the community from within in fact he saw the scheme for exactly what it was a moneymaking venture on nevs part apparently he already suspected nev of skimming for his own gain and there was quite a little power struggle brewing between them they argued jason said he knew the organization needed money but this just wouldnt work that there was no way they could limit the sale to blacks that it would spread to the white community too and sap their spirit as well he said drugs were a moral evil and a pure aryan would have nothing to do with them he also said heroin wouldnt encourage the immigrants to go back home which is what the organization was supposed to be all about and that theyd be better concentrating on making the buggers feel uncomfortable and unwelcome than plying them with opiates impressive said banks but surely motcombe must have suspected hed react that way why did he even tell jason in the first place i think nev really did miscalculate the intensity of jasons reaction it would also have been pretty hard to keep anything like that from him nev fell in love with what he thought was his impeccable rhetoric and he figured the best thing was to bring jason in right from the start no way he thought could anyone not see the absolute perfection of his logic and irony at that point also remember hed no idea how violently antidrugs jason was it had simply never come up before craig shook his head i was there nev was absolutely stunned at jasons negative reaction what happened next they argued nev couldnt convince him in the end he said hed abandon the idea but he didnt no way too much money in it he just cut jason out but jason knew i think by then he was pretty certain nev wouldnt give up potential profits that easily so jason knew about the proposed drug deal and motcombe was worried hed go to the police that was always a possibility yes but even more of a threat was that hed talk to other ranking neonazis nevs peers and colleagues some of whom felt exactly the way jason did about drugs think about it if jason could convince them nev was nothing but a petty thief and a drug dealer then nev would never be able to hold his head up in the movement again hed be ostracized hypocrisy reigns in the far right every bit as much as it does in most other places theres another thing too whats that jason had charisma he was popular nev was coming to see him as a rival for power and power meant money for nev so nev was getting paranoid about jason it was jason who made first contact with most of our members it was jason they went to when they had problems with the ideology of beating the crap out of some poor black or asian kid jason who set them straight so jason was making inroads on motcombes position exactly banks nodded he found a rubbish bin and dropped his empty chip packet in it they were near keizersgracht now not too far from the hotel what was your role in all this like i said nev wanted someone close someone in the league to keep tabs on mark obviously jason wasnt going to do it so i was the next logical choice i hadnt been around as long as jason but i did have an impressive criminal record including drugs charges so what it comes down to is that motcombe had a pretty good motive for wanting jason out of the way craig nodded exactly thats why i needed to talk to you to fill you in on it all i dont know who killed jason i wasnt privy to that nev likes to keep his left hand and his right hand quite independent from one another but i do know the background they paused at a bridge a young couple stood holding hands and looking into the reflections of lights in the water where do you want me to go with this banks asked wherever it takes you i didnt have you brought here to tell you to lay off if thats what you think and its not a competition or a race whatever we can get motcombe for is fine with me and with superintendent burgess thats why he agreed to arrange this meeting all im asking is that you hold off moving against nev until youve got something youre certain will put him away for a long time he grinned oh and id appreciate it if you dont blow my cover i value my life and i might need to stick around awhile longer to see what he gets up to next when is this drug deal supposed to take place the heroins already on its way they reached the door of bankss hotel he thought for a moment then said all right appreciate it sir coming in no got to go im staying somewhere else take care then i will believe me they shook hands and craig wandered off down the canal banks looked up at the hotels facade it was still early he wasnt tired and didnt fancy sitting in a cramped room watching dutch television he also had a lot to think about zipping up his jacket against the chill he wandered off in search of a quiet bar vii susan put her hands behind her head rested back on the pillow and sighed was that a sigh of contentment gavin asked or disappointment she laughed and nudged him gently you should know you had something to do with it i did little old me and to think that not more than an hour ago shed had cold feet when they had got back to her flat she had asked gavin in and one thing led to another as she had known and hoped it would when she agreed to the second bottle of wine but when the crucial decision came out into the open there was an embarrassing moment when it turned out that neither of them had any protection well it was good in a way susan realized it meant that he wouldnt think she was a slut and she didnt think he had taken her out to dinner in the expectation of ending up in her bed but it was bloody awkward nonetheless luckily there was an allnight chemists on york road not more than a couple of hundred yards away and gavin threw on his jacket and set off while he was gone susan started to get nervous and have second thoughts instead of giving in to them she busied herself tidying up the place especially the bedroom throwing clean sheets on the bed and when he came back she found after a little kissing and caressing that her resolve was just as strong as before and now as she basked in the afterglow she was glad she had made the decision one of chopins piano concertos she didnt know which one played softly from the living room well i couldnt think of a better way to celebrate said gavin his hand brushed susans thigh and started sliding up over her stomach mmm me neither and ill tell you something else he whispered in her ear ill bet were having a better victory celebration than anyone even golden boy wherever he is something about the mention of bankss name gave susan a moment of uneasiness the way she had felt naked talking on the telephone to banks when the jason fox case started but it passed she smiled and stretched feeling a little sleepy from the wine and sex oh hes probably not having such a bad time she said he does all right what makes you think that you dont know where he is or what hes doing i do know where he is gavins hand rested on her breast he had soft hands like silk brushing her warm skin she felt her nipple harden you know his hand moved again downward susan gave a little gasp yes amsterdam hes gone to amsterdam lucky devil said gavin then he did something with his hand that made susan realize she wasnt all that sleepy after all eleven i finding jimmy riddle wearing out the carpet back at eastvale divisional hq had about the same effect on bankss stomach as the dodgy landing the plane had banked sharply and plunged into thick cloud by the time banks had seen the runway they were practically on it still at an awkward angle and for one stomachlurching moment he had been certain the pilot was coming in too steeply and would crash the plane wing first but it leveled out in time and apart from a little more bouncing and swaying than usual the landing had gone without incident and now an hour and a half later his stomach was going through the same cartwheels again it was late afternoon bankss flight had been delayed and he hadnt arrived at leeds and bradford until three oclock he hadnt even eaten lunch not much chance of a bite now he hadnt intended calling at the station but when he neared eastvale he couldnt face going back to the empty house immediately ah chief inspector banks said riddle ive been waiting for you nice of you to drop by sorry sir banks mumbled as riddle followed him into his office riddle tugged his trousers up at the knees to preserve the creases and sat on the edge of the desk looking down on banks banks supposed he took that position because he thought it gave him a psychological edge little did he know and take the bloody smirk off your face man riddle said have you any idea how much trouble youre in trouble sir yes banks serious trouble this time you bugger off for a weekend in amsterdam in the middle of a major investigation and leave your underlings to do your work for you and it so happens that while youre away they solve the case he smiled i must admit that does give me more than a little satisfaction with due respect sir with due nothing banks riddle craned his neck forward the tendons tautened and the skin around his throat flushed what the bloody hell did you think you were up to can you answer me that banks had tried to prepare himself for a moment like this on the flight back if truth be told though he had expected it to come from gristhorpe not riddle and there was a big difference it wasnt that he didnt trust riddle the man was squeakyclean it wasnt even that he suspected riddle of fraternizing with fascists that had only been a joke a bad one at that but whereas gristhorpe would accept bankss explanation at face value and let things lie riddle was too much of an interfering bastard to do that if banks told him what he had discovered from craig mckeracher riddle would be on the phone to his cronies all over the place in a matter of moments if there was any chance of glory to result from the situation he would want his due share and one wrong telephone call could have serious consequences for craig on the other hand if riddle could see nothing to be gained then he would order banks to pass on what he knew and leave it to west yorkshire riddle hadnt got to be chief constable by pursuing the truth against all odds the problem was someone in west yorkshire had already been leaking information to motcombe a dilemma then banks also knew that as far as riddle was concerned the case was solved most satisfactorily solved so it was with carefully measured tones that he answered the question aware even as he did so that it just wouldnt wash i cant tell you everything sir he said at least not just yet its very delicate but i can assure you my trip was directly related to the jason fox case riddle shook his head delicate too delicate for the likes of me no banks that wont do ive already told you the jason fox case was solved in your absence i know sir i read about it in the morning paper banks had picked up a copy of the independent at schiphol airport and had seen a full report on the arrest and confession of mark wood for the murder of jason fox including a quote from riddle to the effect that fox was killed by a friend of his in a dispute after several drinks while alcohol was certainly a factor race was not i am very pleased to say banks didnt believe it for a moment but im not sure thats how it happened he went on oh said riddle youre not sure thats how it happened arent you maybe if youd been here doing your job youd have a better idea about whats going on well let me tell you banks that is exactly how it happened your fellow officers got a confession out of mark wood while you were off cruising the redlight district no doubt banks had to admit that did hit a little too close to home in all fairness sir riddle stood up and went to lean on the filing cabinet checking for dust first dont talk to me about fairness banks ive been as fair with you as i can be ive given you more latitude more freedom to tilt at your own various windmills than ive allowed any man under my direct command and what have you done with that freedom youve abused it thats what youve done day trips to leeds to buy classical records and meet your bit on the side and now a weekend in amsterdam in the middle of a major investigation what do you have to say if youll allow me to get a word in sir banks said calmly in the first place my trip was entirely caserelated and in the second case you havent solved the jason fox case riddles pate went on red alert and im telling you the case is solved telling you banks but and who paid for this trip to amsterdam might i ask shit if banks told him it was the met riddle either wouldnt believe him or hed be on the phone trying to find out exactly who was behind it setting off alarms like a mad cow walking through a cambodian minefield besides dirty dick burgess the only one who could really vouch for him apart from craig was on holiday somewhere tropical i cant say sir he said i trust you didnt pay for it yourself then out of your own pocket no sir i thought not and your wife did she accompany you on this mysterious caserelated mission no sir your mistress perhaps or were you out there shagging the local girls banks stood up his irritation growing look sir im beginning to resent these implications you might be my senior officer but i dont have to put up with personal abuse from you riddle stepped forward chin jutting out like the prow of a ship youll put up with whatever i dish out laddie and right now im dishing out a suspension youre what you heard me banks im suspending you from your duties pending a disciplinary hearing into your activities you cant do that yes i bloody well can read the regulations i think skiving off for a long weekend during an important investigation is grounds enough for an inquiry dereliction of duty for crying out loud man youre a dci youre supposed to set an example banks sat down again a leaden weight in his chest i see this is official then official as it gets banks could hardly believe what he was hearing anger burned inside him red behind his eyes everything was fucked his marriage now his job for some reason this idiot had decided to persecute him it just didnt matter to riddle that there might still be unanswered questions in the jason fox case hed put his blinkers on and he wouldnt take them off no doubt pleasing the muslim community and the general populace simultaneously so thats it then he said im free to go yes in fact i order you to go riddle grinned youre suspended banks right i can tell youve been looking forward to saying those words for some time riddle nodded oh yes banks got up slipped his cigarettes in his top pocket and picked his jacket up from the coatrack next he picked up his briefcase but paused in front of riddle and laid it down on the desk again on his way to the door is that your last word on the subject sir he asked yes banks nodded then he swung his arm back as far as it would go and hit riddle hard right in the mouth riddle staggered back against the flimsy desk and slid to the floor which was where he lay shaking his head and wiping blood from his mouth with the back of his hand as banks said and ive been looking forward to that too sir goodbye then he left the station his knuckles aching and bleeding ii the minute susan heard raised voices arguing about amsterdam she tiptoed into the corridor like a sneaky schoolgirl to listen then she heard a loud crash and saw banks stalk out of his office and out of the building through the fire exit without even glancing in her direction the chief constable hadnt left though puzzled susan crossed the corridor and pushed bankss office door open then she just stood there chief constable riddle was getting up from the floor brushing dust from his uniform and dabbing his mouth with a bloodsoaked handkerchief he saw her standing in the doorway pointed and said get back to your office dc gay nothing happened you saw nothing do you understand yes sir er what about dci banks dci banks is under suspension susans jaw dropped back to your office riddle said again she noticed one of his front teeth was chipped and remember if word of this gets out ill know exactly where it came from and your career wont be worth two pennorth of shit sergeants exam or no sergeants exam yes sir back in her office susan leaned on her desk took a deep breath and tried to collect the thoughts that were suddenly spinning in her mind out of control had she really just seen jimmy riddle getting up off the floor in bankss office wiping blood from his mouth yes she had was that why banks had got suspended but riddle wanted her to keep it quiet so there had to be another reason he could have banks kicked off the force for assaulting a senior officer but it would have to be made public then she could understand riddles desire for silence easily enough he would look like a real wimp if he publicly accused one of his dcis of assault after all as susan well knew the police force was still very much a mans world and physical prowess was important to men riddle would feel humiliated by what had just happened it would be a blow to his macho ego the last thing hed want known was that banks four or five inches shorter than him and slighter in build had knocked him down if that got out people all over the region would be sniggering at him behind his back even more than they did now so he must have suspended banks for some other reason amsterdam was that it and then she realized something at first it was just a vague sense of apprehension then the tumblers fell into position one inexorably after the other then came the final click and the door opened susan looked at her watch just after five first she drove the short distance to bankss house as she drove she chewed on her lip wondering if she was doing the right thing she wished superintendent gristhorpe were here to advise her but hed gone off to teach a twoweek course at bramshill that morning she didnt even know what she was going to say to banks after all he was her senior officer what could she a mere dc do to help but there were things she wanted to know she had worked with banks for several years now and had come to know his moods pretty well she had seen him angry sad hurt and frustrated but she had never seen him like this nor would she ever have thought him the kind of person to do something as stupid and impulsive as punching jimmy riddle call it womans intuition a term she had a lot more respect for than she would ever care to admit in front of a roomful of male colleagues but she felt something was seriously wrong and it wasnt only to do with riddle all she could think of was that something had happened in amsterdam but what she walked up the front path to bankss semi standing on the doorstep she took a deep breath counted to three and rang the bell nothing happened she rang again still nothing she waited a few minutes more tried knocking and ringing the bell still nothing where the hell was he looking around she couldnt see his car she dashed down the path and jumped back in her golf she was starting to feel angry now not a good emotional state for driving but at least anger would sustain her all the way and help her do what she had to she headed out of town through the darkening countryside at a dangerous speed crossed over the a and headed southeast then hurtled through the dark through villages where families were just settling down to tea and an evening with the telly soon she was on the outskirts of northallerton pulling up outside gavins modest terrace house gavin answered on the first ring and smiled when he saw susan come in he said standing aside this is an unexpected pleasure susan walked into the hall and gavin leaned forward to plant a kiss on her cheek she jerked back and slapped him hard across the face gavin staggered back a step or two you bastard susan said you bastard how could you do it gavin looked surprised he held his hand to the reddening weal on his cheek do what what the hell did you do that for you know why no i dont look take your coat off and come through then you can tell me what youre on about susan followed him into the living room but she didnt take her coat off i wont be stopping she said ill just say what i have to say and go gavin nodded he leaned against the wall with his arms folded he was wearing tartan slippers susan noticed and looked ridiculous somehow that helped all right he said im listening and itd better be good after what you just did to me oh its good all right susan said it took me a while i dont know maybe im thick maybe im a fool but i worked it out in the end well you are supposed to be a detective after all but look i still dont know what youre talking about will you back up a little and explain susan shook her head youre so damn smooth arent you gavin you used me thats what i mean how did i use you i thought you enjoyed im not talking about sex im talking about information all the time we were going out together all the things i told you in private all the station gossip you passed it all on to jimmy riddle didnt you even what i told you in bed on saturday i dont know what youre talking about but he looked away from her eyes down at his slippers susan had seen that guilty gesture in enough criminals to know it meant gavin was lying yes you bloody well do she went on how else could riddle have known everything he did i should have twigged much earlier then maybe none of this would have happened what riddle suspended banks this afternoon dont tell me you didnt know gavin shrugged oh that well its the chief constables pre dont give me that crap you got me to talk about banks in private shop talk it was me who told you he liked to call at the classical record shop whenever he had to go to leeds when riddle mentioned that to me a few days ago i didnt even think at the time about where he might have got it from it was me who told you about pamela jeffreys too the violist involved in that case a couple of years ago the one he felt guilty about and on saturday night in bed i told you banks was in amsterdam my fault for being such a fool blame it on the wine but you you youre beneath contempt okay said gavin gazing at her coolly so the chief constable wanted to be informed about what was going on at eastvale so what hes like that unlike his predecessor he likes to be in the know hands on its easy for you you dont have to work close to him day in day out do you he pointed his thumb at his chest i do and we all have our careers to consider dont we whats so wrong with that susan could hardly believe what she was hearing even though it was exactly what she had expected so you admit it just like that you used me to spy on my colleagues well seeing as you have the evidence theres not a lot else i can say is there i can hardly deny it yes mea culpa i dont understand gavin how could you do that gavin shrugged i never thought it would come to anything like this he said for crying out loud it was only little tidbits nothing important like i said riddle just wanted to be kept informed but that wasnt why i asked you out in the first place that only came later when he found out i was going out with you and believe me i didnt tell him hes got quite a network has riddle he shrugged i didnt really think it would do any harm did he want to be kept informed about eastvale in general or dci banks in particular gavin shifted from foot to foot well he did ask about banks in particular he never really approved of banks you know thought he was a bit of a maverick if truth be told i know that said susan he never liked him right from the start i remember the deborah harrison case when banks upset some of riddles important friends he was just looking for something to use against him and you used me to get it for him thats what i cant forgive like i said i didnt really think i was doing anything oh stuff it gavin im not interested in your excuses you used me to scupper bankss career and thats all i care about if thats how you want to see it is there any other way i take it things are over between us then susan could only look at him and shake her head then she turned to leave what is it susan gavin called after her fancy him yourself do you you should listen to the way you talk about him like a lovesick teenager believe me it wasnt very difficult to get you talking about him the hardest thing was getting you to stop even in bed susan slammed the door behind her and got back in her car she couldnt move couldnt even turn the key in the ignition all she could do was sit there hands gripping the steering wheel shaking she took deep breaths and then susan did something she hardly ever did something she always hated herself for when it happened she started to cry bloody great convulsive sobs because fuck it she said to herself gavin was right she had never admitted it but she had known it for ages it was banks she cared about it was banks she fancied and dammit he was a married man he was her senior officer and he wouldnt look at her that way in a month of sundays she was just another stupid girl in love with her boss and there was no way she could stay in eastvale now not after this iii it had long since turned dark when banks got home for hours it seemed he had driven around the dales hardly noticing where he was or what music kept repeating on the cassette player his knuckles still hurt but the shaking inside had stopped had he really done it punched jimmy riddle he realized he had and he also realized that at the moment the anger had burst out of him it was sandra he had been thinking of not the bloody job the house was quiet and empty a different quality of silence and emptiness than he had ever felt there before first he had a look around to see if anything was missing sandra hadnt taken very much most of her clothes were still in the wardrobe the scent of her hair still lingered on the pillows and her photograph of the misty sunset above hawes still hung over the fireplace in the living room it made him think how only on sunday yesterday he had wandered the amsterdam museums in the rain a pilgrim marveling at rembrandts the night watch in the rijksmuseum unsettled by crows in the wheatfield in the van gogh museum and finally elated by the bright whimsical chagalls in the stedelijk museum all the while thinking how sandra would have loved it and how he would like to treat her to a visit one weekend in spring perhaps as a belated birthday present but sandra was gone he noticed the red light blinking on the telephone answering machine thinking it might be sandra he got up and pressed the replay button one call was vic manson two were hangups but the next four were from tracy on the last one she said dad are you there its sunday now ive been trying to ring you all weekend im worried about you if you are there please answer i talked to mummy and she told me what happened im so sorry i love you daddy please give me a ring banks stood by the phone for a moment head in his hands tears burning in his eyes then he did what any reasonable man would do in his situation he cranked mozarts requiem up as loud as he could bear it and got ratarse drunk twelve i when banks stirred on the sofa at about four oclock in the morning mozarts requiem was still playing on repeat and a more fitting piece of music he couldnt imagine it was playing loudly too and he was surprised that none of his neighbors had called the police still he was the police or used to be wishing he were still unconscious he groaned rubbed his stubble rolled off the sofa and put some coffee on turning the volume down on the stereo as he went then he stumbled upstairs and swallowed a handful of aspirins washed down with two glasses of water to irrigate his dehydrated brain cells back downstairs as the coffee dripped through the filter with frustrating slowness he surveyed the damage twelve cigarette ends in the ashtray no burns on the sofa or carpet about two fingers of laphroaig left if he was going to keep up this rate of drinking he would have to start buying cheaper scotch still it could have been a lot worse he concluded especially as he remembered the bottle had only been about threequarters full when he started when the coffee was ready he decided to switch from the requiem to the c minor mass something to bring a little more light and hope into his bleak world then he tried to collect his thoughts he had punched jimmy riddle that was the first memory to come back and he had skinned knuckles to prove it well that had been a stupid thing to do he realized now and it had also probably put the mockers on his career jobless then also wifeless and hung over at least the hangover would go away it could be worse couldnt it yes it could he realized he could have been diagnosed with a terminal illness he racked his brains to see if that had in fact happened but could find no memory of it it would probably happen today the way his lungs felt after all those cigarettes so what was he going to do become a private eye enter a monastery get a job with some security outfit or should he just carry on and solve the jason fox case on his own to run rings around jimmy riddle just as sherlock holmes did around inspector lestrade alan banks consulting detective had a nice ring to it he poured himself a cup of black coffee and flopped back on the sofa looking at the misty hawes sunset over the fireplace for some reason he remembered sandra telling him on thursday that there might have been somebody else but there wasnt remembered the faraway look in her eyes when she said it and that made him angry he pictured sandra with some strapping bearded young artist standing in the wind on the moors doing a cathy and heathcliff looking lovingly into each others eyes and exercising restraint no my darling we mustnt theres too much at stake think of the children grand passion collides with family values and moral responsibility it was a scene from a cheap romance but all the same it made banks clench his jaw what might have been and come to think of it he only had her word for it that she hadnt left him to run off with someone else someone she would only take up with publicly after a decent interval well two could play at that game banks had had his chances at infidelity in the past too but he hadnt taken them he hadnt romanticized them either he thought especially of jenny fuller there had been a time some years ago when something might have blossomed between them was it too late now probably jenny seemed to spend most of her time teaching in america these days and she had a steady boyfriend over there then there was pamela jeffreys the one riddle thought was his mistress banks hadnt slept with pamela either but it was an appealing thought so many choices so many possibilities then why did he feel so bloody miserable and empty because he concluded none of them was what he wanted what he wanted when it came right down to it was his job back sandra back and his hangover gone perhaps if he played a countryandwestern song backward he couldnt even do that hating country and western the way he did still taking stock of himself he realized that depressed as he was he felt calmer now than when he was stuck at the airport yesterday contemplating his return home thumping jimmy riddle probably had something to do with that after the first cup of coffee he realized he was hungry he hadnt eaten anything since that snack on the plane a million years ago now searching through the remnants of the fridge he managed to throw together three rashers of streaky bacon and two eggs only a week past their sellby date that would have to do the one remaining slice of bread was a little stale but it hadnt turned green yet and it would fry up nicely in the bacon fat cholesterol special so what as he fried his breakfast banks remembered tracys messages he would have to ring her today and put her mind at rest should he explain to her about losing his job too best not yet he decided it was bad enough his daughter should suddenly find herself the child of a broken marriage the minute she flew the coop let alone the child of a disgraced copper there would be time enough for that later he would have to phone brian in portsmouth too and his own parents they would all be upset suddenly the day ahead seemed full of things to do none of them pleasant the only bright spot was that he wouldnt have to worry about money for a while the suspension was with pay and jimmy riddle couldnt do a thing about that until after a disciplinary hearing he cursed as he broke an egg while lifting it onto the plate and yolk ran all over the counter it would have to do no more left carefully he used the spatula to lift the one unbroken egg onto the fried bread then patted the bacon with some kitchen roll to remove the excess grease and tucked in when hed finished he poured another cup of coffee and lit a cigarette it was still just past five in the morning and he hadnt a clue what to do to keep him occupied until it was a decent time to start phoning people sleep was out of the question now and he knew he couldnt possibly concentrate on reading a book or listening to music he needed something completely mindless something to keep his thoughts off his problems for a few hours like television but there was nothing on television at that time apart from something educational on bbc and a studio discussion on itv so he started sorting through the video collection odds and sods hed picked up over the years finally he found one that would do it was still in its cellophane wrapper so someone must have bought it for him as a present and hed forgotten he had it bridge on the river kwai perfect he remembered his dad taking him to see a revival of it at the gaumont when he was about twelve it would take him back to those days when life was simple and right at the moment he would give anything on earth to be that innocent twelveyearold again grabbing his fathers hand when jack hawkins burned the leeches off with a cigarette thrilling at the way all the birds flew up and the pool turned red with blood when they ambushed the japanese patrol and biting his nails to the quick as alec guiness made his final dying staggering way to the dynamite plunger yes the bridge on the river kwai might just keep the dark hounds of depression at bay for another couple of hours until daylight came ii susan didnt know where she was going when she left the station around eleven oclock that morning only that she had to get out of the office for a while let riddle suspend her too if he found out the next thing she knew she found herself on castle walk looking out over the formal gardens and the river all framed in the branches of the beeches it was the same view shed had from the bistro with gavin on saturday night just thinking about that night made her burn with shame and rage across the swain a belt of trees called the green partially obscured the east side estate but she could still make out a few of the light red brick terraces and maisonettes and the three twelvestory blocks of flats a crime wave in themselves poked their ugly heads way above the trees beyond the estate and the railway tracks were the chocolate factory and a few old warehouses corrugated metal roofs glinting in the sun a local diesel rattled by and blew its horn she would have to leave eastvale there was no doubt about that now that she had admitted her feelings to herself she could no longer work with banks she couldnt trust herself not to act like a lovestruck schoolgirl nor could she go running off in tears every time she saw him either and she would have to see him he might be suspended for the moment but a disciplinary hearing would probably reinstate him she thought it also hadnt taken her long to work out the fact that after what she had witnessed yesterday jimmy riddle would want her as far away from north yorkshire as possible at least that could be easily accomplished without raising any eyebrows although it did happen on occasion it was rare for a dc to be promoted straight to the rank of detective sergeant within the same station the most likely scenario was a transfer and at least a year back in uniform this was supposed to be a safeguard against corruption senior officers offering promotion in exchange for falsified evidence at first susan had hoped the chief constable would approve her request to stay but being promoted within eastvale cid didnt matter to her now she had to leave and the farther away the better devon and cornwall maybe she had fond memories of childhood holidays in that part of the world st ives torquay polperro how could she have been so stupid she asked herself again in cafés pubs and in bed she had chatted away to gavin about banks and his idiosyncrasies his love of music his guilt over the injuries to pamela jeffreys and gavin had turned it over to jimmy riddle who had twisted and perverted it beyond all recognition if anyone deserved to be suspended it was riddle and gavin fat chance an old woman walking a dog passed susan on the path and said hello after they had gone by susan paused a moment to sit on a bench she was facing north now and to her left she could see the square norman church tower the bus station and the glassandconcrete swainsdale centre straight ahead was the preroman site in the distance not much more than a couple of bumps in the grassland down by the river even though there wasnt a great deal to do around the station in the aftermath of the jason fox case susan didnt think she could honestly stay away too long after all a call might come in something important and if she missed it shed have to explain why she remembered something else she had overheard yesterday banks expressing doubts about the solution though she couldnt quite put her finger on exactly what there were things about mark woods confession that rang false with her too maybe she should have a look over the reports again so with a sigh she stood up and headed back around castle walk as she went up the stairs to cid she told herself she would have to get a grip lock up her feelings keep them separate and behave like a professional she could do it shed done it before on some level being a woman in a mans world she did it all the time she would also have to work out how to deal with bankss misplaced trust in her should she tell him about gavin could she really do that iii shortly after six oclock that evening banks sat in leeds parish church though not much to look at from the outside the interior had recently been restored to all its victorian gothic glory like the town hall all stained glass dark polished wood and high arches he wasnt there because his troubles had driven him to religion in fact he was listening to a rehearsal of vivaldis gloria by the st peters singers and chamber orchestra it certainly wasnt where he had expected to be or what he had expected to be doing when he woke up on the sofa that morning tracy had rung him much earlier than he would have thought of ringing her at least he was feeling a bit more human by then she was full of concern naturally and he tried to assure her that he would be okay tracy told him she was going down to croydon for a while to stay with her mother and grandparents but she assured him she wasnt taking sides he told her to go take care of her mother hed see her when she came back reluctantly she hung up maybe he hadnt lost tracy after all he felt the need to get out of eastvale around noon so he phoned pamela jeffreys as it turned out she had a rehearsal that evening but banks was welcome to attend she was surprised to hear from him and said she would be delighted to see him someone pleased to see him music to his ears he drove to leeds in plenty of time to browse the citycenter record shops first a couple of cds would be paltry compensation for the miserable time hed had lately but they would be better than nothing like the toy soldier his mother always used to buy him after hed been to the dentists by half past six the conductor seemed frustrated by the soprano sections inability to enter on time so he ended the rehearsal early pamela packed away her viola grabbed her jacket and walked toward banks she was wearing black leggings and a baggy black velvet top belted at the waist with a scoop neckline which plunged just above the curve of her breasts her long raven hair hung over her shoulders and the diamond stud in her right nostril glittered in the sidelighting her skin was the color of burnished gold her eyes almond in shape and color and her finely drawn red lips revealed straight white teeth when she smiled many of them were crowned banks knew looking at her now he found it hard to believe that only a couple of years ago she had been lying in a hospital bed covered in bandages wondering if she would ever be able to play again banks gave her a peck on the cheek she smelled of jasmine thank you for inviting me he said wouldnt have missed it for the world she turned up her nose we were terrible but thanks anyway and its nice to see you stranger sorry i couldnt stick around after the pearl fishers banks said thats okay i was knackered anyway long day what did you think wonderful she grinned for once youre right everything seemed to fit together that night sometimes it just does that you know and nobody knows why banks gestured around the church im surprised you have time for this st peters oh if the schedules work out all right i can do it i need all the practice i can get ive been recording the walton viola concerto too with the orchestra for naxos finally the violas getting some of the respect it deserves you were the soloist she slapped his arm no not me you idiot im not that good the soloist was lars anders tomter hes very good im really glad its all working out for you anyway pamela smiled and made a mock curtsy thank you kind sir so where now banks looked at his watch i know its a bit early but how about dinner fine with me im starving curry pamela laughed just because im bangladeshi it doesnt mean i eat nothing but curry you know banks held his hands out whatever then brasserie fortyfour no not there pamela said its far too expensive theres a new pizza place up headingley just off north lane ive heard its pretty good pizza it is then im parked just over in the calls you can have curry if you really want banks shook his head and they walked through the dimly lit cobbled backstreets to the car they were in the oldest part of leeds and the most recent to be redeveloped most of the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury warehouses by the river aire had been derelict for years until the civicpride restoration schemes of the eighties now that leeds was a boom town they were tourist attractions full of trendy new restaurants usually located on something called a wharf the kind of word nobody there would have used twenty years ago canary wharf had a lot more to answer for than vanished fortunes banks thought its not that i think you eat curry all the time because youre asian he said its just that there isnt a decent curry place in eastvale well there is one but i think i might be persona non grata there at the moment anyway pizza sounds great what did you get pamela asked as she got into the cavalier and picked up the hmv package from the passenger seat have a look said banks as he set off and negotiated the oneway streets of the city center the beatles anthology i never would have taken you for a beatles fan banks smiled its pure nostalgia i used to listen to brian matthew do saturday club when i was a kid if i remember rightly it came on right after uncle macs childrens favourites and by the age of thirteen id got sick to death of sparky and the magic piano little green man and big rock candy mountain pamela laughed before my time besides my mum and dad wouldnt let me listen to pop music didnt you rebel i did manage to sneak a little john peel under the bedclothes once in a while i hope youre speaking metaphorically banks drove past st michaels church and the original oak just opposite the streetlights were on and there were plenty of people about students for the most part a little farther on he came to the junction with north lane an enclave of cafés pubs and bookshops here said pamela pointing banks managed to find a parking spot and they walked around the corner into the restaurant the familiar pizza smells of olive oil tomato sauce oregano and freshbaked dough greeted them the restaurant was lively and noisy but they only had to wait at the bar for a couple of minutes before they got a tiny table for two in the back it wasnt a great spot too close to the toilets and waiters route to and from the kitchen but at least it was in the smoking section after a while sipping the one glass of red wine he was allowing himself that evening and smoking one of the dutyfree silk cuts hed picked up at schiphol banks hardly noticed the bustle or the volume level anymore so have you got a boyfriend yet he asked when they were settled pamela frowned too busy she said besides im not sure i trust myself to get involved again not just yet hows your wife sandra isnt it yes shes fine after a while of small talk their pizzas came bankss margherita and pamelas fungi hows life at the cop shop pamela asked between mouthfuls i wouldnt know said banks ive been suspended from duty he hadnt intended to tell her certainly not with such abruptness but it had come out before he could stop it he couldnt seem to hold back everything in a way he was glad hed said it because he had to confide in someone her eyes opened wide as soon as she had swallowed her food she said what good lord why as best he could he told her about the jason fox case and about thumping jimmy riddle arent you still angry she asked when hed finished banks sipped some wine and watched pamela wipe a little pizza sauce from her chin the people at the next table left the waiter picked up the money and began to clean up after them not really angry banks said a bit perhaps but not a lot not anymore what then disappointed with what myself mostly for being too stupid not to see it coming and for thumping riddle i cant say i blame you from what youve told me oh riddles an arsehole no doubt about it he even suggested that i took you to amsterdam with me me but why he thinks youre my mistress pamela almost choked on a mouthful of pizza banks didnt feel particularly flattered afterward he couldnt tell if she was blushing or just red in the face from coughing come again she managed finally patting her chest its true he thinks ive got a mistress in leeds and thats why i keep making up excuses to come here but how could he know i mean i know what you mean dont ask me banks smiled felt his heart skip but went on anyway aiming for a light tone it didnt seem like such a bad idea pamela looked down he could see hed embarrassed her im sorry he said that was supposed to be a compliment i know what it was supposed to be pamela said then she smiled dont worry i wont hold it against you please do he almost said but managed to stop himself in time he wondered if she would take him home with her if he told her that he and sandra had split up they ate some more pizza in silence then pamela shook her head slowly and said it just sounds so unfair fairness has nothing to do with it banks pushed his plate aside and lit a cigarette oh sorry he said looking at the small slice left on pamelas plate thats all right im full she pushed hers aside too this neville motcombe you mentioned isnt he the bloke who was interviewed in the yorkshire post this weekend something to do with neonazis disrupting a funeral thats the one didnt someone die there yes said banks frank hepplethwaite i knew him slightly oh im sorry its okay we werent close friends or anything its just that i liked him and i think of anyone hes the real victim in this whole mess tell me something have you ever come across motcombe in any other context what you mean with me being the sort of person this albion league might target partly yes she shook her head not really ive been lucky i suppose oh ive been insulted in the street and stuff you know called a paki bitch or a paki slut its always paki cant they think of anything else but that banks smiled thats part of their problem severely limited thinking no originality i suppose so im not saying it doesnt bother me when it happens it does it upsets me but you get used to it i mean it starts not to surprise you as much so you dont get shocked by it as easily but it still hurts every time like hot needles being stuck through your skin sometimes its just the way people look at you am i making any sense perfect i remember once when i was a kid back in shipley oh this must have been in the seventies twenty years ago now and i was walking back from my aunts house with my mum and dad we walked around this corner and there was a gang of skinheads they surrounded us and started calling out racist insults and shoving us there were about ten of them there was nothing we could do i was terrified i think we all were but my dad stood up to them called them cowards and shoved them right back at first they just laughed but then they started to get worked up and i could tell they were getting ready to really hurt us my mother was screaming and i was crying and they got my dad on the ground and started kicking him she trailed off and shook her head at the memory what happened pamela looked up and smiled through her tears would you believe it a police car came by and they ran off a bloody police car about the only time the police have ever been there when ive needed them must have been a miracle they both laughed the waiter came by and took their plates what now pamela asked after shed wiped her eyes from the mingled tears of humiliation and laughter coffee dessert she hit him on the arm again i dont mean that idiot i mean you your future looks bleak id rather concentrate on dessert just a cappuccino for me banks ordered two cappuccinos and lit another cigarette youre smoking too much pamela said i know and just when id managed to cut down anyway you havent answered my question what question was that you know quite well your future what are you going to do banks shook his head i dont know yet its too early to say well surely when this chief constable person has done his investigation hell have to reinstate you i doubt it even if a disciplinary hearing really does reinstate me it doesnt matter why not think about it said banks i hit the chief constable even if he does keep that just between the two of us it still means i cant work with him anymore hed find ways to make my life a living hell i understand it might make things difficult difficult it was difficult before all this after he shrugged impossible more like the restaurant was full of students now they looked like an artsy literary crowd all talking excitedly about the latest music arguing loudly about books and philosophy they made banks feel old made him feel he had wasted his life a waiter passed by carrying plates leaving a trail of garlic and basil smells but you can get a job somewhere else pamela said i mean as a policeman in a different region cant you i suppose so i dont mean to be negative pamela i just havent thought that far ahead yet i understand she leaned forward and put her hand on his candlelight glittered in her diamond stud made shadows of burnished gold and lit the fine down between her breasts banks swallowed and felt his excitement rise he wanted to take her home and lick every inch of her golden skin or did he there would be consequences confidences shared a relationship he didnt think he could handle anything like that right now pamela sat back and flipped a long tress of hair over her shoulder with the back of her hand what about this case you were working on she asked you seemed to imply that its not over everyone thinks it is and you banks shrugged she toyed with a gold bracelet on her arm look alan this person you talked about earlier mark wood did he do it i dont know he might have done but not i dont think the way he said he did or for the reason he claimed does it matter yes it could mean the difference between manslaughter and murder and if someone else was behind it say neville motcombe id hate to see him get away with it while mark wood takes the fall alone if you were still on the force would you be working on this case probably not the chief constables got his confession everybodys happy case closed but youre not on the force thats right so that means you can still work on it if you want banks smiled and shook his head what impeccable logic but i dont think so i cant do it pamela im sorry its over pamela sat back and studied him for a moment he reached for another cigarette thought twice about it then lit up anyway remember when i was hurt she said yes and thought i might never play again banks nodded well if id taken your negative attitude i wouldnt have played again and believe me there were times when giving up would have been the easiest thing in the world but you helped me then you encouraged me you gave me strength and courage when i was at my lowest id never had a friend like someone who didnt want she turned away for a moment when she looked back her eyes were deeply serious and intense glistening with tears and now youre giving up just like that i dont believe it not you what else can i do you can follow up on your ideas on your own but how i dont have the resources for a start someone will help you youve still got friends there in the department havent you i hope so well then i dont know maybe youre right banks gestured for the waiter and paid waving aside all pamelas attempts to contribute my idea my treat he said so you will do something you promise me you wont just sit around at home and mope yes i promise ill do something he scraped his chair back and smiled now come on let me take you home thirteen i the first thing banks needed to do he realized in the cold light of wednesday morning was spend a few hours going over all the paperwork on the jason fox case especially that which had been generated in his absence he realized he had missed a lot over the weekend and there were things he needed to know if he was to make any progress on his own but how could he get hold of it nobody was going to kick him out of eastvale station he didnt think but neither could they let him just walk in and take what he wanted there wasnt even a crust of bread left in the house and he didnt fancy eating sandras leftover cottage cheese so he made do with coffee and vaughan williamss serenade to music for breakfast as he let the sensuous music flow over him he thought about last night when he had dropped pamela at her flat he had half hoped she would invite him up for a drink but she just thanked him for the lift said she was tired and hoped she would see him again soon he said he would call and drove off with a pang of disappointment about not getting to do something he probably wouldnt have done anyway even if he had had the chance but seeing her had been good for him at least she had persuaded him to keep working on the case when the music finished he picked up the phone and called sandra in croydon he had been thinking of calling last night when he got in but decided it was too late her mother answered alan how are you doing oh not so bad considering you about the same look er im really sorry about whats happened do you want to speak to sandra please just a minute she sounded embarrassed banks thought as he waited not surprising really what could she say her daughter had left her husband and come home to sort herself out banks had always got on well with his motherinlaw and he didnt expect she was going to see him as a monster now but nor was she going to chat with him about his feelings over the telephone alan it was sandras voice she sounded tired he felt the icy hand squeeze his heart now he had her on the line he didnt know what to say yes i er i just wanted to know if you were okay of course im okay i wish you hadnt called but why why do you think i told you i need time to work things out this doesnt help it might help me i dont think so i spent the weekend in amsterdam you did what in amsterdam it was strange it brought back a lot of memories look do you remember alan why are you telling me this i dont want to talk about it please dont do this to me to us im only im going now dont hang up alan i cant deal with this im going now can i speak to tracy there was silence for a while then tracy came on the phone dad its you i was worried im okay love your mother shes upset dad honest i dont understand whats happening any more than you do all i know is mums confused and she says she needs some time away banks sighed i know that i shouldnt have called shes right tell her im sorry and tell her i yes never mind look does brian know about all this im sorry i havent been very organized other than you i havent called anyone else its all right dad you dont have to apologize to me i suppose its hard to know what to do when something like this happens i mean its not exactly something you can take a course on is it god she sounded suddenly so mature banks thought much more mature than he felt right now does he yes we talked to him over the weekend hows he taking it cool you know brian hes okay when am i going to see you im staying the rest of the week down here but ill come up for the weekend if you want you will the icy hand relaxed its grip and bankss heart warmed a little of course you know i love you dad i love you both i told you yesterday im not taking sides please dont think because i came down here that i think any less of you i dont anyway the weekend would be great tracy hesitated you wont be at work all the time will you i er no i dont think so banks answered no point telling her about his suspension he thought the last thing he needed right now was his daughter feeling even more sorry for him from a distance ill pick you up at the train station what time does your train get in it gets back to leeds midafternoon but ill need to drop by the residence first there might be messages i shouldnt really have taken off like that ive only just started there im sure theyll understand i hope so so why dont i come down to leeds and pick you up at the student residence does that sound like a good idea thatd be great what time about six be okay fine and well stop at the kings head in masham for something to eat on the way back great and dad what take care of yourself i will see you on friday goodbye goodbye banks hung on to the receiver for a while after the line went dead then he swallowed took a deep breath and dialed brians number in portsmouth after six rings a sleepy voice drawled uh yeah who is it did i wake you dad yes well yeah as a matter of fact you did but its all right i should be getting up anyway next lectures at ten whats up i gather youve heard about your mother and me yeah its too bad are you okay im doing fine and mum i just talked to her shes a bit confused right now but shell be okay great whats going to happen i dont know she says she needs some time away shell come back dad youll see i hope so just wait and see shes just having a midlife crisis thats all shell get over it kids banks couldnt help but smile right and how are you fine hows your classes all right hey dad the bands got a couple of gigs coming up next weekend paying gigs brian played in a local blues band banks thought he was a pretty good guitar player thats great just dont let it get in the way of your studies i wont dont worry gotta go now or ill be late for the lecture when are you coming up ill try to get up to see you before christmas okay fine if moneys a problem ill pay for your ticket thanks dad thatd be a great help gotta go goodbye bye dad and hang in there hang in there like a kid from some american television program banks smiled as he hung up well that was enough family business for the moment he thought he knew he should phone his own parents and tell them what had happened but he couldnt face them yet theyd be really upset all these years they had loved sandra like the daughter they had never had if anyone was likely to blame him for what had happened it would be his own parents not sandras he thought ironically no best wait maybe sandra would come up with tracy at the weekend then he wouldnt have to tell them anything he poured some more coffee and put on the beatles cd that hed bought in leeds yesterday it was the second of the three anthologies and hed been thinking of buying it ever since it came out he went straight to the second disc outtakes from strawberry fields forever his favorite singing along he tidied up a little but soon started to feel restless and caged somehow it didnt feel right to be home during the daytime watching neighbors walk back and forth with shopping and the unemployed bank clerk across the street wash his car for the second time in a week it was time for action he picked up the telephone dialed the station and asked to be put through to dc susan gays extension she answered on the second ring susan banks said its me sir are you is everything all right he was sure she meant it but her voice sounded tight and cool im fine is jim there no hes out on the east side estate another breakin the super away at bramshill good sorry i didnt mean that to sound like it did look i know i shouldnt ask you this but do you think you could do me a favor sir i need to look over the stuff on the jason fox case again all of it from the crimescene photographs to mark woods statements can you help can i ask why youre still interested sir because im not satisfied will you help me there was a long pause then susan said why dont you come to the station is that a good idea its pretty quiet here right now the supers going to be away for a couple of weeks well if youre certain i dont want to get you into trouble banks heard a sound like a harsh cough or bark at the other end are you all right fine frog in my throat thats all its okay sir really it is are you sure if jimmy riddle turns up if jimmy riddle turns up im buggered i know that but theres far too much stuff to photocopy and that would look suspicious especially the way you have to account for every penny you spend around here these days ill take the risk if you will sir all right but id still like to know why youre not satisfied ill tell you about it when i know more myself at the moment its mostly just a feeling that and a few bits of information about mark wood i picked up in amsterdam why dont you just come to the station as soon as you can then ill be waiting and she hung up hurriedly banks grabbed his coat and left the house it was another sunny day with a little high cloud and a slight chilly edge the leaves had turned a little more than last week and some were beginning to fall already he needed the exercise so he decided to walk he plugged in his earphones and turned the walkman on billie holiday singing strange fruit he walked along market street past the roundabout the zebra crossing garage and school the local shopping center with its safeway supermarket and collection of smaller shops and banks there was a lot of traffic on market street today and the acrid smell of petrol and diesel fumes mingled with dry dusty air he paused across from the jubilee whose large stoneandredbrick frontage curved around the junction of market street and sebastopol terrace that was where jason fox had spent his last evening on earth before being dispatched to whatever circle of hell was reserved for racists why on earth did it matter who had killed him or why banks wondered as he walked on wasnt it good enough that he was dead was it only bankss insatiable bloody curiosity that made it so important or was there some absolute standard of justice and truth to be served banks had no answer all he knew was that if he didnt get to spin it out until he thought it was all over then it would stay with him like a sore that wont heal and he knew that in some way it was the murder of frank hepplethwaite he was out to avenge not jason foxs one or two pairs of curious eyes followed him up the stairs at the station but nobody said anything susan was in her office waiting for him with a thick pile of papers in front of her i feel like a schoolboy sneaking a look at naughty pictures banks said can i take them to my office of course said susan you dont have to ask my permission she stood up look i appreciate this no problem susan is sorry sir ive got to go she dashed out and left him standing in her office well he thought it didnt take long to become a pariah around here did it but he could hardly blame susan for wanting to put a bit of distance between them not after all that had happened and she had put herself out to help him checking to see that the coast was clear he tiptoed across the corridor to his own office with the papers and shut the door behind him nothing had changed even the desk was still at the same odd angle after riddle had fallen back on it embarrassed at the memory of what hed done banks straightened it sat down with the pile of papers packet of cigarettes and ashtray beside him window a couple of inches open and settled in to read ii what the hell am i doing here susan wondered as banks stood aside and held the door of the duck and drake open for her why did i agree to this i must be insane the duck and drake was a small hideaway in skinners yard one of the many alleys off king street wedged between an antiquarian bookshop and the victoria wineshop it had a narrow frontage and not much more room inside one advantage was that it was one of the few pubs that still had a snug a tiny room handy for private conversations the doorway was so low that even banks had to stoop inside the snug was all dark wood beams and whitewashed stone walls hung with brass ornaments an old blackleaded fireplace took up almost one entire wall above it ran a long wooden mantelpiece with a few tattered leatherbound books they had the snug to themselves banks bought the drinks and sat against the wall opposite her a small table between them sipping her st clements susan could hear the occasional kerchunk of the fruit machine and chink of the cash register coming from the other rooms if they wanted the barmans attention they had to ring a little bell on the bar it was an altogether too intimate and cozy setup for susan but there was nothing she could do about it banks had been right in that the queens arms was far too public a place for them to meet and he was clearly oblivious to her discomfort drinking his sam smiths old brewery bitter and chewing on a cheeseandonion sandwich susan had no appetite at all between mouthfuls he told her about what he had discovered in amsterdam susan listened frowning and biting her lower lip in concentration when banks had finished she said it makes sense sir but how does it change things we already know mark wood killed jason he admitted it banks finished his sandwich sipped some sam smiths and reached for his cigarettes yes he said ive just read through his statements the kids a pathological liar hes confessed to manslaughter but if im right it was murder premeditated murder i dont see how you can prove that theres the rub according to the postmortem report jason fox was hit on the back of the head with the beer bottle right susan nodded thats where dr glendenning found the most damage to the skull and the glass fragments but in his statement mark wood said he hit jason on the side of the head i noticed that said susan but quite honestly sir i didnt think much of it he was confused under pressure basically he was saying he just lashed out yes i understand that the point is that doesnt happen in a fight sir stand up banks edged out from the bench the room itself was just about high enough for him to stand up in there was no one else around susan got to her feet and stood facing him almost close enough to feel the warmth of his body she concentrated on the demonstration focusing on little details he didnt look well she noticed he had dark bags under his eyes and his face was pale there was also a deep sadness in him that she had never noticed before pretend to hit me on the back of the head with an imaginary beer bottle he said i cant sir susan said not from this angle jason must have had his back to wood walking either in front of or beside him or he must at least have been partly turned sideways like this banks turned sideways yes sir banks went back to his seat and lit a cigarette been in many fights he asked no sir but that let me finish i have at school and believe me you would never get your opponent to stand in that position not willingly not unless youd hit him with your fist first and knocked him sideways maybe thats what happened banks shook his head again listen to what youre saying susan to do that hed have to have been holding the beer bottle in the same hand he punched fox with and then swung back very quickly and hit him before he moved even if he had the beer bottle in the other hand and switched after hed hit him it still doesnt make sense and remember jason was no slouch when it came to physical strength youd need every advantage to get the better of him let me ask you a question yes sir was mark wood bruised in any way did he have a black eye or a cauliflower ear no youd expect something like that wouldnt you if hed been in an actual fight especially with as tough a customer as jason fox are you telling me jason didnt even get one punch in i dont know sir perhaps he hit wood in the body where it wouldnt show and not in the face i mean we didnt do a strip search or anything banks shook his head im sorry but its just not on i had another good look at the crimescene photographs as well and i reread dr glendennings postmortem report it just couldnt have happened the way mark wood said it did well susan said slowly superintendent gristhorpe wasnt entirely convinced either but mark said jason fox was goading him about his wife and kid they neednt have faced off to start fighting mark probably just lashed out when hed had enough i suppose you saw it for yourself in the statement but when we pushed wood on exactly how and when it happened he said it was all a blur he couldnt remember how very convenient he also denied emptying jason foxs pockets two loose ends thats the thing that bothered me most sir but we just assumed that either he lied because it would look bad for him too deliberate stopping to empty jasons pockets instead of running off in a panic or maybe someone else came along later and robbed fox while he was lying there id go for the first explanation myself it just didnt fit with the scenario he was painting for you but why take his keys as well unless they might have led to easier identification i think whoever did this wanted to keep the victims identity from us until they had a chance to clear out the rawdon house of any dodgy files or notes he might have kept there and they werent taking any chances we just thought that if some opportunist came along and did it he simply took everything you know just sort of scooped it all up quickly without pausing to separate the keys from the loose change susan shrugged chief constable riddle didnt seem to be worried by any of this and by then we had him breathing right down our necks its still two loose ends too many for me then i dont know where that leaves us sir what about motive banks told her about marks connection with motcombes drug deal and jasons disapproval so you think motcombes behind it she said i do but proving it is another matter officially the case is closed you got an easy conviction that pleased jimmy riddle that and the opportunity to suspend me i made a mistake there i didnt expect youd solve the case so quickly that hed be buzzing round the station all weekend to be honest i didnt expect hed find out where id gone sir susan blurted out feeling her heart lurch into her throat can i tell you something banks frowned and lit another cigarette yes of course what is it susan chewed on her lip for a while just looking at him unsure now whether she dare speak out or not then she took a deep breath and told him all about gavins betrayal when she had finished banks just sat quietly staring down at the table she was afraid of what he might say especially as she could no longer deny to herself the way she felt about him please god she prayed let him never find out about that im sorry sir she said banks looked at her a sad crooked smile on his face never mind it wasnt your fault how were you to know your boyfriend would run off and tell tales to jimmy riddle whichever way you look at it sir i still betrayed a confidence forget it how can i do that look how its turned out it isnt over yet susan im far from finished it must have hurt you this betrayal im sorry susan looked down into her empty glass fancy another drink banks asked no sir im fine really well i fancy another pint banks went to the bar and rang the bell while he was waiting to get served susan sat hunched in on herself feeling miserable no matter how bloody kind and forgiving banks might be she could never forgive herself for what she had done it wasnt so much the betrayal itself as the humiliation of letting herself be fooled and used by a bastard like gavin so what do you want to do she asked when he came back i mean about mark wood i see from the paperwork that woods solicitor was called giles varney thats right a real arrogant bastard expensive too it seemed a bit odd at the time that he would get varney to come all the way from leeds yes wood also said something about him being jasons solicitor too the one who helped them get the business set up he didnt want a duty solicitor he was adamant about that interesting banks sipped his pint wiped his lips and said and fishy you know i wouldnt be at all surprised if varney is motcombes solicitor too or at least works for the same firm ill have to give ken blackstone a call and check now according to the reports it was only when the blood evidence came back that wood confessed right yes sir it would have been pretty difficult to lie his way out of that one did he have a private conference with varney make phone calls yes sir we did it all strictly according to pace banks nodded so wood talked to varney then he made a telephone call then he confessed yes sir who did he call i dont know it was made in private we should be able to find a record of the number ill bet you a pound to a penny it was neville motcombe ill bet he told motcombe he was well and truly up shit creek and motcombe talked to varney who then told him to plead manslaughter but why would he do that isnt it obvious you had him against the ropes i mean fine early blood evidence doesnt necessarily mean a hell of a lot but wood knew hed done it and both he and varney probably knew it was just a matter of time before we got results from dna testing and that theyd be positive in the meantime if mark wood admits to a lesser charge of manslaughter denying that hes ever even met motcombe then the heats off it was just a fight that went wrong and you can also bet that varney will milk as much sympathy from the jury as he can from the fact that the fight started over jason fox making racist remarks about mark woods wife and child all motcombe has to promise is that wood will get a short sentence and that his family will be financially taken care of while hes inside that and a nice bonus when he gets out i think its an offer id probably take if my balls were in the wringer like woods are if he pays a penny yes i suppose he could renege and arrange for an accident in jail im assuming hes not doing all this out of the kindness of his heart hes doing it because wood has something on him like the truth about what happened what can we do about it if youre right we cant do anything susan remember youre still on the force but youre off the case i on the other hand can do whatever i want but banks held his hand up susan i appreciate what youve done so far but i dont want to risk getting you into trouble again even superintendent gristhorpe wouldnt approve if he knew what i was up to he would if you told him sir i told you he had his doubts too but jimmy riddle just barged in and steamrollered everything i know but the supers not here its better this way for the time being believe me what next then banks looked at his watch next i think ill get right back to basics and pay george mahmood another visit theres something missing from those statements some connection im missing and its starting to irritate me it might be worth eating a mouthful or two of humble pie to find out what it is iii banks walked down king street toward the mahmoods shop as he passed school lane he could hear kids shouting on the rugby pitch and was almost tempted to go and watch he had enjoyed rugby at school and when he first joined the met hed been a pretty good winger if he said so himself strong slippery and fast is this what private eyes feel like he wondered as he cut down along tulip street on the northern edge of the leaview estate walking the mean streets of eastvale he didnt even have a license to validate what he was doing how did you go about getting a privateeye license in yorkshire did you even need a license he did however still have his warrant card riddle hadnt had the chance to ask for it and banks hadnt managed the cliché of slapping it down on the table he supposed it would be an offense to use it while under suspension but that was the least of his worries the builders were busy at work in the fields around gallows view mixing concrete climbing ladders with hods resting on their shoulders or just idling around chatting and smoking cigarettes soon the row of old cottages would be swallowed up banks wondered if theyd change the name of the street and the fields when the new estate was finished gallows estate probably wouldnt sit too well with the local council for banks approaching the mahmoods shop felt like coming full circle not only had the jason fox case led him there but his first case in eastvale had involved the previous owner and the way things looked this might be his last case george stood behind the counter wearing his white shirt with its nehru collar serving a young woman with a baby strapped to her breast when he saw banks he scowled his mother shazia came over from the freezer area where shed been stamping prices on packages of frozen pizza though she only came up to bankss shoulders her eyes challenged him what do you want this time mr banks havent you caused enough trouble around here as far as i know i havent caused any trouble mrs mahmood not intentionally at any rate i have a job to do a small lie he realized had a job would be more like it i have a job to do and its sometimes difficult im sorry it has caused you pain oh are you such as throwing my son in a cell overnight worrying his poor parents to death mrs mahmood george wasnt thrown anywhere and he exercised his right to make a telephone call if he didnt ring you she waved her hand impatiently oh yes he rang us all right but we still worried a young boy being put in jail with all those criminals he was in a cell by himself look i dont know where youve got this from and only because of his color dont think we dont know thats why you pick on us banks took a deep breath look mrs mahmood im getting sick of this we took your son in because he and his friends had an altercation with the victims party on the night of the killing because they live in pretty much the same area of town because they refused to cooperate with us and because we found something suspicious on georges trainer suspicious animal blood we didnt know that at the time it could have been human blood she shook her head my son would never hurt anyone im sorry but my business isnt always as trusting as it might be and what about the second time wasnt that persecution my colleagues turned up a witness who said he saw george and his two friends beat up jason fox what could they do but he was lying yes but again we didnt know that at the time so why have you come here pestering us all over again its all right mother george said walking over the woman with the baby seemed torn between leaving and staying to eavesdrop on the conversation she took a long time putting her change back in her purse then banks gave her a sharp glance and she scurried out murmuring comforting sounds to the baby who had started to cry can we go somewhere and talk mohammed banks asked george nodded toward the stockroom in the back of the shop im going to call a solicitor mrs mahmood said no need to mum said george i can handle this banks followed him into the back the stockroom was full of boxes and smelled of cumin and shoe polish there were no windows or if there were they were covered by the stacks of boxes a bare bulb shone in the center of the room banks fancied it looked rather like a filmmakers idea of one of those interrogation rooms from the old days hed seen a film not too long ago in which two detectives had actually sat a woman in a chair with two bright desk lights pointed at her hed never tried that in interrogations himself he wondered if it worked what do you want george said there wasnt a trace of friendliness in his voice whatever friendship there had ever been through brian was gone now i need your help george snorted and leaned against a stack of crates arms crossed thats a laugh why should i help you to find out who really killed jason fox who cares from what ive heard the racist bastard deserved everything he got besides i read in the paper that his mate confessed isnt that good enough for you im not going to argue with you will you just answer a few straightforward questions please he shrugged all right no skin off my nose but hurry up cast your mind back to that saturday night at the jubilee why were you there george frowned why to listen to the band why else kobir was up visiting from bradford like i said so asim and me thought hed enjoy it i understand the jubilee has a good reputation for music yeah girls yeah its a good place to meet girls and drugs if youre interested in that sort of thing im not people come from miles around so and it was really busy that night yeah well scattered dreams are really popular theyre pretty new on the scene and they havent got to the really expensive venues yet but theyre already recording for an independent label pretty soon youll be paying through the nose to go see them at wembley or somewhere okay now apart from that little contretemps you had with jason did you notice anything else about him and his pal never paid any attention really except that they seemed to be talking pretty intensely a lot of the time arguing not loudly not sos youd notice but they didnt look too happy with one another did they try to chat up any girls not that i saw they werent listening to the music not really some of the time but they were sitting toward the back closer to the bar we were near the front but the way the chairs were angled around the table they were pretty much in my line of vision when they werent talking the other one the one that killed him would seem to be listening but the one that got killed even put his fingers in his ears every now and then what kind of music was it george shifted position and put his hands in his pockets hard to describe really sort of a mix between rap reggae and acid rock thats about the best i can do no wonder jason had put his fingers in his ears banks thought he obviously hadnt known what kind of music to expect but mark wood probably had did you see either of them talk to anyone else george frowned no i was far more interested in the music than in those two pillocks the shop bell pinged id better get back and help my mum my dads down at the cashandcarry just a couple more questions please okay but hurry up what about those jamaicans selling drugs you mentioned when i first talked to you what about them was that true yes of course it was i suppose i should admit i dont know for certain they were from jamaica but they looked like rastas and one of them had dreadlocks and the drugs i saw a bit of money change hands now and then then one of them would talk on his mobile a while later hed nip outside and bring back the ecstasy or crack or hash or whatever from the person who was carrying it they dont carry it on them thats how they usually do it and you saw them doing that sure you think i should have reported it you think the police dont know whats going on you told me yourself the jube has a reputation for drugs im sure the drugs squad are quite well aware of whats going on it doesnt sound as if these lads are major dealers though were they regulars id never seen them before doing good business by the looks of it george sneered some of the white kids think its cool to buy from spades were they with anyone they were with the band as far as i could tell a few connections started to form in bankss mind this was the link that had been eluding him were they actually playing with the band george shrugged no maybe roadies or something hangerson the bell pinged again look id better get back really right just one more thing did you see any contact at all between the jamaicans and jason or mark what that would have been hardly likely would it i mean wait a minute what once when i was going for a piss i saw them pass one another in the corridor anyway now i think of it they sort of nodded at each other very quick like and expressionless i thought it was a bit weird at the time then i forgot about it who nodded at whom the kid who confessed he nodded at one of the jamaicans like i said i thought it was odd because he was with the bloke who called me a paki bastard and there he was on nodding terms with a rasta so this was after your little conflict with jason fox yes that makes sense banks muttered mostly to himself you were very nicely set up come again oh nothing just thinking out loud banks followed george back into the shop thanks for your time mohammed he became aware of shazia mahmood glaring at him as he walked out onto the street for a moment banks just stood there on gallows view as the chaotic thoughts settled into some sort of pattern like iron filings when you hold a magnet under them motcombes drug deal with the turk and devon using mark wood as a gobetween mark woods jamaican wife marks connection with a reggae band and with drug dealing scattered dreams that signal between wood and the drug dealer jasons death warrant there was a pattern all right but now he had to come up with a way of proving it banks set off toward king street a pneumatic drill from the building site broke the silence and sent a pack of scavenging sparrows spiraling off into the sky fourteen i ken youre a mate said banks so i want to let you know before you agree to anything that im under suspension bloody hell blackstone nearly spilled his drink it was thursday lunchtime and they were in the city of mabgate a pub near millgarth finishing bowls of chili whats it all about blackstone asked when hed recovered his equilibrium banks told him blackstone shook his head they cant make it stick he said it sounds like a personal vendetta to me it is but dont underestimate personal vendettas ken especially when chief constable jimmy riddles the one carrying them out and for the record id appreciate it if you didnt tell anyone else around here where i was over the weekend it could mean real trouble for craig mckeracher blackstone tilted his head and squinted at banks are you hinting that one of our lads is bent banks sighed look theres no evidence but it seems clear that someone most likely someone from west yorkshire is doing a few little favors for neville motcombe and his league of merry men blackstones expression hardened are you certain no not certain it just seems to be the most obvious explanation as far as i know so far its just been a matter of accessing criminal records if you use the pnc you wouldnt have to be in west yorkshire to do that ill admit but thats where motcombe lives logical deduction brilliant my dear holmes said blackstone but ve haff vays of finding out whos been using the pnc and what theyve been looking for ill catch the bastard and have his bollocks for golf balls maybe its a her maybe but how many women do you find hanging around with these whitepower groups not a lot it inclines me to believe theyve got more sense well not many of them like playing soldiers thats for certain i dont know what odds id take against how many of them actually agree with some of the stuff motcombes lot comes out with though anyway can i ask you one more favor ken go ahead youre doing pretty well for a suspended copper so far thanks dont move on the mole until ive played out my hand why not same reason i asked you to keep quiet about amsterdam it could jeopardize craigs cover as rupert francis or even his life i dont think motcombes the forgiving sort blackstone squirmed and scratched the back of his neck okay my lips are sealed want to tell me more banks told him about motcombes gangs of steamers and muggers then about the turkish connection and the possible heroin deal with devon the deal that mark wood was to play such a big part in blackstone listened without comment shaking his head every now and then thats quite a conspiracy he said finally it makes me wonder about this suspension business do you think theres anything more to it like what blackstone paused a moment more sinister remember when john stalker got taken off that investigation into the rucs shoottokill policy in northern ireland a few years back yes i seem to remember they mocked up some story about him consorting with criminals just to shut him up and stop him embarrassing them it was all political banks shook his head a week or two ago i might have been paranoid enough to agree with you he said the old conspiracy theory has its appeal especially when dirty dick burgess appeared on the scene and it wouldnt have surprised me if jimmy riddle had been in the bnp at the very least but i dont think so whatever he is riddle isnt a cardcarrying fascist hes just a pushy bullheaded arsehole a frustrated headmaster with a mean streak put him on the innercity streets where the real coppers work and hed shit himself in five minutes maybe so but youre certain theres nothing more to it pretty much hes been looking for an excuse to nobble me ever since he took the job and now he thinks hes found it okay so how can i help im going to ask you a couple more favors and i want to give you the chance to say no i dont want you to stick your neck out for me im giving you fair warning blackstone paused then said go ahead ill tell you if i dont want to hear any more or when fair enough banks lit a cigarette the way i see it though is that most of whats going on here is on your patch anyway so you can regard me as informant consultant whatever the hell you like as far as official records go blackstone laughed clever bugger thought it all out havent you youd have made a good lawyer all right im interested i only hope you dont expect paying thats all banks smiled this is for free ken first off id like to know whether a solicitor called giles varney has ever acted for neville motcombe there might be some record in the paperwork on that receiving charge or better still last thursday after that fracas at frank hepplethwaites funeral someone got motcombe out of halifax nick pretty damn quickly blackstone got his notebook out how dyou spell that banks spelled varney for him blackstone smiled well that ought to be easy enough to do without compromising my career the next request might be a bit tougher and ill understand if you say no there was a band from leeds playing at the jubilee in eastvale on the saturday jason fox was killed theyre called scattered dreams someone who was there told me that there were a couple of jamaicans dealing small quantities of hash crack and ecstasy apparently they might have been with the band in some capacity roadies hangerson what have you blackstone nodded a lot of small dealers are mobile now theyve saturated the urban markets and it makes sense theyd target places where theres loud music and lots of kids i think ive heard of the jubilee is that the one that advertises in the evening post thats the one i suppose the drugs squad keeps tabs on these bands and their itinerant dealers i hope so said blackstone though you never quite know what the ds is up to theyre a law unto themselves half the time anyway banks went on ticking off on his fingers mark wood had passing contact with one of these lads at the jubilee my thinking is that they might have been in this together first off i need to know if this band is the same one mark wood roadied for a couple of years back when he was arrested on the drugs charge blackstone nodded and then id like the names of the jamaicans who were on the fringes of scattered dreams that night if you can get them i know that might be a bit more difficult i can only try said blackstone actually i know a bloke on the drugs squad who can keep his mouth shut we did some courses at bramshill together a few years back bloke called richie hall hes a jamaican himself and hes done a fair bit of undercover work over the years anyway the point is he knows the music and drugs scene up north better than anyone i know if he doesnt know who they are nobody does great there might even be a short cut mark woods wifes jamaican her maiden name is shirelle jade campbell they seem to have met up around the time wood got involved with the band and im wondering if there isnt maybe a family connection a brother cousin or something at least that gives you a name to work on ill pass it on to richie like i said if anyone knows richie does you sure you dont mind doing this ken blackstone shook his head nah what are mates for ill warn you though youll be bloody lucky to get anything out of these lads even if we do track them down i know that actually if im right i was thinking of a slightly more devious approach to the truth but lets wait and see shall we just as long as your expectations arent too high who knows there might even be a bit of glory in this for me banks smiled maybe whatever happens therell be no brownie points for me from jimmy riddle but i promise you if theres any credit to be taken its yours and lunch is on me will you do me one small favor alan name it just be bloody careful thats all ii by nine oclock on friday morning banks felt edgy and restless alone in the house he was pleased with himself however for avoiding the booze completely on thursday evening and for actually managing to finish the power and the glory as he listened to beethovens late quartets so he felt full of energy when he woke up on friday there was nothing he could do until he heard from ken blackstone except pace the floor when his phone rang at about half past nine he grabbed the receiver on the first ring yes banks here alan its ken what have you got some answers for you i hope in answer to your first question yes giles varney is neville motcombes solicitor and has acted for him on a number of occasions their professional relationship goes back to the time motcombe started buying property in the leeds area about four years ago it seems like theyve been bosom buddies ever since does varney have any other known rightwing connections yes i checked around and hes pretty well known in some of the more extreme right circles great that would seem to indicate that mark wood did a deal with motcombe through varney anything else this is where it gets a bit more complicated im afraid and you owe me i had to spend yesterday evening in a pub with richie hall and he drinks like a bloody fish ill be sending you the bill banks laughed find anything out yes the band mark wood worked with at the time of his first arrest was called cloth ears they split up shortly after the drug bust but this scattered dreams was formed partly from the ashes phoenixlike you might say apparently the blokes youre interested in used to play with cloth ears but now they just hang around the fringes of scattered dreams and sell dope seems drugs have sapped whatever talents they might once have had and most of the time theyre too stoned to strum a chord and you were right about the family connection the one with the dreadlocks is shirelle woods brother wesley campbell and the others a mate of his called francis robertson wes and frankie as theyre known locally both of them have been seen to associate with devon recently according to richie lowlevel dealers looks that way excellent and in shirelle woods favor richie says shes not connected with any of this in fact she stopped talking to her brother wes as soon as she discovered he was involved in getting mark busted the first time and she hasnt talked to him since cut him off completely good for her banks thought there were very few people he had come to have respect for in this whole business frank hepplethwaite was one of them and shirelle jade wood was another pity about her husband he should have followed her lead and cut off communications with wesley campbell too but no mark wood thought he could make an easy fortune and it was a sad thought that shirelle and connor would be the ones to suffer the most if the truth did come out thanks ken banks said youve done a great job no problem now for the hard part he heard blackstone sigh somehow i had a feeling there might be more to it than this i assume this is your cunning plan for getting to the truth banks laughed hear me out ken then let me know if you think we can do it iii about an hour later banks drove down to leeds alone there was no point involving susan gay or jim hatchley in his scheme it was risky and could backfire then hed have their jobs on his conscience too ken blackstone would be fine he was simply carrying out an investigation on his own patch based on information received the fact that banks was along for the ride really didnt matter banks lit a cigarette and turned up the volume on bryn terfels renditions of robert louis stevensons songs of travel he looked at the digital clock eleven oclock plenty of time to do what he had to and pick up tracy at the residence by six oclock as he pulled up behind millgarth he looked at his watch just after twelve if ken blackstone had done his work everything ought to be set up and ready to roll by now he checked at the front desk and went straight up to blackstones office in the corridor outside the cid offices as arranged sat mark wood who had been brought in from armley jail shortly after bankss ninethirty talk with ken blackstone just to answer a few more questions and help make the paperwork flow more smoothly apparently wood had been more than willing to show his cooperation and even though hed been sitting there for probably a couple of hours already he hadnt asked for giles varney yet if he did theyd have to lie and tell him they couldnt get in touch with varney present the plan would be useless mark wood didnt look like much banks thought muscular yes but basically just another sullen nervous kid chewing his fingernails in a police station banks introduced himself they hadnt met before and it was important that wood know someone from eastvale was involved in all this as expected wood looked puzzled and confused when he asked banks why he had come down all this way banks said it was nothing to worry about he would find out in a while he sounded like a doctor about to tell a patient he has a terminal illness leaving wood under guard in the corridor they went into ken blackstones office where wood could watch them through the glass partition if he wanted though he couldnt hear what they were saying that would make him even more nervous especially if they glanced his way once in a while as they spoke they had been standing behind the glass chatting about leeds uniteds abysmal season and occasionally looking at mark for about fifteen minutes when three large uniformed officers led wesley campbell and francis robertson along the corridor as arranged the two had been passive and compliant when picked up over an hour earlier ken said that was either a mark of confidence that theyd be out again in two shakes of a lambs tail banks thought or they were too stoned to care both had been found in possession of small amounts of marijuana and neither had had time to flush it down the toilet so they had been languishing in the charge room for a while by now they werent quite as complacent as they passed mark wood they glanced down at him and mark looked even more confused his eyes widened with fear campbell actually struggled against his guards for a moment and tried to get closer to wood as if he wanted to warn or threaten him but the guards held on campbell and robertson were taken to separate interview rooms around the corner both seemed to know the pace regulations by heart and they asked to make their phone calls immediately at about two oclock after banks and blackstone had enjoyed a leisurely lunch across the road it was time to start they went back upstairs and took mark into an interview room it was agreed that banks being more familiar with the case would do most of the questioning blackstone would give the occasional prod if things got slow they werent taping this one there would be time for formalities later with banks well out of the way if the plan worked if it didnt then all hell might break loose as far as disciplinary actions were concerned banks had already warned ken and given him the option of staying well away but ken had insisted on being involved well mark said banks i know we havent met until today but ive had a great interest in you ever since i saw jason foxs body a couple of weeks ago ive told the police all about that wood said ive pleaded guilty to manslaughter whats all this about banks raised an eyebrow its not quite settled yet he said not to my satisfaction anyway wood folded his arms i dont know what you mean first you leave me hanging about in the corridor for hours now you start interrogating me im not saying anything i want my solicitor mr varney well well see what we can do for the moment though i suggest you hold your horses mark and listen to me certain new evidence has come to light that puts an entirely different complexion on the jason fox killing oh whats that then banks jerked his head toward the door weve just had a long chat with mr campbell and mr robertson and theyve told us some very interesting things like what like the truth about what you did to jason fox i dont know what youre talking about oh come on mark surely you can do much better than that im not saying a word listen to me then according to your brotherinlaw mr campbell an old mate of yours from the cloth ears days the two of you were commissioned by neville motcombe to get rid of jason fox jason had become a major risk in a heroin deal you were planning and a serious threat to motcombes power motcombe couldnt get any of his own members to do it because jason was too popular with them instead he got two of the people who were already involved in the drug deal one from each side so to speak two people who also stood to gain a lot i should imagine devon wanted one or two of his own lads along just to make sure you did what you agreed didnt he from what i hear hes not the kind of bloke to take undue risks how am i doing so far woods eyes widened you know about devon jesus christ does he know about this does he know im here have wes and frankie been talking to him shit if devon thinks im talking to the coppers hell fucking kill me banks ignored him when scattered dreams played at the jubilee it gave you the perfect opportunity jason was going to be in eastvale anyway he had a football match in the afternoon so you told him you were coming up and that the two of you could go see the band maybe it would be a chance to settle your differences and talk a bit of business try to save the partnership somehow id imagine you were compliant more than willing to make compromises you knew scattered dreams werent jasons cup of tea but suggested he might like to broaden his horizons a bit who knows maybe you promised to go to the next celtic warrior concert if he gave your lot a try jason had been to the jubilee before and he had mentioned that a couple of pakistani youths went there on a fairly regular basis im only guessing at this part but i think hed already chucked a brick through one of their windows and hed said he was looking for trouble with them perfect for you if something like that happened in public wasnt it a bonus as long as it was just a minor incident enough to draw just a bit of attention anyway according to mr campbell you accompanied jason toward the ginnel where he and mr robertson were waiting at the other end to render any necessary assistance according to them you whacked jason on the back of the head with the bottle a couple of times and he went down after that you managed to kick him to death all by yourself they didnt have to do a thing and that mark with two eyewitnesses to testify against you makes it murder wood turned pale thats not true he said it didnt happen like that at all theyre lying banks leaned forward what didnt happen like what mark it was like i said there was just me and jason we got into a fight he slagged off sheri and connor i didnt mean for him to die banks shook his head im afraid that storys gone right down the toilet now mark along with all your other stories let me see if i can get them right he began counting them off on his fingers looking toward ken blackstone who nodded at each one first you werent anywhere near eastvale the night jason got killed second you were at the jubilee but you never went anywhere near the ginnel third you were there and you saw george mahmood and his mates kill jason and fourth you killed him yourself in a fair fight how am i doing so far wood licked his lips and shifted in his chair problem is mark banks went on youre a liar the only version we have any independent corroboration of is the one i just put to you the one mr campbell told us about so it looks as if thats the way its going to go down now he paused then went on after this interview di blackstone and i will be having a word with crown prosecution service about changing the charges from manslaughter to murder that carries a much longer jail sentence as im sure you know you cant be serious you cant believe those bastards why not i certainly cant believe you look at your track record mark no im afraid this is the end of the line for you you get charged with murder now and you dont get out of jail for a long long time in fact by the time you get out your wife will have run off with another bloke long since and your kid will have grown up and forgotten you in the meantime youll be fending off the arsebandits in wormwood scrubs or strangeways and thats if you last that long i suspect both devon and neville motcombe have long reaches wood seemed to shrivel to draw in on himself like a bank of ashes collapsing banks could tell he was trapped he knew lies wouldnt save him now but he didnt know the best course of action time to tell him time to give him a ray of hope after pulling the carpet from under him give him a foam mattress to land on theres only one way out for you mark he said whats that marks voice was no louder than a whisper the truth right from the top how will that help im not saying itll get you off scotfree nothing will do that we dont have the power to make deals with criminals reduce their sentences in exchange for information that only happens on american tv shows but i can guarantee itll make things easier for you wood chewed on his knuckles for a few seconds then said i need protection theyll kill me my family too we can help you with that mark if you help us mark rubbed his nose with the back of his hand i never meant to kill him he said honest i didnt it was those two he was close to tears who frankie and wes what happened mark right from the beginning banks took out his cigarettes and offered mark one he took it with a shaking hand all right he said but what guarantee have i got that things will go easier for me if i tell you the truth what are you offering me youve got my word said banks for what that you and your family will be protected and that your cooperation will be considered i want relocation for me and sheri he said and new identities the witness protection program thats what i want ive already told you this isnt america mark we dont do things that way in england look like i said im not telling you youre going to walk out of here a free man youre not one way or another youll serve some time what im saying is that if you give us what we want the charge can remain manslaughter not murder it doesnt sound like that good a deal to me well it is ken blackstone chipped in the difference is between say twentyfive years in a very nasty place where youll be vulnerable to anyone devon or motcombe cares to send along and maybe five in minimumsecurity prison protected environment telly and conjugal visits thrown in he glanced at banks who nodded your choice mark its as simple as that wood looked between the two of them and his gaze finally settled on banks again what about sheri and connor well take care of them make sure theyre safe said banks you have my word what about it wood looked at blackstone again who assured him that banks was right then he rested back in his chair and said all right okay neville motcombe approached me several weeks ago and said he knew about my record for drugs offenses at first i didnt know what he was getting at then it became clear that hed made a contact for getting his hands on some pretty large amounts of heroin through turkey at a rockbottom price and he hadnt a clue what to do about it drugs just werent part of his gig but he saw a way to make a lot of money and fuck up the niggers in the bargain as he put it he really does talk like that makes you sick anyway he found out about my drug bust and decided i was to be the gobetween what was in it for you something in the region of fifty thousand quid over a period of a few months if all went well maybe more in the future if the supply didnt dry up he leaned forward and gripped the sides of the chair look you can judge me all you like but have you any idea what that would have meant to sheri and me it would have got us out of that fucking prefab for a start and it would have given me a good chance at expanding the business buying some uptodate equipment making something out of it and all i had to do was play gobetween for motcombe and devon he laughed it was a bit of a joke on motcombe too he didnt know sheris jamaican and that his money would actually be going to help one of the people he wanted to destroy didnt that bother you mark that he was intending to cause so much suffering in the west indian community that was just a load of bollocks he came up with for jasons benefit he was after profits pure and simple takes one to know one something like that anyway once you get heroin out on the streets theres no telling what color your buyers will be is there theres no color bar on h even jason knew that like i said i thought it was funny that sheri and connor were going to get some benefit from this banks shook his head so you agreed wood nodded under motcombes instructions i met with wes then with devon they never met neville didnt know who he was i called him mr h anyway we talked about prices delivery schedules methods of getting the stuff into the country the lot then devon said hed think about it a few days later he got in touch with me through wes and told me to let mr h know we were in business i suppose motcombe got in touch with his blokes in turkey i didnt have anything to do with that end of the operation and they set things in motion there were huge profits in it for everyone devon wouldnt stop at leeds hed be shifting stuff to bradford sheffield manchester birmingham you name it somehow or other that seemed to resolve the problems on both sides motcombes about dealing with darkies and devons about dealing with a whitey like me mark snorted great healer of race relations greed isnt it and where does jason come in motcombe made a big mistake there i could have told him but he didnt ask he seemed to think jason would just love the idea i mean i dont think theyd ever talked about drugs or anything other than league business before but jason was straight even with motcombes justification he wouldnt go for it motcombe got worried that jason would spread the word among his colleagues in the movement and theyd chuck him out and put jason in charge instead i suppose you know neonazis arent really supposed to be into drugs banks nodded then there was the matter of the money to be made anyway motcombe got paranoid especially as jason had gained a lot of respect in the movement and people looked up to him for guidance and leadership jason was fast becoming a loose cannon on the deck so motcombe decided things would be better all around with jason out of the way he knew i was desperate for the money and he also knew me and jason didnt get along so he asked me if i could arrange for the jamaicans to do away with him that way he said if they happened to get caught itd only be two less niggers to worry about you have to give the guy credit at least hes consistent i didnt want to do it i mean im no killer i know jason and me had our problems but i didnt want to see him dead you have to believe that i had no choice what happened banks asked mark ran his hand over his head like motcombe asked i talked to wes and i told him jason was involved in the turkish end of the deal and that he was planning to rip devon off i also said he turned out to be a racist bastard a member of some loony fringe group well i couldnt tell him the truth could i i had to make something up pretty quick and it had to cover whatever publicity might come about when you found out who jason was wes went back to devon who ordered it done just like that no questions asked and he also stipulated that i had to be in it with them a sort of test of faith i suppose i didnt want to do it i just didnt have any fucking choice theres always a choice mark right sure easy for you to say that it came down to me over jason sheri and connor over jason what would you have done like i said jason and me werent close and the bastard did get on my nerves with all that nazi shit who came up with the plan that was down to me you know the rest motcombe wanted it done out of the way i mean he knew youd find out who the victim was eventually and what organization he belonged to but he needed time to get his files out of jasons house he sent two of his blokes to do that anyway scattered dreams were playing in eastvale and jason had mentioned possible trouble with some pakistani kids who went there told me hed already chucked a brick through one of their windows it couldnt have been better what about the actual killing how did it happen wood swallowed frankie and wes were waiting at the other end of the ginnel as wed arranged and when i hit jason with the bottle they came forward and started booting him i kicked him a couple of times to make it look like i was with them all the way but only a couple of times and not very hard he wood stopped for a moment and put his head in his hands christ he begged us to stop i just thought about connor and the damp walls and the yobs that taunt sheri call her a black bitch and threaten to gangbang her every time she goes to the shops i didnt think about jason lying there till it was too late you have to believe me i didnt mean to kill him it was wes and frankie theyre fucking maniacs theyd been out in the van smoking crack all right mark said banks calm down tell me what happened when we first arrested you why did you change your story mark shifted in his chair well the evidence it was getting pretty strong against me i was up shit creek so when varney took me aside i phoned motcombe and basically explained the situation what did he say to tell you it was just a fight between the two of us to leave him out of it and hed see i got the best legal help available hed also take care of sheri and connor financially while i was inside if it came to that what a laugh motcombe taking care of a black woman and a mixedrace kid but he didnt know that no and i didnt tell him have you talked to him from jail a couple of times but even then he seemed very nervous what did you talk about getting my story right when it came to court did you talk to devon no hes keeping a low profile i phoned my brotherinlaw though wes what did you talk to him about i told him who mr h was where he lived just in case something went wrong and motcombe didnt keep up his end of the bargain you know like maybe when he did find out sheris black and all then he wouldnt help them i needed some sort of insurance okay mark i need to know just one more thing before we start taking fresh statements and making this all official yes will you testify that neville motcombe instigated this conspiracy to murder jason fox woods lips curled motcombe bloody right i will no way that bastards going to get away with it and devon mark looked away i dont know thats different id need some sort well see you and family are protected mark like i told you earlier ill think about it okay okay banks smiled i think that just about wraps it up for now thanks mark youve been a great help what happens to me now you make your official statement then you go back to armley eventually therell be committal proceedings and a trial but well cross those bridges when we get to them in the meantime well make sure youre protected banks looked at his watch just after threethirty then he turned to ken blackstone for the moment though i think its about time we paid mr motcombe another visit iv leaving one of blackstones most trusted dcs to take mark woods official statement banks and blackstone set off in the cavalier for motcombes house most of the journey they talked about getting enough evidence together for the cps to take on motcombe im still not sure about this banks said driving along through pudsey i cant help feeling im jumping the gun how bloody longs motcombe likely to get for conspiracy to commit murder thats assuming we can prove it giles varney will whittle it down to conspiracy to assault if hes got any brains we might be better off leaving him to the drugs squad hed get longer for dealing heroin and i promised craig mckeracher id wait till i had something really solid before i moved in ken blackstone shook his head at this point i dont think we have much choice weve got evidence we have to act on mark wood has actually named motcombe as one of the blokes who requested jason foxs murder now woods blurted it all out we have to go ahead i dont think hell get such a light sentence and this way we also get wes and frankie in the bargain and maybe even devon too thatd be a real plus maybe so said banks i hope youre right besides blackstone added id say were best getting motcombe off the streets as soon as possible and none of what were doing blows craig mckerachers cover what weve got all came from mark wood banks turned down the hill to motcombes house and they got out of the car the sky was clear and the countryside shone green and gold and silver a chill wind from the valley whistled around their ears as they stood and knocked at the front door no answer whats that noise blackstone asked straining his ears banks could detect a faint whining above the sound of the wind sounds like an electric drill or something he must be down in the workshop thats why he cant hear us lets try the back they walked around to the back of the house which overlooked the valley and parkland the sound of the drill was louder now banks hammered on the back door still nothing just on the off chance he tried the doorknob it opened mr motcombe he called out as the two of them walked down the stairs to the workshop were coming in he began to feel a slight shiver of trepidation it looked dark at the bottom and they could be walking into a trap motcombe could have a kalishnikov or an uzi with him he might be hiding in a dark corner ready to start blasting away at them but still they advanced slowly toward where the sound was coming from then banks noticed something odd the highpitched whine the drill was making hadnt changed the entire time theyd been there surely if motcombe was working on something and really couldnt hear them there would be variations in the pitch of the drill when he stuck it into a piece of wood for example and if he was making so much noise when he worked he would hardly leave the back door unlocked so that anyone could walk in would he banks felt the back of his neck tingle at last they approached the workroom and pushed the door open slowly on the brightly lit room motcombe was there all right his body hung at an awkward angle naked to the waist his poloneck tunic hanging in shreds around his hips as if it had been ripped or cut off his left wrist had been wedged in a vise which had been tightened until the bones cracked and poked through the flesh blood caked the oiled metal the smell of blood and sweat mixed with iron filings shaved wood and linseed oil and cordite the room felt crowded claustrophobic even with only the two of them there three if you counted the dead man the drill lay on the workbench banks didnt want to touch it but he wanted the sound to stop he went over to the wall and pulled out the plug using a handkerchief carefully and hoping he wasnt smudging any valuable prints old habits die hard somehow he doubted that there would be any people who do things like this dont leave fingerprints the scene was a gruesome one more so because of the unnaturally bright lights that motcombe had rigged up so he could see clearly what he was working on what banks at first took to be bullet holes in motcombes chest and stomach turned out on further examination to be spots where the drill had been inserted when the bit stopped spinning he could see it was clogged with blood and tissue motcombes right arm was practically in shreds striped with lacerations patches of skin hanging off as if hed been flayed someone had obviously shredded the flesh with a saw cutting deep into the muscle and bone banks noticed the blood and chips of bone on the edge of a circular saw that lay on the floor beside the body the coup de grâce looked like two gunshot wounds to the head one through the left eye and the other in the middle of the temple both leaving large exit wounds well ken said banks finally backing away from the scene i cant say i envy you sorting this little lot out no said blackstone visibly pale lets get outside i dont think i can stand being in here much longer they stood outside the back door overlooking the valley and the peaceful village of tong in the distance three large crows circled high in the blue air banks lit a cigarette to take the taste and smell of the workshop out of his mouth want to call it in he asked yes just give me a minute what do you think blackstone took a deep breath before answering you probably know as well as i do alan he said either wes campbell or frankie robertson phoned devon the minute they saw mark wood at millgarth that was what over four hours ago now this pisses devon off mightily and he sends a couple of lads over right away to help him vent his rage you dont get far in devons business unless youre seen to act and to act fast he relies heavily on pure fear who knows maybe hes even made a down payment to motcombe and wants his money back too so they either torture him to find out where the money is or they do it for fun just to teach him a lesson then they execute him bang bang banks nodded either that or they decided they didnt like mr hs politics when mark told them who he really was its devons style alan blackstone went on two head shots with a thirtyeight by the looks of it remember those murders i told you about in new york toronto chapeltown uhhuh same mo torture and two head shots it still doesnt help us prove anything i dont suppose anyone can tie devon to the scene hell have an alibi you cant break and therell never be any trace of a murder weapon weve still got mark wood to use against him if he doesnt suddenly lose his memory the minute he hears about what happened to motcombe i probably would if i were him and dont forget campbell and robertson youve got them too they might not be quite as tough as they seem once you put the pressure on especially if theyre deprived of their narcotic sustenance and ill bet youve got records of any telephone calls they made from millgarth blackstone nodded and looked around then he sighed well wed better set things in motion can i use your mobile be my guest they walked around to bankss car at the front of the house and banks handed him the phone blackstone tapped in the numbers gave the details and requested more police a murder van and a soco team ill tell you something he said when hed finished your chief constable isnt going to like it is he remember the song and dance he made in the paper about solving the murder keeping race out of it bugger jimmy riddle said banks this isnt a matter of race its drugs and greed anyway theyre west yorkshires jamaicans not ours and i wasnt even here what do you think now blackstone asked handing banks the phone still want to come and work for west yorkshire banks stubbed out his cigarette on the wall and put the butt in his pocket to avoid contaminating the scene i dont know ken i really dont know i might not have much choice might i anyway right now i think id better make myself scarce before the troops arrive and all hell breaks loose youll be okay ill be fine ill catch a lift back to millgarth from one of the patrol cars go go banks shook blackstones hand thanks ken id be interested to hear you tell them why youre here and how you got here but i really cant stay ill tell them i got the bus said blackstone now be a good lad alan and bugger off back to eastvale i think i hear the sound of sirens banks got in his car he couldnt hear sirens but the sound of neville motcombes electric drill still whined in his ears a mile or so down the road the first patrol cars passed him lights and sirens going no hurry banks thought no hurry at all he lit another cigarette and switched on the tape player robert louis stevenson sung by bryn terfel now when day dawns on the brow of the moorland lone stands the house and the chimneystone is cold lone let it stand now the friends are all departed the kind hearts the true hearts that loved the place of old banks looked at his watch just gone half past four hard to believe but they had hardly been half an hour at motcombes house he still had plenty of time to go and pick up tracy for the weekend even with the rushhour traffic plenty of time about the author peter robinson grew up in yorkshire england and has lived in north america for twentyfive years his previous inspector banks novels include in a dry season which was nominated for the edgar won the anthony award and was named a new york times notable book and the international bestsellers aftermath close to home and playing with fire
