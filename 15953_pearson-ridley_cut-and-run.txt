steiger attorney at hyperion karin maake bob miller ellen archer jane comins katie wainwright thanks also to nancy litzinger and louise marsh for their daytoday office support for helping me with the details andy hamilton assistant united states attorney retired eric robertson us marshal for the western district of washington state and to many who choose to remain anonymous prologue six years earlier the fortyfirst day was their last together roland larson was holed up in a truck stops pay phone halfmad from guarding her roundtheclock while denied any privacy with her whatsoever he resorted to calling her on the phone hed slipped her his cell phone and now dialed his own number to find her breathless as she whispered from her hardened bedroom the aft cabin of the bus not thirty yards away i cant stand this she said he found himself aroused by the hoarse coarse sound of her fortyone days under every conceivable pressure and this the first complaint hed heard from her us or the situation he asked hope stevens had been moved on three separate occasions first to a wilderness cabin in michigans upper peninsula the kind of place larson could see himself retiring to someday a lethargic life so different from the one he lived then shed been moved to a nearly abandoned air force base in montana the desolation reminding him of a penitentiary a place he knew well and finally into a private coach a customized diesel bus that treasury had confiscated from a forgotten rock band its interior complete with neontrim lighting and mirrored tables painted on three sides as a purple and black sunrise the coach comfortably slept six and converted to club seating by day three deputies including larson two drivers and the witness traveled togetherone of only a handful of times in the us marshals services long history of witness protection that a moving target policy had been adopted the last had been aboard a sleeper train in the mids ironically the more attempts made upon her life the more importance and significance hope stevens gained in the eyes of her government it wasnt for her keen understanding of computers that they guarded her nor for her fine looks or sharp tongue when she did bother to speak it was instead for a few cells and chemicals inside her skull and the memory trapped there living now like a dog under the front porch cowering with a bone of truth in its jaws the problem for roland larson was that the longer he guarded her the more he cared for hercared intenselya situation unforgivable and intolerable in the eyes of his superiors and one that if discovered could have him transferred to some far outpost of government service like north dakota or buffalo but the few private moments shared with her overwhelmed any sensibility in larson after just seventeen days of protection the michigan cabin had gone up in flamesarson in the resulting firefight a shadowy ballet in the flashes of orange light from the mighty blaze two deputy marshals had been injured when at the montana air force base mention of persons unknown had been intercepted by some geek in an nsa cubicle the marshals had been instructed to move hope yet again larson wasnt much for running away from a faceless enemy but he knew well enough to follow orders and so he did as a former technical consultant to an industry probe of fraudulent insurance practices hope had connected a string of assistedcare facilities to millions of dollars in wrongful charges the names shed eventually given justicedonny and pop romero and by inference the young scion of the crime family ricardo romerowere well known to federal law enforcements organized crime unit the romeros notorious for inventive white collar crime on an enormous scale also played rough and dirty when required the arson and the shootout at the lake a case in point hopes value to justice was not only her initial discovery of insurance frauda scheme involving billing medicare long after the patient was deadbut more important her interception of a series of emails sent to and from the romeros that proved to be murderforhire contracts five executives of the same health care consortium that had called for the probe all referred to in the correspondence as whistleblowers whose actions threatened the romeros had later been found brutally murdered the victims of socalled serbian spaslaundry bleach enemas that burned the victim from the inside out over a period of several hours their families tied up and forced to watch their prolonged deaths intended perhaps to implicate the russian mob these horrific tactics did nothing of the sort the fbi had immediately placed the romeros onto their most wanted list and their two remaining witnesses hope stevens and an unnamed accountant had been placed in protective custody the emails had been electronically destroyed they existed now only in hopes memory government prosecutors believed a jury would convict based primarily on her testimony and so they sequestered her on the garish bus never allowing her off never risking her being seen in public and never stopping the bus for more than fuel or supplies the strategy had kept her alive for the past ten days and left everyone on board with a bad case of cabin fever discussions had begun to once again relocate her this time to a static or fixed location probably a federal facility quite possibly a short stint inside an unused wing at a federal penitentiary or in an icu at a city hospital they had myriad tricks up their sleeves if left to their own devices they seldom were isnt there something you can do hope asked order us to stop at a motel and arrange for you to guard my room there has to be something im only guessing here larson answered but i think a few of the guys might see through that tactic he caught his reflection in the polished metal surrounding the pay phones keypad no one was going to call him pretty although they had as a child hed grown into something too big for pretty too hard for handsome like a puppy growing into its feet pedigree be damned she sputtered on the other end not quite her trademark laugh but a valiant effort he said you could make like a heart attack and i could give you mouthtomouth a little more authentic this time at the cabin and then again at the air force base theyd managed to find moments together though not the moment both of them longed for one he repeatedly daydreamed about but once onto the bus theyd barely shared a glance a phone call was as much as they were going to get its probably better this way she said right no its decidedly worse as soon as i testify as soon as thats over with theyll put me into the program and that will be that right we should have never started this lars her testimony against donny romerothe fraud casewould come first the capital murder charges were likely still a long way from prosecutiona year or twobut he knew better than to mention it one didnt talk about the future with a protected witness the reality far harsher the adjustment far more difficult than they understood in practice breaking off all contact with ones former life proved traumatic invariably more difficult than the witness imagined seriously he asked because i dont see it that way at all i wouldnt trade one minute with you for something else youre hopeless im hopeful he said an intentional play on her name that he immediately congratulated himself for though no doubt one shed heard before his feeling for her had come on like a force of nature as unavoidable and inexplicable together they communicated well she accepted teasing in the face of all the madness they fit and when you found that you held on to it nearly ten minutes had passed since hed left the bus members of his small squad would be wondering why the delay ostensibly hed left the bus to settle the billwith cash always cashbut ten minutes was pushing it my gut tells me well work this out somehow he lied he couldnt see them ending this nownot before they tested the boundaries hed attended the seminars on avoiding emotional attachment with the witness brother bonding with the male witnesses was as dangerous as what he and hope had stumbled into it screwed up everything risked everything and he well knew it it could not possibly have a happy ending still he encouraged her to stay with him while he looked for some way around it all a way that he suspected wasnt there at this moment after what theyd been through together letting her go was not an option lars she spoke yet again in a hushed whisper the crisp sibilance rolling off the s and causing a ripple of gooseflesh down his left side it snaked into his groin and lodged there but rerouted by a synapse it suddenly sparked across a gate in his brain that translated it differently albeit a beat too late this was nothing short of the sound of panic hope oh my god the line went dead the bus larson dropped the receiver and ran losing his balance as he took a corner too quickly on wet tile ignoring the yellow sandwich board written in spanish and english with an icon of a pail and mop and a splash of water he went down hard he scrambled to his feet knocked over a corn chip display and hurried out the truck stops main door the cashiers cry of complaint consumed by the highpitched whine of highway traffic rolo this came from trill hampton a member of his squad a fellow deputy marshal approaching footfalls of shoes slapping blacktop came on fast larsons running had sent a signal hampton was in full stride already reaching for his piece larsons arrival into sunlight temporarily blinded him theyd stopped at far too many truck stops over the past ten days for him to immediately recall the layout of this one theyd parked out here somewhere a spike of fear insinuated itself as he considered the possibility that the entire bus had been hijacked for he didnt see it anywhere but then as hampton caught up to him and edged left and the two of them moved around the building larson spotted the rows of diesel pumps and the bus where theyd parked it wedged amid a long line of eighteenwheel tractortrailers hampton walked gracefully even at double time leading at a slight jog larson assessed the bus from a distance seeing no indication of trouble and wondering if hed misinterpreted hopes distress whats up hampton asked not a sheen of sweat on his black skin he wasnt about to confess to phoning the witness from the truck stop a bad feeling is all a bad feeling hampton questioned since when he had a flat wide nose too big for his face and a square cleft chin that reminded larson of a black kirk douglas larson wasnt exactly the touchyfeely type hampton saw through that larson sought some plausible explanation for hope hanging up on him he seized upon the first thing he saw why isnt benny stretching his legs the older of their two drivers had been complaining to anyone who would listen about a bad case of hemorrhoids larson saw benny through the windshield sitting behind the wheel yeah so they drew closer benny not only still occupied his drivers seat but his head was angled and tilted somewhat awkwardly toward his shoulder as if dozing this too seemed incongruous as benny rarely slept much less napped rolo hampton said cautiously now he too had sensed a problem with benny hampton and larson went back several years hampton had come out of one of new havens worst neighborhoods had won an academic scholarship to a blue blazer prep school and had gone on to graduate from howard university hed wanted to be a professional sports agent but had become a us marshal as an interim job at the urging of an uncle hed never left the service radio stubby larson instructed hampton attempted to raise stubblefield the third marshal who remained inside the bus but won only silence shit hampton said increasing his stride the man could cover ground when he wanted to the two were twenty feet away from the bus now larson adjusting his approach in order to come from more of an angle to avoid being seen his handgun a glock carefully screened he instructed hampton hang back take cover lethal force if required got it hampton broke away from larson hurrying toward the adjacent tractortrailer and taking a position that allowed him to use it as cover larson found the bus door closedstandard procedure benny would typically open it for him as he approached but that didnt happen sounding a secondary alarm in larsons head he slipped his hand into the front pocket of his jeans searching amid a wad of cash receipts for the cool metallic feel of keysthe duplicate set to the bus that as supervising deputy larson kept on his person benny remained motionless not responding stubby not answering a radio call but who could storm a bus through its only doora locked door at thatand overcome two drivers and a deputy marshal larson heard thumping from inside banging just as he turned the key out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a state police car parked beyond the diesel pumps and he thought benny would open the door for a uniform as larson opened the door and entered the banging stopped abruptly larson both tasted and smelled the bitter air and knew its source from experience a stun grenadean explosive device that uses air pressure to blow out eardrums and sinuses and render the suspects temporarily deaf and semiconscious the narrow stairs that ascended to the driver prevented him from seeing into the main body of the bus he saw only benny whose shirt held a red waterfall of spilled blood down the front larsons first assessment was that the mans nose was bleedingtypical with stun grenades but then he saw a precise line below his jaw like a surgical incision his open eyes and frozen stare cinched it benny was dead weapon still in hand larson kept low and climbed the bus stairs ready for contact the banging hed heard had been someone attempting to breach the hardened door to hopes cabin he saw stubby unconscious or dead on the left side behind a collapsible table clancy the other driver sat upright in a padded captains chair opposite stubby his head tilted back a game of gin rummy between them had ended abruptly no blood or ligature marks on clancy no sign of a state trooper either the aisle empty a sleeping cabin on either side one of stubbys golf clubs lay broken in front of the rear cabins door which appeared intact and suggested hope remained safe a source of great relief the intruder had been trying to use a club to pry the door open there was only one key to that door hidden in a hide a key in the rear engine bay larson edged forward he went down hard as a strong hand gripped his ankle and pulled from behind the gun hit the carpet and bounced loose the wind knocked out of him larson reeled the intruder was a stringy guy with frogtongue reactions he seized larsons hair from behind and pulled but larson rolled left and the razor blade intended for his throat missed and caught the front of his right shoulder instead larson broke loose dived forward and grabbed for the gun he spun and squeezed off three rounds two went into the mirrored ceiling raining down cubes of tempered glass and blinding him in a silver snow a crushing force caught larson in the jaw snapping his head back he inadvertently let go of the gun for a second time the intruder had fallen onto him and larson realized hed hit him with one of the three shots larson grabbed for the man and felt fabric rip a uniform larson fought back the wounded man keeping him from the gun larson bucked him off but his cut shoulder caused his arm to flap around uselessly refusing all of larsons instructions tangled up with the man larson drove his left elbow back and felt the crunch of soft bone and tissue like an eggshell breaking he then heard a series of quick footfalls and looked in time to see the intruder hurry off the bus landing out on the parking lots pavement the uniformed mans voice shouted someone call for help larson came to his knees his head swooned he looked around for his gun through blurry eyes hampton saw the slender state trooper throw his hands in the air as he called for help he was bleeding the man sank to his knees in front of the door to the bus hampton held his weapon extended and stepped out from behind the tractortrailer hands behind your head he called out not feeling great holding a gun on a man in uniform as the trooper sat up hampton saw a yellowwhite muzzle flash he took the first round in the thigh driven back by the impact and losing his balance he sprawled back onto the hot blacktop rocking his head to the right and watching the suspect run off he fired two rounds from his side as larson dragged himself toward the front of the bus he tried to lock down anything he remembered about the intruder thin and wiry strong the uniform a scar he focused on the scar the lines of pink beaded skin crossed forming a stylized infinity sign on the inside of his forearm larsons vision filled with a purple fringe the dark throbbing color coming at him from all sides his shoulder was cut badly sticky down to his waist he felt faint sounds echoed again he smelled the tangy air laced with black powder and sulfur bitter with blood his stomach retched he felt as if he were being pushed and held underwaterdark waterby a strong determined hand he resisted but felt himself going deeper his last conscious thought was more of a vision not an infinity sign at all but two triangles facing inward touching pointtopoint like a bow tie chapter one the present of all things larson thought he recognized her laugh here where he least expected it it carried like a shot well past his ears and spilling down into the audience where it ran into a waterfall of othersthough none exactly like itand broke to pieces before the footlights and spots that made the dust in the air look like snow it might as well have lodged in his chest the way it stole his breath hed started the day perfectly the way he wished he could start every day busting his body into a sweat while pulling on twin sticks of composite carbon painted on the scoop in a diagonal of rich burgundy and black the owners college colors no doubt driving the borrowed scull through swirls of noseeums and gnats so thick he clenched his teeth to filter them out the occasional dragonfly darting swiftly alongside as if challenging him to a race hed been up before the birds and would be doneput away and showered creve coeur lake behind himbefore the rushhour traffic made the citys famous arch stand still hed taken in the play on a whim calling the box office to see if there were any singles available a guilty pleasure he wouldnt have told anyone about if he hadnt engaged the receptionist lokisha in a discussion of shakespeare on the way out the door the fact was that in over five years of secretly searching for hope at shakespeare festivals and performancesin places as far away as ashland oregon and cedar city utahhed become passionate about the bard himself the violence the romance the lies and deceptions the cunning the manipulation the symmetry of the plays it had never occurred to him that he might find her here in his own backyard the belief in coincidence had been trained out of larson in the way a dog could be made to lie by the dinner table and not look up to beg hed felt his blackberry purr silently at his side several times over the past ten minutes but it was after hours and it did that for any incoming email spam or legitimate and he wasnt about to bother the people sitting next to him by lighting up a pale blue electronic screen in his lap while they tried to remain firmly in the sixteenth century the intermission was fast approaching hed check email and messages then this city was the last placethe absolute last placehe might have expected to hear her laugh a combination of wild monkey and a slinky going down a set of stairs even almost six years later he would have known her musical cackle anywhere but st louis in the fox theatre not on your life not on hers either but it was shakespeare which he knew to be in her blood if he were to find her it would be at a performance like thisand so a part of him was tempted even convinced that hed finally found her the balcony he imagined her selecting a seat that offered the strategic advantage of elevation because that was just the kind of thing hed taught her onstage benedick having dived into a horse trough addressed the audience his black leather riding pants and billowing shirtsleeves leaking water another volley of laughter rippled through the crowd and there it was again larson felt like a birder identifying a particular species solely by its song he was no longer laughing along with the others instead driven by curiosity he was turned and straining to look up into the balcony being too large for the closely crowded seats his temperature spiked and his skin prickled or was that the possibility running through him he represented hopes past her former self would she want that as badly as he did had she somehow found out about his transfer through all his training coincidence nipped at his heels baffled unsure what to do he stayed in his seat the fox theatre a renovated throwback to a bygone era dwarfed its audience its combination of art deco gilded asian quasiegyptian splendor with anachronistic icons like a twentyfoottall crosslegged buddha lit in a garish purple light looked intentionally overwhelming despite the vastness of the hall larson felt impossible to miss at well over six feet and with shoulders that impeded both the theatergoers on either side of him he would stick out if he stood it seemed doubtful she might spot him might recognize him from the back at such a distance but he hoped she would he glanced around once more amused and concerned intrigued and feeling foolish his muscles tense his shoulder ached as it had ached for the past six years every time a storm drew near hed carried the same badge all these years though now his credentials wallet showed a different title larson having been reassigned along with hampton and stubblefield to the marshals services elite fugitive apprehension task force part bounty hunter part bloodhound part con man and actor fatf marshals pursued escaped convicts and wanted felons in an effort to return them to their predetermined incarceration if she spotted him before he spotted her what would come of it larson wondered would she fight through the crowd to be in his arms would she run again he put his own training onto her deciding for her that shed selected an aisle seat near an exit shed probably make for that exit rather than risk running into him hed lost all track of the play the audience erupted in laughter and hed missed the joke he continued to imagine various ways this could possibly be her but none made sense not here not st louis not unless she too were looking for him six years it seemed alternately to him like both a matter of days and a lifetime what would he say to her her to him would she even care larson wiped his damp palms on the thighs of his khakis again a wave of laughter washed over the crowd but this time something different her distinctive laugh was no longer a part of it larson turned again in his seat scanning various exits no sign of hope but slightly behind him a pair of men in dark suits stood with an usher both dutifully scanning the crowd in an audience of twentyfive hundred there were plenty of men wearing suitsbut none quite like these two conservative haircuts thick builds the big guy looked all too familiar federal agents like himself though not like him at all fbi maybe or atf or even missouri boys working for the governor a witsec deputy the federal witness security and protection service was now a separate entity but had recently been part of the marshals service larson knew many of those guys but not all these two witsec he doubted it he might have thought they were looking for hope but the big one looked right at him and locked on this man somehow knew the row the seathe knew where to find larson cocking his head the agent directed larson to meet up with them larson held off acknowledging while he thought long and hard about how to play this the earlier buzzing of his blackberry now more persistent in his memory as with hopes laugh two deputy marshals or agents materializing at the fox was anything but coincidence he felt tempted to check the blackberry but didnt want to leave his head down that long the big guys posture and the way he bit his lower lip revealed a gnawing anxiety a nagging unrest this wasnt a social call a nearby woman wore too much perfume hed been struggling with it through the performance driven to distraction only now did he find it nauseating the audience laughed uproariously larson chanced a last strained look toward the balcony then gave it up hope didnt miss anything whether shed seen larson or not shed likely have spotted the suits by now and therefore was already well on her way to gone intermission arrived with a wave of crushing applause the stage fell dark by the time the houselights came up larson had already slipped past four sets of knees avoided a handbag and laid his big hand on a strangers shoulder hope would now head in the opposite direction from the two agents she would quickly put as much distance between herself and the theater as possible seek cover avoid public space she would never look back and would not hurry no matter how desperate she believed her situation her walk would be controlled yet deceptively swift her demeanor casual though determined she would never return to the theater again no matter what the show if he were to catch her he would have to run and if he ran the two bloodhounds were sure to follow and if they followed and if he led them to her then hed prove himself a traitor to her stuck larson tested the agents purpose by mixing himself into the throng and making for the opposite exit but his head traveled a full head above most like a parade float as expected the two immediately followed rudely pushing open a route to attempt to intersect larsons path larson got caught in a snag of people as a wheelchair blocked the aisle he cut through a nowempty row working away from the men copies of playbill littered the floor he joined the right flank and pressed on toward an interior lobby where people mingled looking lost out of habit he tested his skills scanning the crowd for any woman wearing a headscarf or a hat any woman making quickly for the main lobby and the doors beyond he didnt spot her and all the better he had no desire to get her tangled up with these two someone shouted and he knew it was for him adrenaline pricked his nerves his stomach turned with the mixture of human sweat cologne and perfume he pushed on to his left his swollen bladder taking him down a long wide set of elegant stairs as he joined a phalanx of men eager for urinals he heard his name called out and cringed it reminded him not favorably of being singled out by a coach or the school principal he hazarded a look the big one with the leather face and edgy disposition was following him the younger one immediately on his heels he stopped on the stairs and the current of impatient men streamed around him he addressed his two pursuers as they drew closer the face of the more senior of them revealing his surprise that larson would allow himself to be caught gimme a minute of privacy larson said as he continued down determined to appear unruffled reaching the basement level he entered a cavernous anteroom that held only a mirror a small wooden table and twin tapestry chairs that looked to be from a museum beyond this anteroom was the actual bathroom about the size of a soccer field sinks straight ahead to his left a room of stalls to his right a roomful of old porcelain urinalsthere must have been thirty or forty of them built into the wall and floor and so obviously antiques the urinals looked surprisingly beautiful to him larson took his place in line and emptied his bladder one of the great pleasures in life we need to talk the same low voice now directly behind him the big one had followed him down junior mint was no doubt standing sentry at the top of the stairs ensuring that larson didnt slip out and i need to pee larson said not looking back but the magic of the moment spoiled a hand fell firmly onto his shoulder fuck off larson shrugged and wrenched himself forward dislodging the grip thankfully the man stepped back and let him finish as he washed his hands he saw two images of the big pain in the ass in the cracked mirror that was unnecessary larson cautioned he wanted to establish some rules the agent said we were told you could be slippery to respect that in you thats why the hardball the guy at the next sink over stopped washing and eavesdropped on them you trying to butter me up larson asked youve got a funny way of doing that im trying to get a message to you larson had to stare down the man at the adjacent sink to get him to leave so deliver it here larson turned and faced the man larson taller by several inches here seen close up this other guys face carried an unintentional intensitysomething somewhere was very very wrong the man cupped his hand and leaned in toward larson who did nothing to block him as his own hands were now engaged with a paper towel the guys breath felt warm against larsons neck causing a shiver as he said i was told to tell you that weve lost uncle leo larson dumped the towel into the bin and heard himself mumble oh shit chapter two larson had picked up people from private jets before a supervisor some witsec brass a witness or two came to mind but hed never flown in a private jet himself so although the cause was a mans disappearance and the resulting tension inside the aircraft nearly palpable he got a kick out of it nonetheless leather seats the size of first class held his large frame comfortably wood trim polished like the dash of a jaguar surrounded a wallmounted flatpanel tv that currently displayed their flight route over ground but probably could have handled a video had either of the agents been interested in some entertainment there was even an air phone that none of them had permission to use heady stuff despite the lack of any offer of food or drink beyond bottled water and the general mood of its inhabitants both of whom bordered on morose larson wished his parents had been alive to hear about this but hed lost them both to twentiethcentury plagues his father to smoking his mother to drink hed had a sister once but shed gotten lost in her high school years and had run away never to be heard from again hed never used his tracking skills to hunt her down and he wondered if someday he might the explanation for him taking this flight had been cryptic at bestuncle leo had gone missing the wherefore and how had yet to reach him but the promise of a nearly instant return flight once there also on the private jet had convinced him not to challenge this assignment few people could summon a government jet at a moments notice fewer still to transport his rank of deputy marshal he was considered little more than a glorified bounty hunter so why the special treatment hed decided to ride this one out despite his tendency to question orders and cause headaches for his superiors because he suspected that scott rotem his immediate superior and boss was behind the order neither of his companions would confirm this he thought once more of the womans laugh in the fox and the state of panic in him that it had caused he laughed out loud at his flight of fancy then covered his mouth with his hand and tried to wipe the grin off his face of all the unhealthy indulgences why her why now the agents looked at him like he was supposed to share the joke both of his keepers carried justice department credentials the older one with the pained eyes answered to one of those names that rang familiar to larson wilcox larson knew a couple different guys named wilcox one a running coach at a private college the other a former fatf deputy said to be one of the most reliable and most entertaining stakeout partners out there this guy was neither of them and whereas larson felt a little tired wilcox saw eleven oclock pass still rigidly upright and wide awake in his padded seat like he had a broomstick up his ass he typed aggressively as if the laptop had pissed him off in some way or else the report he was generating was his last will and testament what about hampton and stubblefield larson asked suddenly hampton and stubblefield had survived their wounds the two had transferred with him and were members of his fatf squad larson depended upon them have they been called wilcox pursed his lips and returned to his typing you find out when we get there larson stared out the window the nights black canvas mixing with his own reflection of deep set green eyes lips set in a constant smirk and skin that needed a shave below city lights shimmered small and clustered the world looked so simple from above hopes offer six years earlier had been straightforward enough itself the bus incident the failed attempt on her life had forced the marshals service to request her immediate placement into witsec an unusual but not unheardof pretrial tactic there had been nothing romantic or sentimental in hopes proposal perhaps because like him she feared they were being watched there was never time for just the two of them while larson appeared at briefings covering the bus incident hope had been placed into a safe housethe orchard house an old farmhouse out of townand guarded by larsons team limiting larsons contact with her the days ticked down toward a full identity wash after which hope stevens would cease to exist even for larson come with me shed said in a businesslike tone they were standing in the safe houses backyard a winter wind blew through his clothes this was how he explained to himself the fulllength shiver that swept through him at that moment his fantasy and the culmination of his fears what request a new identity and come with me well start over together she knewthey both knewthat this was nothing short of a proposal of marriage where she was going it was permanent once into witsec there was no going back no reconnection to ones past it was a case of selfinvoked amnesia suddenly it seemed to larson that on so many levels they barely knew each other could he make this decision without thinking it through without a chance to say some important goodbyes adding to the difficulty was his insiders knowledge of how difficultimpossiblewitsec could be on the protected witness even the most hardened criminal cracked when shut off from all contact with family members many ended up attending baptisms weddings or funerals exposing themselves breaking the anonymity of their protection risking their lives for a few minutes of the familiar how long would hope hold up what if he gave up the years of his training and employment only to have the relationship selfdestruct six months into the struggle to remake themselves how well would he hold up he didnt speak any of this didnt voice his concerns but he clearly wore them on his face for she grew pale turning away from the wind and him along with it oh she said its not that it is just so out of the blue is all is it me joining the program witsec yeah it is its like a doctor becoming a patient the warden becoming a prisoner its just something you dont ever see happening to you when youre on this side of protection well im asking you to see it will they even let me i doubt it he had no idea how such a request would be treated fraternization was discouraged sometimes punished all deputies were instructed to avoid what most protected witnesses wanted most safety in the form of friendship with the marshals its complicated no not really she said its about as simple as it gets lars you either see us together or you dont he coughed out a nervous laugh and this hurt her he wished he could take it back theres a lot to get done he said her face brightened he knew it was the right decision she came into his arms eagerly but tentatively like a child asking a parent for forgiveness im not asking you to suffer with me im asking you to live with me dont worry youll suffer plenty with me in your life he teased returning the hug penance ill gladly endure i have to make some calls say some goodbyes clear this through channels the list grew longer in his head what if they refuse you only then did he fully understand the extent of her proposal and he had to wonder if this was her original intention all along i cant do that hope cant or wont sneak you out of here somehow run away with you without the the firewall of witsec to protect us im one person it doesnt work like that he realized immediately she underestimated witsecs importance to herto theirsurvival this in turn caused him to reassess his own willingness to destroy roland larson in the coming twentyfourtofortyeighthour period all in the name of love a love less than three months old a love fashioned under the threat of death and in the heat of battle rotem will try to talk me out of it at the very least theyll make me meet with a psychologist or psychiatrist there will be papers to sign releasing them of responsibility its not a matter of breaking out the champagne and waiting to be relocated second thoughts its too soon to have second thoughts these are original thoughts he said i just need a little time to think it through and put it together there isnt any time is there do you think theyre going to warn you before they take me off do you think theyre going to warn me no way she was right it would be done in the dead of night like a criminal act two or three vans all leaving at the same moment all heading different directions shed be inside one of them gone for good shed already been placed on the fast track her new identity would arrive any moment he explained his situation again detailing his need for a day or two at least i do love you but i owe some explanations i wont leave my friends in false grief ive seen enough of that they kissed though for the first time without passion and that kiss would haunt him as he told rotem of his plan to join her and later considered her offer through the night phone off the hook his bed not slept in in the morning his mind made up he returned to the farmhouse he found it empty and deserted even the tire tracks had been swept out of the dirt as if no one had been there in years he blamed rotem though never to his face he blamed her for waiting so long to ask he blamed himself forever for wavering for leaving her side even for a moment that day touchdown returned him to the present and delivered the requisite black navigator to the jets stairs this kind of service made larson feel both important and uncomfortable neither of which pleased him the three federal employees were whisked off by a driver who also carried justice department creds larson was once again reminded of how serious this must be uncle leo it was little more than a name to larson but it carried weight of legendary import in the realm of witsec uncle leo had had something to do with the witness protection programs modernization which had begun in the mids leos name spoke as much of secrecy as anything else as did so much of the witsec programs overhaul it was the equivalent of the programs very integrity its security and the security of its protected witnesses uncle leos predicament had rallied the big hitters it might be nothing more than an unscheduled vacation or a trip to a hospital but uncle leo had disappeared and rotem had obviously been ordered to move heaven and earth along with a sizable private jet to find the man it was as if witsec and fatf separate entities with one rarely having anything to do with the other would be working together the presence of these justice agents spoke volumes this was the varsity squad if larson was being called off the bench as it appeared he was then people wanted uncle leo found the desk jockeys were ready to sit back and watch people like larson work this particular october night in princeton new jersey left larson wishing hed brought a sweater rather than the black jeans and black blazer hed been wearing at the play the smell was of car engines and tire rubber as he climbed out of the navigator stepping onto a blacktop driveway alongside a modest unremarkable home in what was probably called a nice neighborhood a place where kids could ride bikes and skateboards at any hour but the current hour of four am larson for no reason other than his own experience had been expecting a crime scenelocal cops a crime scene unit maybe an effort to hold back the press instead it was the navigator a town car and one other navigator also black the house was dark and it took him a minute to realize someone had taped black visquine or garbage bags over the interior windows he followed his two escorts inside he was struck both by the hideous color of the living rooms yellow carpet and the abundance of printed matterbooks magazines and more magazines the owner was a reader the place was a litter basket the furniture wanted to be contemporary but stopped at modern and so looked like the beforeshot of a customrenovation ad a s ranch for a scientist who belonged in back to the future judging by the few shots of uncle leo and various dignitaries and politicians that hung on the wall amid copies of warhol lithographs and some fairly decent blackandwhite portrait photography that included john f kennedy and ronald reagan he knew everybody once upon a time scott rotem fortyone or two going on fiftyfive he sported bulging eyes a comedian would kill for if theyd been capable of carrying any expression at all a patch of missing hair cried out for rogaine rotem was all right if you liked your bureaucrats with zero sense of humor a mean streak burnished into a crease between the eyes and the vague aura of foot odor following one about the man not only woke on the wrong side of the bed he also willingly entered it from that side too not simply a stickinthemud but a phone pole piledriven at that larson liked him though it confounded him exactly why this was it might have been the beauty and polish of rotems stubborn persona that nevergiveaninch bastardataglance attitude that made him both an asshole and yet someone larson could rightfully respect rotem was consistent if in a vaguely pernicious way and that struck larson as a noble attribute in this day and age you owe me half a performance of much ado about nothing your guys pulled me at intermission come in here larson followed whenever possible he took the high ground against rotem took it early and fought to hold it because the man had a way of getting under his skin getting him to do things to take assignments he didnt want larson would say yes before he meant it even if the one time in his life he should have he hadnt the moment he entered the side hall now passing framed snapshots of what had to be family he smelled the blood once youve been around it a few times your nose can pick it up at a distance and larson had been around it more than a few times so the memories attached to that odor like ticks each step down the hall was a step down memory lane only the snapshots on the walls of his recollection were all of victims he found the silence of the house disturbing he wished rotem would say something he caught himself humming and wishing he could carry a tune better than he could the smell grew riper now all of a sudden it reeked like someone had opened a longignored trash can it hit larson like twisting the cap off a bottle of ammonia hit him in the eyes and deep up into his sinuses where he knew it would lodge and remain for hours to come days perhaps it came from a macys parade balloon facedown in a vanity bathroom fallen to the linoleum floor the body so swollen and distorted that the wrists puffed out above the shirt cuffs straining the buttons two to three weeks decomposition so advanced that the skin on the back of the neck had split as it swelled leaving a set of narrow trenches running from the shirt collar up under the hair its not leopold markowitz rotem informed him not uncle leo larson asked then this was one emerson brighton doyle names not important a graduate student markowitzs personal assistant against the universitys bylawsunpaid personal assistantsbut fairly common practice especially for the emeritus types like markowitz he did consulting for princeton markowitz did consulted all over the place were collecting that information now did or does larson sought to clarify the tense you catch on quickly you wanted me to see emerson brighton doyle in person i dont get that a picture wouldnt have done it rotem said aromatherapy come around this side as larson stepped across the pale log of a khakiclad leg rotem continued the moment they move him disturb him some or all of this will be ruined hes going to come apart like an overcooked brisket youre right about me wanting you to see this but its not as if id wish this upon anybody he said displaying what was for him a rare moment of humanism then why larson asked as it turned out a little prematurely for by then rotem had pointed toward the head which looked more like a horrific beach ball larson backed off a step his back now pressed against the coolness of the wall between the corner sink and toilet his left arm on the roll of toilet paper like an armrest that chill found its way through the blazer and shirt and into his skin and bored down into him like a dentists drill rotem was right moving the body would have likely destroyed it at first blush it looked like nothing more than another of the series of chinslarson counted nine or ten of the folds despite the heavy bloating but the pink one just below the mans right earlobe was more than a tear or a split it was too precise the slight smile of a curve that started at the ear too intentional benny the bus driver larson finally said christ almighty the romeros hope rose in his thoughts again hope and her long history with the romeros we cant be sure rotem said but his heart obviously wasnt in it the medical examiner had written up bennys sliced throat as a precision cut intended to sever the trachea while simultaneously laying open the carotid arteries an extremely efficient cut for someone wishing to both silence and kill a man benny had bled out while drowning in his own blood his larynx cut and inoperable larson hadnt seen anything like it in the past six years cant call it a signature cut rotem continued cant we but i wanted you to see it scott maybe im punchy because its fourthirty in the morning or maybe its from all the chitchat with the two wonderful conversationalists you sent to abduct me but im squatting by this pile of stink looking at what it is you brought me here to look at and im telling you it is a signature cut which must be exactly what you want to hear or why would you bring me so if you know something else would you just fucking say it larson wanted out of there he wanted to find hopetell her the romeros were on the move again on the movethey had leo markowitzgood god leopold markowitz wrote the code for laena larson had assumed as much laena was the name given to witsecs master witness protection list the most carefully guarded database in the justice department larsons insides did another little roll anything and everything to do with the identity and location of hope stevens was contained in laena laena became inoperable yesterday afternoon at around four eastern they cant open it they cant access it so theyve got the list larson said the list but maybe not the names on the list seven to eight thousand people including dependentswomen children spouses and relatives the encryptions a significant obstacle not for markowitz though said larson right even for markowitz decrypting laena will take time weve been tapped to find him you have by me yes larson held his breath disentangled himself from the toilet paper roll and leaned forward to study the cut more closely there was too much rot and decomposition for him to determine if a razor blade had been responsible though he knew this would ultimately be the judgment of the coroner or medical examiner it all proved a little overwhelming he stood hurried out of the bathroom down the hall and outside where he gasped for clean air or what passed for it in new jersey rotem was right there behind him more agile and quick than larson might have given him credit for the treetops fluttered and stirred in a breeze swaying back and forth like a gospel choir larson coughed up a clam and spit it into a nearby shrub and heard it glob down from twig to leaf and finally trickle into the sodden mulch the taste lingered at the back of his throat hanging barely above his retching point fuck he muttered judging by this he has a twoweek head start on us rotem said three at most so does he have the names or not im told by witsec that its possible but doubtful not yet but any day now not only is the master list encrypted but each individual record within it as well think of it as a safedeposit box inside a bank markowitz not only has to break into the bank but then open each and every safedeposit box in order to win a protected witnesss identity three weeks to a month and only then with the fastest computers out therethe crays and silicon graphics gives us a week to ten days more to find him which means finding the romeros i thought they up and vanished after donny checked into our federal facility we know better than most larson rotem said that no one ever fully disappears he paused excepting maybe hoffa with donnys initial conviction on fraud charges pop ricardo and others had gone to ground if the government knew where to find them it was news to larson the remaining romeros had never been prosecuted leaving larson wondering why hopes testimony would be enough to convict she remained a living threat to the family rotem added any one of the big families would kill to have that list pay millions why not the romeros if markowitz gives them laenaevery assumed identity of every protected witness in the witsec program he let it hang there then he said thats a lot of motivation but the point of making the list digital was to make it bulletproof larson said right and the titanics unsinkable listen witsec is reassembling the list through paperwork but its a hell of a lot of paperwork theres got to be some kind of backup right i suppose they might get it back online what do i know were supposed to find markowitz period we do this in secret you do everything in secret rotem said yeah but something this big its gonna be a taskforce effort right fibies us atf who else us i said us us rotem repeated the light from his butane lighter now catching his oversized eyes and throwing two noses onto his face as he lit a cigarette larson didnt know this about the manthat he smokedand he found it disconcerting to have served five years on the fugitive apprehension task force and only now learn this his head was spinning he still couldnt get that taste out of his mouth then as rotem coughed larson understood the cigarette it was rotems wayas a nonsmokerto purge the lingering taste from his own throat does that really work yeah rotem answered you mind rotem passed larson the burning cigarette larson took it between his thick fingers looked down at his own hand and then passed it back he tried a stick of gum instead and for a minute it worked but when he swallowed he thought he might upchuck the panic hit him again ran right through him like venom hopefirst in line for execution by the romeros donny romero larson said is coming up for parole yes larson had heard only rumors how does he pull off a parole hearing if hes still a suspect in capital murder investigations rotem sized him up sucked on the cigarette government lost its star witness no witness no prosecution the other romeros are in the wind larson cringed lost the witness to spoilage the services euphemism for killed witnesses awol this is hope stevens were talking about so she never had testifiedthe rumors were true the look that came back from rotem was paralyzing rotem knew the connection he nodded is that why he picked me for the job larson wondered rotem wanted as much added motivation in his men as he could find some kind of critter scampered through the undergrowth a rat larson thought though he didnt get a look at the thing markowitz could be bent larson said this could be some kind of ruse one hell of a ruse my gut says romeros yours larsons silence signaled his assent well bring in forensics rotem said but i guarantee you that cutll end up matching bennys larson wondered with the master list gone with hope awol from witsec how he would find her before the romeros did no matter what rotem assigned him that was the task at hand with donnys parole on the line the romeros wouldnt want a witness as potentially damaging as hope changing her mind and stepping forward in fact it didnt seem out of the question that theyd gone after the list specifically to find hope and prevent her from testifying larson spat again trying to rid himself of that horrid aftertaste the rat or squirrelwhatever the fuck it wasrattled the underbrush as it ran off into the night chapter three rotem flew him back commercial larson should have seen that coming the rush had been getting him there not flying him home coach of course so he ate his knees and felt his lower back for the entire flight a layover in chicago of course because twa had sold to american and thus the demise of nonstops to st louis progress weather delay of course because this was chicago s ohare larson wasnt sure hed ever had a perfect connection here tired of course because hed been up all night hed managed to doze for an hour or so on the plane it held off the headache but did nothing for the gloom the underwaterlike efforts of movement and the persistent buzz of panic in his gut he couldnt get past hope being a likely target the romeros wouldnt know that shed fled witsecbut unless shed done everything perfectly that would only make her easier to find by the time the second delay in boarding for the homeward leg was announced larson had already spoken twice with rotem and finally connected with trill hampton he needed to lead hampton down the garden path in order to disguise his own intentions to locate hope stevens and somehow get her to safety and he needed to do so without violating the secrecy rotem required of him the trails icecold he told his next in command hed caught him up on markowitzs disappearance and the murder of the mans assistant but not the professors role in the creation of laena rotem had been adamant about the need for secrecy the future of witsec itself depended on their teams ability to contain laena and the news of its compromise and yet larson felt his guys worked better when they understood the stakes it took a special mindset to work fugitive apprehension your guys deserved to know what to expect on the other side of the door and larson felt like giving them the benefit of the doubt but to keep his word with rotem hed have to lead hampton into discovering markowitzs role for himself hampton and stubblefield didnt have the rank within the service to have heard of uncle leo larson said im told a couple of our guys canvassed markowitzs associates this morning they were pretty tightlipped claimed he traveled so much he was hard to keep track of and that no one knew hed gone missing a guy his age traveling a lot hampton who was not yet forty related everything to age larson had long since decided it was some kind of phobia with hampton he was terrified of growing old and saw anyone over fifty as long gone hed focused so much on age that hed missed the hint larson had dropped larson again markowitz was or iswe dont know yet whichdoing a lot of consulting work as well as speaking engagements must have been raking it in and no one knew his schedule larson sank the hook our guys didnt get anything out of the canvass his point here was that fatf not the fbi had done the canvassing that should have sounded alarms for hampton his last known hampton had missed again a little slippery his assistant might have helped there were left to fill in the gaps and his most recent schedule is among them weve confirmed palo alto raleighdurham and our own wash u airline records show hed been commuting between these three and back to princeton regularly for the past couple months thats where you and stubby will start phonecanvassing the three universities facetoface followups if needed this guy qualifies as a fugitive from what an old folks home closer larson thought were gonna need his full financials his medical records and a psychiatric hampton s voice bordered on complaint does a guy that old have a love life larson carefully considered what he said next he wanted hampton making the connection that no other law enforcement was involved that leopold markowitz had put the witness protection list at risk he owed his guys that much he looked for another way around it okay the assistants wound was nearly identical to bennys the pause on the other end of the call said enough did you say our guys did the canvassing bingo why are we investigating this anyway hampton asked where the hells the bureau in this larson nodded on his end of the call theyre not in this which should tell you a lot that and the fact that it may be the romeros behind the disappearance right at a time donnys coming up for parole review why the fuck would the romeros care about some old computer geek hampton asked what is it youre not telling me rolo now youre getting the idea theyve got you gagged on this relief swept through him he thought this was probably how people close to the investigation leaked things to the media you didnt have to say things to say things you could let them speak for themselves he was somewhat new to this who else did this geezer consult for besides these three universities do i smell federal government hell of a nose youve got hamp romeros hampton said organized crime unit colder think benny justice scalding hot witsec the inflection was gone hampton had made it a statement wait was he involved with the reorg of the master list pure poetry larson knew hampton would see the full scope of it now they were not pursuing some old man who was missing his college lectures butif hampton was able to take it one step furtherthe man behind the laena list the lives of more than two thousand protected witnesses and their five thousand dependents what came with that was a level of personal risk unlike anything associated with their typical day job chasing down escaped convicts and wanted felons our primary is markowitz hes believed to need access to a supercomputer for whatever reasons they want us interviewing the people running the computers at these places in hopes of intercepting him supercomputers you go for that hampton asked it has merit money women and work hampton said thats how you find a guy no argument there whys he need the computer thats offlimits for discussion as is most of this the romeros youre warm hampton would put it together it just might take a day or two scrotums taking his orders from witsec whats with that since when if this plane ever takes off i should be landing before noon but another idea had surfaced he would not be on the next plane out you want me to pick you up that would be good my cars downtown but ill call you when i leave meanwhile you and stubby get cooking rotems got the contacts for you riddle me this rolo hampton said still working out the information hed been supplied are you in chicago on a layover or because the regional witsec office is up there how involved are they they wouldnt be missing something would they something our very own ben franklin created for them about five years back larson wanted to congratulate the man but he said only ill call you his return to st louis was going to have to wait a few hours first things first chapter four chicago s north shore a string of bedroom communities developed a century before retained some of its former heritage classic architecture lined the streets of the quaint villages these townships had for the most part been spared the tract housing that swept across the american midwest during the suburban sprawl of the postwar s but to larson it all began to look the same winnetka glencoehard to tell one from the other the difference being the occasional golf course with a brick clubhouse on a saturday afternoon the diehard homeowners were out raking leaves they wore creased khakis leather deck shoes and izod shirts the women had been released to jog rollerblade and walk the dog while their adolescent kids skateboarded or rode bicycles in packs the cars he followed lexus mercedes volvos and cadillac escalades carried golden retrievers or labradors in the back with soccer camp and hockey stickers on the rear window and foolish bumper stickers announcing their kids were honor students larsons small house in st louis one of those s rancheswould have fit into the garage of most of these palaces though that space was probably reserved for the au pair or the morgan or xke he doublechecked the address and pulled over traveling through suburbia the reminders of family and what his life might have been had he accepted hopes invitation without second thought forced him to call linda the only person in whom hed confided this past linda had been his one and only relationship in the past six years a recently widowed wife of a dear friend of larsons the two had shared a brief but emotionally charged affair nearly three years earlier neither had entered the bed with any expectation beyond comfort and understanding but both came away with a confidante for life linda often looked after larsons dog tanner when he was away for work hed left her a message from new jersey and decided to follow up she screened her calls so he had to wait for her to call him back she never asked him where he was or what he was doing tanners fine she began the call he thanked her for taking care of the dog on such short notice and she replied that it was no problem she lived in a huge house with a giant backyard a holdover from the marriage she would eventually have to part with but not yet they both knew she wasnt ready he said you remember that guy who i knew would know my friends new persona no names nothing definite yeah she sounded worried hed expressed many times how pursuing this information might cost him his job im parked around the corner from his house well thats news am i crazy of course you are crazy in love right shes in danger im sorry i dont know if im just using this as an excuse or not but here i am and im going through with it unfinished business exactly if i could have had even five minutes with jack well youve heard this enough times larsons friend had died while lecturing at a small new england college not for the fee but because theyd asked fortythree years old way too early im going to get my five minutes he said although it rang of hollow confidence his odds of tracking hope down were limited by a very tall wall erected to prevent such contact remember youre the one pursuing her youve had time to process the reunion and what it means she wont have dont judge her by her first reaction give her time to sort it out it wont be easy on her it wont be easy on either of us im happy for you he felt like an asshole bringing linda into this rubbing her nose in his opportunity while she would have no such chance to reconnect he said if and when i find her it may be me making the proposal this time ill give tanner a good home was all she said he heard her voice tighten could picture her at the kitchen table he knew her patterns he loved her as one of the good ones they would miss each other well see he said she told him to take care of himself that she loved him and as they hung up he realized how very close theyd become how much he would miss her pulling back onto the road the trees alive with color larson considered the career risk he took by coming here to the mans private home he wasnt supposed to know the identity of any of the witsec regional directors much less visit one unannounced he had no idea what repercussions he might face he pulled to a stop in front of an impressive threestory tudor either sunderland or his wife came from a wealthy family or she had a hell of a good job because there was no way a person on sunderland s salary could afford this place it sported four brick chimneys leaded glass windows and a fully landscaped yardmore like a parkincluding a slate walkway that led up to an archedtop wooden door that hosted a massive wroughtiron knocker in the shape of an ivy wreath a pair of impressive oaks shaded the front yard their leaves rattling at larsons feet intimidated by the surroundings he rehearsed not only what to say but how to say it the door opened to a young teenage girl selfconscious and wearing braces she tried to hide by covering her mouth as she spoke she wore hiphugger blue jeans and a gap tshirt that showed her navel larson wondered what it was like being her parent marley your dad home he took a risk by using her name but thought the familiarity might soften her she cocked her head curious may i tell him whos asking the right words the right schools she didnt invite him inside she blocked the door with her foot the right training deputy marshal roland larson he told her handing her his business card tell him im with he spelled it fatf sure wait here please she closed the door for the hell of it larson tried the handle and found it locked sunderland s kids had grown up to learn the complexities of living in the same house as a regional witsec director or maybe it was just suburbia there were only four other regional directors who knew the program as intimately as sunderland but it had been sunderland who had relocated hope from the orchard house sunderland s face and his wrinkled clothes left the impression he hadnt slept recently a pair of smudged reading glasses hung from his neck by a thin black cord he smelled of popcornor maybe that was the house itself he had ice blue eyes that projected contempt a roman nose the silver hairs of which needed trimming a cleft chin and awkward ears he wore his graying hair cut like that of his fellow suburban businessmen well in disguise his right hand remained behind and screened by the massive door possibly concealing a weapon larson caught a reflection in the narrow side window alongside the door two big guys well dressed completely out of place on a saturday stood back on the sidewalk between him and his car deputy marshals no doubt assigned to protect the guy who protected so many the loss of laena had shaken witsec to its core creds sunderland ordered fingering the business card larson turned over his id wallet his moves slow and controlled for the sake of the two behind him we met once six years ago did we he asked still studying larsons credentials through the half reading glasses on the bridge of his nose a woman witness larson said using this to jog sunderland s memory because women were such a minority among protected witnesses it was a farmhouse outside of st louis you came down there to debrief her sunderland glanced over the top of his glasses you do look vaguely familiar scott rotem was in the field then this is back before our protection squad was transferred to fatf thats a nice promotion he still couldnt place larson let me ask you this my home are you out of your mind sunderland s phone number went unpublished and was not listed anywhere in any government publication nor on any internet site standard security for a witsec regional the five regionals ultimately relocated all the witnesses in the program or oversaw their relocated identities as such the regionals were carefully protected i traced you through marley and conner you or your wife bought them each a cell phone about a year and a half ago marleys phone had the home address listed it took me about thirty minutes to get it sunderland grimaced and then waved off the two guards as he closed the door behind larson he asked incredulously you found me through my kids cell phones its what i do for a living the living room was chippendale handwoven area rugs and floral arrangements that matched larson drank in the sweet smell of furniture polish and the tang of ripe cheese he heard a television running sunderland led him past the kitchen down a hallway lined with summer vacations the television first growing louder then fading scott knows about this visit not exactly larson answered honestly fugitive apprehension has the utmost respect of those of us in the service larson and were all aware its you running field operations rotem can be a real prick we all know that too but he gets the job done so do you im told or i wouldnt have let you past the front door in fact hed recognized larsons name if not his face how well do you know markowitz larson asked once the study door was closed livedin and somewhat disorganized it appeared to be a maids room hed converted for it was a door or two past the laundry room it smelled of oil paint and whiskey a partially completed somewhat tacky landscape sat on a paintstained wooden easel in the near corner a canvas drop cloth beneath it calms the nerves sunderland explained catching larson staring not when you look at it larson thought leo markowitz is a brilliant designer and technician i know him only professionally of course but im not sure theres much to leo besides the professional he took an unruly system for cataloging and and tracking thousands of protected witnesses and and created out of it not just a database but an encrypted database we paid a dozen convicted hackers to try to break laena and and not one of them made it past first base the mans a genius how many within witsec knew what he was doing knew it was him doing it listen if youre going where i think youre going were way ahead of you were on it sos rotem if theres a molewitsec fatf justicewell ferret him out im sure you will but were coming at this from an entirely different direction than you youre trying to find a mole and turn him were trying to find markowitz and that means radiating out from anyone who knew his role in this and looking at their recent activities calls emails contacts finances some of the same stuff youre looking at so ill get you the names well email them to you there are about eight people total were looking at thatll help thanks which woman sunderland asked the farmhouse he reminded what was her primary stevens hope stevens sunderland nodded no one forgot hope but as it turned out sunderland remembered her for other reasons than larson might have thought she opted out you know i heard larson took a deep breath i need to know whats in her witsec record what someone might see if they went looking i need to find her that halfcocked tilted head of curiosity was something his daughter had learned from him have you been assigned to do so delicate territory larson hesitated because i dont know if you know this or not but justice would do backflips to find her right now theres a case pending she could be influential donny romero youre beginning to impress me larson or am i pissing you off larson could see it in the mans face sunderland nodded behind an ironic smile okay that too youre not going to read this in any report but markowitzs assistant the one we found dead in the downstairs bathroom was killed by the same person that attacked hope stevens on that bus six years ago you remember that incident go on i need to find her because theyll come looking markowitzs assistant was either done by the same person or a different one trained by whoever trained him because its a signature kill were never going to prove it was the romeros but thats not my job and were never going to prove this either but hope stevens is at the top of the list of people they want dead she reads about donnys parole review and maybe she has a change of heart and comes out of the bushes are they going to risk that and we have two choices let them get her let her be killed or find her lay a trap and either arrest the killer on the way in and try to debrief him orand this is more to my likingscare the shit out of him drive him off and hope the termite returns to the nest hed surprised sunderland with all of this in truth he didnt care nearly as much about tracking the killer but he knew sunderland would want a bigger prize than protecting an awol witness the same nest thats containing markowitz and laena im guessing i told you she opted out you placed her into the program i did its true you created a new life for her a life she may still be following using even if under an assumed name ive put dozenshundredsinto the program what makes you think id remember this one larson had his own answer for that he said when she opted out was there any discussion or did she just blow you off sunderland pursed his lips studied larson thoughtfully and shook his head slightly i dont do this he said i dont know what your agenda is deputy marshal but i dont discuss protected witnesses the active list is missing no one is protected but what about the inactive listthose whove opted out of the program why do i think that those witnesses would have a list of their own everything thats contained in laena or nearly everything has a paper counterpart we also have physical backups of laena all of that is being onlined as we speak by monday well be most of the way back his tone indicated otherwise but larson didnt challenge any of that the computer backups had probably been installed by markowitz and if so they might not be so easily accessed witsec most certainly had paper records but how current were they and how easily found and organized he thought it was probably in more of a shambles than sunderland was letting on a couple years into depending on computers and paperwork seemed to calcify i need anything youve got on her larson said he felt sunderland resist why do you suppose there hasnt been a bloodbath larson asked i beg your pardon if markowitz has cracked laena and decrypted each of the protected identities if the romeros have all those names and locations then why hasnt there been a bloodbath with sunderland behind the desk larson stepped forward and took a seat in a comfortable red leather chair facing him they could sell the names off that list no shortage of buyers every crime family in the country has someone on that list theyd like to see deadmost have hit lists theyre just itching to get to so why no bloodshed im sure scott told you about the encryption one identity at a time thats a lot of work takes a lot of time why else they want to cherrypick the list i suppose were way ahead of you on this larson believe me we have crews out there right now recalling dozens of witnesses but not the ones who have opted out larson said actually were posting a prearranged general warning for all witnesses its a red flag meant to send them and their dependents to ground theyll stay there until they get the all clear and hope will obey that if shes smart she will if shes not smart larson said we miss a golden opportunity to catch a killer and find marko are you always this confident fugitive apprehension isnt like anything else you have to learn to see around corners thats all im trying to do here sunderland stood and moved to his study door trying to draw larson out of his chair come on he said larson didnt budge youve got to help me not here sunderland said not in my home im not discussing a protected witnesseven one that opted outin my home we have a room downtown its clean both of us will have to be swept as well im not doing this without taking that precaution larson practically sprang out of his chair sunderland had agreed to give him hope stevens larson was made to empty his pocketsbillfold credentials loose change handkerchief penand to leave his blackberry and his belt anything metal with the deputy in charge sunderland did the same but was carrying a lot less wands were waved over every limb and up and down their torsos like an airport security check before either man was cleared they entered a plainlooking conference room housed in the center of the offices this room was without windows or decoration and only the one door a thick door that locked with a significant click the pale green walls looked different to larson perhaps a special metallic paint had been used or even a composite material that reflected radio waves hed heard of such rooms but had never been in one no phone no computer no electrical wall outlets the recessed lights in the ceiling shone through some kind of thick glass or similar material and larson thought this material was probably also designed to ground out any random radio waves it had been a thirtyminute drive downtown larson in the rental following sunderland s buick all this effort he thought an exercise in secrecy for a woman no longer in the program he would never fully understand the government of which he was a part at his request larson was provided a simple wood pencil and a blank piece of paper hope stevens was relocated under the protected name alice frizen sunderland began without ceremony a man in a hurry bakersfield california we set her up as i recall with employment in health care information technology skills wasnt it computers yes yes it at a hospital im pretty sure it was no matter because just short of a year after assuming her new identity right at the time she was applying for a dependent there was another of our witnesses a man known to hope stevens who was murdered while in a parking lot outside a walmart in des moines his pictureit was a gruesome killwent national before we could stop it the stevens woman went off our radar just as the ausa was putting a second case the murderforhire case together against donny romero and the others needless to say those conspiracy and attempted murder charges were never brought larson sat there as if slapped across the face hopes application for a dependents paperwork suggested the existence of a husband or a child or both a new life indeed a dependent singular or plural anything more on that there might be in her record youre right about her information being filed separately we do pull it once they opt out but its kept in laena as well because seventysome percent of those who opt out eventually rejoin the program by monday ill be in a better position to clarify this sort of request and thats all alice frizen voluntarily left the program larson scratched out notes for himself forfeiting a sizable stipend and medical insurance coverage i might add thats a lot to give up it is indeed no explanation of this dependent child lover relative none that im aware of and thats that larson had spent a career reading the faces of notorious liars and he put sunderland up there with the best of thembut a liar just the same it wasnt all and larson knew it the possibility of mr romeros parole lit a fire under the us attorneys office with it came a renewed interest in locating ms stevens aka ms frizen and and i dont report rumor or innuendo larson studied the man carefully awaiting another lie its one of those things you hear is all sunderland said would you make the call for me on a saturday larson answered you want to wait until monday i was told that if markowitz doesnt have the entire list decrypted by now he will any day i doubt either of us has slept much in the last thirty hours and i can tell you i for one wont be doing my best work by the time monday rolls around youll have to wait here im good at waiting larson answered containing his excitement government work you know sunderland didnt appreciate the sarcasm he left the room larson catching a glimpse of the deputy marshal standing guard by the door after a minute larson put his head down onto his arms and rested on the table he sat bolt upright upon sunderland s return sunderland sat down beneath a great emotional weight reminding larson of some judges as they returned to the bench following jury deliberations sunderland said an alice dunbar appears on a threeyearold health insurance group coverage for st lukes hospital minneapolis the social she provided is the same one we gave her for frizen she probably had no choice it makes sense post its this side of impossible to get a counterfeit social the name change to dunbar was legitdone legally in california theres also a social assigned by treasury to one penelope dunbar born in california currently a fiveyearold caucasian female the kids social was mailed to a box number in minneapolis the investigators report lists some calls made to the hospital there before passing this up the command his report suggests the lead was promising at that time and sunderland now seemed to be dragging this out for dramatic effect and the change bothered larson no followup sunderland s face reflected larsons exasperation youre the one who brought up government work it looks as though he sent it over to us to justice but not directed to the us attorneys officeand this is a little over three months ago apparently it never found its way to the us attorneys office this deputy had not only the post office box number where the social had been sent but a residential address he thought was good it was very good work this guy did theres been a lot of turnover at justice since ridge and homeland securityi probably dont have to tell you that but as far as i can telland its the same for the guy i talked toit looks as if it died there right larson said then under his breath or else she did chapter five minneapolis minnesota streamed past outside the bus window as the passenger took a final opportunity to commit the face of his next victim to memory he had to allow for added age a change in hair color or style weight loss or gain so he focused on the green eyes the soft curve of her chin and the placement of her ears finding a tiny hooked scar in the hairs of the eyebrow above her left eye he put no currency in the namealice frizen alice dunbarhe thought instead of carving lines into her shallow at first deeper when necessary the beauty of the rich sanguine red against pale skin a hole in the knee of his worn blue jeans revealed the dark skin of his latin heritage his knee bounced with the vibrations of the city bus the fabric moved including the forest green sweatshirt he wore but not the body withinevery muscle flexed and taut a cat ready to pounce with the hood of the sweatshirt pulled up the mans face remained like a monks in dark shadow so that the curious little girl who studied him so intently from the row in front of him could make out no distinguishing features just two eyes peering out impossibly dark brown to the point of appearing black at the center those eyes looked down and returned to the crossword puzzle in his lap across a knot not to be undone the fiveyearold girl smiled at him and waved with the tips of her fingers so her mother wouldnt see she clearly hoped for a smile but she got nothing out of him paolo ignored the girl his attention on the puzzle and occasionally out the bus window on the street numbers above or alongside the door of a passing building he awaited a particular address for all the rigidity of his muscles he felt an internal calm he followed instruction he did as he was told he felt eternally grateful for the opportunity hed been given a sense of family a sense of belonging nothing no one would come close to stopping him paolo had philippe to thank for his training he served him as a lieutenant serves his captain it had crossed his mind more than once that his orders should have come directly from ricardo philippes half brother who now ran the romero compound in his fathers retirement philippe did not sit on the council as ricardo did and was unlikely to have the authority to order this womans execution but this was the woman responsible for putting donny away and so paolo followed the orders philippe was tangled up in a family dispute a power struggle to keep the family business in health care and insurance while his worthless half brother was more of a street thug who favored cutting in on the native american casinos and gaming paolo would follow philippe to the grave if asked ricardo was an arrogant spoiled snot if the bastard son philippe was making a move for control of the romero family as it appeared then paolo would gladly assist the transition philippe carried a hardon for his half brothers wife an extremely finelooking italian woman named katrina paolo grew heady with the thought of his own increased importance following the success of this job he felt the twinges of an erection and knew he must be close he looked up and caught a street number off a delicatessens window yes nearly there gordian he wrote into the small boxes he reached for the button to signal the driver next stop paolo scouted the back of the apartment building intent on finding an alternate point of entry the crossword puzzle was now folded and tucked into a back pocket he pulled down the sweatshirts hood aware that he exposed his face by doing so but wanting his ears in open air his hearing in top form he pursed his lips and inhaled through his nose collecting the various odors of the back alleycats stale beer human urine decomposing trash motor oilwiggled the fingers of both hands like a butterfly drying its wings and briefly closed his eyes containing himself in darkness before opening them again and seeing everything around him as new he saw it the adjacent office building held a fire escape on the alley side that led to the buildings roof this office building physically connected to the apartment building which had a similar fire escape but one that used a weighted drop mechanism and was therefore impossible for paolo to reach it was an indirect route but one that would serve his purpose broad daylight he thought who expects to die in the morning hollywood had conditioned the public into believing murder only happened at night he had them to thank for the ease with which he could surprise his victims he climbed strongly his light frame moved effortlessly by a taut lean musculature he made no hurry of it counting again on the publics conditioning he climbed with confidence a maintenance man perhaps or a roofer making an inspection he crossed to the fourstory apartment building descended an exterior steel ladder and worked his way down one level to the catwalk that fronted a string of eight large windows studying the top floor as he climbed down he made it out to be two apartments four windows each kitchen living room and probably a pair of bedrooms from a distance no one would see the trufeel surgical gloves with his back turned to the alley it would be difficult if not impossible to make out the reflective sunglasses he now donned they served the same purpose as the black box strung across eyes in photographs effecting anonymity he had alice s face committed to memory her body as wellwhat the photo showed of it he made a point of slipping past the windows swiftlya blur a shadow he had the recent heat wave to thank for four of the six windows being either ajar or fully open two contained fans that spun noisily helping to conceal his actions apartment d would occupy the three righthand windows the first of these was open four inches and looked in on an empty galley kitchen paolo heard a womans voice as well as synthesized new age background music not a human voice he discerned electronic a cd or television he hesitated just long enough to hear the instructions and realize it was yoga tighten your abdomen firm up the buttocks and rock like a rocking horse the next window was shut without exposing himself he studied it from the side more closely locked but the third windowthe bedroomwas also open he peered around the window frame just far enough to see her facing away from him and toward a television where an instructor went through the motions alice wore a black swimsuit or leotard that fit her lean frame tightly and was currently wedged up her buttocks and crotch as she rocked per instruction she was damp with perspiration and some pubic hair escaped the edges paolo again felt the twinges of arousal he slipped the razor out from behind his belt buckle and sliced the nylon screen on the kitchen window a calculated risk nothing came without a price if his diversion failed things could get messy noisy he might be forced to work incredibly fast nothing new in this world the most promising situations often turned bad he reached through the slice in the screen and pushed a warm coffee mug off the counter to his delight it crashed to the tile floor his eye was to the second window by the time she came out of her pose pulled her feet in front of her and stood hello she called out she marched into the kitchen pulling down on the backside of the leotard her buttocks flexing nicely paolo slipped past this window cut the screen to the bedroom and was fully inside within a matter of seconds his heart beat wildly in his chest she was neat and tidy and dead before she knows it he thought he heard her picking up the pieces of the cup and dumping them into the trash she ran water probably for a sponge she wouldnt see the cut in the screen for his technique was to work the very edge by the frame with it tucked back into place as hed left it shed have to push against the screen to reveal the damage the cup falling would remain a curiosity shed blame it on wind despite the weight of the cup and the air being still shed blame it on vibration from the dishwasher though it was not running people wanted to believe the easy explanations if she had any fear it was just now warming her he hoped it might be pulsing strongly by the time he confronted herhe could work a persons fear like a potter with wet clay he hurried into the living room and drew the gauzy drapes shut glad that on the television the fortysomething flatchested instructor continued her smoothvoiced program on the screen the woman currently held both legs apart suggestively paolo was at the height of excitement like an athlete before the starting gun he moved fluidly across the room placing his back against the wall that joined the kitchen awaiting her coming through the doorway he was hungry now he felt electricity sparking in the air i can smell her he realized almost time it always ended too quickly he hoped this time to drag it out as long as possible it wasnt every day he did a woman much less one as young and pretty as this one one had to count ones blessings the woman stepped back into the small living space prepared to reengage in her yoga when paolo collared her around the neck with a choke hold the elbow and forearm grip cut off both her wind and the blood to her head he lifted her off her feet as she kicked and struggled putting up with her flailing elbows he drove a knee into her back and maintaining the choke hold slammed her down onto her tailbone he managed to secure her left arm and releasing the choke hold handcuffed both hands behind her back he set the choke hold again to prevent a scream and dragged her into the center of the room turning up the volume on the tv with his free hand her nipples spiked under the leotard and he responded with an urge to have her he grew excited by her frantic breathing her heaving chest and her legs slapping together he decided to enjoy her before he killed her or at least before she fully expired she shook her head side to side eyes wide as saucers he abandoned the choke hold to cup her mouth and muffle the upcoming scream at the same instant he used the razor to sever the leotards shoulder straps cutting into her skin as well the pain from a cut of a sharp razor takes several long seconds to register a moment later the trickles of blood began he made no effort to expose her chest black and gray straps sagged down but the tight leotard held to her he felt her shudder the waves of fear quaking through her and it pleased him saliva ran down the hand that covered her mouth say goodbye alice im not alice the woman moaned i have money a car anything you want a flash of heat filled his face he would expect her to claim she wasnt hope stevens but alice could he possibly have the wrong woman he spun her around to face him and she must have known by the fact he didnt hide himself from her what he ultimately had in mind he struck her below the v of her rib cage and threw her back and onto the floor you say one word he hoisted the pinkedged razor to indicate his intention he withdrew the photo and did a quick comparison he looked for scars from implants or plastic surgery he compared only the relationship of the eyes to the ears not the look of them the eye color was wrong way off he scrambled forward pinning her beneath him as she writhed to be free he liked the feeling of her warmth beneath him of her bucking to be free the leotard slipped lower on her chest a breast revealed he grew hard as he steadied her then he reached toward her face held her head in a tight grasp and carefully spread open her left eye with his fingers searching for a pigmented contact lens no lens not possible he felt tormented by the possibility hed screwed this up im not alice im not alice she repeated in shock now barely conscious this was how he liked them but the situation was not good he tried to maintain his focus her face was blotchy snot all over her chin tears oiling her cheeks he used his bare hand to clean her up steady now he cautioned you wouldnt want me to slip again he produced the razor as he lowered it toward her she froze obeying him he cut into the fabric at her cleavage and the stretch fabric came open like hed lowered a zipper this revealed a gray sports bra that he quickly cut and peeled back exposing both breasts now her chest glowed an angry red much better he said knowing the power he gained by working against embarrassment and shame her nipples and areolas were dark brown going on black puckered and nut hard he felt some drool on his own chin he was salivating she raked her head side to side her eyes locked onto the bloodied tip of the razor he held in his right hand by now her shoulder cuts would be stinging by now she understood what he intended tell me about alice this is her apartment he knew enough to discern the spark of recognition talk to me he lowered the razor again pulling on the cut stretch fabric to continue the line hed started that line led down he exposed her navel a ridge of carefully trimmed pubic hair the less of the leotard the more of his arousal he wasnt sure how long he could contain himself mrs blanchard the woman coughed up neighbor mrs blanchard mentioned alice alice alice and her daughter two peas in a pod she said i am not alice please god dont do this paolo had a thing about gods name being invoked during his work it seemed everyone summoned up the courage to get religion when a razor flashed before their eyes paolo had a grim relationship with god that few would understand but one that caused him deep resentment when his victims begged for saving he cut through the rest of the leotard careful not to nick her he didnt want her all bloody and dirty there the leotard now stretched in a long v from armpits to the dark tangle of brown hair her scent enveloped him and he briefly swooned like a patron in a pastry shop this was fear pure fear heady heavenly the woman said im subletting alice this alice its not me im not her shut up he backhanded her meaning it more for himself he contemplated the ramifications of his mistake he loathed the idea of disappointing philippe he would not call to inform him of bad news and what of this child what child what daughter hed been told nothing of this knew nothing of this he drew a line at doing anything bad to children hed been one himself mrs blanchard the woman beneath repeated talk to her she knew alice the welt rose on her right cheek where hed struck her the dull look in her eye told him that she understood this was quickly coming to an end the television instructor was talking about deep stretches and he had a little deep stretch of his own to give her his mind made up he cut off a piece of the leotard balled it in his fist and crammed it into her open mouth as she summoned a protest she tried to bite him but to no use her eyes wild they opened to where he could see the crown of the eyeball itself again he noted no contact lens nothing to explain the wrong color he felt dizzy both from excitement and confusion he slipped the razor away unfastened his belt and let his pants down let her see what hed done to himself if he had seen fear in her face before now he saw terror she humped her way backward thrusting her bottom off the floor trying to distance herself but the humping motion of her hips only served to stimulate him all the more thats it he said just like that dont run from me then he crawled forward and went to work paolo rubbed a few small drops of blood deeper into the green fabric of his sweatshirt before knocking an older woman he took to be mrs blanchard opened the door it had to be her gray blue hair cloudy ice blue eyes that sparkled with a hunger for companionship even the companionship of a stranger knocking on her door i think you may have known alice my dear dear friend paolo said by way of introduction speaking as politely and calmly as possible mrs blanchard took note of his color hed seen that look a thousand times before yes a fragile voice he was reminded of little glass horses on windowsills i wonder if you might be able to help me find her i have no other address for her than this what dear girls those two the old woman said do you know where i might find them no no i dont just up and left one day not even a goodbye that fits paolo cocked his head slightly inviting himself in would you mind id love to hear anything you can tell me about them im sorry she said as sweetly as possible but i dont admit strangers but with both of us their friends she seemed to consider this then reconsidered im sorry id be happy to meet you at petesthe diner next door say twenty minutes her head tilted in curiosity as she heard the snap of latex on his left wrist and she looked down he calmly slipped his right hand into the second glove what on earth she made a play to shut the door paolos shoe blocked it she looked up her mouth gaping like a fledgling too terrified to cry out we just need to have a little talk he seized hold of her the loose skin of her throat rolling over the latex lifted her off her feet by her neck and stepped inside nudging the door gently shut behind him nice place you have here he said when it was all over out of habit paolo chased down a vanilla milkshake and drank it slowly so that it wouldnt give him a headache his temptation was to use the cell phone to call philippe but he could put that off a while a second much stranger compulsion overcame him a desire to call mother in italy a woman he hadnt seen in fifteen years but the time zones were all wrong and perhaps she wasnt even alive though if she was he knew shed be pleased to hear from him just as shed be pleased to hear from any of the dozens of boys she raised along with him instead following the milkshake he gave in and placed the call he was required to make the line rang three times and went silent he typed in the code waited for two beeps and pushed go ahead said the male voice on the other end of the call philippe it got wet itll make the news and bring the dogs go on shes not here moved on theres a daughter named penny he knew this information would stun philippe so he gave that a moment to sink in do we know where she is where they are she worked at st lukes hospital here maybe still does im heading over there now the girl the daughter we just doubled our odds of finding them philippe said yes paolo agreed still not liking the development when you get to the hospital focus on the child shes unlikely to change her daughters name not her first name kids dont go for that and that helps usyou use it people love kids love to talk about them true enough paolo liked kids himself well see if theres anything we can get you from this end report back after the hospital despite philippes businesslike tone paolo hung up feeling hed let him down for the past several years paolo had been top dog at the compound philippes right hand he had no intention of giving up that position if there were information to be gleaned from the hospital hed find it if alice still worked there hed find her and kill her reminded of his attack on the bus all those years before he had no intention of repeating that failure he was older now more seasoned and experienced he made it a point never to repeat a mistake chapter six four months earlier minneapolis minnesota burn victims were the worst like fish skin left too long on the barbecue the patient arrived sedated rushed from the ambulance to the er alice dunbar watched the blur of blue scrubs pass as the er nurses took possession and the paramedics surrendered control a male nurse broke off the cavalcade to handle the paperwork three others all women stayed with the patient running the gurney toward the elevators in order to expedite delivery to the burn ward as the emergency room administrator alice could observe all this with a certain degree of detachment she kept the health care machine working admittance insurance scheduling oncall assignments and she attended administration meetings to convey the inherent problems the personality conflicts the budget overrunsall part of her daily life the job had nothing to do with her technical expertise but that had been the case for most of the past six years as a former systems analyst and fraud investigator for jamerson ltd a britishowned insurance underwriter her computer skills had once proved incredibly valuable now those talents went unrecognized and uncompensated for until a colleague had a problem with a pc alice was the unpaid computer geek of the emergency room administrative offices shed chosen minneapolis nearly at random but in part because garrison keillors show had let her imagine that good simple lives were lived here a wholesome place to bring up her daughter and also because it had a robust theater communityincluding shakespeare in the park of course if witsec ever came looking for her roland larson would concentrate on cities offering shakespeare first he knew this about her he knew too much about her alice had been a redhead for the past six monthsa fairly convincing color given that it was out of a box beneath the red was natural blond shed tried to gain weight but to no useher metabolism her nerves burned it off as fast as she could eat the result was a slightly gaunt look sunken eyes pronounced cheekbones unflattering she thought she looked a little sallow unable to spend the time she wanted outdoors simply because she felt safer while inside they were out there somewhere she never forgot about themnot for a second not in the shower not on her way to sleep not now as she worked in st lukes anybody anytime this mantra had been drummed into her during witsec orientation she could make friends but she could not trust them she could tell no one she lived like the bubble boys on the sixth floor of this same hospital insulated isolated and completely alone except for penny the new website is pretty cool dont you think that was tina sweet tina who worked as her administrative assistant tina whose job it was to dig them out from under the pile of paperwork but who toiled at it like a dog digging in sand perfect tina with her perfect body her perfect kids and her perfect husband there were times alice ached to trade lives with her what website the daycare tina answered it went up over the weekend such cute shots you should see you and penny in the music circle the two of you are adorable and ill tell you something i like that they only use first names you know a little extra measure of safety alice s ears whined like standing too close to a jet airplane she remembered the music circle vaguely do you read any of the email they send us tina worked the keyboard of her computer opening the website the coolest part of it is this she spun the monitor so that alice could see on the screen in a small box alice saw the jerky motion of kids playing and she understood immediately that she was watching a live webcam are they insane alice said far too loudly for the small office she dropped the pile of papers shed been holding she broke into a full run as she reached the same corridor through which the burn patient had just been admitted she felt burned as well tina watched through the offices interior window she called out her voice silenced by the thick glass tina inadvertently left the webcam up on her computer five minutes later in that same jerky almost inhuman motion alice entered into frame snatched penny into her arms and looked once directly at the camera with a face so full of fear that tina flinched and backed from the screen chapter seven the present paolo entered the modern brick edifice of minneapolis s st lukes hospital with the small brown shoulder bag hed borrowed from mrs blanchard the woman whod told him about st lukes in the first place he worked his way down the sterile corridors until reaching the administration receptionist a hispanic woman in her midtwenties with long acrylic fingernails he held up the bag putting it on display then slid his photograph of hope stevens across the counter and through the open window i found this purse out in the parking lot it says inside there is a reward if found this picture was inside does this woman work here he let the woman take a look and he took a chance the name on the id is alice alice dunbar there is a photo of a pretty little girl too the woman answered him after a moment alice this id barely recognize her she looked up at paolo you only found this just now just now hmmm she hasnt worked here in a long time she eyed him curiously where did you say you found this have you got a forwarding address for me i wouldnt mind that reward he felt his pulse quickening legwork and patience paid off it had been drummed into him by philippe the thrillslike those at the apartmentwere shortlived but well worth the wait the receptionist worked the keyboard with those long nails no nothing she finally said you might try tina down in er admin she and alice were close tina the woman pointed to the left down the hall follow signs to the er gracias good luck with the reward and if you hear from her tell her we could use a postcard the ers waiting room teemed with noise and confusion giving paolo a moment to study the back of the brownhaired woman in the glass box of an office a woman he took to be tina humboldt executive assistant as advertised by the black placard by the sliding window another woman prim and proper came and went from the same office she carried an aluminum clipboard and hurried stiffly down the long corridor her clothes neatly pressed twice a male housecleaner in green scrubs opened and entered a glorified closet that paolo saw stacked with linens cleansers and supplies this he thought would make a suitable interrogation room he would need ms tight ass to be off on one of her excursions and the busy waiting room to remain so the more he worked it out in his head the longer he waited the better he liked it the officious one with the pointy tits and stiff walk came and went one more time a sick mexican laborer coughed up blood that threw his family into a frenzy paolo moved toward the office door and knocked loudly enough to be heard over the cacophony behind him hello tina glanced up at him delivered a presson smile and pointed to the waiting room were handling everyone as quickly as possible shed probably mistaken him for a mexican and this pissed him off a brazilian orphaned and raised briefly in italy before being trained in washington state paolo didnt care for the ethnic association its about alice he said alice dunbar tina spun on her office chair she had a pleasant but not exceptional face you know alice her face brightened paolo measured his chances of getting her out of the office and toward the closet ive heard from her he said she asked me to pass a message along to you but its private confidential you understand he looked behind him at all the noise and confusion please come in she said standing to reach for the door the phone rang saving him he gave it a distasteful look its interruption unacceptable and he said maybe just over there cocking his head away from all this stuff she nodded i get so used to it i dont even hear it he stepped away hoping she would follow and she did drawn by her curiosity he felt a rush of satisfaction when he found the right playas he had just nowhe could use the victims own desires and needs he stopped just in front of the closet door marked private turned and faced her my names raoul he said i helped to relocate alice and penny tinas brow furrowed with concern he knew that word would win her interest relocate she asked did she never tell you about him the father and what hed done to her tina shook her head he could see her thinking so that was it the trick was to buy enough time to wait for the exact moment he needed them to be invisible he used a convex hallway mirror mounted overhead to keep an eye on the corridor behind him another eye on the distraught mexicans while watching the small glassedin office as well in case the other woman returned a doctor appeared in the waiting room and the mexicans clustered around him now paolo reached out toward tina with open hands as if to console her as she responded her hands coming up reluctantly paolo grabbed her wrist opened the closet door and spun her inside in one fluid motion in a precise ballet of movement he flicked on the light caught her up in a choke hold and eased the door shut behind him the door wasnt made to lock so he dragged her off her feet and away from the door he reversed her his hand on her throat now and pinned her up against the shelves nearly lifting her again tina proved herself a wily one maybe shed taken a selfdefense class or seen the move in a film but she reached back onto the shelf as he pushed her against it and onehanded a steel brush at paolos face he saw it coming deflected the effort and knocked the brush from her hand he was angry now she drove a knee for his crotch but he blocked it taking it on his thigh he delivered a fist to her solar plexus and watched her pale felt her sag his rule his automatic response to those who fought back was severe punishment he drew his razor from its hiding place behind his belt buckle listen to me now he told the whites of her eyes you know what happens to little girls who lie they get religion he cut straight down through her blouse neck to navel he made it a shallow cuta bleeder that wasnt close to lifethreatening maybe because she worked in er shed know that about the cut maybe not but either way he won her full attention the second cut made equally fast ran breast to breast completing the sign of the cross that seeped out into her clothes ill leave you to bleed out if you dont answer me do you understand she nodded terrified he loved that look of panic in their eyes that moment when they realized theyd lost all control choking her as he was he watched her grow slightly blue and felt her begin to tremble from shock hold it together im going to let you go she nodded again though her eyes rolled slightly back into her head and he feared she might faint he loosened his grip and whispered where did alice go she coughed tears streamed from her eyes she whipped her head side to side indicating no perhaps in his outrage hed pushed her too far perhaps she was a lost cause if so he knew the thing to do was to quickly finish her and get the hell out of here he tried one more time where she didnt say tina gasped she was feeling the sting of the cuts now she just left i never saw her again thats not helping me he said thats not helping you he presented the bloody razor blade well aware of the power it contained so small but so effective he counted down five four three two a letter she said too loudly paolo cupped her mouth turned his attention toward the door and listened thankful for the continuing commotion in the waiting room he motioned for quiet then released her mouth she owed me some money a hundred dollars a pair of shoes id bought her i didnt even remember it she said she mailed it to me cash letter said thanks wasnt signed but i knew it was her youre wasting my time he moved the razor so it flashed light across her face come on tina you know better i was curious she said quickly on account of the way shed left like that panicked and all leaving a paycheck behind no explanation youre stalling he forced his free hand between her legs and filled his hand with her soft and incredibly warm he felt himself stir she rose to her toes and he heard her choke back a scream st louis she said a postmark the envelope st louis its all there was but at least i knew paolo felt a wave of satisfaction and accomplishment st louis his erection receded he hadnt the time for such foolishness well done tina he eased off her crotch while keeping the razor close to her face ill spare you the pain he told her in a warm whisper into her ear with that he crushed her nose with a single blow knocking her unconscious he used a towel to block the spray as he sliced her neck ear to ear as hed been taught he let her slump to the floor the secret of their conversation contained he once again felt himself engorged and aroused but knew this was not the place he committed tina to memory slumped on the floor like that so hed have it to draw upon when he had the time then he cracked open the door and slipped out leaving the wails and cries from the waiting room far behind chapter eight larson climbed the apartment stairs two at a time his federal shield flapping against his coat pocket he couldnt blame his pounding chest solely on the exertion hed been in an agitated state ever since arriving in minneapolis the rental car company said his credit card was no good only to reverse themselves he was detoured because of road construction but his rapid heart rate and clammy hands spoke to one thing hope stevens he prayed hed arrived in time at the address sunderland had provided larson faced clusters of poorly parked cop cars flashing lights and not one but two ambulances he slumped knowing without knowing everything about this scene implied he was too late the fall night air slapped him he smelled wood smoke in the air or rotting leaves or a foul cigar the trees were barren in minnesota weeks ahead of chicago and a month in front of st louis he reached an apartments open door at the top of the stairs slowing to allow an mpd officer to mentally process his federal credentials larson quickly introduced himself as fugitive apprehension the seas parted and he was inside whos lead he asked the door guard who then pointed out a man crouching by the sprawled body of an elderly woman who was simultaneously being photographed by a forensics tech in her late twenties the photographer bounced on her haunches as she squatted studying the dead woman with a controlled impatience before clicking off another shot the deceaseds dress was hiked up over ashen legs revealing varicose veins that wandered like wisteria the grapestained bruise on her neck suggested shed been strangled larsons panic gave way to relief who the hell is this he asked whos asking the detective was seated by a phone which he promptly hung up hed spent too much time in the sun on vacation his wellweathered and leathery face now pink and peeling you didnt get a tan like that in minneapolis he appeared to have fresh mosquito bites on his lower neck larson was guessing florida or maybe the yucatán hed been back a day or two at most larson introduced himself detective dennis manderly he wore latex gloves and didnt offer to shake hands with larson dressed in plainclothes like larson he stepped closer and studied larsons credentials carefully through a pair of bifocals that didnt want to stay on his nose question still stands fugitive apprehension task force larson said straining now to steal a look at the number on the apartment door c he had the wrong apartment larson wasnt sure what was going on but the clamminess crept through him again i missed my mark he said im down the hall hold on a sec judging by his accent manderly had been raised on the eastern seaboard boston or the bronx came to mind im gonna need a little more than that thatll have to happen boss to boss id tell you if i could manderly gave him a look that said im sure you would wrong apartment my mistake larson turned toward the door manderly called out stopping him my guys are down in d as well youre not going in there until and unless you or someone above you explains to me or to my boss why ive got two toetaggers on my hands two toetaggers those words drowned out all else larson charged out of the room down the hall and blew past a uniformed officer whose job might have been containment he entered a fairly bare living room where he stopped abruptly struck by the sight of the woman spreadeagled on the floor a blue workout mat was indicated by four numbered flags pinned into the carpet a televisions blue screen glowed in the background larson thought he knew that body the womans chest and abdomen were splayed open in the sign of a cross nipples to navel dark rust brown blood had run out of her and coagulated into a giant congealed scab looking like melted wax from a candle where it puddled on the carpet a rank and familiar odor pervaded a stench that even an open window couldnt overcome deputy manderly shouted behind him by only a step larson had to confirm her before they dragged him out of here the razorthin incisions needed no medical examiner to be properly analyzed he lunged past another forensic technician in an effort to identify the victims face he fell to his knees as manderlys thick fist caught his coat collar from behind larson looked over his shoulder and straight up the mans arm and said give me one minute sixty seconds then well do this behind a face flushed from running and indignation manderly met eyes with him released him and stepped back plastic surgery was a relocated witnesss best friend never mind hopes pledge never to resort to it chin cheek breast and buttocks implants botox pigmented contact lenses teeth veneers dental work laser hair removal and a cutters creative blade could so radically alter a persons look that only the lab boys could make the final confirmation he disconnected from the victims hair color forced her chin flatter her nose wider her cheekbones lower wondering if it possibly could be her he used his pen to move the womans hair off her neck ears were as individual as fingerprints this womans right ear smooth and perfect and clearly untouched by surgery did not belong to hope stevens larson had once spent hours staring at hope while she slept this was not her ear he exhaled wondering now how he might explain himself he hesitated briefly while concocting a ruse gloves he asked the tech he did not look back at manderly as the detective asked what the fuck are you doing in my crime scene deputy marshal gloves larson restated motioning with his hand awaiting delivery if youre thinking of moving her head forget it manderly said but he must have okayed the gloves because the technician deposited a pair into larsons waiting palm larson donned the gloves slipped open the eyelids and touched the surface of the eye looking for contact lenses that werent there victims name larson asked im not in a real giving mood manderly said maybe we take this up back at the office when your boss talks to mine larson snapped off the gloves and let them fall he passed manderly his full credentials wallet as he stood he explained we thought briefly judging by what wed heard of this scene the address that we might know the victim but clearly were mistaken lemme get this straight you came here in a real cooperative mood but changed your mind after seeing her face why the old lady larson asked any theories on that why the cross tits to crotch manderly nibbled toward the truth that fit the profile of whoever it is youre after larson considered how to play this rotem had assigned him to track down markowitz and therefore knew none of what he was up to if it went boss to bosswhich wasnt going to happen until monday morningthis would all come apart on him did she lease it or sublet it larson asked we barely just got here give us a minute to get her bagged first would you im betting sublet are you telling me this was mistaken identity they look a lot alike this one and who else larson shook his head conveying his unwillingness to share that information yeah thats what i thought manderly said i suppose you have a theory on the neighbor an older woman like that she was probably a longtime resident of the building when this one became a problem he turned to the older one for what he wanted and what did he want theres a contract hit out larson explained stretching the truth im supposed to stop it this razor larson indicated the cuts weve seen him before so have we manderly said larson rose to his feet heady from the fatigue and moving too quickly but more than all his physical challenges it was this information that made him stumble a step whats that we had a similar killing a razor like this earlier today we figure we got ourselves a serial killer he added and im thinking you federal boys have lost one am i right the other victim look anything like this one larson indicated the dead woman on the floor not really older maybe four or five inches shorter smaller overall larson felt himself relax a little hope might look older but she couldnt have shrunk sunderland had provided a possible place of hopes employment this wouldnt have been an employee of st lukes hospital by any chance would it have manderlys face registered his astonishment where the fuck did you get that ill need to speak to the investigating detective larson said manderly stood and brought his face close to larsons youre looking at him he said its been a long fucking day pal and it just got longer for both of us youre coming to the office and if i have to cuff you to get you there he said a couple of his uniforms perking up and stepping toward them i will this dumbass picked the wrong closet manderly explained nearly two hours had passed amid the familiar smell of burned coffee and male sweat cop shops werent so different one to the next it had been a while since larson had been inside an actual police department his time typically occupied in federal facilities but the lighting the low hum of printers and copiers of keyboards and muted conversation were nearly the same manderly and larson occupied chairs in a goodsized conference room with gray carpeting and an oval table that sat eight the rooms single window might have had a good view if the blinds hadnt been drawn a computer and keyboard a blank whiteboard a pair of phones and a video projector accounted for most of the rooms electronics on a separate dolly a tv and vcr held the attention of both men thing is manderly said further explaining himself evidently hospital scrubs make pretty good pajamas and this closet in er was getting hit the hardest that and antibacterial soap and shit like that so admin gets a headsup from it that they can mount a wireless webcam in there for peanuts and monitor it for theft this jerkoff drags her in there to do his thing having no idea hes on candid camera on the screen in the silent jerky motion of lowframecount surveillance video to which larson was becoming accustomed the abduction and murder played out again either he got seriously lucky here or hed scouted it and took his chances but his back is always to the camera we never get a look at his face other security video they got cameras all over the entrance to the er cause thats where the trouble always comes from but this turd entered er from the main wing we got a profile of him while he sat in a chair scoping the vic but thats about it and in terms of quality it sucks grainy and burned out its true video this webcam stuff is much better quality as it was the webcam image didnt impress larson it blurred with any quick motion so that when the killer moved to cut her neck it looked as if someone had wiped vaseline on the camera lens back it up larson instructed all civility gone from his voice it felt like a ghoulish act to repeatedly watch her die on the fourth viewing larson accepted the vcrs remote from detective manderly to both men a symbolic exchange of power larson watched a particular twentysecond section well over a dozen times he finally said i cant make out any of that can you youre kidding right have you got any kind of society or center for the deaf here in town metro deaf school manderly answered one of our captains he said responding to larsons look of surprise has a kid enrolled they do this music thing every christmas pretty fucking amazing actually can we get someone over here it had taken manderly that long to understand the request fucking a he said his tanned face breaking into a smile now that is fucking genius two long hours later larson had a ticket in hand for the city mouthed on the video by the woman who was about to be murdered in the hospital linen closet st louis back to where hed started chapter nine wearing only a shirt paolo leaned back on the airport motels crisp white sheets and muted the televisions sound on the screen the videotape of the yoga instructor in her pink leotard played just as it had been playing when hed sneaked into apartment d the woman on tv turned sideways bent over and practically touched her nose to the floor but it was the way her compact little ass flared toward the ceiling that sent paolos heart aflutter he removed the small cardboard sheath that protected the new utility razor blade examining its miraculous edge in the yellowish light of the motel rooms bedside lamp in flashes his face reflected partially in the steel of the tiny sharpened mirroran eye his teeth another eye hed grown thinner in recent months his face stretched unnaturally over sharp cheekbones more like the face of a mummy the dark eyes sunken deeply inside pronounced sockets the rich brown color of his eyes only revealed itself when he tilted his head up into light despite the look of his gaunt frame hed never been this fit this strong this fast on his feet in his life he accepted that with crimes came punishment guilt gave way to confession release he felt no pain internally or otherwise when he did these things to others only when he did them to himself without pain there was no payment it confirmed his existence he examined the perfection of the blade he loved it and hated it propping his head up with two pillows he saw past his erection to the screen where the pink leotard continued its contortions he could picture the woman hed killed mimicking those movements he could smell her he unbuttoned his shirt it fell open revealing dozens of raised scars some pink and fresh others dark and older a few lucky ones had been cut repeatedly and now protruded a quarter inch or more a geometric lump of scar tissue under the glow of the lamps dim light he placed the blade to a vacant space on his abdomen and applied pressure gentle at first then pressing more firmly as the skin separated and curled away from the blade he gritted his teeth watched the television and stroked himself he dragged the razor deeper creating a red feverish wound three inches long as he climaxed he dropped the razor awash in relief a flood of departing tension like a drain being opened beneath him he closed his eyes sighed deeply later when he bothered to look he realized hed gone a little deep with the razor the pink leotard had been lying on her back at the time stretching her legs up and apart hed overreacted the wound would require butterfly bandages but he carried them with him wherever he went for a moment he was not alone for a moment hed done nothing wrong for a moment he felt at balance with the world and his own place within it these feelings would change would forsake him over the next several hourshed been here enough times to know the kill might return in his dreams might linger for days or even weeks that hed fucked her while she died beneath him only made matters worse his moment of creation hers of destruction but he took opportunities when they arose and paid for them later in his own way as he did now he might rest later but now the adrenaline from this painful act would carry him he sometimes stayed awake days without sleep never bothered by it never fully understanding it he couldnt remember if or when hed last eaten and reminded himself to eat something before continuing under the glare of a fluorescent tube he wetted a towel and cleaned himself his black hair wet and combed back he left the room for a twentyfourhour diner envisioning pancakes and a hot cup of coffee an aging redhead in a tight shirt who would call him hon a bead of blood seeped through and stained his shirt despite the butterfly bandages he failed to notice it his body numbed and distant his mind whirring he felt right again and that was all that mattered chapter ten alice dunbars jefferson square loft apartment lacked a view of the st louis arch or the mississippi instead it looked out onto what only a few years earlier had been a needle park gentrification had relocated the drugs and dealers a few blocks south and east now the park offered penny a place to play on the jungle gym or to swing on the swings during the steamy sultry afternoons but penny wasnt in the mood for playing she stared at her mother tears pooled in oversized blue eyes poisoned by betrayal but we just got here alice packed furiously a maternal storm leaving debris in its wake shed been through this before she reminded herself wanting to stay calm only months ago in fact she felt bad for uprooting penny for the third time in her five short years this time penny had found a set of kids at day care to call her friends and her mother hated to lose that until this most recent move penny had pretty much kept to herself she liked american girl dolls and to be read the accompanying stories mcdonalds happy meals her hamburgers with onions mustard and ketchup shed outgrown a macaroniandcheese phase now it was frozen gogurts pancakes and flank steak when mommy could afford it she liked for her mom to read to her before bed her baths hot and her pillowcase cold shed learned to watch her mother for signals when on the bus or the street with little in the way of discussion instruction or explanation shed intuited that they lived a secret life a different life from others its not forever alice lied in fact alice had no idea when they might stop running were not moving were just leaving for a while like vacation not me im not going anywhere ill run away i will thats the point were running away together sweetheart alice said in as loving a voice as she could muster well be back despite this outburst penny was significantly more mature more worldly and sophisticated than her peers it no doubt stemmed from their nomadic secluded life whether those qualities would benefit her remained to be seen she acted like a fiveyearold but she read at a sixthgrade level and spoke with an adult vocabulary though adults were impressed alice wasnt thrilled with what she saw developing a precocious challenging willful child who acted as if she were entitled garagesale furniture had failed to adequately fill the loft space that had once housed a printing press and been home to a citywide giveaway newspaper alice had left the yellowed front pages of past editions stapled to the rough wood walls as artwork she checked the tv tuned to cnn wondering how often they would run the ad for the id bracelets shed seen it only once about an hour earlier but that had been enough to make her leave st louis today possibly forever the witsec deputies had drummed into her the need for her to keep up her daily watch of usatoday and cnn and even though shed fled witsec years before shed never stopped looking for the warning signal if she ever saw an ad for a silverplated id bracelet with the name johnny anyone on the bracelet and the address on the mailin form po box washington dc she was to take immediate action sight of the ad today had knocked her sideways one moment struggling through life on its typically difficult track the next pure panic something drastic something radical had happened within witsec that must have jeopardized all protected witnesses sadly for alice it was just more of the samethe endless dance of reinventing herself she packed while containing an anxiety she hadnt experienced since fleeing st lukes the unsettling existence of living with the knowledge that someone was after her wanted to kill her preoccupied her every thought every movement witsec tried to explain such feelings in its orientation literature but had no idea what they were talking about she knew that given this unexpected move she would not sleep for days worried sick about penny being a part of this and what might become of her daughter if her enemies were ever successful she glimpsed her immediate future their survival depended upon her own random unpredictable behavior they would live on what shed saved until she found new work she did not maintain a bank account instead she converted paychecks to cash for a fee and bought us postal service money orders she would keep moving would contact no one they would return to an isolated unpredictable life for the next few days or weeks however long it took for witsec to run a nearly identical ad to read mr johnny citizen po box washington dc that combination would alert her that whatever the problem it had been resolved it would be safe for protected witnesses to call the memorized phone number and check on their individual status for alice long since out of the program it would likely mean choosing someplace else to resettle with penny st louis had not worked out as planned anyway selfpity crept in and she pushed it away she would not cry in front of her daughter would not resent their situation she was alive she had a beautiful daughter she would not fantasize some life other than that shed been handed she would not give them that she would not succumb she and penny were a team like no other best friends mother and daughter rivals survivors she looked up from the clutter of clothes sorted first by necessity given that shed elected to try for a warmer climate this time fewer clothes less baggage she turned penny was not in the room she called out the first tendrils of fear wrapping around her heart pen no answer her daughter had been standing there only secondsminutesearlier her feet moved independently of her first at a walk then a run she hurried around the few rooms offered by the lofts layout she checked under both beds in all three closets behind the couch all of those places penny sought during hideandseek then she arrived at the front door only to find it hanging open her daughterher headstrong precocious adorable frightened little girlhad run off alice hurried within the building neighbor to neighbor not many of them knew her particularly wellshed made a point of not getting close but most knew penny just from hellos in the hall and at the mail slots with each successive failed attempt her desperation increased she was lightheaded and sick to her stomach she steadied her balance and attempted to predict where penny might go she ran three blocks to a church playground grateful that mrs kiyak a neighbor who didnt know her well but recognized a mothers fear when she saw it agreed to guard the apartment buildings stoop in case penny returned alice s deeper concern was that the elderly mrs kiyak might forget why she was sitting there for whom she was waiting and might return to her own apartment unaware she was in fact deserting her post mrs kiyak had delivered christmas cookies to her friends in the building not a month too early but on the twentyfifth of september the playground stood empty a blanket of fall leaves at its feet they stirred in a light breeze one of the swings moved pendulously on its chains the more alice shouted the more anxiety flooded her she fought to calm herself again if shed covered her tracks well and she believed she had then no one from her past knew about pennys existence no one could connect either of them to st louis if shed made any mistake it had been using her alice frizen social security number at st lukes a mistake she had not repeated here in st louis able to manipulate computer data with ease shed covered her tracks within her employment records at baines jewish hospital by way of a small sin she felt was forgivable adopting the social security number of a woman her age and roughly her description who had passed away from cancer up in minnesota by the time the irs figured that one out penny would have her own grandchildren the sounds of city traffic hummed like swarming bees she inhaled the improbable mixture of rich fall smells wet loamy earth the dry dust of brittle leaves she couldnt imagine penny leaving the building without her much less the neighborhood but then alice realized that if penny had left there was probably only one place she would go remembering shed left some cash by the phone in the apartment and now not remembering if shed seen the money during her search alice hurried back home if the cash was gone then she thought she knew exactly where to find her candy was pennys first and only real weakness discovering the cash missing from where shed left it alice tried three neighborhood stores two that sold candy and one that offered ice cream drawing blank looks and offers to help from each establishment she wandered back out onto the sidewalks she rarely shopped the same grocery store twice in a row the nearest lay eight blocks awaythe opposite direction from the hospital sometimes they walked to the market sometimes they took the bus she spun in circles tears now threatening as the hopelessness anger and frustration competed within her she thought of the toy store and broke into a run slaloming through pedestrians avoiding collisions then halfway to the toy store she skidded to a stop across the street she spotted little annies bookshoppe pennys favorite store after crown candy torn between the two she willed her feet to move but they wouldnt budge penny she screamed in such a shrill voice that she turned heads then quickly reminded herself that she was the one the romeros sought chapter eleven larson felt about hospitals the way kids do about dentists hed watched his mother die in one hed sat by his brothers side as he recovered from a freak diving accident that left him a paraplegic hed had his own shoulder operated on allowing him to continue rowing the smell the morose quiet the only thing good about hospitals was women in uniforms even a woman wearing blue scrubs turned him on pathetic he entered baines jewish the third hospital hed visited since landing two hours earlier in st louis bound and determined to ferret out hope trill hampton had met him at the airport driving one of the services black navigators an ostentatious ride if there ever were one considering the services efforts to maintain a low profile hampton a graduate of howard university was often asked stereotypically if hed played college sportsfootball was the first guess because of the broad shoulders and thick neck the cantilevered brow and jutting jaw but in fact his interest in college had been theater arts and to this day he was larsons best guy to send into a dicey situation that required the elements of undercover work like larson hed come to the service through public law enforcementbaltimore pdwhere hed found the thinly concealed corruption impossible to sidestep finally turning in his shield and keeping his mouth shut through this service he learned more than hed wanted to know about the federal witness protection plan eventually applying there for his next job like stubblefield hampton had been with larson for nearly seven years first on a witness protection team and more recently fatf hampton spoke with a tight voice scrotum thinks both palo alto and duke are worth a followup he says you can have wash u since youve been on the road all three have supercomputers capable of decrypting laena and markowitz either contacted or visited all three right before his disappearance larson couldnt put into words the way he felt seeing the cut and naked body of the woman hopes age in minneapolis had poisoned him more than he knew hampton picked up on the silence so you really think its him razor face the guy who did benny even doing eighty larson wished hampton would drive faster he lived in a perpetual state of feeling one step behind hed been here before any fugitive pursuit felt much this same wayplaying catchup living with the concern a crime would go down before you collared the guy but this was different and hampton knew that now given larsons silence actually i got the goahead to look for hope stevens prior to checking out wash u hampton seemed to buy it or at least wasnt going to argue and wheres that leave me and stubby on the road for the next few days interviewing geeks and getting hardons over coeds hampton said you wont mind if we wait to file our reports upon our return but if you find anything larson said thats a different story any possible connection to markowitz living or dead i need to know about it asap got it hampton accepted that there was nothing more to be said at baines jewish larson negotiated his way through the disorganized parade of orderlies and nurses doctors and housecleaners maintenance men and visitors following signs to administration he felt his chances of finding hope alive dwindling especially if by now witsec had sent out its national alert protected witnesses would have gone into hiding would hope the notion that the cutter had a head start on him that one or both of the dead women in minneapolis had known something about hope tortured him with a tenacre footprint and housed under a dozen roofs baines jewish was more a small city than a large hospital consequently it took larson over twenty minutes to reach the information desk capable of helping him larson displayed his credentials while linecutting im looking for a woman who works here he described the former hope stevens as a little taller than average eyesgrayish green thin face a bit of a pointed chin nice build long legs unique laugh like happy coughing reconsidering he added could be any hair color really maybe the chin is rounder or he saw the womans eyes glaze over a place like baines there had to be thousands of employees a little more desperately he said it probably computers for sure insurance i dont know he realized how ridiculous this all sounded im not sure where to start the receptionist polite and demure wore a telephone headset over a french braid that vaguely resembled a topknot do you have a name sir try alice dunbar larson suggested the woman attempted typing no one admitted under that name sorry she looked past him at the two women behind him not admitted she works here he said this is urgent government business please employees anyone named alice her eyes dulling she said weve got over twentytwo hundred people who work here on any one shift five six thousand total youre describing a white girl right like the color of her eyes and her having nice legs means something to me if youve got a last name ill put it into the system otherwise youve got to step out of line a last name she might be in the er he said thinking back to st lukes try alice stevens or alice stevenson actually try both alice and hope and try hope as the last name as well the woman stared across at larson whats with all that larson returned his credentials to the countertop please he said the receptionist lost some of her earlier confidence the gold federal shield had that effect on some people she looked warily between larson and the two waiting women she started typing her eyes widened and narrowed with her efforts she needed reading glasses but was too vain to wear them she glanced up sharply drawing larson in then shook her head and mumbled and typed some more recognition registered in her eyes and then more brightly roamed from the screen to larson and back to the screen shes in there larson said under which name the womans attitude had changed with her success larson could feel her wondering if she should involve others in this process not wanting any such delay larson reached across with his long arms and spun the computer monitor to face him knocking over a gray plastic magnetic paper clip container in the process the woman protested but it was too late alice stevenson an acronym alongside the entry aedea the space for a home phone number had been left blank the mailing address a post office box not a street no way to trace her to a residence it was her theyd taught her all of this a wave of guilty pleasure swept over him she lived in st louis five years of wondering boiled down to this maybe the laugh at the back of the theater had been her after all why he wondered had she been watching him yanking back the monitor to face its original position the receptionist asked him you want me to call her extension did he he felt stunned he answered automatically no thank you is she here on site working here today she tried the phone next angling her index finger to press the phones number keys without dislodging a nail she pressed the headsets earpiece to her ear larson reached across the counter and punched a different co button on the phone disconnecting the call hey she slapped the back of his hand she cant know he told her what department whats she done its not like that the woman fixed a doubtful disbelieving look onto him after a short staring contest she decoded the acronym for him assistant executive director emergency administration ill check into it myself larson said then privately you are not to alert her not to tell anyone you do and youll be interfering with a federal investigation he waited for her practiced eyes to register his warning but saw nothing her face expressionless she called out past larson as if he werent there next chapter twelve paolo didnt trust hospitals like the bates motel people checked in but not out nor did he like going after a kid but both directives had come from philippe and if there was one thing a soldier learned to do early it was to follow orders fortunately looking latino remained an advantage no one would take any notice of him he intended to exploit this invisibility paolo knew that no day care worker in her right mind was going to turn over information about a child under her care not to a hispanic man not to a civilian for this reason as he had before paolo donned his police uniform it was black not blue or khaki the word swat written over the pocket and a swat insignia sewn onto the left sleeve the trained eye might immediately note the lack of a city or jurisdiction within the badge or insignia might identify this costume as a costume might question the forged id badge that hung open from the left breast pocket slightly smearedpink as if blood had been cleaned from it his own personal touch for which he felt especially proudmaking it difficult to read but who knew what a swat uniform was supposed to look like civilians encountered cops often enough to develop expected patterns of dressbut special forces units also working in his favor was that swat held a certain respect panache even that impressed people it made up for any questionsvoiced or otherwiseabout his ethnicity he entered baines jewish hospital from the delivery side and asked directions only once then of a young woman who appeared to be in a hurry after ten minutes of wandering corridors and moving between connecting structuresthis place was more complicated than the pyramidshe finally reached a door marked employees only administrators had elected not to advertise the whereabouts of their employees children he found the door lockedan unexpected nuisanceand knocked twice with authority there would be cameras here there might be an armed response if his uniform were spotted by some alert security guard officer rodriguez he announced himself in a hush to the anorexic who opened the door and received him she could have been thirty might have been fifty her teeth pushed apart thin lips i need to speak to penny he said while digging into his left pants pocket stevenson the woman supplied teachers were always so eager to know everything so eager to please regarding police business he replied we have a a tricky situation in progress im going to need to contact the mother april no alice he corrected himself ill leave penny in your care but ask you to keep a close eye on her once ive spoken to her pennys not with us today paolo craned to get a better look past her he hadnt been asked in a group of fifteen kids sat crosslegged on the floor facing an adult woman who held a book in her lap where is she i wouldnt know absent today her mothers scheduled so we called but there was no answer ill need her address and home phone number the police dont have a home phone number and address lines of incredulity damaged an already difficult face her eyes fell to his uniform and he knew hed lost her he jammed a straight arm the flat of his palm against the flatness of her chest and drove her backward and off her feet she fell onto her coccyx and cried out sharply he was inside with his foot he drove the door shut behind him cell phones on the floor he announced carefully brandishing a plastic weapon in order to disguise its lack of authenticity to his satisfaction the other two caregivers the one reading and another neatening up a play area behind her went slackjawed the one neatening up was of a sturdy breeder build a darkhaired wonder well endowed in both hips and chest he took a special interest in her immediately with the instruction repeated the reader tried to speak as the breeder rose and crossed silently to her purse the breeder set her phone down onto the carpet not taking chances paolo holstered the fake pistol he backed up seized the thin one off the floor and held her in a choke hold she was frail enough that he could kill her by merely tightening his grip anyone moves he warned now flashing his razor blade in the grip of index finger and thumb including any of the little ones and theres trouble for all of us he made eye contact with each of the two caregivers now on their feet are we clear the women nodded they eyed their captive colleague and instinctively moved to corral the children the one paolo held went limp having passed out from frightor perhaps hed choked her too tightly he allowed her to slump to the floor and released her he stepped over her approaching the two others both recoiled pennys mothers address now the kids stared at him wideeyed the breeder glanced toward the computer terminal on the gunmetal gray desk paolo grabbed the phone off the desk and tore it from the wall in case that had been her intention he signaled her over and she responded by standing and brushing herself off her colleague the reader reached out to stop her but the gesture went unfelt the sturdy woman walked calmly toward the computer terminal and sat down paolo moved around to view the screen from directly behind her he stood close enough that had he wanted he could have cut her open ear to ear you do anything to i wont he watched as she called up various employee records he kept watch between keystrokes first to the wall clock then to the woman seated with the kids then to the one still unconscious on the floor he hoped he hadnt killed the skinny one she toggled through several records a digital photo embedded in each a minute or two had passed murphys law told him everything about this would quickly fuck up and hed be caught if he didnt hurry by purposely identifying penny and her mother hed shown his cards revealed his target in the time it now took him to reach hope stevens aka alice stevenson shed be warned off and hed miss her again that was unthinkable not an option he had to think of a way around that then he spotted the breeders handbag sitting atop the desk where shed searched it for the phone and he had his solution quickly terrified she typed faster when he heard her fingers pause paolo viewed the record on the screen penny stevenson parentguardian alice stevenson address a po box her street address paolo said see for yourself the woman answered there isnt one listed with a trembling finger she pointed out the appropriate line on the screen i need the street address he repeated now he reached out snatched up her purse and then turning the two other purses both from cubbyholes the tall skinny woman came alive sitting up from where she lay on the floor she tugged at the hem of her dress selfconsciously it had ridden up her pale thighs revealing a pair of white stretch stockings that stopped at her knees as if a part of this conversation she told him i drove them home once to her colleague at the computer she said that blizzard last year the buses she caught herself its a loft in jefferson square youll come with me he said oh god no he removed the billfolds from all three purses the thin woman looked dazed hed have preferred the breeder for entertainment value but hed take the one he was given i now have all your home addresses he explained displaying their billfolds i have your drivers licenses pictures of your children no doubt im an elephant all three women reacted with puzzled expressions children paolo called out to the kids on the floor what do we know about an elephant a boy raised his hand energetically and called out he packs his own trunk some of the other kids laughed paolo cued the kids do elephants forget no a handful of kids erupted addressing the women he said and neither will i if anyone tries to interfere he tossed a box of tissues across to the thin woman now kneeling it landed at her feet he asked which purse was hers and retrieved a set of car keys youre driving moving toward the door now no one comes in or out you dont make or take calls if it comes up your friend went home early one of the kids pulled the telephone off the wall he held up the two billfolds you continue on and finish the day as planned you go home for all you know ill be watching you do not call each other do not tell anyone anything husbands family no one if the kids talk you handle it tomorrow morning you can do as you please he glanced back at the breeder one last time knowing the pleasure she represented he called out to the room start singing as he headed down the hall the skinny one at his side he heard their small voices like toy bells offkey but lovely in their clarity chapter thirteen as you can see the matronly er nurse explained to larson were a little bit busy right now officer it was deputy marshal not officer and larson considered setting the record straight in order to take control the nurse wore a set of extralarge scrubs that nonetheless stretched to contain a continental shelf of breast and a hula hoopsized waist she wore a st christopher cross around her neck a mouthbreather she exposed a thin slice of white teeth like a sleeping cat she glanced up locked her flinty eyes onto larson do i know you the question was not uncommon people said he had a little bit of harrison ford in him a little bit of moviestar quality that seemed familiar at first glance hed looked for it but sadly had never seen it but this woman didnt mean it as a comeon but a qualifier she was simply being stubborn i need a street address for alice stevenson the woman complained you know how hard it is shorthanded he saw her name on her badge pinned above the shelf ms rathmore i need your undivided attention here he awaited those annoyed eyes of hers then lowered his voice im conducting a federal investigation im not going to throw around words like bioterrorism and national securityhe immediately won her full attentionbecause youre not authorized to receive such information but lets just say a little bit of help would go a long way and youre not going to want to look back on this opportunity and have to tell your friends you were the broken link you were what took more time than necessary you were the one who cost lives we dont have an address in the system she told him but i can tell you this alice doesnt make friends easily shes a little off you know i mean who makes the kind of money she makes and still rides the bus and with her looks i mean the docs hit on her all the time and she turns a blind eye to every one of them so the talk is you know that she likes other women and that stuff not that theres anything wrong with that but theres not a lot of them around here im not saying i feel one way or the other about that you understand but she does have a little daughter penny thick as thieves those two nurse rathmores mouth kept moving the words kept coming but larson no longer heard the request hope had made for a second protected identity had been for a daughter not for a husband or lover he filled in the blanks almost automatically he considered the timing my god maybe hope had jumped the program because of her daughter our daughter larson rushed his words a fluttering inside him like something had broken loose the daughter penny did you mention a father a nanny who takes care of her during work hours rathmore nodded tilted her big head daycares over in the basement of the childrens hospital not so easy to find youll have to ask when she looked up she saw only larsons back the automatic doors already closing chapter fourteen paolo explained the rules to the pale trembling woman behind the wheel hed removed and pocketed all the cash credit cards and the three drivers licenses from the womens wallets the rest of the contents spilled out onto the floor mat at his feet shed gotten the message loud and clear she slowed the car suddenly this is where i dropped her off pull over the womans glassy eyes and twitching fingers did nothing to convince him shed heard him nonetheless the car pulled to the curb and stopped he said the easy out is to kill you and put you in the trunk and steal your car she tensed and went yet another degree of pale but youre a teacher and i like kids im ready to let you go if this is the right place is it she nodded okay then drive home and lock your door and turn off your phone and dont talk to anyone you wake up tomorrow morning and you go to work and you deal with this shit then you think you can hide from me she shook her head vigorously your alice stevensons been hiding for six years and look where shes at keep that in mind she nodded her fists tight on the wheel at first paolo thought hed done a convincing job with her but then he took the cue and followed her line of sight to the sidewalk in the middle of the next block he glanced once more at the driver then again at a pretty little blond girl facing a doorway but staring straight up at the building looking lost the first smile in a long time curled across his lips as he thought god helps those who help themselves chapter fifteen each time the bus shuddered to a stop alice was stung by impatience convinced her daughter had fled to the one place that felt safe to her she was on her way to the hospitals daycare if shed seen any taxis on the street any other means to reach the hospital more quickly she would have bolted the bus in a heartbeat but cabs werent a common sight in st louis a city dominated by its suburbs she chastised herself for panicking over the alert on cnn for her lack of an explanation to penny who was old enough now to understand some of this she could have handled this so much better if shed turned this into a surprise trip to disney world theyd already be on their way riding some greyhound toward atlanta so why had she reacted like that a fit of worry but then again shed been trained to worry trained to be paranoid her daughter wanted nothing of it and who could blame her the romeros can and will find you if you make so much as a single mistake theyll be on your doorstep had lars told her that or one of the others there had been so many debriefings orientations meetings with psychologists she couldnt remember them all but the warning had been convincing then and she heeded it still caution was a way of life not a switch she threw when convenient shed overreacted to the alert she understood that now but knew this was part of her programming and her programming had kept them alive this far penny was the only one who had the number to the cell phone alice carried it was their leash their fallback she never phoned out on it never created a call history she might have used it now to call ahead but feared that if penny got even a hint of that call she might run off again in protest anything to delay their next move penny was far too smart a child far too intent on making her mother pay for their nomadic ways surprise remained alice s best chance chapter sixteen larson entered the hospitals daycare center only minutes behind a pair of uniformed security guards two women the childrens caregivers were trying to explain the events to one of the uniformed security guards while a nurse attempted to entertain the children and a second guard on his knees quietly interviewed three of the kids larson pulled rank and removed the two teachers from the room the more athletic and attractive of the two maintained her composure he said hed come back and kill us and our families she said calmly but wei actually she confessed eyeing her hysterical friend felt the threat to penny and her mom was more immediate so we called security larson sought a description from her wincing as he heard mention of the intruders police uniform for it stirred up his own memories of the bus attack years before if hed harbored any doubt any question that they were pursuing the same cutter this initial description sealed it for him as she went on to describe the man as mexican or hispanic lanky late twenties early thirties larson nodded he hadnt gotten a good look at the man in the bus but the general description combined with the razor and the use of a uniform was enough to further convince him he watched as his only verbal witness withdrew into herself he recognized the aftershock of a guilty conscience her secondguessing their cooperating with the man her reviewing the alternatives they might have had might have taken conscience is so quick to relive so unforgiving and hypercritical of its own decisionmaking larson knew this about himself and could see it in her now and knew better than to try to say anything comforting for such things only solidified ones convictions that the wrong choice had been made seeing this as a scene that could quickly absorb him larson excused himself the moment local police heard of a federal agents involvement larson would be delayed by questions he couldnt answer he turned and made for the door i know where she lives the caregiver called out after him alice larson stopped and returned to her sensing now the impending arrival of police and the need for quick information she spoke in a voice that sounded as if she were explaining this to herself i drove them both home once from what larson had learned her colleague had been dragged off because of this same knowledge debbie didnt need to tell him that the woman said shouldnt have told him i wasnt about to tell him larson took her gently by the shoulders human contact could have transforming results he said softly i need the address when she gazed up into his eyes larson added with your help we can stop him chapter seventeen hope stevens now alice stevenson broke into a run at baines jewish hospital overwhelmed by the flashing spectacle of police cars and emergency vehicles a pain gripped her chest but she continued running her eyes swept side to side her focus shifted near to deep alert for any special attention paid to her battling her maternal urges understanding the attention she would provoke by storming into the daycare center she forced her legs to slow and as she did so took deep breaths to settle herself to where she could talk clearly and calmly without betraying her terrors she felt exposed and vulnerable both government agents and the romeros could be looking for her a day agojust twentyfour hours earliershed been rebuilding planning comfortable in her life here now when it mattered most she not only couldnt find penny but shed driven her daughter to run away she reached the childrens hospital basement by a circuitous route known only to employees through a series of colorcoded hallways corridors and underground passages she passed through the central baines building heading north and finally into the subterranean infrastructure of childrens past laundry food services and maintenance she suppressed the urge to hurry holding herself back for the sake of appearances reaching a clot of uniforms and scrubs that blocked the entry to daycare she battled against her own guiltridden pessimism and did not ask what had happened instead she listened gleaning bits and pieces an intruder wanting an address no children hurt awash with relief she nonetheless coughed up a murmur of a mothers anguish that mixed awkwardly with despondency and a sense of reprieve from behind her a uniformed cop approached trapping her between the group and her only easy exit then a voice alice she turned to see phylliss astonished face peering around a door frame alice quickly reached the distraught woman passing shoulder to shoulder with the cop who barely looked at her penny we didnt see her today phyllis said a man an awful man alice she wasnt here didnt come here today no listen im so sorry phyllis broke into tears and not for the first time judging by the look of her alice welcomed this news of her daughter even though it meant penny remained missing this man a policeman or dressed like one we wouldnt have let him in wouldnt have opened the door phyllis met eyes with alice hers bloodshot and tearfilled as she said we told him where you live alice backed up and slowly walked away not wanting to bring attention to herself she thought her heart must have stopped completely for the pain in her chest but the pulsepounding whine in her ears kept her moving hey lady a deep male voice shouted from behind you lady she headed left then right then right again and then broke into a run she would never allow them to catch her in these corridors chapter eighteen penny the girl turned around immediately confirming her identity paolo stood tall enabling her to take in the police uniform im officer rodriguez the little girlshes a pretty little thingbacked away from the apartment houses buzzer board and into a corner im not allowed to talk to strangers she said ill scream if you come closer and well trained and well you should young lady he said if i was a stranger he took another step closer by the look of her she didnt have a way into the apartment building standing by the buzzer board as she had been it suggested mama wasnt home he decided to play that card but im not a stranger im a policeman assigned to find you and take you to your mother doesnt that sound like a good idea her head tilted curiously like a dogs shes at the hospital baines jewish penny seemed to accept this explanation concern worrying her small brow using the information gleaned from the wallets he exploited that concern ms gillespiefrom the daycare centerhas had a small accident your mother is anxious to get you over there and see her what happened the girls curiosity won out paolo extended his hand toward her again reminded of a wary street dog well take the bus he said did you know policemen ride the bus well go find your mom already planning ahead he realized he would soon need to rent or steal a carbut both options presented serious risks her eyes softened slightly though she remained cautious or he said if you want to stay hereif you promise to stay right herei could head back and tell her id found you and that you were okay but that you wouldnt come with me he turned his back on her knowing well what shed do wait she called out when hed taken but two steps thrust parry he heard the patter of her small feet dried the sweat from his hand on the uniforms shirt and extended it for her to hold chapter nineteen trill hampton affected the deadbeat toocooltogetexcited deputy marshal role whenever possible so when hampton interrupted larsons call in an animated voice larson immediately took note good timing hampton said we just got a tac alert from homeland that an air marshal may have ided a guy with a bow tie scar on his forearm someone actually reads the alerts we put out there if you can believe that if its our cutter he was seen on a morning flight nwa from minneapolis to st louis flying under the name rodriguez its why i called larson said it is him the guy who did benny id put money on it and my best guess is im only a few minutes behind him a half hour at most larson explained he weaved his explorer through traffic i was calling in for backup gimme your tentwenty hampton said its a jefferson square address larson recited the exact street and number me and stubby have made some progress on markowitz well catch you up were probably ten minutes behind you well stay on com for larson the air marshals spotting the tattoo connected the passenger to the romeros homeland security could now interface with the bureau and perhaps even interpol to track the suspects travel his true identity his route his finances everything that could be generated and gathered larson ran two red lights narrowly avoiding a collision as he raced through the second intersection a notsosubtle reminder for him not to lose focus by the time he reached the apartment complex off jefferson square he first heard and then spotted a squad car a block behind him and closing fast siren blazing larson pulled over and hurried out of the explorer the sirens grew steadily louder and more shrill with his third kick he dislodged the door from the jamb and he shouldered his way through the siren wound downtheyd reached the curb larson had not seen a listing for any stevenson or stevens on the buzzer board but had held a blank card and it won larsons attention he sprinted for the exit sign and the stairs he knew hed find behind it avoiding the slower elevator and hoping the cops might sucker into it he had his weapon out and at the ready by the time he nudged open the door to the secondfloor hallway the corridor was empty and quiet he worked his way past one apartmentand reversed directions he braced himself hope might be dead murdered only moments before or the cutter might be inside the apartment with her prepared to use her as a hostage the sirens having alerted him it might be empty it might be lit on fire he placed his ear to the cool door the guns grip warmed in his hand silence a trickle of sweat escaped down his face a syncopated jolting rhythm occupied the space below his rib cage into the mix he now added the sound of hurried footsteps as the cops followed up the stairs larson reeled back and drove his heel into the door with the second blow it tore open banging against the interior wall and rebounding put down the weapon a male voice screeched from behind him federal officer larson roared as he charged into he wasnt waiting around to share a moment with the two patrolmen larson hurried from one interior door to the next his weapon held in both hands at the ready a loft apartment with an open floor plan the wood planks creaked with his every step put the weapon down hands where i can see them shouted one of the cops from behind him in the doorway if larson failed to answer he knew the man would enter without further warning and might shoot him out of a bad case of nerves nonetheless larson headed down a narrow hallway now facing two closed doors to his left and two to his right bedrooms and closets he thought us marshal larson called back intentionally engaging them even though it would reveal his position to anyone else inside youre interfering with a federal fugitive apprehension stay where you are and guard the door not happening buddy im coming inside and if that gun is not on the floor its not larson called out as he moved down the dimly lit hallway he reached for the doorknob of the first door drop it very close behind him now the tension in the cops voice cut like a knife blade larson shot a glance back there far enough to see the toe of a polished shoe he shouldered his way through the door and swept his weapon corner to corner beads of sweat now trickling down from his temples and armpits a little girls room larson felt a pang of dread a jolt of connection stuffed animals a low bookshelf crammed with thin colorful books the cop was suddenly right there behind him larson could feel him he chose his words carefully listen officer we have one more room to clear the apartment isnt safe until we clear that room drop the weapon guard your backside dont get yourself killed out of stupidity a second cop now entered the apartment calling out now for his partner guard the door larson shouted the suspect is considered armed and dangerous he may have two hostages a woman and a child what the fuck is going on here the cop behind him asked larson squatted and gently placed his weapon on the floor these guys were too green and uptight for him to take any more chances larson ordered whatever you do clear that room behind you officer now he turned slowly to reveal his credential wallet hanging from his coat pocket fed er al off i cer larson repeated syllabically clear that fucking room and both closets before somebody throws shots the banter increased between the two cops the one guarding larson collected his weapon and required him to kneel with his hands behind his head his partner abandoned the front door and cleared the remaining room and closets a minute later weapons drawn the two carefully followed larson out into the hallway then he heard a womans voice a familiar voice you she was panting from having run the stairs he saw her first in a dreamlike blura rush of memories love lust and confusion overtaking him his only thought it cant be but it was she was right there not twenty feet away six years compressed into that singular moment as they met eyes and he froze wheres my daughter chapter twenty larson and alice climbed into his parked explorer this was their first moment alone together after an hour of negotiations that had included scott rotem in washington dc the missouribased us attorney slpd and the regional office of witsec justice represented here by fatf had won custody she was larsons she displayed a reticence in closing the car door and he wondered if he should read anything into that after an awkward few seconds of silence they turned to face each other he saw a mothers anguish on her face and realized this was neither the place nor the time to express what he was feelingjoy exhilaration a sense of completionbut as usual his mouth betrayed him its incredibly good to see you again the shock that registered on her face told him hed gone too far but then her expression warmed however briefly well find her he said you dont know that i dont mean this he said sweeping his hand to include everything outside the windshieldthe lights the uniforms the huddled discussions i mean you and i well find her she fought back tears and won i appreciate the sentiment lars i really do but we both know that when debbie dropped him off she might have managed to get the sentence out but she couldnt complete the thought couldnt allow herself the image of penny at the door unable to get inside shed held up unbelievably well over the past hourperhaps her months with witsec had conditioned her at some point she would need to release what she now bravely contained but not now she was either numb or far stronger than hed imagined she said id hoped for a happier reunion that would be all she would offer him for now and they both knew it it was enough yeah the explorer had a view across a corner of the park to the entrance to her apartment building a dozen uniformed police and two detectives continued to comb the neighborhood conducting interviews in an attempt to locate penny the one report they had confusing as it was to some put a young girl matching pennys description with a policeman boarding a city bus the eyewitness put the policemans uniform as blue but larson was betting black he and the others knew who was wearing this uniform since the same disguise had been used at the hospital rodriguez nonetheless the local police were conducting a full canvass of the area both because it was dictated by procedure and because when it came to a childs abduction all bets were hedged in profile her nose turned slightly upward her lips looked a little less full than the lips he remembered kissing larson adored the perfect pear shape of her ears and was reminded of the dead woman in minneapolis there was so much more to tell her both personally and professionally but first was the question of pennys whereabouts larson believed pennys abductor might call hopes cell phone as penny was believed to have the number memorized the call wouldnt be for ransom though all the romeros wanted was this woman dead for the moment larson was authorized to oversee hopes protection he couldnt think of her as alice while his fatf team continued to pursue markowitz and laena when and if witsec stabilized hope would be turned over to justice for more permanent protection he said we cant take you to our offices because theyre too public and could be being watched all i care about is getting penny she said looking out the windshield now searching thats all i want too he said he decided to trust her with the truth we think we may have a mole either in witsec or fatf weve lost something valuable to us thats why the alert went out while we figure out how to get penny back im taking you into a safe house to ride this out ride what out finding penny or the return of whatever was taken from you both he said speaking only for himself rotem and others would see penny as an unfortunate her life would not measure well against the lives of thousands of other witnesses and dependents while trying to ensure her safety ultimately they would use her lose her if necessary larson could not go along with that but neither could he tell hope this now after a few painful moments of silence during which the only sounds were her occasional sniffing back a runny nose larson said we should go we cant leave shell come back home your apartment building will be watched twentyfourseven im in constant contact im not leaving they want you hope he didnt bother to correct himselfhe wasnt going to get used to her as alice we are leaving were going to get you to safety every effort is being made to locate penny theres nothing to be gained by staying here and putting you so out in the open and if i get out of this car she asked her hand on the car door im allowed to do that right witsec any kind of government protection is voluntary right she remembered her orientation materials well technically but we can hold you as a material witness to a crime those crimes happened over six years ago theres no statute of limitations on federal capital murder cases youre in this now ill get an attorney she said still resisting and itll get ugly he shot back and all that energy time will be diverted away from where we need it most finding penny again she looked at larson directly do something larson turned the ignition chapter twentyone larson drove his explorer down a perfectly straight farm road less than forty minutes west of st louis the mcmansion suburban developments finally stopped sprawling and the flat expanse of generational farms took over the small white houses and silos surrounded by brown tilled ground rail fence and pasture the almost geometrical landscape looked familiar to both passengers six years earlier larson had sequestered protected witness hope stevens in the same marshals service safe housethe orchard housethat now was his destination the closer they drew to the final turn across a wooden bridge and up the hill the more those memories weighed on him it was at the farmhouse where theyd first found each otherand had last seen each other for six years hed avoided reliving such moments no great fan of nostalgia and unwilling to be one of those people who lived constantly with one foot in the past but now with her finally in the seat beside him something allowed him to revisit another time in this same place and he gave in to it willingly larson had run the protection squad back then and the rotation of assignments had conveniently left him inside the farmhouse with her while stubblefield and hampton had perimeter patrol he later wondered whether hed been set up whether hamp and stubby had felt the chemistry between them and arranged this one night for them but he wasnt thinking such things at the time he was thanking his stars the twostory hundredyearold farmhouse had not been restored since the thirties and remained in a state of neglect it sagged with wandering cracks like lightning bolts in the greenpainted plaster walls and white ceilings gaping chips drawn by gravity out of the dining rooms elaborate ceiling molding swollen black fingers of cigarette and cigar burns at the edges of much of the furniture especially the dining room table where witnesses and their deputies had whiled away the hours with games of poker and scotch the house had been shown little respect since its incorporation into the marshals service the exterior once a fashionable gray was now peeling paint curling away from the western sun and sloughing off like reptilian scales what had once been a proper and formal staircase led up to a narrow secondfloor hallway off of which were two small bedrooms and a narrow bath wedged between them probably originally a linen closet or nursery another smaller corridor added hastily years before and without the care given the original construction led over a study below and into two oddly shaped bedrooms connected one to the other through an illfitted communicating door a foulsmelling twisting set of back stairs led from the added bedrooms down to the small kitchen below because of these additions the house had a wandering cutup and unpredictable feel to it seeming larger than it actually was shed called him upstairs lars and he knew before arriving that despite other nights of comforting of intimacy that this was their moment of consummation he knew what she had in mind not from anything said but by the pentup energy that had been forced to simmer between them while in the company of others he couldnt identify the moment between them that accounted for the way he felt nor had she directly communicated to him her own emotions or desires and yet he knew he knew this was wrong against all regulations and he knew this was going to happen knew they wouldnt have long all windows in the house had been retrofitted with removable blackout cloth that velcroed into place the two exterior doors had blackout blankets that tied to the side by day but hung as light barriers by night the fixtures in the house and all lamps burned compact fluorescents the governments idea of how to save on energy costs the resulting light slightly blue or oddly yellow on the eyes never looking quite right her bedroom had one jaundiced bedside lamp aglow the house closed and shuttered as it was and without airconditioning of any kind sweltered in the latesummer heat with only ineffective and noisy floor fans left to stir the turgid air one such beast was at work in the corner grinding and clapping as its paddles scraped the wire protection meant to defend fingers from accidents it forced a mechanical rhythm into the room clippityclippityclapping and then whining asthmatically before starting the pattern again hope stood just in front of the lamp casting herself in a dark shadow shed shed the paleviolet blouse one of two such shirts she alternated day to day revealing the lowcut sleeveless saffron tank top that held to her loosely her egrets neck and strong arms glistening in the bedrooms heat close the door she commanded the idea of locking the air in the room went against all logic it had to be for privacy he pushed the door shut with a click does it lock larsons heart responded in his chest i dont think so will they come in the house not until shift change what if they need to use the facilities shed clearly deliberated on the obstacles that faced them larsons heart continued to race no i seriously doubt it the fact was theyd piss into bushes if need be but he didnt want to get crude at such a moment furthermore both his men would keep well away from the farmhouse in an effort to not place motion near it not bring any attention to it she unfastened her belt unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans leaving them hanging on the width of her sumptuous hips her purple underwear showing i want to take a bath she said warm not hot to cool off if thats possible standing just inside the shut door larson walked toward her ive slept in my clothes the past several nights we all have havent we im sick of sponge baths he took another step closer im not sure i know where youre going with this oh i think you do she said as she dragged the jeans lower tugged them over her hips and down her legs she leaned over to step out of them and her tank top fell away offering a flash of round pale skin and the white from her bra she added am i the only one whos been thinking about this no another step closer theres something about taking my clothes off undressing its a moment of extreme vulnerability im glad youre here hope i if youre ever asked about this questioned i know you lars youd never lie about it i know you could lose your job and i know how much it means to you how good you are at it all those things so you see theres only one way this can happen between us i mean im usually not the forward type she said pulling off her top and standing now in bra and underwear not at all she reached behind her back and deftly unclipped the bra this doesnt come easy for me as the back strap came loose it slipped half off her breasts the shoulder straps sliding lower on her arms but it has to be that i seduced you it has to be all me all my doing that i came up with some lame excuse about being afraid to undress in the room aloneit was all i could come up with on short notice she said that i came on to you in a moment of weakness its supposed to be me protecting you he said hoarsely his throat gone dry not the other way around well look after each other then she said she allowed the bra to fall her breasts rode high on her chest her nipples and areolas far darker than her complexion suggested she climbed out of the bikini briefs and he could feel her embarrassed determination to continue she wore only a thin silver necklace nowsomething he hadnt yet told her would have to go before enrollment in the program she stepped forward and melted into him her arms between them her hands already working on his shirt buttons he reached around to embrace her and she chided no no no looking up at him she suppressed a grin as she explained i want it to be entirely my doing lars she mocked a response to her being interrogated about this he stood there stoically he was in the room as i undressed i asked him to be i cant explain that but i couldnt take off my clothes without someone there and deputy larson was the one guarding me that night and well she continued working his shirt open she moved on to his belt and khakis i suppose i felt vulnerable or in need of company safety security but i found myself not heading for the bath as id suggested but instead one thing led to another and i found myself flirting with him in her regular voice she said flirtings far too soft a word not the right word at all ill have to come up with something better hope you be quiet deputy we need the record clean we need our story straight with that she had his pants open and him firmly in hand she brought his fingers up to her chest and whispered this once the first time between us it has to be all me her nipple firmed and grew puckered under his touch she undressed him saying youre going to lie down on the bed and do your best to resist me again larson reached to embrace her having had enough of the game but she held him off saying please and he understood from her tone that she was serious perhaps she couldnt confront true lovemaking perhaps it was too soon for her perhaps this was more born of a primal urge to dominate after daysweeksof having her every movement controlled and coordinated by others and all of them men always men my turn she said confirming his thoughts she lay him back on the bed and climbed atop him dragging her warm spot against him drawing something abstract with her soft paintbrush she climbed over him and lowered a breast and nipple to his lips and as he kissed her there as his tongue raced circles she reached back and touched him and he shuddered head to toe she alternated breasts to his lips as her fingers explored him she pulled her breast free of him and raised up on extended arms and locked elbows hovering over him on raised toes like doing a pushup and slowly lowered herself to where it was the heat from her skin he felt first then her breasts lit up his skin and she slowly eased her full weight down onto him melting down into him to where arm matched arm belly matched belly and thigh matched thigh then she rocked her hips opened her legs and reached down there taking hold sliding lower along his chest and with this motion joined them with barely any effort she lay there quietly larson fully inside her now not a motion between them beside the drumming of their pulses their conflicting heartbeats she held him like a clenched fist he tried to initiate a rhythm and she pinned down his hips and said hotly into his ear youre all mine and he was he grew delirious in the heat of the room he lost track of time but never of her they melded into this single humming entity a lone moth worked along the ceiling dancing with its shadow they must have lain absolutely still for ten minutes or moreit was like nothing hed ever experienced at the first sense of him losing his erection she moved one full glorious stroke lifting herself up to sitting and driving him back into her filling her completing her before stretching out prone and lowering herself incrementally again in that same dizzying fashion as before now she lay fully atop their bodies meeting together again both of them murmuring ive wanted this for so long she whispered into his ear i didnt want to waste it she sat up then pulled his hands to her breasts and began her musical rising and falling look at me he said and she did and it felt like days later before her eyes rolled back into her head and the world exploded through him and into her in a perfectly timed choreography of contractions and sharp cries of satisfaction he awoke to the sound through the wall of her bath running and might have believed it all a dream had not that paddle fan been grinding its way through the chorus of that same grating song rolling swales of bleached and dying field grass gave way to slate ponds stitched together by meandering streams the color of old steel a pair of mallards rose and crossed the road their wings beating so fast they seemed to fly without them veering away from the explorer and up into a guncotton sky hope sat stonefaced in the passenger seat a knot of concern worn on her brow like a birthmark how do we know that will work because weve done it before larson answered but it hasnt rung it will hed callforwarded her cell phone to his secure blackberry and had then shut her cell phone off to prevent any chance of her phone being triangulated a sophisticated method of radio telemetry if penny had been kidnapped and if her captors called if an effort was made to negotiate larson believed it would only be to hold her on the line long enough to electronically track her location he dared not underestimate the reach of the romeros if they could corrupt the federal court systemand some said they already hadthen cell phones werent going to inhibit them this drive is bringing back all sorts of stuff for me she said yup good stuff you sure absolutely whats her name hope asked out of the blue there is no her theres a friend linda it got heavy for a couple months a long time ago but its friends now and thats good he said you no she offered a mocking smile not even close shed overheard larsons call to linda suggesting she stay with her mother for a day or two the incident at the hospital and the kidnapping had rattled him it seemed unlikely the romeros would connect him to hope then his dog to linda but hed never forgive himself should anything happen to her because of him unsurprisingly linda had reacted calmly her primary concern that he make sure he was taking all necessary precautions for himself did you come to st louis looking for me larson asked why he couldnt bring himself to ask the real question about penny he wasnt sure the moment hed heard the childs age hed known so why the indirect questioning she almost smiled yeah i did had no clue thered be no way to find you once i got here youre not in information not in any phone books nothing on the internet youre worse than i was in protection she hesitated as if ashamed to admit it i even sat outside the federal building a couple different days looking for you hows that for sick not at all he thought a moment much ado about nothing was that your laugh i heard dont miss the turn she said indicating the left as if he would have are you sure theres no way they can detect that ive callforwarded my number why havent i heard from someone good job changing the subject he thought but at that very moment larsons blackberry chirped at his side to save them both rather than answer himself he pulled over sharply and caught a quick look at the caller id out of area calls from anyone inside the service came up private on caller id believing this could be intended for her he passed her his phone still ringing he switched off the car as she cradled the blackberry awkwardly and pressed it to her ear hello her eyes darted first to larson then out toward the landscape larson leaned across to listen in and for a moment their heads touched and he felt that same sense of burning he had felt all those years ago he withdrew quickly but now it was she who angled toward him and again he leaned to meet her you are missing a package the voice said a very pretty little package but the way the words were drawn out and strung together convinced larson that the call was nothing but a ruse to buy time to trace hopes location larsons blackberry was untraceable and though it housed a gps chip that chip had to be switched on manually you leave her out of this hope blurted out contrary to what she knew was required of her oh but its a little late for that now dont you think i wonder what social services would have said about you locking her out like that tracing calls worked both directions the romeros had to know that the full technological might and power of the marshals service would be summoned to locate this girl so why play so loose with time caller id was nearly instantaneous whether the caller believed the line blocked or not this caller had already stayed on much too long larson suspected that a reverse trace was under way the caller had been advised to keep hope engaged for as long as possible but by remaining on the line the caller was in fact leaving his own foot squarely in the bear trap larson drew a fast circle in the air indicating she should keep the caller talking what do you want she asked its not about what theywhat we the male voice immediately corrected want if you want to recover the missing package i suggest you keep your phone close by your side instructions to follow the line cleared larson found the callers slipup tellingfrom they to weand the choice of language intriguing it sounded as if the man had been reading from a script at the beginning and end but had improvised in between he took back the phone expecting to hear from the clayton office within minutes the call had lasted plenty long enough for them to trace even if some kind of switching device were involved sitting upright behind the wheel again larson turned the key hopes face was streaked with tears her arms now crossed so tightly he wondered if she could breathe dont he cautioned dont let them win they want this kind of reaction from you shut up she said ratcheting her head away from him gazing out at the patchquilt geometry of some farmers labors it helps them leave it she told the tilled fields after a moment she asked what now they think if you leave your phone on theyll find you and that will end it but we won this round well trace them maybe they know that maybe they dont so what now she repeated well get you settled in at the farm normally a couple of our guys would join me but rotem and i think thats too risky right now soon enough until then basically youre missing and im awol my boss has to plug a leak until then you and i remain on our own its best i have some stuff to work through once youre okay i am okay she said he had the car going again theres a psychology to thisto abductions im not expecting you to be able to detach of course not but their plan is to play with youto manipulate you into making a mistake and offering them a chance to kill you thats all they want they dont care about penny the way we do a slip he covered by talking more quickly now and nothing they say one way or the other about her is the truth what we knowwhat we absolutely knowis how important she is to them right now shes their passport to you thats all that matters all there is shes a means to an end and as long as we i the service keep them from getting you penny retains her value do you understand its important you understand this you dont do anything without me knowing it nothing i dont know how but theyre going to try to push you into somethingwe dont know what it is yetbut what i need you to keep in mind is that denying them is the key sounds like theres a lot you dont know not very reassuring as long as they dont have you pennys safe god how he hoped he was right and whatever you do that they ask will only ensure that both of you are killed the explorer complained as it climbed a long twisting hill revealing pumpkin patches and apple orchards and unexpected colors brought on by early frosts that had yet to reach the city the leaves were changing here a swirling mix of maturing oranges reds and browns paint by number pick yur own miles ahead the orchard house was just around the next bend her body stiffened once again telling larson that she recognized it too chapter twentytwo in the motel rooms dimly lit bathroom paolo dabbed a slippery antibiotic cream into the red raw selfinflicted wound on his abdomen addressing the infection in the mirror covered in the white flyspecks of someone elses flossing the chaotic scar tissue the randomly drawn bumps and lines that lay across his chest and midsection reminded him of dead worms on blacktop after a hard rain his eyes shifted focus in the speckled reflection behind him and to his left he encountered the bound ankles knees and shoulders of the little girl tucked into the bottom of the open booth that served as a closet she wore a pair of his dirty socks tied around her head the ends connected by a shoestring the bulging knot jammed into her mouth having phoned in the girls abductionhis successto philippe he now awaited instructions as to what came next he placed down the tube of cream the girl turned away from him as he doublechecked her gag and the duct tape on her wrists and ankles he repeated this ritual every five minutes kids could be tricky little things i dont like this either he said to her though he might have been talking to himself again i told you that the girl made no indication of hearing him it wasnt exactly my idea snatching you up like that now for the first time she turned her head her sad eyes bloodshot and irritated to a pitiful pink pleaded with him then he watched as she caught sight of the mosaic of his scars whimpering she turned away again paolo slipped on a black tshirt he tried again i can remove this stuff you know penny are you listening the tape the gag you understand you could watch cartoons whaddya think he stood and fumbled with the remote control you want to watch cartoons he cycled through the channels hitting mostly ads no cartoons he tossed the remote onto the bed pissed off at it come on he said to her do something nod if you want me to remove the gag she cowered into the corner of the closet a tight little ball of pale fear nothing id rather do than cut you loose you understand that he studied her all we need is an agreement and i can cut you loose no screaming no fightingand i remove the tape and gag okay he moved closer to her craned down to where he could smell her fear and said do you think youre helping anything her head pivoted slowly her nose was runny and he went over and got her a tissue and brought it back and held it at her nose so she could blow and she did not just once but a couple of times see he said i want you to be as comfortable as possible this is going to work out she nodded and tried to speak paolo grinned ear to ear his eyes brightened he reached out to pet her head but thought better of it by nodding youre promising me you wont do anything stupidwont shout or anything like that are we both clear on that penny nodded for a second time all right then yes good he was already loosening the gag real good the sock fell down around her neck penny said softly ive got to go potty a few minutes later hed untied her and helped her to stand her knees ankles shoulders and wrists ached she leaned on him for the first few steps trying to find her balance you can shut the door he said but dont lock it if i hear you lock it im going to have to bust it down and then our deal is over and ill have to tie you back up frightened she managed yet another nod okay go on and do your business penny entered the bathroom and closed the door behind her she dropped her pants and pulled down her panties and sat down to pee but her mind was on escape she was hearing her mom telling her all this stuff she never really bothered to listen to over and over the same boring stuff stuff about where to go if they were ever separated how to scream and run how to bite her mom had once showed her everything in the kitchen that could be used to hurt someone telling her over and over that she was only showing her this stuff in case it was absolutely necessary in case someone tried to rob them or something like that but the way shed said it the something like that was the important part this felt like one of those times something like that she looked around dental floss a toothbrush a tube of ointment she reached forward and grabbed the ointment because one of the things her mother had showed her had been all the stuff under the sink and how most of that stuff if squirted or sprayed into a mans eyes would blind him she squeezed a little dribble out onto her finger and held it close to her nose and smelled it it didnt smell like the kind of stuff that would hurt your eyes she put it back you done in there he asked through the door almost done a plastic basket that was supposed to look real held tiny bottles of shampoo conditioner and lotion next to that was a brown tray with two coffee mugs and a little dish with plasticwrapped coffee creamer and sugar in the corner a coffee maker her eyes returned to the coffee mugs she finished up and pulled her clothes back up but her eyes never left those two coffee mugs the image was vivid in her mind because shed been the one who had knocked the mug off the kitchen counter and broken it like the mug shed then broken into tears made all the worse when her mother had cut her finger picking up the pieces that bleeding finger was so present in her mind now because shed glimpsed the awful mans stomachall those scars and that one fresh cutand somehow the two things connected in her thought blood he knocked it spiked through her like a jolt i know i know she didnt need to try to sound annoyed with him she wrapped one of the coffee mugs in a towel several layers thick she could feel the man about to open the door as she wielded the towel up over her head with her right hand her left tripped the toilet flush wanting the noise just as the toilet crashed into a gurgle she flung the towel to the bathmat on the floor and felt the cup shatter opening it she selected a decentsized curved triangular shape handling it delicately remembering how effortlessly it had cut her mother she closed up the towel as the toilet finished its coughing and glugging wrapped it into a ball now what she looked for a place to hide it she spun around in a panic where she wondered she placed it into the garbage can too obvious okay open up only the thickness of the door separated them she pulled back the garbage cans white plastic bag liner and stuffed the towel and its contents beneath the bag that she now saw held the scabby remains of an orange peel and several pieces of crumpled tissue she returned the liner around the lip of the garbage can wrapped her chunk of pottery in a wad of toilet paper and slipped it into her front pocket then she changed her mind and put it into her sock behind her ankle where it fit well chapter twentythree my guys are outside larson explained hope sat at the aquablue linoleumtopped kitchen table her chair a piece of porch furniture she held her hands cupped around a mug of steaming tea that filled the room with lemon and ginger she stared down into that tea as if it held some answers two of them but that should be enough why are you telling me this im leaving for a while his comment lifted her head as if pulled by a string her thumbnail rubbed at the red glaze on the mug that advertised the home depot it made a thin scraping sound you still like gin rummy its been years she said deadpan and lifeless probably in this same house the last time i played well play a hand tonight and ill let you beat me you wish she returned to picking at the glaze a futile effort if there ever were one why where are you going our guys were able to trap and trace that call to you it came from a pay phone here her voice brightened in st louis dont get your hopes up but yes here the hill im going to follow it up guys like the romeros they never do something like this themselves itll be an intermediary if were able to connect it to anyone that is the realization that penny might be his daughter knotted his gut pushed him like nothing hed experienced not even his love of this woman measured up against that feeling a dead end not necessarily its a lead if we know its the romeros she asked why dont you just kick down a door theres a lot we dont know among which is a firm location for the romero operations were talking with the bureauthe fbitheir oc unit see what they have you dont know where they are incredulity we dontthe marshals service someone does either in justice or the bureau people like this are generally kept track of but not always gaining access to that information isnt easy its compartmentalized and protected for the sake of the informers and ucsundercover agents im sure rotems working on it but were not going to sit around and wait to be cut in guys like this when donny was convicted they know were coming after them next they know its only a matter of time and they go to ground they make it as difficult as they can for us to find them but theyve still got to maintain control over their various businesses and interests half of what these families do is legitimate the bad money finds its way to the good the romeros are still in business and because of that they leave a trail someone will know something thats what were working on thats why im gonna follow this phone lead shes five years old lars well find her by dinner how did he answer that tears had found her again floated at the bottom of her eyes she bunched her face and sniffled and he could see her trying to keep from spilling them he wanted to do something but the only thing he could think of was to get going with what he had planned follow leads beat the bushes stir the nest stubby and hamp were off pursuing similar leads trying to connect markowitz to the use of supercomputers and in turn to track him down and laena and the romeros along with him in the back of larsons mind was the nagging reminder that there were seven thousand others out there just like hope he knew a dozen witnesses personally their families indirectly when the last name on that master list was finally decrypted there would be more pennys more hopes than they could possibly save people were going to die some of them deserved it as far as larson was concerned hed personally protected dozens of guilty men killers and loan sharks and losers hed have rather shot in cold blood than pamper and defend but their families their kids and the whistleblowers like hope if the names on the list were sold off like pigs at auction there would be untold bloodshed and carnage i gotta go he said he handed her a siemens cell phone it was a new phone for her to use brushed silver with a green screen your number has been forwarded to this one now its also untraceable like mine is we programmed in my number speeddial one you and i can text message as well just so you know if they contact youthis phoneour guys will know about it too but call me the minute you hang up no matter what what are their names she asked larson was stumped the two guards she explained marland and carlyle are those their first names or last i dont know their first names do i lock the doors theyre all locked ive doublechecked them everythings blacked out you can turn on any lights you want youll deadbolt the kitchen door behind me and if they want in they wont larson thought she would have remembered all this i dont want to be alone she said as his hand found the cool doorknob please stay with his back to her he said i can send carlyle inside if you want send carlyle on the errand you stay please listen i want penny back too he said grateful she wanted him to stay right now theres no one i trust to follow up this lead no one im going to trust pennys life with but if you ask me once more to stay with you i will how could she still command this kind of response in him i hate this she said lock it behind me he reminded larsons head ached he couldnt remember the last time hed eaten this time of evening he thought about beer his mouth was dry and tacky a tourist visit to st louis wasnt complete without a trip to the arch ted drewes frozen custard and cunetto house of pasta soon after his transfer a few of larsons coworkers had led him on a somewhat drunken tour of all three he didnt like small spaces so he stayed on the ground instead of riding to the top of the arch but had found the underground museum and film on the construction of it enough to hold his interest frank cunetto the restaurants secondgeneration owner was considered a friend of law enforcement he typically offered cops and special agents and deputy marshals complimentary rounds of beverages he loitered and rubbed shoulders and no one knew if he was a spy for the mob or just a good guy who happened to like cops hed done larson plenty of favors cardinals tickets rams tickets even set him up with a busty italian woman who hadnt worked out he turned east onto southwest avenue stirring leaves under his tires driving past the postwarera row houses each so similarif not identicalto the next little houses larger lives the hill was all about who you knew and what family you came from larson was an outsider here roland frank cunetto lived inside a round face pale mediterranean skin an affable smile and a bald spot on his head that made him look older than his thirtyeight years he pulled larson by the arm and dragged him past the clot of restaurantgoers whod been waiting forty minutes for a meal lemme buy you a drink excitement was a perpetual state of existence for frank he wore a thin white dress shirt an undershirt showing beneath gray flannel trousers and an open matching vest he had a barrel chest and a dozen pounds he didnt need his face glistened beneath the dim lights of the smoky bar his uncles had started the place after opening a pharmacy how the two were connected larson wasnt sure but blackandwhites hung on the walls in a family pictorial the uncles looked like they went back to the fifties draft beer larson told the matronly waitress whom frank signaled bud he added paying loyalty to the citys home brew in front of frank when their drinks had been delivered larson asked to see the restaurants pay phone franks face screwed up into a knot of suspicion but he maintained his cool he talked as he led the way frank liked to talk whats this about anything i can help with you guys on a case or what i never figured out exactly what it is you guys the marshals im talking about do besides protecting the courts and witnesses and all that not that thats not something you understand but tell the truth roland you dont strike me as the type to stand around a courtroom all day the place was crowded linen tablecloths the waiters were mostly old guys in black pants and white shirts the waitresses dressed like they were from playboy fantasy camp with the white aprons fishnet stockings and high heels frank knew better than to mess with a winning formula he couldnt hear who was singing on the pipedin music but larson was guessing it was the other frank they passed through the main dining room and entered through a door and into a corridor where larson had never been off of this room were several private dining rooms waiters and waitresses came and went from these standing out of their way as frank and larson passed you happen to see anyone using your pay phone earlier this evening this was at to be exact they arent in any kind of trouble themselves he hastened to add he hoped lying convincingly but they may have information important to a case let me think on that roland i didnt want the restaurant getting any bad press over this he said as the aromas from a platter of something very garlicky caught his nostrils he was starving my boss has a way of playing things pretty heavyhanded who is your boss right now i probably know him it was this kind of prodding that left larson and others wondering about franks true colors hes outta dc you think i could get some takeout toasted ravioli or something i could eat in the car not a problem im paying sure you are cunetto had barely turned his head to look for a waiter before one appeared a guy in his sixties balding with wet lips and an expressive face that belonged on the side of a jar of spaghetti sauce frank ordered larson the toasted ravioli to go the waiter took off at a clip moving well for a guy so round larson finished his beer having drunk it too fast on the empty stomach he already felt a ticklish lightheadedness he craved another at the end of the hall frank pointed out the pay phone it was an old battered thing an exit door stood three feet away at the very end of the hall larson said hell i didnt even know these private rooms existed frank shook his head nervously wanting nothing to do with this frank knew which side his bread was buttered on larson lowered his voice youre a good guy frank we all know that about youlaw enforcement im talking about familys important to you the kids of this city are important to you that soccer program you helped get started its good work he paused to allow this to sink in this case im working frankit involves a child a little girl actually time is everything in these casesim sure you know that first twelve to twentyfour hours are critical im not making arrests no rough stuff but i need to deliver a message to give that girl any kind of fighting chance and i need to deliver it to whoever made that call ninety minutes ago your pay phone frank this one right here i dont know roland uneasy larson said you understand how this develops if my boss gets his way a crime scene unit your place shut down your guests interviewed names taken down detectives asking to see your credit card records for the evening you know how long it takes the federal government to let go of a bone i need a name frank cunetto looked dazed a kid a little girl thats what im saying larson said his gut turning over its awful to make a kid a bargaining tool a waitress pushed through the far door walked down the long hall and delivered larson a beer taking his empty she asked everything okay mr frank she eyed larson like she was ready to punch him out might have a good chance at it judging by her shoulders thanks maddie frank said tommy put in a takeout make sure its up as soon as possible maddie marched off thighs like a hurdler a body like hers didnt work in the short skirts cunettos mandated you dont want to get on the wrong side of this larson said thats all im saying frank i held off my boss because i told him youd help us out without a pile of warrants and a lot of flashing lights out front but ultimately thats gonna be your call larson swigged the beer jesus it tasted good he stifled a belch kathleen and bridget frank said my sisters twins sixyearolds he met eyes with larson his sad and tight with concern im not saying i actually saw him use the pay phone you understand who larsons skin prickled the way we do it he explained is i sell whoever this is on the idea that we tracked his cell phone that we placed him here in your place at the time the pay phone call was made most peoplethis kind of personknow we can do about anything when it comes to technology they dont question something like that theres no connection back to you other than his using your pay phone frank cocked his head to study larson they met eyes again larson remained unflinching knowing this was the moment dino salvo was in about the time youre talking about had a drink at the bar left for the can im not saying one way or the other but he never came back to finish that drink thing about dino he asked rhetorically he never leaves a scotch halffull larson swilled the rest of the beer on the way out he handed the sweating empty to the waiter who delivered the bag of takeout he reached for his wallet and frank cunetto said gimme a break roland its on me and id like to accept you know i would but im afraid i cant he passed him two tens will that cover it frank handed him back one of the bills well write you up a receipt nice and tidy and while youre at it larson said i could use a home address for our friend and a description of his ride dino salvo turned out to be a known man to the local cops one phone call to a detective friend and larson knew him as a lowgrade bagman an errand runner who was connected up in a business arrangement to a former gangbangerturnedrapartist elwood els or ll as he was called on the street ll was currently serving time for a nightclub shooting salvo was believed to be supervising lls hiphop club in east st louis he was a regular at a fridaynight lowrent poker game that the cops knew about larson stopped at a gas station convenience store and bought a disposable camera and a cup of black coffee salvo was registered as owning a black town car carrying vanity plates that read luvne he lived ten blocks from cunettos on the second floor of a walkup a driveby found the place dark so larson asked the detective for a bolo on salvo and the town car the cop called him back twenty minutes later after larson finished the takeout and was working on a second cup of coffee a patrol had spotted salvos ride outside guneross pizzeria a joint that larson knew because it served the best tapas in town the salsa music seemed in direct conflict with the aroma of bolognese sauce larson chatted up the hostess slipped her a twenty along with the disposable camera and gave her specific instructions he then worked his way through the cluster of overly tall cocktail tables and chairs toward the back the music changed to percussive moroccan he recognized salvo from the simple description supplied him by frank cunetto salvo wore his arrogance in the form of an overly starched oversized yellow collar poking out of a black leather jacket unzipped to below the table a thick gold chain showed through a forest of chest hair his watch had to weigh a couple of pounds he had the lazy eyes of some killers larson had interviewed and the broken nose of someone who liked to use his fists but something about him said more bark than bite dino also looked younger than hed hoped he wore his black hair slicked back with too much mousse it shined in the overhead lights one small plate contained rolled dolmas another some kind of dumpling and a third shish kebab the dipping bowls pool of black ink might have been responsible for the smell of cinnamon without invitation larson sat down across from salvo he placed his identification wallet down next to the mans wineglass and left it there long enough for salvo to read it he then slipped it back into his pocket making sure that in the process salvo would see he was packing you like dolmas salvo asked without so much as a flinch best dolmas in the city right here pass larson said dino dino remained impassive we both know you made a phone call from cunettos and we both know who it was to and that it came at the request of someone else like you someone not worth my time if you dont like tapas they do a pretty fair toasted ravioli as well there are jobs worth taking and there are jobs that arent worth taking and this one falls into the latter category you want to stay as far away from this one as possible and all your friends do too you were put up to this because youre expendable dino plain and simple what you want to do is play this smart and let the romeros do their own business dino wanted to think he was good at this but with mention of the romeros his eyes fluttered larson decided he hadnt known who was behind the job hed carried out just good money for placing a phone call they told you what to say larson said and chances are a man of limited intelligence such as yourself probably was dumb enough to write it down and that means you threw a scrap of paper away doesnt it dino you want to think about that are we going to find it in a car in a trash can at cunettos tossed out on the street between here and there its not still in your pocket is it cause that could be really embarrassing the mans blinking and the tongue working told larson hed struck a nerve the best thing you can do right now is get the word out that theres federal heat on jobs coming from out of town even these small ones like making a phone call big heat do yourself a favor and take the money you made on that call and take a long vacation anyone found cooperating with these people will be looking at accessory chargeschild kidnapping federal charges federal courts federal prison it took us less than ninety minutes to find you dino you need to do a lot better next time all this served a simple strategy if larson could force the romeros to negotiate directly with hope he had a chance of locating the child but it was highly unlikely his talking tough would have much effectthere were plenty of dinos waiting in line he lowered his voice leaned in across the table and stole a dolma he ate it as he talked the food blurring his words whoevers the first to provide information that connects to the romeros is going to win a free get out of jail pass as well as the daily number larson wasnt being facetious state lotteries had been used for years to pay off informants ten thousand here five thousand therea lowlevel winning ticket in hand for all to see so there were no questions asked about where the money came from you like the dolmas he repeated larsons blackberry rang he finished chewing swallowed and as he took the call he signaled the young hostess who carried his twenty he was told salvos cell phone had received a call two hours earlier from a pay phone in plano texas another evidentiary dead end no doubt but salvo didnt need to know that he hung up and faced salvo so now i hear that the call that was made to youthe one giving you this jobcame from plano texas this much was the truth the next part larson invented we picked up your boy about a half hour ago as the hostess arrived larson scooted his chair around right next to salvo who was midbite he threw his arm around the mans shoulders and then tossed his head back and said cheese she clicked off two flash shots before dino salvo had the good sense to break the embrace larson stood and took the camera before salvo was to his feet twenty dollars well spent how long will it take ll to identify me in that shot larson asked salvo how about the romeros how long to figure youre hanging with federal heat concern creased salvos brow larson knew hed hit a nerve the hostess moved off sensing the trouble shed caused several nearby patrons stopped eating and watched how much of a scene you want to make dino how deep do you want to wade into this ll has nothing to do with this then youll have no problem explaining to him a wave of new charges filed against him and the five thousand dollarsa cash depositthat moved through your bank account the day after this picture was taken what five grand dino salvo wasnt the fastest on the uptake loyalty was the only currency for guys like him no matter what excuses he might make for the photograph its very existence would plant seeds of doubt larson might not be able to pull off the money stunt but dino couldnt be sure of that salvo told the waitress to leave his food as he followed larson out of the restaurant for a moment larson believed the man stupid enough to start a fight but as it turned out hed only sought to distance himself from the ears inside amid thick humidity and the distant hum of traffic salvo lowered his voice and warned you dont want to fuck with me im already fucking with you dino gimme a break you get the word out and you get lost and ill stop fucking with you make another phone call for whoever paid you to make that phone call and youll regret it for twelve to twenty larson pointed at the mans yellow shirt you got a little spot there looks like sauce maybe he turned his back on the man and walked away but used a parked cars outside mirror to see salvo already scratching frantically at the stain chapter twentyfour this is not an official review scott rotem began he faced deputy marshal gilla geldwig an unusually attractive woman with dark brooding features and haunting green eyes her body a bit big and clunky by femme fatale standards was nonetheless full at the top and lean in the leg giving her an imbalanced look that would not have photographed well but worked fine when she was sitting down as she was now it was her face though her eyes that grabbed you so rotem tried his best not to look directly into her eyes not to cave in to the compelling pull he needed this interviewthis interrogationto be successful for the sake of markowitz laena and his own career five protected witnesses had been executed in the past twentyfour hours the bloodbath appeared to have started thousands of others were at stake he hated her for what she represented it was dark outside now traffic on pennsylvania avenue slowed to a crawl seen as two long streams of red and white lights from the onewindow conference room they shared the oval table rotem sitting across from geldwig and to his left assistant united states attorney tina wank who possessed a mannequins complexion and body type that complemented her somewhat nervous disposition do i need my representative present geldwig asked its certainly your right to make such a request you tell me do you need a rep present not if theres a deal to be made beforehand youve been carrying on an affair with assistant marshal bob mosley rotem said sue me she contained her body language well but could not prevent the scarlet blush that moved up from her fashionable suits shirt collar to its hiding place behind her ears mosley came clean earlier this morning and weve had the day to review your own activities assignments and your overall participation within the service youre a hard worker you moved around a lot within witsec now youre here youve moved through the ranks surprisingly quickly all legitimate promotions im sure tina the attorney took notes her pen working furiously so that it looked as if she were a stenographer whats your point ms geldwig this may have started out as some kind of game to you im not sure maybe it was for the money because god knows wed all like more in this job maybe it was the secrecy or the joy of feeling so damn important to someone or maybe theyand in this case im specifically talking about the romero syndicatehad collected some piece of information that they could use against you hold over you your sex life your vices your spending habits your family i mention these only because they are the most commonly seen in cases like this cases like what she fumbled in her clutch purse and came out with a delicate handkerchief that she used to dab at her nose more nervous habit than necessity bob mosley remembers everything he told you everything you asked for rotem the inconceivable thing in this case was that a guy like mosley would ever believe a woman such as this could fall for him in the first place hed now have twenty to thirty years to think about it and so would ms geldwig thanks to his testimony what you seem to be missing in this deputy marshal geldwig is that mosleys told us everything the longer you play the naïf the less time you have to get on the other side of this and help yourself finally wank joined the discussion youve been with fugitive apprehension for a little over three months ms geldwig perhaps you can explain what was behind your decision to transfer when she failed to answer rotem did it for her witsec might be considered the more prestigious more interesting employment and yet you transferred over to the fatf i wanted away from mosley besides i think youre wrong sir this is where the action is we know for a fact that mosley told you everything there is to know about leopold markowitz and what came to be known as laena rotem said do you know what laena means deputy geldwig where the term came from she cleared her throat its latin or greek for cloak as i recall rotem now forced himself to lock eyes with her and youve removed that cloak havent you he avoided mention of the recent executionsshed lawyer up given that information exposed several thousand lives to possible execution and all for what ms geldwig the seven hundred thousand dollars in commercial real estate the timeshare in paris we know about those ms geldwig and well find out more weve seized all your property all your assetsor rather ms wank has as of this moment you dont have two nickels to rub together are you sure you dont want to talk rico the attorney said we own you and youve run out of time to explain yourself a knock on the door was followed by an aide poking his head inside it had to be important rotem stood walked around the table and passed close to geldwig she smelled darkly sweet and earthy a perfume designed to engorge a man the effect lingered as rotem reached his aide who apologized for the interruption the aide a young man in his late twenties handed him a sheaf of papers her movement through the network sir what files she accessed i highlighted the few of interest rotem scanned down the list of computer network addresses all directories and files that geldwig had accessed in the past week the aide said we can go back further as time allows rotem flipped pages waiting for the yellow highlight on page four his thumb found the line and his eyes carried over what the hell what is this utilities for what shed been surfing the utility recordsthe billing records sirfor our various safe houses a change in utility consumption indicates activity at a particular safe house rotem jumped ahead to what this meant but restrained himself needing to confirm his suspicions before sounding the alarm and these particular billing records he asked are for the orchard house sir but i checked with witsec and they dont have anyone assigned to the orchard house at present the young man noticed rotems sudden pallor or do they rotem swallowed dryly get larson on the phone now right now you dont send him an email you dont leave him a message you get him on the phone i need to speak to him right now he glanced back at the closed door to the conference room thinking a gun to the head would serve the taxpayers far better where geldwig was concerned chapter twentyfive paolo drove past the farmhouse and kept right on going at first glance his guess was that the info theyd been given was bad from what hed seen of the house pushed back off the road and in a cluster of barren trees it was decrepit and hardly the kind of place the government would use as a safe house the feds leaned more toward motels and hotels military facilities and public housing not a neglected farmhouse isolated and out in the middle of nowhere defending such a place would require a minimum of two probably more like four to six which again struck him as far too rich for federal law enforcement he also couldnt be sure it would be the same mark as he was after but the assignment had been handed to him passed along to philippe by a supposedly reliable source and he had to stick with it how many witnesses in and around st louis could they be protecting on a given day he followed the map making a full circle of the area driving close to five miles before pulling around and back up the steep hill again and passing the same rock outcropping that looked this time like some sort of face part human part devil hed left penny behind in the motel her hands taped behind her back her ankles knees and thighs taped around her pants to keep her legs straight the gag in place hed left her on a towel in the bottom of the dry bathtub with the sink water running and the television in the other room left fairly loud with the removal of four screws hed reversed the bathroom doors knobs and lock so that it now locked from the outside even if the kid got freeimpossible he thought though he didnt put much past a childshe was imprisoned he slowed and studied the surrounding property held in the evening dusk as if sprinkled with fireplace ash he turned the car up a muddy rutcovered track stopped at a rusted metal gate climbed out and swung it open the air smelled different here the way really cold water from a bottle tasted more like melted snow than tap water once through the gate he backed up and parked tucking the car in alongside a hedgerow of overgrown weedy trees and shrubs from here the track rose into the spines of gnarly barren apple trees that cast a chill in the air forewarning winters approach the hill rose up to a rocky queens crown the swells of the orchard below rolling once up and then back down before slipping left toward a crumbling fence line in disrepair and just beyond leveling to nearly flat ground and the fading farmhouse now only a suggestion in the dwindling light paolo charted a course through the orchard to the house committing it to memory so that he could return to the car by one of two different routes he spotted one tree among all the trees that would serve well as his lookout the apple trees had been trimmed and cut back for many years keeping them full and at a height convenient to harvest he couldnt tell if they were alive or deadthey looked as inert as gravestonesbut theyd lost that look of being tended to he crept carefully through the separating rows the trees as regimented as soldiers starting and stopping alert for the slightest sound change of color shift of light or shape once into the tree he climbed to the small branches from where he could see the gray geometry of the farmhouse farther to his right and slightly down a hill a large milking shed with a metal roof bisected a freestacked stone wall jutting into a fallow field thick with grass the hint of an approaching moon warmed the horizon with a yellowish glow seen through the gray haze of ground fog just lifting out of the ground as if sucked by the retreating light paolo waited as was his way worked alone as he and the romeros preferred it if hed been trained in anything it was patience he could sit immobile for hours never bothered by stiff joints or the urge to do something ten minutes passed before he detected the red pulsing light in another season another color he might have mistaken it for a lightning bug but well into october the evening air chill its perfectly timed flashing meant electronics more than likely a cell phone or radio it was clipped at a height that made sense for a belt a waist a guard he warmed with anticipation the falling temperature meaning nothing to him the information had been good the dilapidated farmhouse might indeed be a safe house given that hed now spotted a patrol but police and federal agents were like termitesfor every one you saw there could be many more in the nest overcoming them one at a time presented the kind of challenge paolo lived for subterfuge stealth baiting razor workall his skills would be required here he gave no thought of calling for backup of waiting hours or days opportunity had presented itself and he intended to capitalize to prove himself the red flashing stopped either the guard had turned or the phone had been briefly exposed as hed gone for a stick of gum scratched an itch or donned a sweater or jacket against the cold a small mistake lasting no more than a few seconds but enough to signal the warning to paolo a godgiven blessing a few minutes later his eyes adjusted to where he was quite certain he saw the guard that belonged to the flashing red lighta large lump of black neatly attached to a tree trunk in the side yard then to his delight another such lump moved from his left to right and then left again it took several seconds for him to identify this pattern as circular this guard was slowly orbiting the farmhouse clockwise eight minutes later around he came again the original guard still not moving from his post in the side yard the repetition of this the combination of one moving object one stationary told him there were far fewer deputies than hed anticipated as few as two no more than three eight minutes later there he came again around the near side of the house they were lazy these two typical government agents theyd established a pattern well conceived but flawed in execution their undoing having just driven onto north larson received the call from rotem still twenty minutes or more from the farmhouse larson rocketed into the far left lane and brought his speed up in excess of eighty as he spoke into his blackberry rotem said theres something else you need to hear witsec is reporting five protected witnesses dead all executed laena markowitzs defection or abduction it seemed a world away from penny and hope but only for larson for rotem and most of the justice department the recovery of laena was now a matter of national security larson heard small sparkles of static on the line why only five you catch on fast rotem said now add this into the mix the bureaus oc unit is reporting increased chatter among the top west coast crime families a meeting has been called for this friday all the big guys undisclosed location larson put it together so the romeros sold off or gave up those five witnesses to prove they had the real thingthat they could deliver the master list and now they intend to auction it off this friday two days rotem confirmed two days to find markowitz two days to locate the romeros how long would they keep penny alive listen rotem said theres one other thing we dont know how much weight to give it if any its a compromised source whats going on scott larson didnt appreciate all the qualifiers this source appears to have accessed utility records for our safe housesincluding orchard house but and i want to emphasize this theres no indication that information went any farther jesus scott he disconnected the call larson had to warn carlyle and marland that orchard house may have been compromised he tried marland first but when marland failed to pick up he called hope hello its me everything all right he worked to keep his voice level and calm fine listen the house may be compromised i couldnt raise marland so im going to try carlyle next but i wanted to get to you first you want me to go find them no he said a little too loudly do not go outside not under any conditions not for any reason you keep the doors locked until i arrive hide somewhere inside hide youre scaring me lars just until i get there its serious hope okay dont hide anyplace obvious not under the bed or in the closet find a place you can be comfortable without moving around he told her to put the phone into vibrate mode and then doublechecked that shed done it correctly ill be there in minutes what arent you telling me i cant tell you what i dont know myself he said paolo went well out of his way to approach the far side of the house and lie in wait for the deputy on the circular patrol costing him valuable minutes he was warming to the kill now and so took little notice of the sustained hush delivered into the wilds by the further setting of the sun only the very distant barking of a dog almost a howl interrupted the nights still quiet aira yapyapyap that paused for a half minute before barking out into the void a male no doubt longing for company the ground fog lifted like bedsheets rolling and twisting and yet languishing at chest height paolos movement broke these plumes like a finger through cigarette smoke creating feathers of vapor that slowly dissipated and dissolved the farmhouse now within a stones throw continued to appear empty and uninhabited he couldnt help but wonder if this was all an elaborate trap to snare himleak the location set up a patrol lure him in so he again practiced his patience in no hurry to find himself in federal custody he allowed the circling deputy to pass to complete yet another full loop but decided against such foolishness he wasnt going to blow his chance by being overly cautious he bellycrawled gistyle into the overgrown perimeter shrubbery that surrounded the farmhouse and lay low razor at the ready when it came time he felt no great adrenaline rush to the contrary he found a quiet stillness within himself an immediacy that led him into a graceful movement a silent oneman ballet choreographed to deliver death a moment later it was over the deputy gaping soundlessly like a beached fish his body twitching and sparking through the throes of death as he bled out from the neck paolo considered taking the mans gun but recalling the barking dog decided against its use for fear of alarming a neighbor he did take the dead mans cell phone but disconnected the battery he would study it later for programmed phone numbers call lists and might even use it for a call or two now for the time being he assumed the role of the circling deputy picking up where the man had left off he came around the front of the old farmhouse ears alert for any sounds whatsoever inside he heard only the yapyapyap pause of the baying dog charged with exhilaration paolo headed straight for the tree behind which he hoped to find and kill the second agent only at the last moment did he realize hed chosen wrong as the agent stepped out from behind the tree to paolos right not where he expected him whats up this deputy asked in a whisper in the thick black of night both figures were silhouettes paolo said nothing having no idea what voice to mimic hey whats up the deputy tried again his voice clear and tight more strained than before perhaps sensing as some animals can his own demise even before taking precautions against it paolo took two last strides suddenly much longer strides than hed used in his approach so as to throw off the deputys timing one moment he was a smudge in the ground fog the next a blur of arms and limbs a slicing blade behind extraordinary leverage and strength the deputy managed two defensive blocks both of which cost him long gashes down the palms and wrists of both hands as he opened his mouth to scream paolos hand flashed before his face slicing his tongue and lower lip containing him in a choke hold paolo spun the man drove his right knee into the mans lower back bending him backward and in that moment of pas de deux drew a hot angry opening across the mans jowls and larynx issuing a sound like a steam pipe bursting behind a crimson spray that joined the fog and painted the tree bark scarlet he dropped the man like a bushel of apples not looking down to see if the job was complete he knew his work instead his back to the bark he opened his senses like a flower to the sun every sound every swaying branch and rattling leaf was a part of him he waited for the backup for the threatening glow of an infrared rifle sight tracking the tree and trying to find a kill spot on his body he anticipated surprise braced himself for the unexpected he kneeled glanced once at the dead man and pulled open his windbreaker he found the mans weapon chambered a round and shoved the gun into the small of his own back this for inside if needed the dog stopped barking as if somehow silenced by the scent of fresh blood on the windpaolo pissing on his territory the dog wisely unwilling to challenge well off in the distance he could make out the low insect hum of interstate traffic a jet rumbled fallen leaves tumbled and rolled and swirled at his feet offering faint applause paolo sensed there was no backup coming he would face one more inside the house and beyond him the prize at any second any minute the deputy inside would attempt his scheduled contact with those on perimeter duty never longer than ten or fifteenminute intervals paolo moved through angular shadows dodging across the lawn toward the farmhouse the dog started up again his nose revealing the truth only the dog far off in the distance stood witness to what had been done larson drove all but the last mile with the retrofitted light system in play his parking lights taillights and headlights alternating right to left and left to right in a dazzling display that identified him as an emergency vehicle from inside the cars front grill bright blue and white bursts of warning marked him as law enforcementnot fire or medical hed called for backupfederal not localnot knowing how traffic would affect his ride as it happened he reached orchard house first he pulled off the road a quarter mile short of the farm and set out on foot paolo ducked and crossed below the window intent on reaching the front porch as quickly as possible the ground floor would not only be highly secured but would be where the remaining agent would keep himself herself was more likely he thought since they were protecting a female witness this gave him more confidence the second story looked best even if it came down to breaking glass to gain entry the time it would take a deputy to respond would be in his favorhed be inside and at the ready before anyone could make it upstairs once onto the porch he climbed atop the railing and pulled himself up a column leprous white paint flakes peeling away and floating to the autumnal vegetation like moths that had ventured too close to the light he climbed with all the sound of a snake slipping up onto the porch roof and from there the steeper main roof to the first of several dormered windows all pitchblack he moved carefully and slowly one window to the next feeling vulnerable the construction was old ropeandweight doublehung windows a barrier had been hung just on the other side of the glasssome kind of blackout material he hoped this fabric might mute the sound of breaking glass when the windows proved impossible to jimmy open he drove his elbow just above the lock pieces of glass tumbled down caught by the blackout curtain the window opened his razor led the way through the rubbery vinyl covering and he squeezed through the slit into the interior the room was dark a simple bed made a corner sink from a hundred years ago a mirrored dresser no suitcase no clothes he crossed to the door soundlessly ears alert for the sound of a guard rushing up the stairs nothing for a momentonly a momenthe allowed himself to believe the woman was not here that this accounted for the informal patrolling of the perimeter that these two had not been protecting someone but defending a structure another possible explanation for this complete silence was so tantalizing that he barely allowed himself to consider it were there only the two guards not three had they adopted the format of one moving one stationary because of these minimal numbers was the witness here armed perhaps but all alone it seemed plausible the service could be in chaos how many deputies could they spare for a single witness when thousands of witnesses were at stake but this optimism got interrupted by a second thought the remaining deputy could be more clever than hed given him credit for perhaps he was not the type to charge upstairs and force an encounter what if heshe was lurking somewhere inside ready to spring a trap and gain the element of surprise added to his sudden uncertainty was the idea of timing payment for his killing the two deputies outside would come due with communication lost the service would respond either by helicopter car or both he might have five to ten minutes after that he couldnt be sure it was a big house he went to work through the whine in her ears that whistled like a teakettle hope thought she heard something larsons warning had tightened the screws at her temples fixing her jaw to where she ground her teeth her prickling skin feverish with fear shed worked so hard all these years to control such reactions but this time isolated in a strangely familiar place without penny for company she panicked outside close by on the roof a location shed thought of little else since his call in her various residences over the years shed always created clever hiding spots for herself and penny not panic rooms but a nook or cranny a false wall at the back of a closet cleared out shelf space in the kitchen cabinets but here in this place she considered the back bedrooms for they gave her a shot at the back stairs if she heard someone coming up the front she thought she might even engage in hideandseek by using both stairways and constantly keeping on the move but larson had told her to seek out a spot and stay put and as much as she resisted being told what to do she knew instinctively this made sense when she heard the muted but distinctive sound of glass breaking she moved without further thought the point was to find someplace out in the open yet hiddenhow many times had that been drummed into her not a closet or an attic she spotted it that same second her imagination fast at work given the breaking glass she grabbed the bolster in this first of the two back bedrooms the room having been converted into a television den she unzipped the zipper the full length of the long round pillow that sat atop the twin bed converting it into a makeshift couch inside was a tubeshaped filler that she quickly hauled out and wrestled into the rooms only closet pausing as she found herself faced with two buckets of cleaning supplies and on the shelves in typical government fashion another six cans of each cleaning product all neatly lined up like little soldiers deodorant toothbrushes aspirin tylenol tampax toothpaste hand cream a minipharmacy how many times had she schooled penny on using readily available household items as weapons the words on a greenandwhite can jumped out at her oven cleaner paolo opened the bedroom door a crack his back against the wall and away from the door in case someone threw shots blindly he sneaked it open to where he could get an eye out an empty hallway no guards razor in his left hand the borrowed gun now in his right he moved down the hall his back to the wall he paused he tried the next door a bathroom longer than it was wide empty of people but not of their presencea tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush both new on the sink another bedroom next door near the top of the stairs its bed made but ruffled someone had lain there the air smelled cleaner less dusty less trapped and paolo could picture hope stevens airing out the stale air ahead of the blackout curtains being hung he took a glimpse down the staircase with the hallway being empty if there were other guards they were downstairs was she down there with them or had he missed her somehow but the woman was most likely upstairs he retraced his steps hurrying down the hall past where hed come from only to discover an unexpected hallway that emptied quickly into a television room he stopped cold he smelled her the sharp tang of fresh sweat the pungency of woman close now he raised and lowered the gun as he stepped toward the rooms closet he yanked it open gun now aimed into the darkness found a string dangling and yanked it a bare bulb flashed on revealing two plastic buckets and some rags on the floor all kinds of personal items and cleaning supplies on the shelves a regular storehouse a long white pillow like a bolster paolo jerked his head to his right the bolster on the bed misshapen he followed along the zipper with his eye a small gap at the very end the zipper not quite closed there weapon in hand larson accidentally smeared the doorknob with marlands blood as he cracked open the farmhouses back door and slipped inside panic had invaded him and he couldnt shake it he left the bloodsmudged key in the lock to avoid making any more noise than necessary settle down he told himself but he found it impossible hed come across the body of only one of his fallen deputies it had been too dark to identify him though he believed it to be marland hed abandoned hope here left her again he moved cautiously and alertly through the kitchen clear he surveyed the living room clear as he passed through it and crossed the hall and continued into the small study the structures old floorboards creaked beneath him with every step no matter how fancy he got with his attempts at delicate footfalls the boards still complained some loudly he decided distraction wouldnt be such a bad thing he cleared the study now focusing on the staircase to the second floor climbing those stairs would leave him exposed and vulnerable his lower back pressed against the handrail his shoulder blades dragging on the peeling wallpaper larson started up the stairs they announced his every step with the first of the sounds the reluctant bending of unwilling wood paolo turned toward the improvised hallway and the secondfloor banister beyond someone was coming hope saw the intruder fix on her hed not so much as given the bolster a second look until hed seen the pillow that belonged in it at the bottom of the closet floor then he turned and looked right at herright at the tiny gap in the zipper through which she looked right into her eye he took a cautious step toward her then another to the edge of the bed as a sound in the hall distracted him she made her move with her left hand she stripped the zipper open with her right she pushed the can of oven cleaner out of the bolster sitting up simultaneously he sensed her and turned she threw herself forward aimed for his face and pressed the button the can issuing a hiss of white spray that grew into foam as it contacted his skin the cleaner covered the right side of his face bringing a scream of pain and she kept spraying the burning began at once with the pain paolos finger involuntarily flexed on the trigger and the weapon fired wildly its recoil sudden and more than hed have expected his wrist was jerked violently back and as he reached to stem the agony in his right eye he dropped the weapon completely he lashed out blindly with the razor in his left hand transferring it effortlessly to his right and continuing to slash the air the back of his calf caught the low coffee table and he went down backward first to sitting then rolling off the table footsteps charging up the stairs the burning in his eye and on his nose and lips was more severe than anything hed imagined and only grew worse more spray hit him and again he lashed out at his attacker coming to standing he caught blurry sight of the open door to the next bedroom and feeding down from it a second stairwaya back stairs everything inside him resisted turning his back on someone approaching the person would shoot him dead he leaped for the door larson now at the top of the stairs ran toward the guns report he slipped on the hallway rug banged into the doorjamb of the small television room and an arm came down onto him as a gray blur heat penetrated the back of his right hand and his gun fell out of his hand as he realized hed been cut hope lay on the floor in some kind of sleeping bag struggling to get her legs out a swipe came at his neck larson jerked away from the attempt he kicked out and connected with the intruder who slammed against the open closet door but came back at larson like a boxer off the ropes the razor whooshed past larsons right ear he ducked and kicked out again this time spinning the man larson regained his balance and delivered the tight knot of a fist squarely into the space above the mans hip bone pounding deeply for the kidney and bending him backward in pain as he connected incredibly the intruder spun as if never struck their arms tangled larson defended against the razor by first blocking an intended blow and then grabbing the mans wrist they banged together like a pair of wrestlers still on their feet larson won purchase on fabric and pulled buttons flew fabric tore the intruders shirt tore open two dozen red raised scars screamed from his bare chest random lengths and shapes some old and thick and hardened as if recut many times some pink and raw and new larson froze hed never seen anything like this the intruder caught him with a toe in the groin snapping larson over in pain inexplicably he did not feel the razor run its course down his back instead he heard the familiar sound of feet fading away from him a crashing downstairs then gone as he glanced at a wideeyed hope are you hit no get the gun he said sliding it across the floor as he retrieved his own into the bathtub for coverlock the doornow his last words faded behind him as he entered the mouth of the stairs and scrambled down into the waiting darkness a locked house proved as difficult to get out of as to get into the intruderrodriguezmade for the kitchens back door but struggled with the antique twistknob dead bolt found it an impasse and turned this in the same time it took larson to descend the steep back stairs larson got off a roundgiven the angle more of a statement of his presence than a kill shot the bullet took out an old handpainted plate in the hutch on the far wall splintered pottery rained down tinkling and clinking as it landed larson raced down and into the kitchen but slowed as he reached the door that connected through to the front entry in case the killer planned any surprises he heard the front doora rattle of chains and locks a loud bang as it thumped the wall reeling on its hinges the humph humph humph of the intruder running off the porch and then as the man hurried away the crackling of sticks autumn winds larson like someone late off the blocks in a track meet now followed behind as fast as his powerful legs would carry him as fit and as solid as hed ever been the morning training on the river engorging his muscles arms pumping like pistons as his right hand still clung to the weapon slightly warmer it seemed from his firing that shot a hundred yards and closing the distance judged only by the sound of the other the smudge of gray charcoal that might have been a man obscured in the foggy haziness of night larson made it another fifty yards before his own voice whispering dryly from the back of his brain asked about hope and who was guarding her now asking how certain he was that thered been only one intruder with the killer went a chance to find penny and markowitz guilttorn and fearful his groin aching his nerves raw from having discharged the weapon the smell of cordite still bitter in his sinuses larson slowed and reversed directions he pulled out his cell phone but then thought better of it compromised rotem had said so himself how many other such moles how many secrets leaking from fatfs splintered hull he put his phone away his priorities certain now larson returned to the farmhouse intent on getting her out of here rotem would have to handle the cleanup he and hope would sleep if they slept at all in a downtown condominium a friend had been trying to sell to larson since the middle of summer hed say hed picked up a woman downtown and if there was ever a time for him to demo the place it was on this night of all nights he would arrange for the key to be left see no one make contact with no one there would be no more connection made between hope and him and the service they would go it alone some old dog began barking as a car fired up far in the distance thoughts competing in his head larson hurried inside and called out for her chapter twentysix blinded by the corrosive chemicals in his right eye paolo drove onehanded covering his bad eye to block the blurring double vision that turned the interstate into a rainbow of stretched lights he headed for the motel but missed a turn somewhere and finally exited off south onto manchester road which teemed with traffic even at this late hour he drove east past the onslaught of strip malls and chain stores spotting a shell station on his left he pulled up to the back of it hoping for a restroom accessible from the outside only to realize he would have to go inside if he wanted water on his face and inside meant witnesses and security cameras then he spotted the automatic car washthree minutes of peace a chance to collect himself maybe even water for his face but getting his car caught in an automatic car wash made no sense he crossed back into traffic and found a mcdonalds he pulled the car around to the driveup microphone his eye stinging and throbbing leaking tears like a faucet he ordered friesfeeling he had to pay for somethingand a large cup of water no ice he awaited change at the first window keeping his head aimed down and his hand up to screen any sight of him dodging the change from the two dollars might make him memorable once in possession of his order he tossed the fries onto the passenger seat and raced the car ahead to a parking space hanging out the car door he doused his eye as the water hit he clenched his teeth the pain hot he sat up switched on the interior light and aimed the rearview mirror he saw a red swelling mass oozing yellowish fluid he pried his unwilling eye open between trembling fingers gathered his courage and touched the eyeball itself in an effort to clear it but the plastic of his contact lens had melted and adhered to his eyeball real terror ripped through him blind the end of his career hed be relegated to sweeping sand traps on the romeros eighteenhole golf course the fear encouraged more pain the pain more fear he knew he had to extricate the lens to leave it invited infection possible blindness and unbearable pain leaning out of the car he once again splashed his face and eye once again cringed he stabbed at it with his fingers squeezing and pinching but it was no use the excruciating pain left him feeling faint it was glued onto his eyeball he was stuck with it he had to get to the motel had to handle the little girl had to handle his eye still had to take care of hope stevens alice stevensonthe mark his fear graduated to panic pain to agony his world caved in around him philippe would recall him hed be sweeping tennis courts hed be the guy with that face the mirror showed blisters already forming on the rim of his eyelids his nose and the corner of his mouthanywhere the chemical came in contact with him the red swelling now included most of the right side of his face any such memorable features were impossible for a man of his trade anonymity was crucial he had to fix this before it changed his life forever and by the look of him he had to do it fast he needed soap and water he needed the contact lens removed painkillers through shifting blurring colors of passing traffic streetlights and walls of neon swirls of light he spotted a building across the street that represented some help mason ridge veterinary clinic and animal hospital he carefully backed the car out of the spot for now the girl would have to wait chapter twentyseven penny lay in the bottom of the bathtub on top of the towel her knees taped together she couldnt bend her legs and reach the piece of broken crockery hidden in her sock couldnt cut herself free shed been here for so long she was beginning to wonder if the man with the scars was ever coming back or if hed just left her for good the tub was slippery she could rock back and forth but could not get her legs up and out and over the edge could not get out of the tub shed tried a dozen different things at one point accidentally rolling over so that she lay facedown on the towel it had taken her several tries to get back over onto her back her flailing efforts reminded her of a turtle shed had cheyenne and how her mother had made her leave it behind on one of their many moves if she could get out of the tub even taped as she was she thought she might hop to the door maybe bang her head against it as someone passed do something but trapped in the tub she felt helpless frustrated penny rocked and bucked which only served to bang her head against the tub and that hurt she quieted again remembering her mothers lessons on patience that everything took time sometimes more time than we wanted and there were more ways than one to skin a cat at that moment at the height of her telling herself to be patient her mother so fully in her mind that it felt to her as if she her mom were sitting on the toilet while penny took a bath her mom fingercombing her hair the way she did when she was tired and talking to herself penny heard her mother say look for the obvious dont fight the easy answer it was then at that moment that penny finally did see the obvious saw what had been facing her throughout her entire ordeal facing her like a giants eye and she thought that without mommy she never would have seen it and that made her sad and all the more desperate to be out of here the tubs faucet its single lever right before her eyes she wiggled moving herself incrementally toward the drain stiffened her elbows and rocked her bottom like playing bucking bronco her feet jumped up though she could not hold them there she tried again and again the third time the tape around her ankles snagged on the pullup lever on the top of the spigot a lever that started the shower her feet were held aloft one more heave and her toes smacked the faucet cold water trickled out another try and the valve opened and the water gushed out shivering she wrestled her feet free of the spigot she felt the water collecting when the maid had finished cleaning shed left the tubs stopper down plugging the drain the tub slowly filled with cold water a moment later she felt the first tingle of her body rising with the water floating toward the top of the tub she cried at the thought of seeing mommy again her freedom might now be within reach chapter twentyeight paolo roughly broke through a glass window using the corner of a shipping pallet at the back side of the mason ridge veterinary clinic and animal hospital the sounds of barking dogs erupted from within hearing a burglar alarm he moved quickly these kinds of suburban neighborhoods were well patrolled especially along the commercial district the cops were typically bored and appreciated a good breakin to pick up a slow night stepping through he found himself in a small bathroom he grabbed a pair of latex gloves from an open box and donned them the dogs continued to battle the alarm door by door he worked his way past two examination rooms an office and the waiting room the place smelled of dry dog food medicines disinfectant cedarwood shavings urine and feces having marked his watch at the moment of breakin he estimated he had less than five minutes before the police arrived in new york city or los angeles he might have had twenty to thirty minutes not here in middle america he found the stockroom located a pair of locked cabinets and used a stainlesssteel surgical device to pry it open he trained his one good eye toward it in the dim light the shelves were stacked with clothwrapped surgical gear as he turned his talents to the second cabinet he noticed hed ripped open the surgical glove on his right hand fingerprints he glanced behind him attempting to quickly catalog all the surfaces hed touched when had it torn as it happened the idiots used their sirens he heard the mechanical cries growing louder but they still sounded far off the second cabinet succumbed he searched the five shelves of prescription drugs reading for the base compound instead of the brand name as vets called their drugs by different names he pocketed some highdose antibiotics and finally mercifully located a synthetic opiatea painkiller he would have liked to search for a salve for the blistering on his face but no the wash of headlights on the windows signaled the arrival of a patrol car far sooner than hed anticipated he hurried back through the building to the window through which hed come not trying for his car eager to disappear up into the woods on the hill behind the small clinic minutes later he dryswallowed two of the large pain pills and squirted saline solution onto his swollen face never resting he pushed up through the woods reaching a clearing shared behind three large homes all with garages garages meant cars or bicycles from a distance he could see down to the roof lights of the patrol car flashing red white and blue across the vet clinic the painkiller wouldnt kick in for a half hour or so and by that time he hoped to have ridden a bus back to the motel hoped to be numb to the sensation of the razors edge and the punishment he so craved he would still have to deal with the little girl he wondered how tough she was how badly she wanted her freedom and whether she possessed the courage to remove the melted contact lens from his swelling eye chapter twentynine what now hope asked she carried a small bundle of intimates and clothing cradled in her arms you want me to wash yours as well youre going to have to get out of them no thanks you could use it this is all ive got larson informed her thats my point she said hed risked a quick stop at target to buy them both some clothes she was laundering what shed changed out of the condominium they occupied overlooked construction on a new baseball park for the cardinals and beyond it the tiny moving lights from highway from the corner of the living room they had a view of a gambling casino on the mississippi an eyesore in larsons opinion larson took a minute to don the sweatpants and sweatshirt their clothes joined in the washer he thought this oddly significant wondered if this was but the first of such nights together he heard her setting the timer she seemed more settled she returned to the kitchen searched the refrigerator and the cabinets but of course no food were going to have to order in he wondered if this ease of hers had come with the shower or the attack on her or had she simply resigned herself to the fact that he now represented her daughters only real chance or like him did it run deeper than that she slid down into an ikea chair and placed her elbows on the table lets say they never call me back she proposed from a distance how do we go about finding her larson took a chair facing her its a twostep process our best shot our most likely prospect remains markowitz on the way to the condo hed told her all he knew about markowitz hope already had a better grasp of the computer and technology aspects of the case than he did so youre saying the romeros got to markowitz or they didnt have to because it could have been his idea in the first place no one is saying leopold markowitz walks on water he could be bent he could be broke he could have approached the romeros for protection while he went about stealing the list we wont know until we get there are you saying if we find markowitz we find penny its a possibility yes if the romeros are behind thisand im convinced they arethen finding markowitz gives us the romeros and were that much closer to penny and how do we find him witsec is convinced hell need a supercomputer to accomplish the decryption if its onetwentyeightbit or higher then yes she said interrupting it would be painfully slow even on the fastest pc and with such computers in short supply he continued that makes them a good lead we have guys spread out from accelerators at stanford to cyclotrons at u of m indiana and duke he saw a sparkle in her eyes what is it he asked by now knowing you guys youve confirmed where he last was seen stanford palo alto yes just before that wash u and he was in any number of places before palo alto were still chasing his travel his finances and the like its a job even tougher because justice is not eager to let anyone know hes missing but thats stupid government work he said as frustrated by it as she was what department at wash u planetary sciences i think it was he answered makes sense weather prediction that would be a silicon graphics or even a cray those machines create processor reports ways to determine a machines activity even if theyre not showing markowitz himself as having been logged on he welcomed her excitement her computer expertise surfacing im assuming weve checked all that he told her i cant just sit here she said can you no for one thing hed fall asleep a look of defiance overcoming her she said good then lets check for ourselves ill need access to the processor reports we can start at wash u i cant take you out in public i thought the best place to hide a person like me was out in the open he felt himself losing ground she had the will of seven he felt a heat hanging between them wondering if she felt it too trust me she said ive become something of an expert in the art of disguise he told her if she slept for a few hours hed consider it she nodded her assent larson doublechecked his blackberry no messages rotem would understand his going awol would contact him when he was certain fatf was safe again the internal threat contained fatigue was getting the best of him he realized hope brought him out of it the point being that if they arent going to bring penny to me then were going to find her without them i havent spent a single night without penny since she was born not one single night her lower lip trembled despite her efforts to keep it steady this is my first she looked up at him then her eyes carrying anger frustration and a mothers pain her hands were right there on the table and seeing them larson felt compelled to reach out and surround them with his which he did of all hed done that day he considered this his biggest act of bravery hope did not pull her hands away instead just as the awkwardness of the moment required him to let go of her she looked up and they met eyes and his hands stayed where they were thank you she said chapter thirty the bathwater continued to rise and penny along with it lifted it seemed to her by the fingers of angels come to rescue her extremely cold at first shed managed one more bump into the faucet to make the handle point up at twelve oclock resulting in a lukewarm stream even so penny was cold shivering cold and she wanted out of the tub at a little over the halfway mark the rising water hit the overflow drain forcing penny to wedge her head in front of the soap dish mounted into the wall tile in order to then hold the toes of her right foot over the vent in the drain and allow the water to continue to fill water still seeped out but there was more water coming in than going out the tub continued to fill she peed in her pants into the tub unable to hold it sight of the yellow stream motivated her soaked through the duct tape had lost some of its stickiness the tape at her knees came loose her knees able to bend her ankles wiggling she hooked a knee rolled over the edge of the tub and crashed onto the floor of the bathroom facefirst a splash of bathwater following with her as she sat up she saw the water on the floor was pink blood pink her nose screamed with pain and she screamed right along with ita muted worthless cry forced through a knotted sock the thin puddle of water grew as she kneeled a dead fly floated past this all but yanked her to standing then her knees giving out she sank back and collapsed onto the toilet with a loud bang try as she did she could not get hold of the chip of pottery shed hidden in her sock it took her several minutes to get feeling back into her legs her strength returned she kicked and fluttered and tried everything to break the tape at her ankles but it held soaked through to the bone more determined than ever she rose held her stance and hopped toward the bathroom door angling like a penguin to use her right hand still taped to her waist to try to open the door locked she remembered the man with the scars reversing the doorknob on her side of the door the knob now had a hole in it but penny knew such doorknobs more than once shed locked herself out of her room and then watched as her mother did the clotheshangerinthehole trick to pop the lock another time shed used a paperclip penny spun hopping like a rabbit she looked for anything that might work as a pin or nail to shove into the doorknob and free the lock and there it was right on the bathroom counter a thin piece of silver metal she moved and it moved a mirrored reflection of her own belt her arms and hands held to her sides with tape she nonetheless fingered the belt and drew it around her waist toward her fingers the buckle caught on the first belt loop but this proved close enough for her to deftly unfasten her belt with outstretched fingers it did not go smoothly she fell back onto the toilet twice losing her balance only to stand again and continue with her efforts finally the belt buckle came open and penny sprang forward hopping a little to position herself before inserting the buckles metal tongue into the doorknob she pushed and nothing happened she pushed again click she had to push her arm against the knob and slide down to make it turn it took four tries before the door finally came open the bedroom lit only by the shifting colors of the tv her face exploded into a smile shed done it better shed done it herself along with the fear the dread of him returning came a gleeful sense of accomplishment usually mommy did everything told her what to do made all her decisions somehow this one act of floating herself out of the tub and winning her freedom was the best feeling shed ever had wanting nothing more than to find her mother and tell her everything shed been through all that shed accomplished penny hopped toward the motel rooms door determined to open that one as well she was on a roll why stop now she was just past the bed past the tv bleating out its news when the door seemed to jiggle she stopped frozen the door didnt just seem to jiggle it was jiggling and it wasnt the loud tv making it move she wanted to turn and head back to the bathroom would have given anything to mop up the dark stain of bathwater that now loomed at the junction of the door her wet footprints where shed hopped across the carpet but her legs would not move would not cooperate the door came open again she screamed one of her muted screams it wasnt him in the blue flickering light of the television she saw the blistered face and red dripping eye of a twolegged monster chapter thirtyone by the time the morning sun set the mississippi ablaze broken only by the rolling brown vs cut into it by slowly moving river barges larson and hope were eating bagels wrapped in butcher paper and drinking oj from plastic bottles in the secondfloor offices of grossman iron and steel five acres of dirt dedicated to mountains of scrap metal beyond the yard a massive twentyfoot wall had been erected forty years earlier by the army corps of engineers to hold back the rivers spring floodwaters skip grossman was a rowing buddy of larsons from creve coeur lake mike who worked the graveyard shift and sat guard on the yards gate knew larson well enough to admit him it wasnt the first time larson had stashed a witness for a few hours in this brickyard neighborhood that had risen from the mississippi s banks at the birth of the industrial revolution the two ate their bagels in silence both lost it was a matter of waiting now until washington university s earth and planetary sciences department opened their hunt for markowitz was about to begin in earnest in its heyday in st louis hosted a worlds fair the olympics and the democratic national convention all in the same year hundreds of stone mansions that had been erected during this golden era still stood in the area including a long line of such homes along lindell avenue on the northern boundary of forest park immaculately kept lawns spilled down to what had once been a busy cobblestone thoroughfare you can almost picture the carriages the gentlemen in top hats and the victorian women with their parasols she said gateway to the west larson said from behind the wheel of the explorer as they made their way toward washington university anyone heading west resupplied here it made it a very rich city at the far western edge of the park just across skinker boulevard the pale stone buildings of washington university rose in dramatic fashion showing off a neogothic architecture that rivaled the ivy league colleges the buildings stood amid towering oaks maples and a few elms that had survived dutch elm disease larson had attended its nightschool mba program though he had dropped out in the middle of a difficult protection six years earliera protection he couldnt help but be reminded of given the woman next to him where are you she asked i was thinking back six years ago and then i was thinking that pennys five years old she applied makeup to her face using the small mirror in the back of the sun visor she slowly created the look of a holloweyed woman ten to fifteen years older do you want to know she asked of course i do then find her take a good long look at her youll know his chest tightened as his heart ran away from him at a full gallop ive known all along he said softly he wasnt sure shed heard him and ive waited for you to ask and ive waited for you to tell me i thought it would be cheap of me manipulative unfair its your daughter so do something how could i say that she didnt take her eyes off him are you okay with this his throat caught he found himself overwhelmed with wonder curiosity anticipation im great he managed to whisper lights green she said he took an enormous risk by bringing her along but it seemed a bigger risk to leave her behind and without protection he could easily justify her being here because of her computer expertise but what good would justification be if something went wrong he drove why havent they called she asked yet again whats she like he asked she pursed her lips looked away from him and attempted to conceal her eyes now glassy with tears not now you wanted to know thats as far as i can go right now please dont push me on this the more i think about her he said look they probably dont know what to do next they never meant to have penny instead of you they tried to trace your phone and we cut that off and now all thats left is to hunt you down while we hunt them theyre not going to try to negotiate pennys release until theyve figured a way to beat us and there is no way to beat us they know that we know that he pulled to a stop at the next light the university now directly in front of them she fidgeted in her seat larson pulled through the intersection and found a place to park he shut off the motor and she popped open her door which one is earth and planetary sciences macelwane hall which one well find it she was out of the car larson climbed out locked up and caught up to her on the sidewalk the neogothic architecture towered over them her shoulders slumped she trudged head bent up the incline he caught up to her for the second time you came to st louis because of you and me for penny he waited tell me why you came to st louis hope he persisted did you want me in pennys life or both of your lives i didnt choose it for the weather she said but do me a favor and dont go all warm and fuzzy on me because i dont think i can handle that right now okay he moved closer to her as they walked he held his hand out to her and she took it their fingers interlaced entwined larson squeezed and she squeezed back just for a moment it felt as if he were floating we cant do this she said we cant get everything all confused sure we can he said it cant get any more confused than it already is it can only get better later she said increasing her pace to keep up with him the earth and planetary sciences office was staffed with a combination of salaried assistants and graduate students the walls were lined with photographs of tornados and satellite images of hurricanes dr herman miller a man in his late sixties had sad brown eyes wet lips and a runny nose he tended to with a white handkerchief he wore a navy blue cardigan sweater populated with pills of yarn some the size of bunny tails why more questions about leo he asked i spoke to someone just yesterday larson introduced hope as alice shes our contract it specialist were interested in reviewing your mainframes access logs hope said specifically the past six weeks and weve been looking them over just as your guy asked no stone unturned miller said to larson thats how your other guy wanted it that was stubby by the sound of it trill hampton was too streetcool to bog down in clichés nonetheless hope and miller got started talking their own language id logons pattern recognition software spyware keytrackers hope pushed for specifics each time miller fired off too quick an answer miller asked rhetorically could leo markowitz get in and out of the cray and the silicon graphics without our knowing it of course he could but if markowitz is on the system decrypting these records one by one which we know for a fact he has to do because thats the way he set it up in the first placeand there are thousands of records dont forgetthen your processor logs are going to reflect that even if they dont tell you exactly whos doing it larson asked for a definition of a processor log and at the same time both hope and miller met him squarely with expressions of exasperation he took a step back and let them go at it a few heated exchanges later miller said something like if you want an exercise in futility be my guest thank you she said lead on miller annoyed with her walked down a hall covered with weatherradar printouts and timelapse photographs of lightning they passed through a steel door and down two flights of stairs that took them into a subterranean lab they arrived at a door where miller used his id card to gain access the expansive room was chilly and the equipment it containedmostly rackmounted black and blue and yellow boxes with thousands of multicolored wireshummed loudly row after row of them wires and lights routers and hubs all interconnected your networking hope said our routing center miller answered one of three such hubs on campus on any one day we have around fifteen thousand pcs hanging on this system every student every department that wants access hope glanced down the long rows of machinery and narrow aisles she studied the racked routers as larson and miller continued on without her eventually miller turned back toward her to hurry her along familiar with that searching look in her eyes larson placed a hand on millers arm to silence him as he was about to call out to her the cray is down this way miller finally said dr markowitz is a systems expert she said repeating what larson had originally told her a description that hardly does him credit miller added from a distance he served as a consultant here yes our weather simulators our forecasting modules he walked a few steps back toward her larson followed leo is far more than a systems analyst hes a designer a code writer custom apps source code he ramped us up to full integration he identified nearly thirty percent more processor headroom than we thought we had stabilized the platform all without touching the cray the additional processing power she said did he by any chance set up grid computing for you before miller could answer she asked has anyone checked the network logs good god miller mumbled to a confused larson he said i assure you the oversight was unintentional what the hell are you two talking about miller held up a finger she just might be onto something was all miller would give him millers office a sanctum of order overlooked a campus lawn and intersecting pathways an extra chair had to be brought in crowding the space miller worked behind his desk consulting two computer screens and an accordioned stack of printouts hope explained to larson in a hushed voice grid computing is the poor mans supercomputer any personal computer or server at any one time is only using about fifteen percent of its processing power you link machines together you take advantage of the headroomthe unused processing power you link together a thousand or ten thousand you have what amounts to a homemade supercomputer what weve just established miller explained is that our grid the one leo set up for us has shown massive additional usage from midnight to seven am for the past three weeks markowitz has been using the system undetected hope interjected with everyone asleep he has six or seven hours of power processing available hes been working the swing shift we were focused on our cray and our silicon graphics but someone tapping directly into the grid its so obvious in hindsight but at the timeits so new to usit just wasnt on our radar can we shut him down larson asked miller looked up sharply meeting eyes with hope who then said no no you dont want to do that yes we do each night he stays on the system for hours hope said dr miller can peek behind that curtain and trace what port hes coming in on which internet provider hes using weve collected enough data pointssix nights worth well identify the isp and with their help should be able to nail down his exact location if hes moving around that may not help you but if hes stationary of course hell keep moving larson said hes not going to give us a way to find him unless hes innocent miller made sure he met eyes with larson youre in such a hurry to prosecute him he could be being watched or like me maybe they hold something over him hope said he doesnt dare send out a distress signal for fear of being caught but hes smart enough to leave us an electronic trail to follow weve interviewed his extended family larson said theres nothing they gave us to suggest extortion nothing the familys willing to share at any rate hope said still working the printouts miller observed only leo would understand the risks involved by using the same entry port the same isp night after night if he is remaining stationary if we are able to trace it then it has to be intentional hes leaving you a string to follow looking up from the paperwork his finger still marking a spot miller said and if youre smart youll follow it chapter thirtytwo a woman with bright green hair passed rotems office she wore a black cape and had pointy ears he thought she must be part of the secretary pool but the lime green hair threw him do they have goths working here now he hoped like hell she wasnt one of his deputies reminded then of yet another beltway halloween he felt burdened by his responsibilities as a father restricted by the twentyminute drive to a safe neighborhood where theyd trickortreat with friends the fathers drinking a little too much as the mothers went door to door with the kids he felt the day slipping away from him the quitting hour quickly approaching even though it was barely after lunch he slid the wellmarked legal pad in front of him and reconsidered his list of priorities he drew a few arrows and then pushed the pad away feeling helpless the discovery of a mole in their midst and the ongoing investigation into damage done had crushed morale within fugitive apprehension rotems mood wasnt much better hed had a latte and some biscotti for lunch and was already beginning to feel hungry again with four meetings scheduled this afternoon he had his work cut out for him wegner entered his office without knocking a redheaded man so thin he couldnt find shirts to fit wegners boyish face belied nearly a decade of experience in the department his deodorant failed to mask his body odor a desk jock devoted to intelligence gathering he approached his job with the eagerness of a field operative may have something when overly excited one of wegners most annoying habits was his tendency to either truncate his sentences leaving the recipient to decode them or talk so quickly you couldnt understand a word or both rotem had not heard from larson nor had he tried to make contact he had two dead officersmurderedand a safe house that was no longer safe larson would find cover and check in hed recalled hampton and stubblefield whod both been pursuing markowitz leads with rotems department in disarray wegners enthusiasm seemed surreal the man placed a printout in front of rotem gave him about an eighth of a second to examine it and then began talking at a furious rate rotem slipped on a pair of reading glasses atc general aviation aircraft flight plans into the greater st louis metropolitan area last thirty hours current as of onezero hundred a little over an hour ago rotem had reported the missing child to the fbis st louis field office requesting they make it a priority hed not told them who penny was nor how she connected to witsec or fatf nor that laena was missing train stations rentalcar agencies bus stations truckers truck stops and state troopers were all on the alert as were the general aviation airports and st louis international rotem didnt recall requesting that one of his guys work with air traffic controls computerized flight plans he hadnt asked anyone to filter general aviation for firsttime visits to the area but he wasnt complaining give me the short form he told wegner and slow down homeland security requires atc to track every bird in the sky for variations from their regularly filed flight plans since the abduction of the stevenson girl atc has recorded a half dozen firsttime singleengine aircraft into the st louis area and weve accounted for the pilot and the reason for the visit in each case eleven twins most of which simply landed and refueled employees at fbos are encouraged to keep track of passenger pickups and dropoffs something initiated by homeland all fbos have been advised of the little girl intel gathered an hour ago from atc concernshe leaned over rotem and turned the page directing him to a line about halfway downa fractionally owned private jet in and of itself its not too remarkable in the past day weve logged seven privately owned jets landing there for the first time but in each case the paper trail made sensethat is the fractional owner was a corporation or at least a known entity and the passengers listed on the manifest checked out this one he said tapping his finger strongly on the open page is the exception weve been on the horn with sureflyte the corporation that sells and maintains the fractional ownership fleet and weve also run a background on the fractional ownera corporation out of delaware and its murky to say the least past flights and there havent been many have been seattle to providence round trip seattle to here washington dc seattle to reno a half dozen times always originating with a passenger in seattle the passenger names listed on the manifests are for people who certainly existof course they dobut im betting ten to one theyre recent victims of identity theft you look at their incomes these people did not ride a private jet around the country is homeland involved theyll be all over this once they hear about the aliases lets delay that for now rotem said wheres it scheduled to land thats what caught our attention the pickup is washington missouri its a small strip west of st louis just big enough to handle a jet like this and get this no tower no fbo no witnesses sureflyte has never let me repeat that never landed one of their jets at the washington strip a private jet of dubious ownership rotem repeated landing for the first time at a strip just out of town where no one is likely to see who gets on or gets off and the first time a passenger flight for this company did not originate in seattle which is why i brought it up here in person rather than put it into the paper mill wegner lived in an office cubicle where the only light came from fluorescent tubes and the only smells from his armpits or the coffee machine for a reward rotem felt tempted to bring him as a fieldside spectator for the dayto see his efforts in actionbut decided he needed him on the front line of paperwork you may have saved a life wegner rotem watched as the man grew a few inches taller maybe more than that maybe many more wegner lingered a little too long now get back to it rotem said already growing impatient with him chapter thirtythree a thunderstorm cracked wildly with twenty minutes to go before the scheduled landing with the small girl bound and gagged in the trunk of the stolen car paolo sat off a farm road across a small pouredconcrete bridge to the east of and with a good view of washington memorial airport s landing strip hed rigged the cars jack to make it look as if he were dealing with a flat in fact he could drive away leaving the jack behind if needed by car he was less than five minutes from the tarmac and the sole hangar on foot they would have to cross a farmers field ten to twelve minutes if the girl stayed on her feet but this option would allow him to abandon the stolen car in the woods along the creek and thereby limit the evidence connecting the kidnapping to this airfield he waited which would it be hed been told the pilot had his cell number he couldnt get the image of the girl out of his mind dripping wet head to toe caught between the motel bed and the tv a stunned look of surprise as he came through the door hed waited for her to say something and she him finally he broke the silence get out of those clothes and dry yourself youll catch cold she turned around and headed for the bathroom i need you to do something for me he called after her she stopped just outside of the bathroom and turned to face him as if expecting more from him its the duty of every prisoner to attempt escape he said once he added and only once id have done the same thing i want my mommy this stung him but he said ill hurt you if you do that again hurt you bad count on it but no ones going to kill you penny least of all me thats a promise the kid never flinched i want my mommy get out of those clothes the motel has a washerdryer you can wear one of my tshirts i dont want to his eyeball had swollen and blistered to deformity yellowish fluid leaked in bursts down his cheek for a moment his eye would actually feel slightly better then the stinging would return escalating to unbearable pain and then it would squirt out its foul juice and the cycle would repeat itself i need you to do something icky he told her somethings in my eye and it has to come out i dont like icky things neither do i but youre going to have to do this a few minutes later she had changed and opened the door for him her clothes lay in a heap by the front doorall but her socks which she refused to take off she wore his oakland raiders tshirt like a dress he mopped up the bathroom floor with a towel and had her sit on the counter while he held his damaged eye open to the bright light he described the melted contact lens and pointed to it youre going to have to pinch it and pull it off he instructed i tried but i couldnt see what i was doing i cant do that yeah you can no i cant you act like this and youre going back in the closet you help me out and theres ice cream and cartoons what if i hurt you youre going to hurt me but its not your fault just pinch and pull okay its disgusting he tried to think of other kids he knewkids who lived on the romero compound he said what if it was a kitty cat with something in her eye would you help the kitty a reluctant yeah so forget its me pretend its a kitty cat and youre the only one that can help it the only one who can save it can you do that maybe were going to do this now you and me ready i guess okay he pried open his bad eye gritted his teeth and watched as the two little fingers converged blocking what little sight he had a moment later he screamed it stuck to her finger like stubborn mucus and when she shook it off it landed on the bathroom floor a little glob of yellowish goo i got it she said i got it without thinking what she was doing she almost hugged him then shrank back you got it he said swallowing a scream his one good eye met hers and for a moment neither knew what to say the assigned hour of pm growing near paolo checked his watch repeatedly his good eye rotating from the distant airfield to the airspace above the field to the rearview mirror and back again hed covered the injured eye with an athletic headband worn askew on his head a makeshift eye patch arrangements had been made immediately after reporting hed lost all sight out of the eye hed hoped philippe might simply decide to send him a partner possibly with some medical supplies so that he could complete the original assignment the jet coming either meant anxiety over the hostage situation or a loss of faith in him so he looked ahead to the landing sick with nerves his future was in the hands of others the outcome a plane ride away and paolo felt desperately out of control the first car he saw could have been nothing it pulled off the twolane road on the north side of the airstrip and into a dirt turnout in front of a farmers maintenance shed or hay barn when no one climbed out paolo kept his eye on it but it was a second vehicle a dark fourdoor much like the first that got his heart pounding if he had it right and he wasnt sure he did hed seen this same car already it had driven past the airstrips entrance now it had backtracked and entered it drove up to the strips only hangar where a man wearing a sport coat climbed out a moment later the hangars electronic door opened slowly and then this car pulled inside meaning there was a second man behind the wheel before the hangar door came fully shut paolo had his motor going he rocked it off the jack and backed up across the small bridge he took a rural road south into farm country having plotted this course as an escape route in advance it was hilly and wooded out here an easy place to lose a tail if necessary he drove fast but not too fast his one good eye jumping from the road ahead of him to the road behind cops or feds it hardly mattered philippe had been clear about what he should do should anything go wrong radio silenceno phones no attempts to contact the compound no email no faxes he was on his own his only assignment to get the little girl to the compound as soon as possible crossing the stream for the second time paolo slowed and tossed his cell phone out the window into the water ending any possibility of triangulating his location it landed with a small splash he and the girl were on their own now bad eye or no bad eye he had an assignment he intended to carry out he felt strangely relieved by the grace of god hed been given a chance to redeem himself to prove his worth he crested a hill already planning how to replace the stolen car in case it had been reported he tried not to think of the implications of what hed just witnessed at the airstrip how close he had come to being caught tried not to think of what hed do if philippe ordered him to kill the little girl chapter thirtyfour in a surprisingly short time dr miller traced markowitzs internet access backward from the university grid to a physical address in florida armed with that address and hoping the markowitzromeropenny connection would hold larson drove hope to springfield and chartered a king air twin engine to tampa topping out his credit card and forcing him to call in for a preapproved home equity loan late that same afternoon larson drove a rental car past a cattle farms unmoving windmill that stood in a field of lush green grass intermittently shorn by gray longhorn cattle looking worse for the wear in the florida heat stretching high above the flat green horizon eightyfoottall telescoping steel poles held clusters of powerful gasvapor highway lights that trained down onto the cloverleaves and rest areas a blessing in hurricane season perhaps but an eyesore on any other day the occasional building crane loomed in the distance reaching for the rare cloud like a bony finger randomly placed cell towers also rose from the green jungle looking for all the world like derelict oil rigs the only other break in the perfectly blue sky came from a musical staff of highvoltage wires strung across the highway these were images one absorbed on the flatness of interstate heading south from tampa orange construction cones bumps of black road tar in a sea of powder gray concrete a set of smokestacks belching in the far distance they passed a sign indicating theyd entered manatee county larson upped the rentals speed desperate now to reach their destination youre not coming to useppa with me larson said having delayed it as long as he could of course i am ive arranged something a buddy of mine will look after you thats ridiculous at the end of this it would be nice if penny had a mother she bit her tongue and said no more larson had left dr miller both his own and hopes original cell phone numberthe number now callforwarded to the siemens hed given her and therefore it was impossible to triangulate miller and hope spoke the same language she would be the one called with anything technical tell me shes okay lars she said at last shes okay he said tell me again they have not hurt her guys like this its all about profit and loss theres no profit in that she unstrapped her seat belt and moved over the gap between the seats so that she could lean against him larson drove on in silence holding his breath with each mile he pressed the rental a little faster and she leaned more heavily against him he could have just kept driving ninety minutes later now on the island of gasparilla a hotel bellhop clad in khakis and a green golf shirt awaited them with a brass luggage dolly and a look of impertinence larsons rental blocked the hotels semicircular drive other arrivals now idling behind him the night air rang behind a chorus of cicadas and tree frogs the gasparilla inns white antebellum facade loomed large before them hotel guests came and went climbing into golf carts used on the island in lieu of cars a parade of salmon and lime green bermuda shorts tevas and leather deck shoes sprayon tans eager for the real thing diamonds and silicone tommyll take care of you larson said i dont want tommy to take care of me she turned intentionally childish larson had bunked with tommy tomelson during a twoweek inservice training at the fbi academy a couple years earlier hed stayed in touch enough to know that the man had lost his wife to cancer and had subsequently taken a years leave from the atf then a short nosedive into a rum bottle and finally sobered up enough to live the griefstricken existence of a charterboat captain he was currently operating a tarpon charter out of millers marina which served larsons needs well tommy was up there on the veranda smoking a marlboro and drinking something dark watching the tight buns and the halter tops pass by while waiting for larson to sort things out he was a big guy with a fishermans tan and a quarterbacks shoulders his sunleathered face covered now by a pervasive veil of discontent and loneliness when and if i find her youll be the first to know all right she held on to his arm listen to tommy and do as he asks at least take him with you if not me please dont go alone she squeezed his arm this is not heroics its simple numbers tommy stays with you hed gone over this a dozen times in his head the smarter call was to wait for hampton or stubblefield to fly down here maybe bothto take on the house on useppa island with as strong a force as he could currently muster but markowitz logged onto the grid at nightand with the meeting of known crime families called for the following night the list had to be close to being fully decrypted larson didnt have twentyfour hours to wait you call me the minute you know anything same there he returned if miller should call youll hear about it she said she leaned away from him then changed her mind and craned across to kiss him larson turned to meet her lips there was nothing particularly romantic about it but he felt it long after dont do anything stupid as if i have a choice he fired back this is me were talking about the first hint of a smile began but then she hid it well she paused the car door now open a crack if you find herwhen you find hershe wont trust you we talked about getting a dog she and i we were going to name it cairo like egypt use it it may help cairo yeah ever since she saw a picture of the pyramids shes wanted to go there her eyes grew distant as if watching a film run inside her head larson walked her up the hotels front steps and introduced her to tommy tomelson as he left he felt horribly alone tommy tomelson had used some of the life insurance from his wifes passing to buy the twinengine inboardoutboard fourhundredandfortyhorsepower christine judging by both the name and all the bells and whistles hed added gps satellite navigation sonar weather radar sailmail email larson read his own email off the blackberry as he navigated the channel cut into the shallow bay between gasparilla and useppa fishing craft cigarette boats and pleasure cruisers stayed to the dredged channel crowding it larson opened it up once hed cleared the speedcontrolled areas dusk was an hour off the sun burning harshly to the west the air holding that twinge of change that came with approaching twilight larson hoped to make the return crossing before darkness fully descended he wasnt keen to test his maritime skills on a friends sixfigure investment tying up at useppa a private spit of old island luxury less than a mile long required permission tommy who often chartered for the islands guests had called ahead for larson with no bridges connecting it to the mainland and only the marina for access useppa was as remote a place as could be found it made great sense as a retreat for markowitz walking off the immaculate dock and onto the island proper larson stepped back a century entering an enclave like nothing hed ever seen no cars hereonly golf carts used for everything from maintenance to transportation larson climbed a sidewalk set amid a lush botanical garden of wild orchid mangrove tropical fruit trees and flowers in garish colors tiny lizards scurried through the underbrush sounding to larson like rats singlestory shellwhite houses carried names instead of street numbers black shutters and screenedin porches begonia house the bougainvillea the rose cottage larson ducked beneath a heavy overhanging branch that ran tentacles back to the ground like a shredded curtain lights already glowed yellow behind a few windows the air smelled of perfume small waves lapped on a crescentshaped manmade beach below and to his left a few sailboats were tied up to moorings there the encroaching dusk foreshortened distance and softened edges giving everything a look that for larson usually followed two or three cocktails he stepped off the path making room for a middleaged tennis couple with a perky teenage daughter in tow who offered larson a smile full of braces the sidewalk terminated in front of a hundredyearold inn from which emanated the sounds of a busy bar and dining room the lush life tony bennett crooned about lost love bit by bit byte by byte it was to here useppa island that dr millers information quest had led them the technology had been explained to larsonusing internet service providers to trace markowitzs digital identity to a direct pc highspeed internet account the address was the sand dollar useppa island larson had been expecting a hotel not a private residence larson found the look of the place intriguing its isolation and privacy perfect for hiding an ideal location from which to decrypt laena near the end of the path he reached and entered the useppa inn paddle fans and linen tablecloths a wood bar with a dozen varieties of bottled rum hanging inverted in a metal rack larson slid up onto a stool and ordered an appleton estate rum and tonic with a lime wedge two women sat at a window table nursing what looked like iced teas while a pair of elderly fellows shared beers by an overhead television with the sound off showing a prerecorded golf match one of the women wore a witchs hat and green nose the other wore harry potter glasses and had a wand sitting on the table halloween with the elderly ten minutes passed and larson ordered another rum knowing he shouldnt drink on an empty stomach he added a basket of french fries to the mix and called it dinner capping it off with a double espresso an octogenarian entered sat alone and ordered a vodka up larson daydreamed of the st louis rowing club on creve coeur lake missing the spiritual exercise as much as the physical he felt bonetired though the french fries had helped to wake him the house detective an older floridcheeked man named harold montgomery whom tomelson had phoned ahead of time doubled as the dinnertime maitre d smelling of lime cologne with an afterglow of gin and tonic he offered larson a damp softfleshed right hand and the two men greeted one another by sharing a few stories about tomelson montgomery wore dark trousers a white shirt a navy blue tie with anchor insignias and a sheen of perspiration across his brow his sport coat was a meanspirited shocking green better reserved for highway work crews he had a piece of food stuck in his top teeth hed missed a few spots shaving his white hair was frontcombed in a failed attempt to hide his baldness montgomery raised his right index finger to signal the bartender and was quickly delivered a gin and tonic to absent friends montgomery said in a tight voice clinking glasses with larson lets talk about the layout of the sand dollar larson began chapter thirtyfive true to his training tommy tomelson guarded hopes secondstory room from the hallway occupying one half of an oldfashioned love seat located beneath a set of windows that conveniently overlooked the hotels semicircular driveway hed checked her in under the aliases stephan and elizabeth storey so as not to identify her as a single woman and to keep the wolves off the scent the rooms windows long since sealed shut for the airconditioning were behind closed blackout shades if a killer wanted in there hed have to go through the glass and tomelson would be on top of the intruder before the guy hit the floor soon after she entered her hotel room hopes cell phone rang she scrambled to answer praying it was penny only to hear the voice of dr miller i cant talk long hope said i need this line free for a call im expecting hes online miller said and ive ided his port right now she checked her watch miller confirmed hes early maybe not miller said more likely i was a little sloppy a little hasty in my analysis i was working fairly quickly this morning by coming online early evening he picks up another five or six hours of processing but if hes online right now she repeated and youve identified the port hes using are you saying i can communicate with him he has no firewall in place no protection you realize what that means i know leo thats no accident if he didnt want to be found i wouldnt have found him but then why not contact us directly technically speaking for one they could have a keytracker in place that would tell them anything he typedtheyd know what he was working on or they might have certain applications blocked or they might be watching his screen its hard to say why dont you ask him me she gasped thinking immediately of larson certainly not me miller said you apparently know what this is about i do not if you people if the federal government is interested the way the world is right now then thats enough for me do you have an internet connection i can give you a url and a password and thats about all there is to it its all handled on this endon the grid her heart quickening hope glanced around the room found the hotel directory and tore it open the receiver cradled between her shoulder and ear flipping through some notebook dividers she saw that the inn had a business center but it closed at pm im fifteen minutes late she mumbled into the phone i could call the manager plead my case any laptop would do she thought of tomelson just outside her door a guy like that would have some way to connect to the internet im going to need a minute then as she turned toward the door she noticed the folded advertiser that stood up on its own alongside the withered rose that was trying its best to look fresh nintendo ondemand movies web access from your tv she practically tore the doors off the armoire a wireless keyboard sat atop the television two elaborate joysticks on the shelf to the right their wires tangled a duplicate advertiser sat atop the tv she switched on the tv it took too long to warm up finally a menu appeared and sure enough internet access was there on the menu im on she said less than a minute later whats the url and password you understand miller said with great reserve that once we do this a window is going to appear on his screen we cant predict how hell react no firewall she said handing him his own earlier argument that has to be significant of course it is he agreed each building the others confidence she asked miller to give her another minute and called larson using the hotel phone but the call went straight to voice mail he either had the phone shut offdoubtfulor hed moved out of cellular service range her maternal fears decided it for her okay lets do it she said sounding excited himself miller dictated the specifics and she wrote them down she worked the keyboard and a moment later a small window appeared in the center of her browser ive got it again theres no gentle way to do this miller warned once i patch you in youre just going to show up on his screen uninvited what he does with you at that point is anybodys guess likely hell kill that window and log off the grid and thats the last well see of him hell talk to me she sensed her childs fate at the end of her fingertips she felt torn about doing this before contacting larson if she succeeded they both would celebrate if she failed he would never forgive her and she would never forgive herself are you ready ready if hes using sniffersspywarehe already knows ive accessed his port but he hasnt broken the connection he may already have both of our ip addresses lets start now and get this done quickly she took one more furtive glance toward the door go ahead she said put me on his screen chapter thirtysix larson slipped a photograph of markowitz onto the hotel bar and left it there briefly larson returned the photo to his pocket and said the sand dollar then the only two ive seen from the sand dollar montgomery said without missing a beat are city types that dont belong here they come and go this time of night or later you dont see them outside during the day they order lunch and dinner delivered from here were the only game in town two of them yeah but the meals are for three so maybe its that guy he said pointing to larsons jacket kid food or adult food adult far as i know do you happen to cover the residences as well im all there is for island security if thats what youre asking so yeah when residents vacate a premise they slip me a little something and i keep an eye on it thats all vacationing teens are the biggest concern the closest thing we get to a crime here is what we call a dwidrunk while intoxicated he lifted his glass and sucked down a fair amount we go about ninety percent occupancy christmas to easter were what you might call inbred i see the occasional pissedoff spouse armed with a golf club or tennis racquet out for revenge high crime in my five years weve had a couple broken noses unlimited in flagrante delicto and maybe a dozen shattered egos and thats about it sounds nice for you it pays its steady they got good health care and a pension though i wont stay long enough to qualify over half the year we go down to a maintenance level of about twenty percent occupancy its a ghost island with an open bar and thats fine with me he hoisted the gin again and worked to below the quickly melting ice cubes to absent friends he repeated is there a dinner order placed for tonight montgomery blinked his rheumy eyes a couple of times larson pushed what remained of the rum away for the bartender to clear despite the beauty of the place this was exactly where he did not want to end up twenty years down the road standing order every lunch every dinner they call in to check the specials can you check for me montgomery didnt look pleased but he climbed off the bar stool and disappeared through a door to the kitchen emerging a few minutes later he saddled back up if youre fucking around with me montgomery said id prefer you didnt im not the order for three dinners was cut back to two not ten minutes ago but i suppose you already knew that whats going on here deputy larson had not known anything of the sort but did nothing to correct the mans opinion how exactly do i get to the sand dollar south end of the island he pointed eyetalian family owns it name of valenti but mostly its their guests that use it there are a couple homes down there all of em pretty much off by themselves you didnt answer my question montgomery said about what hes done why a us marshals interested deputy marshal larson corrected and no i didnt tell you hey i can keep it to myself im sure you can larson said if one of them left the island would we have any way to know it montgomery didnt answer at least not outright instead he signaled the bartender who delivered a phone to him he dialed a threedigit number and waited for an answer on the other end charlie he said not bothering to introduce himself is the valentis boat in or out he paused and listened into the receiver nodded his head and said what just a couple minutes ago am i right paused again thought so he hung up pushed the phone away and worked on his drink one of your guys took the boat out not five minutes ago hence the changed dinner order larson checked his cell phone no reception he made change with the bartender and used the hotels only pay phone to call tommy tomelson but got voice mail he tried hopes phone next and got a busy circuit the recorded voice told him to try later when larson returned to the bar montgomery was leaning back and drawing a pattern on the sweating glass with a stubby finger larson complained about the cell phone service on the island its hitandmiss over there montgomery admitted theres one carrier thats better than the others but for the life of me i dont remember which one it is how soon are those meals being delivered a tanned older woman with the stretched skin of too many face lifts eyed larson over a clear cocktail he wondered what it said about him when seventyyearolds were making eyes at him he smiled awkwardly back at her every night seven oclock he checked his watch you got ten minutes to kill larson didnt appreciate the terminology whos delivering probably orlando tonight dont tell him anything about this we want the delivery to go just as it does any other night got it montgomery said south end of the beach theres a road to your right follow it to the end the sand dollar is second on the left its marked you want my cart ill walk orlando ll drive a cart down there a couple minutes before seven the old guy said make sure hes gone before you do anything kay hes a good kid he doesnt need any trouble they shook hands and larson was gone chapter thirtyseven dr markowitz who is asking worried her actions could cost pennys life hope wondered what shed gotten herself into as she debated how to answer that query her fingers hovered over the keys finally she typed a mother the romeros have taken my daughter i need your help no i cannot help you you left the port open on purpose yes so you want help so do i is my daughter there with you no you must help me the line remained blank the cursor blinking like a winking eye they took my grandson adam if my daughterher familysays anything they threatened to kill him rescue my grandson and i will do anything hope stared at the flashing cursor on her screen her fingers suddenly frozen his answer was so unexpected she wasnt sure what to do finally she wrote the only thing she could think to write where is my daughter the question sat on the screen the cursor blinking she waited for his line of text to come beneath hers follow the email as she lifted her hands to the keyboard the dialogue box suddenly disappeared at first she thought it was a malfunction with miller still on the line she said what just happened terminated she heard the furious clicking of a keyboard from his end miller reported then just as quickly oh shit he blurted it out like a man unaccustomed to swearing they just pinged you what shut off your machine lose the connection right now hope stood from the edge of the bed the keyboard spilling from her lap and crashing to the carpet she lunged for the television remote left on the small circular table by the windows she pushed buttons but nothing happened only to realize she had the remote aimed backwards she turned it around hit menu and worked through the choices when she hit return to live tv an episode of seinfeld appeared dr miller she inquired back on the phone now they pinged you do you understand follow the email she said repeating what shed read the port had to be open you see unsecured to do this he seemed to be talking to himself apologizing by pinging you they went straight back to whatever machine youre using understand there was nothing i could do about it what email is he talking about she repeated that ping will return a unique id for you she thought of larson theyll be under arrest before they can do anything about it we dont know that yes we do actually now calm down and think she told him she was close to penny nowshe could feel it we need to concentrate on what he told us follow the email can you trace any email he may have sent through your network ive put you in danger she pulled the phone away from her face and took a deep breath then resumed doctor i need you to concentrate chapter thirtyeight lizards scampered noisily through the brittle dead leaves amid the overgrown tangle on both sides of the lane dusk had ridden away while larson had shared drinks with montgomery the sky retained a smoky blue haze as a few determined stars struggled through rum pulsed inside him competing with adrenaline and the lingering effects of the espresso he longed for backup but hed already made that choice despite what hed let hope think he doubted hed find penny with markowitz the romeros were too smart to lump together their assets but markowitz remained a possible linka lead worth followingand larson was intent on making that connection he moved off the narrow road of sand and crushed shell and ducked into the tangle of jungle plants the ground was soft here and spongy beneath his feet osprey the house sign announced above the front door no lights on no electric cart out front the sand in front of the home was cratered with water marks from heavy rain undisturbed by either wheels or footprints and suggesting the osprey stood empty larson carefully picked his way through the undergrowth coming up on the north side of what from montgomery s directions was the sand dollar constructed on stilts to survive a storm surge the first floor of these homes stood twelve feet above sea level larson would have to climb either the front or back stairs to get any kind of look inside caged in by whitepainted lattice fencing that surrounded the groundlevel carport a crusty golfcart charger sat on the sand its dial glowing wires like sleeping snakes the cart itself was missing driven down to the marinalarson thoughtsupporting what montgomery had told him one of the three had taken off unexpectedly alongside a rustbrown propane tank two airconditioning units rumbled and a pair of vinyl garbage cans overflowed with trash above the loud drone of the air conditioner larson heard hurried footsteps overhead someone going up and down stairs shouting although too muted to make out the words what if the other man had not left the island but instead was bringing the valentis boat around in order to load up and evacuate the professor what if millers electronic probing had somehow been detected or what if markowitzs work was complete laena now fully decrypted what if markowitz himself was expected at the upcoming mob meeting a room light glowed from the first floor larson reached down and touched the butt of his glock but did not arm himself for the next ten minutes he patiently awaited delivery of dinner from the inn his ears whined the air smelled sour everything on this island was rotting at a different pace a motor grumbled at a distance and larson thought hed been right about the evacuation plan but as it grew louder it sounded more like a plane and then all at once a seaplane flew past low to the water lights flashing not thirty yards away larson took advantage of the noise and distraction to climb the back steps to the sand dollar there his fears and his theory were confirmed as he nearly tripped over two rollerboard suitcases and a cardboard box stacked outside at the top of the stairs through a kitchen door that was primarily glass he saw the kitchen countertops in disarray glass and plastic bottles of every variety from peanut butter to cranberry juice some empty some not all lined up on a center island like soldiers fingerprints he realized any surface capable of carrying a fingerprint had been brought out of the cupboards and sequestered wiped down no doubt close by now the seaplanes engines groaned in bursts the aircraft had landed and was taxiing its engines finally wound down and fell silent larson had seen a long dock off the crescent beach and believed the seaplane likely had tied up there at that instant a golf carts dim headlights broke the darkness of the lane the vehicle motored silently up to the front of the sand dollar and a college kid climbed out and carried a tray up the front stairs larson heard the bell chime through the walls and waited first for the sound of feet approaching a mans back appeared heading away from larson down a peach and turquoise hallway toward the front door with the mans back to him larson stepped around the luggage to the kitchen door and tried the knob it turned he pushed through and stepped inside working to shut the door soundlessly behind himself two careful steps took him deeper into the kitchen and away from any line of sight from the front door he connected the seaplane to the packed bags out on the porch markowitzs handlers were moving him he slipped quietly into a small dining room a large mirror was centered on the longest wall and held in a seashell frame in the mirrors reflection larson saw the man at the door in profile as he tipped the college kid accepted the tray of food and then closing the door set the tray on the floor he turned away from it showing no intention of eating it larson heard the mans quick ascent of the stairs and his arrival on the second floor get it done the man hollered what the fuck is taking you so long its on its way now came another mans strong voice older perhaps defiant its a large file several minutes at least just pack or whatever dont rush me markowitz theyre here now the younger voice said just landed theyll be down here any minute to pick up our stuff hurry it up i said its on its way the old man replied theres nothing i can do about transmission speed larson heard the distinctive clicking of furious typing at a keyboard its on its way was that laena he referred to transmission speed where and to whom seeing no other choice but to make his move larson withdrew his weapon and rounded the corner into the hallway he slipped past the smells of a fish dinner and edged toward the staircase that rose to the second floor he took his first tentative step his weapon aimed straight up the tunnel toward the twopossibly threearguing men heard but not yet seen chapter thirtynine tommy tomelson let himself into the hotel room with his own electronic key card he was sweating a sour bitter odor coming from him as he turned and both locked and barred the door he clutched a maids blackandwhite uniform under his left arm extending the dress to her he instructed put this on and hurry she stepped toward the bathroom but tomelson blocked her advance with an outstretched arm no need to undress he said besides i dont want you trapped in there he pointed first to the drawn blinds then to the door behind him windows and the door quick egress he turned his back to give her privacy facing the door keep your clothes on just get the dress on over them whats the hurry tomelsons eyes said it all someones here a guy at the front desk asked some questions he told her no idea how he found us so fast hope glanced back at the television for the past fortyfive minutes shed been agonizing over what to do before running she wanted larson back she wanted miller to call with more information about the email markowitz had mentioned tomelson said im not taking any chances she considered explaining what shed done but ate her words she tried to pull her pants up on her calves but it was no use the pant legs would stick out from beneath the dress she inspected the garment unzipped it and pulled it on over her head the top of the dress hid her shirt but its skirt with a mock apron sewn in place stopped at her knees she reached up under the dress and kicking off her shoes unfastened her pants and slipped them off stepping out of them tomelson located a hotel laundry bag in the closet and handed it to her she put the pants into this bag there was music playing somewhere nearby childrens voices shouting trick or treat only a few days ago she and penny had had such plans for this evening that recollection overpowered her the shoes are wrong she said looking down brown slipons with a black uniform tomelson didnt dignify that with a comment instead he said youll go calmly down the hall use the stairs youll leave out the back of the hotel by the putting green head down the bike path its crazy out there because of halloween find someplace nice and public when you do call me he scratched out a phone number tore off the corner of the magazine hed written it on and passed it to her his hand was shaking either from alcohol or nerves hope pocketed the number in the front of her maids apron behind tomelson the door kicked in and she felt the thunder of shots fired hope dived to the floor so dizzy with fear she couldnt see chapter forty larson was halfway up the stairs when all the shouting stopped the sudden change froze him he became acutely aware of the bigbreasted whiteporcelain mermaid figurine on a small table at the top of the stairs she seemed to be looking right at him laughing then ever so slightly the mermaid rocked side to side a nearly imperceptible movement the flooring had moved and with it the table and with it the figurine someone up there was moving toward the stairs all these realizations collided in larson at the same instant combining to loosen his knees and move the barrel of his glock slightly to his left he crouched and raised the weapon a man appeared at the top of the stairs already firing larson squeezed off two shots and then intentionally slipped his toes off the stair tread sliding backward and down the stairs toward cover white plaster from exploding sheetrock filled the air like smoke and fell like snow larsons third shot aimed at the belly took away most of the mans knee and spun him around like a dancer hit the man fired off three more rounds lost to the walls larson reached the bottom of the stairs and stopped moving his arm steady he fired again but the man was turned his profile reduced the porcelain figurine erupted off the table into a thousand floating shards a splash of flesh erupted out of the shooters back he buckled forward and collapsed then the top stair splintered as did the fifth stair down larson had not fired either of those shots montgomery had given him the wrong head count a younger man appeared at the top of the stairs a black semiautomatic gripped in both hands arms extended eyes squinted nearly shut early early twenties still with bad acne freckles reddish hair he looked like an altar boy not a killer fired a gun like one as well hed shot the other oneaccidentally no doubtwhile wildly running through a full magazine his shots continued down the stairs wood and carpet jumping debris flying larson dropped him with single round a gutshot that staggered him back and pushed him to sitting against the wall by the table where the figurine had been he stared straight ahead as he slumped to the side and fell still larson moved into the downstairs hall for cover dr markowitz he shouted when hed regained his breath us marshal hello dr markowitz im coming upstairs hands on your head knees on the floor or i will shoot dr markowitz he worked his way slowly up the stairs his attention committed to the two on the top landing wondering if either of them had enough left in their tanks to extend the firefight two steps later he felt fairly certain the younger guy was dead and a sense of outright anger flooded him for hed felt compelled to defend himself and the kid had no sense of guns whatsoever the first one the one now folded forward in a pose of contrite prayer had been gutshot and was losing blood badly he was unconscious though somehow balanced and stuck in this position larson reached the landing kicked the weapons away one tumbled downstairs clattering as it landed he glanced around for a phone perhaps they could medevac this one to the mainland in searching for the phone larson spotted markowitz recognizing him even from the back he shouted to him dr markowitz hands where i can see them please it was only then that larson noticed the small trickle of red below the mans curly white hair he recalled the first shooters wild shots as larson had taken out his knee the sound of bullets penetrating walls one of those bullets had found markowitz dr markowitz the old man still had his fingers on the keyboard but they werent moving he was dead as well whatever progress hed made in decrypting laena remained to be determined larson quickly but thoroughly searched the house closet by closet room by room in search of penny he looked for clues of the girls presence in the food stocked the laundry washed bath toys beach toys anything he could think ofbut found no indication of a child he returned upstairs to markowitz hoping for a disk or storage device but was faced with only the laptop computer beneath the mans hands larson disconnected the laptop and its power supply and took them with him there would be hell to pay for leaving a shootingbut to remain behind and suffer through a day of statements and inquiry was unthinkable as he stole through the night toward the marina larson called montgomery at the useppa inn and told him to call every law enforcement agency he could and an air ambulance larson left behind the carnage but not its aftershock for along with markowitz larson realized hed lost his connection to the romeros and with it his best and perhaps only chance of finding penny alive chapter fortyone having slept only two hours in the past twentyfour jimmy oyer rose from his bunk at the back of the peterbilt with the sour aftertaste of modafinil in his dry mouth and a raging temper bulging at his temples what the fuck he screamed at whoever was banging on the drivers side window he cleared his eyes squinted and searched for his glasses when he spotted the silver badge he mumbled oh fuck it and climbed down and over the front seats to unlock and open the door cops a fist pounded on the window for a second time hold your horses he mumbled collecting himself he tried to think what hed done wrong if anything there was that whore in the trailer park outside of omaha but hed left her with an extra fifty after playing a little rough and shed told him that put things right enough he fought against his clouded head what kind of badge had that been he hadnt gotten a good look at the thing an interstate violation but hell hed stopped at every weigh station as required and theyd signed off on this loadwashers dryers dishwashers and stovetopsso what the hell could the problem be he snorted and swallowed to clear his throat found the lock and opened the door what is it the guy reached up at him incredibly quicklyhis hands like a point guards jimmy felt a line of heat on his exposed neck and clutched at it as he found it hard to breathe he sucked for air but it was his neck doing the breathing not his nose or mouth when he exhaled he sprayed a mist of blood onto the window and door hed been cut coughing he tried to call out but it just sprayed more red rain the cop was a little guy with dark skin a burned face pinched eyes and a threedayold beard he shoved jimmy back and into the cab with incredible strength jimmy carried a few extra pounds his being lifted like this up and over the seats and back onto the bunk shocked him he swung out with his right hand but the intruder grabbed him by the wristwith incredible strengthtwisted and turned in one sharp motion and jimmy heard something snap as he felt more pain than he knew his arm could suffer then he was being bent and rolled over and the little guy hogtied him with the wire from the cb radios microphone lying on his stomach like a rocking horse in his own cabs sleeper bed jimmy gasped wetly for air as he watched a pool of blood spread onto the bed pillow his blood from his neck as the guy left the cab jimmys lights were dimming he rocked and groaned but the pool beneath his head only widened with each passing second deep green and purple orbs formed at the edges of his eyesight like holding a camera wrong and putting a finger in front of the lens jimmy regretted the whoring regretted all the mistakes wanted nothing more than to be home with his wife the greenish purple crept in from the edges now nearly all he saw he felt the cab door open he heard the little guy straining with something for just a flicker of a second jimmy thought he saw a pretty little girl in the shotgun seat silver tape around her eyes a knotted rag in her mouth but maybe that was just dreaming about his own kids engulfed in sadness drowning in his own blood jimmy oyer succumbed to the sounds of vince gill on the fourhundredwatt stereo hed paid for himself chapter fortytwo larson swerved out of the way of some teenage trickortreaters as he drove the rental car around the bend in the road by the hotels golf course running the wipers to clear the windshield of sea spray that had collected in only a matter of hours the strobing blue and red emergency beacons caught his eye and filled the faces of dozens of onlookers many in costume hed picked up decent cell reception halfway across the bay neither hope nor tommy had answered their phones leaving him pushing tomelsons charter boat to warp speed stomach acid bubbled in his throat he saw himself as a murderous failure hed arrived with only noble intentions of saving his daughter protecting hope carving out a future for them seeing himself as part of that future but this he pulled the car over and went the rest of the way on foot clearing the front corner arriving at the hotels covered porch he was met with bedlam hed been gone a little shy of three hours he returned to a different world he realized already a busy halloween night the emergency lights had brought the locals out like moths fifty or more had gathered held back by the staff of college kids in their green golf shirts he found the dense florida night air as suffocating as st louis in august he tugged at his collar only to realize it wasnt the fabric constricting him he strung his federal shield around his neck by the wallets string it bounced against his chest his throat tight he cautioned himself not to give anything away practiced in the art of lying the identity of a witness to protect he crossed the porch for the first time bringing attention to himself you an older guy wearing a wrinkled khaki uniform called out his khaki shirt was buttoned incorrectly the collar opened beneath the loosened knot of black necktie he wore chief on the pinnedon nameplate he had the bone structure of a drill sergeant the look came complete with a buzz cut of gray hair and the requisite crooked nose but age had softened him considerably beers on the back patio hung from his jaw like saddlebags he held contempt in his flinty eyes barely containing a pissedoff attitude brought on by his night being ruined there were too many younger kids in the crowd spiderman catwoman power rangers larson swallowed dryly knowing you didnt drag the chief of police out of his house along with what had to be every emergency vehicle for a few miles for anything less than a crimesagainstpersons felony beyond the crowd filling gasparillas only access road larson saw bumpertobumper vehicles backed up more than fifty yards behind the stop sign at the crossroads among the trapped vehicles a news step van stuck out its ungainly antenna lying on its roof like a giant corkscrew sight of the news van told larson he was at least an hour behind whatever had happened here squinting at larsons shield the chief said come with me it was not an invitation vacationing the chief asked sarcastically noting larsons marshals service shield from behind the registration desk a pale nervous woman in a hotel uniform caught larsons eye she looked sick and larson quickly felt this way as well whats going on here larson asked i thought i was the one asking questions the chief made a halfassed effort to stop and shake hands while walking he squeezed too hard floyd waters the chief introduced himself you are visiting friends larson said i saw the cruisers the chief led the way blackandwhite photos hung on the hotel walls and spoke of another era white dresses and wooden golf clubs children in knee socks and bow ties the chief turned left at the top of the stairs where you out of washington larson found the lie easy hed made it often enough he had no desire to identify himself as fatf just now where do your friends live on the bay side id rather leave them out of it i bet you would the chief rudely pushed past one of his officers larson braced for the sight of her sprawled out on the floor he lowered his eyes unable to look medics stabilized the white guy and took him off island by ambulance one in the leg one in the lung the white guy the description echoed in larsons head tomelson the dead guy on the floor had pale mediterranean skin clearly not purebred enough for floyd waters hed taken a bullet under the chin that would have killed him instantly tommy had either fired from the hip or from the floor he say anything larson asked the one that lived unconscious when i seen him the chief answered the chief pointed a dull toe of a black shoe at tomelsons ninemillimeter beretta partially beneath the bed he said thats a fs military officers and federal law enforcement he looked up at larson and said dramatically im going to ask this once and only once did you know this white guy are you going to give me a name or should i recognize his piece the big man leaned in close apparently thinking he might intimidate larson the armoire doors hung open larson noticed the tvs remote on the bed and then to his surprise a computer keyboard upside down on the carpet larson scanned the room on the floor not two feet from the chiefs pant leg a hotel laundry bag hung partially open he recognized hopes pants as the ones hed bought for her at target had she been abducted fled he felt his breathing quicken larson needed to find a quick and believable way out of here he thought the dead man on the floor to be the missing markowitz guard the man had hurried to the marina barely an hour after hope had checked in did the romeros have someone on the staff of the hotel was there some other way they might have learned hope had checked in his eyes returned to the keyboard wondering what that had to do with anything rooms registered to a couple the chief said studying a piece of paper hed been handed by a patrolman is this something a us marshal might arrange he tried to engage larson in a staring contest but larson wouldnt give him that a marshal carrying a fs i carry a glock myself larson said he patted his side indicating the hidden weapon so does everyone on my squad and that squad is based in washington the laundry bag contains a pair of womens pants size four for playing into the stereotype waters didnt miss much larson said so where is she if were looking at abductionkidnappingthen im required to notify the bureau as are your guys it was the only card he could think to play the threat of federal involvement he hoped it might buy him an invitation to leave without further questioning the chief studied larson a moment with an unwavering eye judging by his breath the man had been party to a few nightcaps earlier in the evening whod you say your friends were larson hadnt said the kempers theyve got a pair of beautiful daughters larson added both married but things change i try to keep my toe in the door as long as its just your toe the chief replied thinking himself clever why dont you head back on over to your friends and wait for the morning paper might be better for everyone better for me larson said you got a card or something larson did have a card but it listed st louis as his office address ill write it down for you he stepped around a patrol officer who was serving as crime technician and found a magazine a corner of the back page had been torn off larson studied this a moment finding it of interest the inn was too classy a place for torn magazines to be lying around he scribbled out the main washington numberrotems numberon a subscription solicitation and handed it to waters youve got business cards right behind your shield the chief said pointing to larsons chest larson had forgotten hed hung his shield out and of course there were also cards in his id wallet he quickly said and id be happy to give you one if youre willing to spend the next three days in tallahassee going through debriefing i know who you are the chief said larson doubted he had a clue though many cops associated the marshals service with witness protection so it wasnt impossible that makes us even youre going to get a phone call some time later tonight tomorrow morning and youre going to want to talk with me call this number first before you make a mistake i dont take orders from you guys waters said then take some advice larson said no more he walked past the man and left the room wishing he could have taken hopes pants with him wondering if they offered him any clues to what had become of her larson hurried out the back of the hotel stopped in the middle of the practice putting green and turned to inspect the roof outside hopes windows wondering if he might see her cowering up there hidden in a shadow he did not plagued by concern he walked around the street side leaving the relative quiet of the back to return to the more noisy congregation at the front dismayed by the circus atmosphere and not seeing her anywhere he returned to the rental car only then did it occur to him to check his blackberrysilent for the past hour except for his failed outgoing callsonly to realize hed never turned the ringer back on the icons showed he had seven emails and two voice messages waiting behind the wheel now he called his voice mail hearing tomelsons voice was like stopping time larson its tommy listen theres someone nosing around here at the hotel and i dont like it im going to relocate the package in a little halloween costume of her own call me he deleted the message an automated womans voice said second message lars its me she sounded out of breath frightened somethings happened to your friend i mean it was horrible whatever you do dont go to the hotel im in a bar its a restaurant called temptation green and white across from a bike rental place ill stay here her voice paused he could feel her checking her watch or a clock an hour at most after that im not sure call me or come by she paused hurry to delete this message press seven to save it press nine to reply larson disconnected the call checked the blackberrys message area and saw the two missed calls the second of which had been made fifty minutes earlier when hed still been on tomelsons charter boat he kicked himself for having left the ringer off he called her back as he drove around the tiny village looking for the bike rental place or a green and white awning this time she answered they were barely into their conversation by the time he caught up to her outside the restaurant she climbed inside able to let down the front for the first time in hours she nearly collapsed its all my fault i blew it miller warned me they could trace me but i wanted to miller find somewhere to pull over weve got to talk larson drove straight to the public beach hope told him about her brief connection with markowitz through miller and millers detection of the electronic ping that quickly identified her she detailed tomelsons actions in the hotel room larson explained the shooting on useppa and the setback it dealt them he indicated the laptop computer at her feet and hope got to work as they talked his family should have told us about the grandson larson said that explains so much markowitz dead she mulled this over pennys life in the wind he would have kept a disk a backup of some sort i looked around didnt see anything patted him down thinking it might be a usb disk im looking for nothing so i took the laptop the list will be on the hard drive she had the computer running now though in and of itself that doesnt help us much it may help others larson wondered about a system that placed the innocent in hiding from killers who remained in open society the twisted logic in that and his own willing participation in its perpetuation now his flesh and blood was a part of it and this seemed to him penance for his failure to question the moral authority of such a practice hed so readily focused on hope and then penny that only now did the full importance of stopping the sale of laena hit him there were not simply tens or even hundreds of pennys out there but thousands many had hopefully heeded the alarm as hope had and were now well away from their homes harder to find hundreds thousands but even these still carried an assumed name and those names were on that list on credit cards checks bank accounts vehicle registrations school enrollments how many would have the wherewithal to drop all that like a stone how many of the thousands had never seen or heard the alarm how many were still at risk if youre the romeros larson speculated and youve hidden this old guy away on a remote island with virtually no access but therefore no escape route either what protections do you take to make sure someone like me doesnt walk away with the list she thought about it if im the one in charge id want to see daily progress and i dont want the only copy of that list in his possession exactly hope suddenly understood follow the email markowitz emailed the newest part of the decrypted list each morning her fingers were typing furiously now the light from the screen washed her face and youre not going to trust something as important as laena with a surrogate larson said not when its worth tens of millions of dollars its got to be emailed directly to you to the romeros follow the email she repeated her hands paused above the keyboard shit larson glanced over at her then back into the darkness of the beach you said there was a techie there with him thats how it looked larson told her a young guy nerdy i cant say for sure well this things clean she said slapping the laptop that guys job apparently was not only to monitor markowitzs progress but to wipe the files to reduce the chance of laena or those emails being lifted if someone like you did come along with her finger she drew a line in the condensation on the inside of the cars glass an old lighthouse at the end of the parking lot threw a dim beacon out to sea swiping their faces with each pass she disappeared from him between the pulses so were screwed no way to tell yet she said his emails arent on this machine he must have erased them as he went his mail is hosted on a serveranother way to reduce the security risk if the laptop was taken the deleted information may still be on here somewhere but it will take days weeks to drill down in and find it then we are screwed now wait she said as if talking to penny the emails would have gone through the same connection through the universitys grid millers network thats what markowitz was telling me about following the emails they leave a digital id at each phase of transmission theres no way to completely erase an email once its sent it sticks to every server and relay it touches so miller can help us larson started the car a sense of purpose finding him again he read the exchange between me and markowitz she turned her face into the sweep of white light my guess is a guy like him hes already on it chapter fortythree his right eye had not improved if anything it seemed to penny to have gotten worse he kept it covered most of the time and because of this whenever he turned his head to check the trucks driversside mirror he had no sight of the back berth no sight of her whatsoever they passed a sign welcoming them to colorado penny had discerned a pattern the monster which is what she called him ever since hed killed the poor man who owned this truck was tired and playing games with his left eye his one good eye in order to stay awake first he looked out the passenger window into the trucks righthand mirror then out the windshield then out the driversside mirror he returned his attention to the highway for another couple of minutes and then started the pattern all over again always the same hed put her onto the comfortable bed in the back ankles and wrists taped together but no gag for most of the day she appreciated having the gag off and didnt say a word knowing if she did hed put it back on hed dragged the dead man into some bushes alongside a deserted road well off the highway late late at night she tried her best to forget about that she now lay with her knees bent facing the front so she could see what he was doing where he was looking her nose was still thick with clotted blood badly bruised but not broken inch by inch she moved her knees up closer into her chest her sock and the broken shard of pottery nearly within reach now she slipped out the broken piece and gripped it tightly and sawed at the silver tape working only for those few seconds he eyed his outside mirror as the edge of the tape was cut it tore he had country music playing its sound covered the small sounds of the tape tearing as her ankles came free working her wrists free felt impossible twice she dropped the shard of pottery into the bloody sheets a jolt of panic flooding her until she came to realize hed all but forgotten about her he seemed occupied with staying awake and overcoming the pain in that eye she waited three more hours for him to pull over the digital clock in the trucks dashboard seeming slower than ever the expanse of elapsed time excruciating he never stopped at rest areas he peed or did his business in the woods along empty roads that hed sometimes take forever to find driving around on farm roads well off the highway until for one reason or another he settled on a place he left the truck and did his stuff first then returned to collect the tupperware pot he made her use while he watchedthe only time he removed the tape allowing her hands and legs to separate she never left the truck until now this time he glanced back at her on the bed said same program little one for that was what he called her ill do mine youll do yours and were out of here she nodded and groaned since she was now facing away from him for this too had become part of their routine he left she sat up and pushed aside the black curtain and watched him hurry into the rocks bearing a roll of toilet paper with two quick jerks she had the silver tape off her she couldnt believe the pain in her limbs from not moving she rolled and fell into the front seat slid beneath the enormous steering wheel and clicked open his drivers door she lowered herself and climbed down onto the pavement the fresh air the first thing she tasted but what now her plan all along had been to get free now that she was she had no idea what to do nothing but vast farm ground as far as the eye could see with nowhere to hide the only place to hide was the tangle of boulders and rock into which hed disappeared she saw snowcovered mountains in the distance but they had to be a million miles away there she spotted it a huge metal tube that ran under the road without a second thought she ran over to it and off the road and tucked herself into a crawl and scurried inside it was dry and sandy in the bottom and spiderwebs stuck to her face and hands as she pushed in farther now centered between the two large openings at either end she waited not knowing what else to do it seemed like forever before she heard the clap of the cab door open and close then open again then close heard his feet move this way and back that way again and she could sense he was searching the underside of the trucks trailer the monster did not call out for her and this surprised her most of all she waited to hear him drive off to look for her but instead she heard his feet approaching she heard him laughing chuckling to himself then he called out loudly you really think so a moment later closer yet you really think this will work you think i will let this happen little one is there even a remote chance i will let this happen there is not and the longer you hide from me the longer you go before your next meal you hear me this is your choice and youre making it so think about it another long pause he was closer still now his face appeared at the end of the long pipe in which she hid she shuddered and pulled into a ball he dared to smile at her were not so different you and me i like you penny began to cry chapter fortyfour larson lost most of the day to making arrangements dr miller had once again come through this time working through the night to follow markowitzs emails those emails all with encrypted attachments had been sent from useppa island to mountlake terrace washington north of seattle while the private jet was being refueled early in the afternoon on the outskirts of denver larson sat in a black leather chair in the passenger lounge speaking on the blackberrys cell phone he should have felt a pit in his stomach over the seven thousand dollars it cost for him and hope to fly charter from tampa to seattle if he was not reimbursed for his expenses over the past twentyfour hours it would take him a couple years to repay the home equity loan but with pennys life in the balance none of that mattered i tried rotem got his voice mail youre stuck with me he informed trill hampton where the fuck have you been hampton complained that mess out at the orchard house flattened us here larson knew the pall that hung over operations following the loss of a fellow deputy the double homicide must have been devastating and would have longlasting repercussions i dropped two of romeros men last night and one of them shot and killed markowitz in the process that was you he said as if this possibility had already been raised it was ugly i walkedhad toand i didnt report it ill pay for that the fibies are apeshit were a step ahead of everyone we as in you and the witness as in larson confirmed we havent determined how much of laena he decrypted but with this meeting called they must have most if not all of it how losing markowitz affects the romeros we dont know but in all probability it has sped things up for them weve traced markowitzs emails to an address north of seattle larson read the exact address another four hours or so well be on the ground there i need you to get the place under surveillance until i arrive use our guys if possible use local law only if you have to larson didnt love the idea of seattle s finest being part of the operation i want you and stubby with me rotem as co we converge on this place asap theres at least some chance the romeros have one or two children held hostagemarkowitzs grandson was nabbed about the time of his disappearance son of a bitch the kids are our top priority so this is not a crash raid you got that hamp no matter what we do not crash this place got it and no one goes in ahead of me kay larson read him the address provided by miller for a second time he said the three of usyou me stubbygo in after dark tonight well need full gear no swat guys ahead of us no crash team but well want them allwell want the fucking russian armyas backup if it comes to that the best guys we can assemble ive got it all down but you stubby and i are lead and if scrotum balks at that then you need to give me a headsup so i can work the alternatives dont leave me hanging you got it youre going to have to move if were going to do this tonight youre on a plane in the next two hours if rotems right about this meetingthis auctiontaking place tonight then this is our only window markowitzs grandson has lost his value weve got to act now so what are you doing keeping me on the phone hampton complained chapter fortyfive towering cedar lodgepole pine and douglas fir climbed the low hill behind katrina romero looking like ivy on a ruin the low pewter clouds broken into patchwork streamed overhead while the sunlight that pierced through felt summerwarm and sublime the breeze carried the smell of burning leaves and the cackle and chirp of chipmunk and squirrel competing to shore up their supplies before winter fixed its grip katrina rode the buckskin with the dusty white tail she wore a black riding jacket over a tailored white shirt with a dozen small motherofpearl buttons running down its front motheroftoiletseat an instrumentbuilder friend of philippes called the plastic substitution katrina held herself erect the cream riding pants stretched tight philippe romero by blood her husband ricardos uncle but in life a younger half brother stood below her looking up he was a smallish man in his late twenties with dark features and thoughtful eyes he glanced at the leather patch on the inside of her thigh rubbed smooth and polished by hours of her locked embrace with the saddle she leaned down and handed him the cdrom a small disk in a plastic jewel case this is the last one he said seriously katie i cant thank you enough whats wrong whys this the last and dont tell me nothing shed been burning these disks for him every day or two for the past three weeks you dont look well philippe we suffered a great loss he said not a lot of sleep last night for me but what we havethis last diskis more than enough for our needs he sensed a change in her then after tonight you wont need me to burn emails to disk no but i dont like the sound of that whats going on katrina why dont we ride together she asked looking to the woods beyond him do you still ride how long since we took a ride together im not sure ricardo would love that do you actually think he is capable of love stunned by the question especially directed at him philippe felt he had no choice but to watch as she tapped her heels and rode off rising and falling in that saddle timed perfectly as the horse trotted in such a suggestive way that philippe believed it had to be intentional stretching back over her shoulder she called to him red rock in half an hour the choice of that place as the rendezvous set the record straight he wasnt imagining any of this the thirty minutes passed quickly as he readied a gelding to ride left a few messages and made a few calls to buy him time he selected a circuitous route through the cedar forestpast the eighth green a half mile out the winifred trail and then offtrail several hundred yards south to a small outcropping of rock covered in red lichen theyd shared this as their secret place while growing up as teenagers the site of a comingofage sexual encounter that remained the most explicit and vivid sexual memory of his life a violent summer rain the two of them tucked into a small cave her shirt soaked through her nipples puckered and firm and inviting his fantasies as he now rode closer to that spot he recalled her crossing her arms and his own embarrassment at having been caught staring her sudden change of heart as she uncrossed them stood with that proud posture of hers and then disrobed right there in front of him no words no explanation never breaking eye contact with him her nakedness revealed only in his peripheral vision shed ordered him over to her come here or something like that leaving little doubt who was in control her sharp tan line from the point of her darkly tangled hairand so much of itto the sloping curve on her chest as teenagers they had kissed until his mouth burned and shed whispered for him to touch her and then miraculously had moved his hand to her breast so he might know what to do their one and only encounternot that he hadnt want to relive it she represented the sum of all good in this world and hed slowly driven her away with his need of her and then came ricardo and her in this same cavekatrina saying it was forced ricardo saying otherwise a child marriage as philippe arrived this time he found her with her back pressed up against a fir tree sheltered from a light drizzle their situation not so very different than all those years before a fact not lost on either of them she made no move to her mare apparently had no intention of taking that ride shed proposed he dismounted and tied off the gelding and ducked under the heavy branches to join her in the muted light the clouded light playing on her face he never felt entirely comfortable around her always on the edge of an apology so he said softly her eyes hardened and she said i saw the boy that wasnt supposed to happen it happened they thought he was sick they asked me to have a look they shouldnt have done that hed heard nothing about this how could you do such a thing kidnap a little boy little donnys age its not something to discuss he had no doubt how she would feel about the young girl now in paolos care of course it is you of all people im leaving she announced tonight during your meeting he had trouble catching his breath its the one time im guaranteed of ricardo of all of you being that distracted im taking callie and remy not tonight he begged yes tonight its perfect his full attention is on this meeting youve called but why he asked i cant let you do this not now this place is like a prison his men drive my children to school pick them up my only chance is tonight thats ridiculous you can come and go as you please he turned to go not needing this not with the children they never leave the children and tonight he had no time for this hed come here hoping to be seduced only to find himself betrayed ricardoalready unpredictable and dangerouswould be impossible if she left i overheard them theyre assigned to this meeting of yours this is my opportunity philippe my one decent chance and i intend to take it youre overreacting as if you know what hes like i have a fair idea believe me and there it was again that same unbuttoning of her blouse for a moment they were sixteen and seventeen again for a moment he couldnt think but then the shock of her believing she could buy his participation in willfully letting her go so revolted him that he took a step back to signal his refusal yet by the fifth button the first of the bluish patches appeared by the time she allowed her blouse to hang open the discoloring began beneath the stark bleached whiteness of her bra and spread down covering both sides of her unmistakable handprints across her ribs against my will she said its his way of punishing me i suppose some shrink will work it all out into neat little boxes but its not so neat and little when youre on the receiving end and im done im out of here he failed to speak the trouble with himwith both of youis that its all about the money how much is enough i ask ricky that and he cant answer me what good is the money if all it buys you is higher walls and more bodyguards its not the money thats a lie and you know it she buttoned the blouse and tucked in the tail her hand stuffed low into the crotch of her riding pants and despite himself he wanted to take her right there and thenno better than ricardo shed driven ricardo halfmad with her open contempt of him he wondered how he would have fared under such reproach so go he said the words tasting foul in his mouth her face brightened beneath the gloom of the tree i was thinking the back gate were you he realized she wouldnt have left him like this if she hadnt seen their hostage life is not without its irony he climbed back onto the horse already feeling a soreness in his ass his efforts to wrestlesome would say stealcontrol of the company from ricardo had largely been based on his fantasy of one day winning this woman back for himself now all for naught she was leaving with barely a goodbye if she hadnt needed something from him would she have lured him out here like this as he rode away he imagined her calling out to him imagined her laying herself down beneath that tree and opening herself to him that same wet warm pleasure hed tasted once he imagined her begging him to come away with her but in fact that sound was nothing but a bird or some other wild thing out there alone in the forest hungry for company contemplative mistrustful of all things foreign and new chapter fortysix the lateafternoon sky darkened with the threat of storm leaving ghosts and false images on the small blackandwhite television screen the tall wroughtiron fence supported every thirty feet by a column of rock and mortar contained the rolling swales of fairways the outofbounds populated with towering cedar white pine and hemlock the bleached sand traps surrounded the greens like neck pillows the black pavement of a road rolled out like a tongue through the columns that supported a heavy gate over which hung a swirl of metal fashioned in twisted curls forming an m over a solid line with a w reflected beneath it larson took his eyes off the television monitor he had parked a rental a half mile down the road from the puget sound energy truck they now occupied hampton had done his best to call ahead and find a federal strike force capable of immediate surveillance but in the end had settled for the seattle police larson checked his watch hampton and rotem would be landing at seatac any minute wireless cameras hope asked the seattle sergeant was dressed in pressed jeans and outrageous cowboy boots exactly used to be you wanted to watch a place you parked across the street now were threequarters of a mile away watching the tube the cop wore his long curly brown hair almost to his shoulders looking more like an icon from the s than one of seattle s finest a brown mustache overpowered his mouth and he had mediterranean eyes that looked deceptively sleepy he said of course theyve probably got cameras too watching that fence the fairways the various roads so what youve got yourself right here is a real kodak moment cameras watching cameras headlights from a passing car illuminated the far left of the four screens and then moved one to the next the compounds gate was seen in the third monitor where the vehicle passed the sign out front read meriden manor it looks like a country club she said but that sign makes it sound like something from the cotswolds larson didnt appreciate how these two hit it off so quickly to him it looked more like a fortress and sounded like something made up if the romeros are in there its news to us the sergeant told larson sorry ive already forgotten your name larson said maybe a little too intentionally lamoia the sergeant said this is billy and duke he added reintroducing the technician and the vans driver who sat behind larson facing out toward the road this meriden manor is a corporation if the romeros are in there maybe theyve changed their names or had a couple of mexican facelifts maybe theyve paid some people off to look the other way because we should have been all over that otherwise pennys in there hope stated lamoia looked over at her my daughter she explained larson cringed seeing clearly in lamoias surprised reaction that this was more information than hed been supplied is that so he gave larson a look its entirely speculative larson was quick to point out technically seattle police were here at the request of the justice department but those lines could get real fuzzy with a young girl captive and the smell of headlines in the air hope hit larson with a stinger of a look intended to hurt him but he knew what he was doing and looked right back at her condemning her for her honesty while begging her to let him handle the sergeant he didnt have any sense of the future beyond that he wanted to spend it with hope and penny if they would have him he hadnt given any thought to what shape that would take only its importance the connection with his daughter intense in spite of the fact theyd never met hed not even seen a photograph as hope never carried one in case she were ever caught or killed by the romeros its down as an assistedcare facility lamoia told them health care corporation weve got no record of ever having set foot in therespd im talking about we got a request in to king county but ill bet it comes back the same whoever they are whatever goes on in there its all theirs and theyve kept it nice and private that fits for the romeros yes it does and if we need your guys in there you give us probable cause and we can put ert inside does my daughter count as probable cause hope asked no larson answered pained to do so not until i get inside and confirm shes there lamoia explained to her hes federal right now theres some ausa working up papers to justify his snooping around for us its a different story there are bound to be people coming and going larson said thinking of the meeting id like to get herhe indicated hopecloser to the gate she was an eyewitness several years ago it may help us with probable cause if she can make a face hopes look of total confusion nearly wrecked things larson tried to quell her expression with one of his own a scornful drop of the brow and a hardening of the eyes yes it was a gross exaggerationa liebut he needed them out of this truck and closer to the estate thankfully she caught this and stopped herself from saying whatever it was shed had on the tip of her tongue lamoia instructed billy to reposition the camera that covered the gate the image moved as the cameramounted temporarily atop a telephone pole it appearedpanned to the left lamoia pointed out an area on the screen you should be able to make your way up into this ground cover by crossing the road right where we are and going it on foot through the woods maybe a quarter mile this direction just make sure you stop well short of where you might be seen he pointed again about here you know the drill yes i do larson knew lamoia might offer advice but would not try to stop him if a federal agent wanted to take a damn fool position lamoia was ready to allow him that mistake but not without a word of caution as it turned out if you decide to go in there without a call from the us attorneys officewell its clearly posted as private property without some kind of warrant that makes you the criminal not those assholes we get a call and we gotta come bust you not them so think about that for larson it was a matter of getting free ahead of rotems arrival of establishing that penny was captive and getting a firsthand look at the setup he stubblefield and hampton were going in there and he wanted a firsthand look not spectravision the woods were dense slow going deadfall and thornbushes caused them several detours as larson fought to maintain his sense of direction after ten minutes they arrived at a spot with a distant view of the gate larson hunkered down how are we going to get in there she whispered echoing his present thoughts the two of them were on their haunches with a view of the gate now he wished hed come alone that hed left her safely behind in the step van from within his coat pocket he removed her original cell phone and its battery hey she said recognizing it what are you doing im putting the battery back into it i can see that we have to consider another possibility the first possibility being maybe we werent as smart as we thought he told her clearly frustrating her with his obliqueness im thinking now we may have been suckered into that mess in florida that it all went horribly wrong for them but that markowitz not using a firewall was no mistake they wanted us to find him they wanted you to find them to lure you there what have they ever wanted you dead right listen he said answering her doubting expression its just conjecture but they were so quick to get over to the hotel and they only sent the one man im just saying there are a lot of things that dont add up perfectly so theyve lured us here she made it a statement im just saying they wouldnt mind if you walked through that gate pennys not in there she moaned is that what youre saying its all a trick to get to me i hope not but i cant rule it out indicating the siemens phone he said the point is in terms of psychology with guys like this you work their blind spots as much as possible you exploit their weaknesses you feed them what they want but not when or how they expect it youre losing me weve kept your phone off meaning they had no way to locate you he said clicking the battery in place and well keep it off until we want them knowing youre here at that point im convinced theyll try to track you down and kill you she laughed at that whose side are you on he placed the phone into the pocket of his black windbreaker waiting to activate it once its on it shouldnt take them long to know where you are at that point if pennys in there theyll want to reinforce her position or even attempt to move her she speculated and by doing so they reveal her to us she nodded understanding his thinking now and if they dont react as you want them to arent we seriously outnumbered i count five of us one of whoms a video technician and another a driver therere more than that larson assured her the radio tech had a list in front of him with seven call signshandleswritten out he keeps lamoia in radio contact with his teams i didnt catch that that could mean seven to fifteen or twenty of their guys around here someplace he speculated there are only two ways to do something like this you go in small and quiet or big and noisy if you go big you have to go very big and you obviously dont like that my squad is small but we work very fast hampton and stubblefield thats right so we wait for them her voice returned to anguish headlights larson reached out and placed a hand on her forearm she was unusually warm the shirt damp from the thick air the headlights were from a car on the inside of the compound it slowed as it approached the gate openedperhaps automatically perhaps notand a sedan pulled through turning out onto the road a highend mercedes fourdoor it stopped at a stop sign twenty yards to the right and then continued on when it was well out of earshot he tugged on her and whispered okay lets go she shook off his grip go where back to the van i want to stay here she protested this is the closest ive been to her im not leaving youre cold we stay here until your friends arrive im not going back to that van he stripped off his windbreaker and made her accept it it was heavy on the side with the phone when do we turn on the phone soon in a sudden burst of light the gatehouse and entrance were illuminated as a pair of overhead lights came on for the second time he noticed the ornate ironwork above the gate but this time it wasnt on a small tv monitor in the back of a stuffy van that smelled like a locker room his breath caught in a gasp as he picked up the significance of the m and the w encircled in an oval of twisted wrought iron he mumbled thinking aloud thats not a w its an inverted m meriden manor hope followed his line of sight and turned her attention to the logo as well yeah m he said and m sounding foolish meriden manor he made the fingers of both hands into ws and connected them yeah so she didnt see it he spread his fingers making what vaguely looked like a diamond like a bowtie the scar on the cutters forearm then she saw it a gleaming razors edge sparked across larsons memory he felt it like a clean cut down his spine i think weve got the right place chapter fortyseven philippe romero steered the sleek mercedes sedan onto the i southbound ramp and located the abandoned truck stop along a dark winding road that aimed west toward a seaside town that had once been a lumber port the truck stops back lot consisted of a pale claylike mud and deep potholes that looked to him like open wounds in the moonlit surface derelict gas pumps now nothing but sawedoff pipes protruding from the ground into hulks of rusting sheet metal rose like headstones from the ooze philippe pulled around back of the boardedup restaurant and minimart per instructions facing a rustedout dodge pickup truck and an eighteenwheeler with iowa plates he carried a beretta semiauto in the doors leather pouch a round chambered and ready to fire he had another weapon a meant for target practice tucked into the small of his back inside the black leather jacket a hunting knife warmed in his right sock he pulled alongside the tractortrailer and a moment later a male figure stepped out of the brokendown dodge paolo came toward him in the headlights he opened the door and climbed inside his face glowed blue in the light of the dashboard he smelled foul his face looked like hed bobbed for apples in a deep fat fryer you were smart to call philippe said we dont need a stolen eighteenwheeler on the property you want her in the trunk no put her in the backseat with the kiddy lock on were decent people paolo didnt move shes okay right yeah shes fine you havent done anything to her right paolo leveled his blisterencrusted eye at the driver im not going to hurt this kid you understand me you want that done youre going to have to ask someone else okay okay you can relax now well get you fed and cleaned up all right you smell like low tide and your face looks like youre still doing halloween i stay with the girl you do what i tell you to do philippe felt his hand slip toward the leather pouch it brushed the stock of the gun weve got a hell of a night ahead of us dont make trouble for me paolo youve done good keep it that way well get that face looked at thats got to hurt ive got pills get the girl philippe reached down to the dash and switched off the cars interior light so it would not come on when a door was opened and no names when shes in the car you got that paolo didnt answer he climbed out of the car shutting his door but then opening the back door a moment later philippe leaned over he felt the at his back put her behind me so you can keep an eye on her paolo shut that door and came around and opened the opposite door he moved heavily under the weight of great fatigue philippe put all the windows down to air it out it stank in there chapter fortyeight hope and larson crouched in the bushes less than twenty yards from meriden manors front gate as the headlights approached sit absolutely still larson hoped they were far enough back in the thicket not to be seen white skin showed up easily at night especially in a collage of green and black with their eyes now adjusted to the darkness it took several seconds for larson to establish it was the same black mercedes theyd seen leaving the estate less than twenty minutes earlier the car rolled toward the gate the drivers side toward them for a fleeting second just a momentary flash they saw a young girls profile through the rear side window hope heaved forward and offbalance and larson caught her and clapped his hand to her mouth to hold back the sobs that began involuntarily that profile had been pennys the car window went down as driver consulted the gate guard and larson committed the face behind the wheel to memory male late twenties short perhaps dark coloring roman nose the large black gates yawned open taillights quickly receding larson had to think fast he slapped his blackberry into her hand while peeling his windbreaker from her shoulder and slipping it on he zipped it containing his upper body in its black fabric in nearly the same motion he retrieved her original cell phone from the windbreakers pocket and switched it on hopes number had previously been callforwarded to the untraceable siemens hed supplied her he changed that now callforwarding that number to his own blackberry now in hopes possession he explained in a forced whisper one eye tracking those receding taillights cant wait for those guys if romero tries to call youand he may because ive just turned on your phoneyoull now get the call on my blackberry im taking both yours and the siemens he took the phone off her hip without asking with the blackberry you can send me text messages he showed her quickly how to do this though she cut off the demonstration i need to know whats going on out here make your way back to the van and keep me uptotheminute when i establish her location ill send for hamp and stubby he seized her by the shoulders unclear if shed heard anything hed said were going to do this he said strongly we both saw her in the car shes okay right he waited for her faint nod said okay and then he took off low and fast through the dense undergrowth whether a nine or eighteenhole golf course meriden manor covered far too much ground to be patrolled effectively for this reason larson worked his way quietly through the woods for well over a hundred yards past where hed seen the fence turn a sharp corner now he crossed the road and stayed low he entered the woods and cut an angle to intercept the fence he reached a chained gatespiked wrought ironused for dumping lawn and garden debris into the woods the gate offered a good chance to get into the compound but he was haunted by lamoias description of a kodak moment and feared a video camera watching the gate the fence was likely intended as much for keeping deer out as for blocking intruders he continued down the wall until spotting an overhanging limb he climbed the tree worked his way out the limb precariously and dropped over the other side lamoia had infected him with paranoia he imagined nightvision video and infrared trip wires set at waist height to avoid raccoons and dogs but to catch intruders he envisioned silent alarms and legions of security guards patrolling the grounds though in fact he didnt see any such boxes or wires running up trees or any evidence indicating any such equipment or personnel it was probably just fantasy with the romeros having called a meeting for some heavy hitters they would concentrate their manpower around wherever that meeting was scheduled to take place he began crawling hands and knees into the center of a fairway believing the wideopen grassy expanses the most difficult to electronically survey fairways were sprinkled even in rainy seattle and sprinklers would trip alarms as quickly as any person would the smart money put security sensorsif there were anyacross the cart paths and at intersections between holes he crawled on a hundred yards farther he arrived at what was marked as the eleventh tee the course had been cut out of forest stands of tall mature trees separated one fairway from the next minutes later he crested a small embankment peering over at the clubhouse an enormous tudor structure loomed close by built a hundred years earlier and standing amid a ring of towering pines this was clearly the original meriden manorperhaps imported from england beam by beam brick by brick he imagined it as a family home belonging to a lumber tycoon or shipping baron running away from it were more structures some private homes some looking more like companions to the manor house though built more recently it looked more like the campus of a private boarding school now that he had a closer look places like this went through a dozen such uses one owner to the next the romeros had bought themselves an enclave to his left one road stayed on the level and appeared to service the private homes another fell down and away from the manor house into the clutch of the dark woods he could imagine barns and maintenance sheds workshops and garages and buildings dedicated to equipment storage not five minutes later headlights appeared from the woods to his left what appeared to be the same mercedes hed seen at the gate climbed into view and parked in the manor houses porte cochere larson couldnt make out details well enough at this distance but two men climbed out no penny larson glanced quickly left down the hill penny had been dropped offor disposed of he broke into a run he would have to improvise chapter fortynine one of philippes guys hurried over to him at first philippe thought he intended to valet the mercedes around back but his face indicated otherwise what is it her phones up the markthe stevens woman her cell phone logged on to the pacwireless network a few minutes ago philippes face tightened it was too good to be true the timing couldnt be coincidental now after what three days he thought a second they know about the meeting theyre using this to try to distract us they dont want this meeting taking place he looked for what else it might mean do we have a fix the guard lowered his voice and spoke quickly the phone is transmitting from here on the compound philippe felt it as a blow to his chest eyes darting looking for an answer in all that darkness he muttered not possible impossible here here the man answered feeling obliged to say something philippes eyes landed on the tortured face of paolo the mans objections to the treatment of the girl rang loudly in his head oh shit he said under his breath he carefully instructed the guard to show paolo into the study and for him and one other to stand by once he had paolo inside philippe suppressed a rush of panic the oneeyed dog had betrayed him had carried her cell phone with him in order to lead the marshals to his doorstep he composed himself struck a solid confident expression and pose not wanting to reveal any of his suspicions he glanced around one last time peering into the darkness and strode inside chapter fifty crawling toward the fringe of woods that bordered the road descending from the manor house larson witnessed part of the impromptu meeting between the driver of the mercedes and a bodybuilder type he wondered if it had anything to do with him the brief flash of terror in the drivers eyes had felt good a moment later the driver spoke into his cell phone and within a few seconds two other men sped down this same hill at a run at great risk of being seen larson rose and cut through the woods and paralleled these two now confident that theyd been ordered to beef up pennys security a trap for hope and whomever she brought with her his shoes soaked through wet from the ground cover he caught a glint off the two black leather jackets as the road snaked gracefully down the long throat of the hill at the bottom of the decline the paved road crossed a noisy creek before rising again larson stopped short as he came across a formidable obstacle coursewooden walls with hanging ropes car tires lashed together and suspended over a sand pit a series of low stone walls a shooting range with standing targets it looked like something from an army boot camp he slipped through the course using it as cover keeping the two guards in sight as they approached a doublewide trailer home a floodlight came on triggered by a motion sensor the guards arrived at the top of a set of rawlumber steps and knocked larson drew closer careful now of each footfall the door was answered by a guy in a tshirt and black jeans larson saw the blue flicker of television light that in turn told him the windows were blacked out from the inside just like the farmhouse that alone told him he probably had found penny a sense of triumph and fear mixed in him as a cocktail he felt the first trickle of sweat catch up to him his mouth was dry he glanced at the face of the siemens wondering if hamp and stubby were on their way larson needed a look inside the doublewide but he didnt want to walk into their trap instead he needed to set one chapter fiftyone talk to me philippe said stepping through the studys door his back now covered by two men unseen behind him the room smelled richly of oiled leather and bookbinders gum three thousand volumes of rare books ran floor to ceiling encased in imported library shelving complete with airbubble glasspanel doors and brass fittings a single heriz covered the parquet flooring an antique globe and an englishmans partners desk faced a pair of worn leather chairs that dated back to american independence paolo occupied one of these chairs looking completely out of place a mutt among the pedigreed the light fixture four foggedglass orbs had been converted from gas to electricity at the turn of the twentieth century a land baron looking vaguely unhappy loomed large in an oil portrait that hung over a wroughtiron grated fireplace you said youd get me a doctor paolo said he delicately touched the skin near his eye then withdrew his hand philippe reached up under his coat and pulled the out from the small of his back it wasnt much of a weapon but it was loaded with live rounds and was accurate he remained out of reach of paolo knowing his fast reaction time he did not provoke him did not aim the gun directly at paolo but its presence said it all empty your pockets sure paolo confused but not about to object did as he was told he placed several credit cards and some bills and change on the edge of the desk the stub of a pencil a small pocket watch with a badly scratched face his cell phone behind your belt you said my pockets everything whatever paolo slipped the razor blade out from behind his belt and placed it on the desk he kept it within reach his eye on the gun in philippes lap show me the phone paolo took the phone off the desk it was a clamshell design not powered up its small screen dark this didnt fit with what philippe had just been told turn it on but paolo said i mean think about it if they have a lock on me theyll pull a location why risk that philippe reached forward and swiped the phone out of the mans hands knocking it across the room the battery came loose as the phone hit the floor when and where did they get to you what the fuck now philippe aimed the gun directly at him when and where how about who you needed a doctor philippe said i can understand that paolo turned the injured side of his face toward philippe does this look like ive seen a doctor whats going on here the more you stall the more you piss me off he made a point of the weapon never piss off the guy holding the gun paolo knew philippes inside jokes better than his teacher knew them ive had no contact with them you hear me none they did not turn me he said earnestly dont you get it all i want all i want more than anything is to do this job for you this woman she did this to me he touched his face again its my turn what did you do with her cell phone i never had her cell phone if i did shed be dead and id be offering it as proof philippe had trained the man well he showed no signs of breaking even under the threat of the gun let me help fill in some of the blanks paolo offered thats the idea he extended his arms are you going to do this or not philippe lowered the gun paolo might have hidden her cell phone in the mercedes so that it wouldnt be found on his person but a second explanation presented itself however improbable if its not a plant then its her shes here could you have been followed no way could the girl have signaled someone gotten word to someone impossible because if shes here you have to tell me how she found us you see philippe talked to himself working this out one of our guys could have given us up i suppose he answered paolos puzzled expression we suffered a setback last night in florida it was messy two of our guys and the professor the phone could be her and this marshal i suppose he considered this further might even be intentional on their part or just plain reckless wed be stupid not to find outto pass up the opportunity if thats what this is if shes on this property i owe her paolo said cut me in on this your face your eye can wait collect your things philippe said hurry paolo scooped his belongings off the desk and jammed them into his pockets all but the razor which he delicately returned to its hiding place behind his belt buckle philippes hand shook slightly as he returned the to the small of his back on this of all nights if shes stupid enough to show up at the house ill call you weve got it locked down tight for the meeting one marshal and a witness are not going to present much of a problem you back up the bunkhouse just in case this marshals luck holds out a little longer consider it done philippe debated calling off the auction but to do so would be a sign of weakness he had ten men ricardo another six to ten if possible they would sweep the property one more time before the meeting he could put off canceling until then if they caught and killed hope stevens in the processthe only remaining living witness who could give them all jail timehed have a major announcement with which to open the auction this might help him to cover that he had only a partial list eight hundred witnesses and their three thousand dependents and itd be a major public victory for him personally did you say something paolo stood at the door to the study had he he wasnt sure the bunkhouse he said then watched as paolo walked briskly away a man on a mission chapter fiftytwo larson moved before the doublewides motionsensitive lights switched off because after that if he approached the building the sensors would bring the lights back on although the windows were blacked out he couldnt rule out a visual or audible alert connected to the lights on the inside he worked around the near side of the building past four plastic trash cans some discarded truck tires and pieces of plywood used for target practice wedged between the trash cans were the cardboard and styrofoam from packaging that had contained a microwave oven the doublewide was a glorified shoebox with a flat roof that extended in short eaves on every side larson followed with his eyes a black wire that attached to a video splitter under the nearest eave next to the cable wire ran a power line extending from the same pole to crash through the door and attempt a rescue was not going to help anyone even if he reached pennydoubtfultheyd never make it off the property he had to get inside quietly and sneak off the property with a fiveyearold in tow possibly markowitzs grandson as well might as well throw in a tapdancing elephant where were stubby and hamp larson found a stout branch to use as a club preparing to carry out his developing plan he then crept to the back of the structure and placed his ear to the glass hearing only the low rumble of television and nothing more no small voices no kids crying the front floodlights clicked off but because of his continuing movement the back lights remained on he wondered if this gave him away he leaned the wooden club against the trunk of the tree nearest the structure and climbed quickly several of the evergreens stout branches hung over the buildings sloped roof larson reached five branches up and then worked his way out along the thickest of these to where he could make the transfer from tree to roof the back lights now went dark leaving larson literally out on a limb over the roof in the pitch black he could sense that the limb he stood on was taxed by his weight it sagged too low bent too far somewhere just below and to his left was the edge of the roof one last step was all he needed but if he jumped in the dark it would make for a loud landing slowly his eyes adjusted first geometric shapes then the branch the roof directly below the roofs edge larson slid his left foot out and stepped off on the roof now he moved like a ballerina toward the eave and lay on his stomach he reached under the eave and fished around until he found where the cable was attached he unscrewed the cable from the splitter but only partially removed it inside the television had either lost its picture or gone extremely fuzzy that would be significant larson knew protection work live by the tube die by the boob tube the darkness left nothing but shifting shapes and made the going difficult as he worked his way over the edge of the roof he squatted prepared to jump he could hear grumbling and bumps from inside he waited when the front floodlights popped on larson let himself drop to the carpet of spongy pine needles a male voice complained loudly to the others inside wheres the fucking cable again larson grabbed the club like a bat and stepped up to the plate chapter fiftythree delmonicos delivers hope read the name on the back of the panel truck her patience draining she stabbed the small keys on the blackberry spelling out caterer gate and sent the message to larson shed not returned to the van as lars had asked the next time she saw penny shed throw herself onto the road if necessary she was too close now to go sit with the boys while they played with her life shed been through too many months of such treatment that part of her life was over the panel truck was kept waiting while the gate guard dressed head to toe in black circled it finally arriving at the back he rolled open the back door and shined a flashlight inside hope was prepared for a team of military operatives to storm out take down the guard and open the gate instead the powerful flashlight beam found stacked plastic boxes collapsible tables flats with serving trays and bags of ice his inspection concluded the guard pulled the rolling door back down in his haste he did not secure it and as he rounded toward the gate the back door bounced open first a crack then a foot or more hope looked left and right nothing with penny inside the compound and this truck her best chance at getting inside she slipped out of the bushes used the truck to screen her from the gatehouse and sprinted across the road she reached the trucks partially open back door before the gate had fully opened chapter fiftyfour the guard rounded the corner looking up toward the eave straining to follow the thin black tv cable larson both hands gripping the broken stick like a louisville slugger stepped into the swing and put the mans unsuspecting forehead into the nosebleeds the guard fell on his back with a whomph of released air clearly unconscious before he landed larson considered tying him up gagging him but feared he had no time if he could bag all three guards then hed return to this one he rolled the man onto his side so he wouldnt drown in his own vomit and left him with no choice but to risk it he entered the glare and hurried up the wobbly front steps he thumped an elbow onto the door and said in a gruff intentionally muffled voice hey help me out here as the door came open he thrust the broken limb like a battering ram into the gut of the guard connecting just below the v of the rib cage he stepped inside past the one staggering back and clipped the skull of the next who at that moment had been kneeling in front of the tv his back to the door the one behind him went for a gun larson broke the mans wrist with the stick and as he cried out dimmed his lights by breaking his jaw the guards eyes rolled back into his head and he slumped out cold sweating profusely now larson surveyed the fallen he kicked the door shut and breathed for what felt like the first time he rounded up weapons and pocketed their magazines hed bought himself a few minutes at most the guard with the broken wrist moaned himself awake grabbing at his flapping hand larson raised the club above his head and lowered it like a camper going after a snake the shabby interior reeked of years of cigarettes and beer it reminded larson of a crappy college dorm lounge a formica galley kitchen offered a twoburner stovetop a microwave and a fridge under tube lighting the buildings modular design left the kitchen and living room at one end a bath and two other doors off a narrow hallway lit by an overhead fixture missing at least one bulb larsons heart remained in his throat as he carried the bloodied club with him down the hall the doors seemed to stretch farther away the more he walked he threw the first open club hoisted and ready two sets of bunk beds complete with sheets and wool pendletons signs of bachelor life ashtrays that needed emptying copies of mens magazines with cover shots of barebreasted starlets soiled laundry in a far corner looking like an animals nest clear he hurried to the second room threw this door open expecting either the fourth guard or the expectant eyes of the two kids another bunk room not dissimilar to the first no kids he tried to wrap his mind around all this the speed with which the two guards had fled the main lodge had convinced him theyd taken the bait of hopes phone coming online the most pressing thing now was to buy himself time to find the children he could bind and gag all three guards leave the one out back perhaps behind the trash bins the other two here in the bunkhouse he felt a rumble in his legs and knew it to be a vehicle he switched off all the interior lights and cracked open the front door in time to see only the back of a panel truck up at the top of the hill rounding the north corner of the lodge he couldnt make out its writing on the back from here he shut the door set down the club and grabbed for hopes mobile caterer gate party time or a trojan horse courtesy of rotem something was wrong hope should have been supplying him with more information than this where to go from here he spotted two rolls of silver duct tapefurther evidence of the kids or wishful thinking no matter he would put them to good use chapter fiftyfive what the fuck is this philippe watched the panel van disappear around the far corner of the lodge but his attention was elsewhere out into the night down the hill to the bunkhouse which he couldnt see from here paolo would reach the bunkhouse any minute philippe had the rest of his guards patrolling the manor representatives from the other families were due any time now all this should have made him feel more confident than he did but the marks cell phone coming alive while on this property did not sit well that had yet to be explained and was the most troubling of his concerns ricardo older than him by a year but technically his nephew answered from behind him jimmy nans decided to make a little contribution to your meeting i dont want his contribution philippe had never learned to feel comfortable around ricardo never had never would not the way to play host ricardo chided theyll set up upstairs then i dont want them anywhere near the meeting philippe decided to follow the van around the building and make sure his guys were on it where you going ricardo called out you got something going with katie philippe stopped in his tracks then decided that the worst response was any at all shes a nervous twitch cant stop moving around the house you know whats up with that katrina is miserable ricky philippe answered using a nickname ricardo loathed everyone around here knows that weve known it for a long long time but at least you dont have to worry about losing her hows that ricardo asked suddenly all the more curious because you never had her chapter fiftysix prostrate hope peered out of the back of the catering truck by the time it rounded the second corner of the lodge and descended down a small ramp she anticipated its coming to a full stop and slid out feet first as her shoes made contact she fell onto the pavement tucked into a ball and rolled an ugly back somersault she quickly came to her feet and stuffed herself into a cave of steel formed between two massive dumpsters the catering truck continued another thirty or forty feet its brakes squealing as it stopped odds were that penny was somewhere inside this building she heard a male voice first stupid shit then the rolling open of the trucks back door the driver angry at the gate guard for leaving it unlatched a smallish man not with the catering crew walked within inches of her and started shouting at people hope leaned back put her hand into something disgusting and had to bite her tongue to keep from groaning out loud the one barking orders explained that the caterers would be let inside the back door would be opened for them if caught anywhere in the building other than the basement or the firstfloor dining room they were told theyd spend the rest of the night in the truck under guard and could say goodbye to any tip and im a big tipper he said his voice fading into the building she wondered if she could pull off being part of the catering crew she picked out the voices of two women and a man all three having arrived in the truck she assumed the back door now open they went about unloading the truck hope sat up into a crouch brushed herself off and poised herself prepared to head to the back of the truck pick up a crate and act like she knew what she was doing she willed her feet to move but they remained frozen to the pavement terrified she collapsed and hunkered back down she couldnt do it it was then sitting there between the two dumpsters with only a wedge of visible landscape and sky in front of her looking out across an empty golf green where sprinklers made rain with random precision that she spotted a flicker of movement high in a tree at a great distance she saw a low stone pillar that supported the wroughtiron fence this tree was on the far side of that fence there another similar movement about twenty yards to the left of the other also high in a tree she stared and stared no more movement and then she understood hands trembling she removed the blackberry shielded it carefully before lighting up its screen and began typing chapter fiftyseven having taped and gagged the three guards larson finished with the unconscious one outside and moved across the road and higher up the hill in order to see three cars arriving in succession as larson finished binding the guard outside the headlights of arriving cars lit the treetops the light dancing and shifting as it advanced one crown to the next criminal royalty if rotems information were correct frustrated at having used up time and energy larson wondered where penny could be hidden a search of the trailer had yielded nothing he scrambled out from under some bushes and broke out onto an open fairway dividing his attention between several things at once the house the edges of the fairway the fairway itself the possibility of more guards people cameras dogs he caught movement well down the fairway and slightly to his left moving right to left he lay on the damp grass a lone dark figurefemale he thought judging by her walk moved quickly between two large white poolssand traps he realized he rose up slightly onto his hands and as he did so caught sight of a massive roof well out of bounds from the golf course a barn he added this up a woman not using any flashlight heading toward the barn nearing midnight eccentric at best secretive came to mind to check on sleeping children he wondered yet another car pulled up to the lodge another passenger dropped off that made five or six just in the past ten minutes then on the cart path not thirty feet away a mans silhouette larson angled his face away from the man to hide the white of his skin while he simultaneously hid his hands beneath him larson froze judging only by sound larson determined the man continued walking a few more yards larson braced for his own discovery plotting a course toward the woods katie the man called out larson saw that the woman in the distance stopped she seemed to turn but then moved on continuing down and out of sight toward the barn shit the man seemed to give up the soles of his shoes ground sand onto the cart path as he headed back toward the manor house at a brisk pace the substitute cell phone vibrated in his pocket larson rolled onto his hip to put it completely beneath him compressed and silent the footsteps stopped whos there the man called out toward larson but his mobile chirped and he answered it over the devices speakerphone a man announced the visitors have all arrived assignments everyone the mans footfalls faded as he headed away from larson and back toward the lodge larson scrambled a good forty yards and into some woods well concealed he withdrew the mobile reading the text message sent from his own phone men in trees police he found the message in some ways welcome but disturbing as well if she was in the police van shouldnt she know if these were police or not torn between the confusion of the message and his instincts that this woman hed just seen would lead him to penny he crept to the edge of the woods and then hurried after her toward the barn such a perfect place to hide a child he thought all little girls love horses and a few errant noises from a barn would not attract attention wouldnt surprise anybody chapter fiftyeight what have we got rotem asked the longhaired detective who sat at the console in the back of the nowcrowded puget sound energy truck the civilian billy operated the equipment the longhaired plainclothes homicide dick who had a wiseass disposition mustache and exoticskinned creamcolored cowboy boots clearly considered himself in charge rotem had his work cut out for him the man on the green nylon camp stool to hamptons left was the deputy special agent in charge a man by the name of forsyth he wore a business suit with a blue handkerchief in the breast pocket the heels of his polished oxfords showed a great deal of wear pronated he had a fairly good attitudeunlike the detectiveable to let rotem tug the reins the wheelman was an spd officer whose name rotem had missed he occupied the drivers seat on the other side of a blackout curtain that lay on hamptons back like a cloak there were two opposing consoles of electronics the men gathered around the four television monitors as if watching a sunday game birds aloft billy reported weve got two men in place with visual theyre looking over the wall down into the compound can we put them on speaker asked rotem with the flip of a few switches everyone in the van could not only hear the spoken words of the two emergency response team officers both seattle police both twenty feet up trees overlooking the compound but the fourth television monitor now carried fuzzy greenandwhite still images returned from the electronicassisted nightvision binoculars each man wore the officer described a quiet golf course with a main clubhouse beyond those in the van saw still images of two possibly three individuals offloading a panel truck it might be food an electronic voice reported copy that the other field officer said agreeing rotem doublechecked his watch a catering truck and five cars had entered the premises in the past fifteen minutes the information theyd gotten on the meetingthe auctionappeared good a small but necessary step forward the longhaired detective took a call on his mobile stripping the headset away to allow himself to hear he ended the call turned to rotem and reported plates on the third car come back a livery service with known oc ownership organized crime looking better what they were seeing fit what theyd been told an exclusive compound luxury cars and limos arriving the fact that there might be one or more child hostages onsite was the one wild card on rotems mind we still need probable cause the longhaired detective said in order for my guys to go in a license plate is not going to cut it agreed said forsyth lets work on that he looked over at rotem as if he might pull a rabbit out of his hat youve got a deputy inside the longhaired detective said has anyone tried calling him this slight to rotem and his operation did not go unnoticed we have hampton answered stubblefield groaned a complaint from the passenger seat on the other side of the blackout curtain he was far too big to fit into the back with the others hes not picking up his presence remains unconfirmed at this point rotem said he racked his brain for probable cause even a suspicion that might entitle him to appeal to the ausa for a phone warrant one of the two ert operatives checked in the detective a hand to his headphone informed rotem of the communication we got a set of high tension lines crossing the property he said ive forgotten your name sergeant rotem finally admitted he lifted an ear of the headset lamoia he said no sweat what about these power lines rotem asked highvoltage overheads crossing the property might be for irrigating the course thing about tension lines theyre wellhung a knowing smile curved under the mustache as in theyre strong enough to support an adult maletwo adult males to be more precise he added my guys go in suspended from skyjacksmotorized rubberwheeled pulleysso theres a bit of a noise factor hum of the motors and all but its not much skyjacks youve done this before ert learned the technique from search and rescue the idea is to be able to move people between existing buildings at high altitude urban warfare its homeland security shit weve used it for some surveillance as well the mans tone implied not all was told rotem resented the tease im sure youll enlighten us sergeant were somewhat pressed for time here youll have to go through the ausa to get the paperwork right so maybe that will make it different for you guys but weve had a ruling in washington state that the airspace above private property is not the propertys the catch here is that all power lines and all equipment relating to the transmission of power is the sole property of the power company in this case puget sound energy get it we dont violate any rights by using those tension lines rotem connected the threads of the sergeants logic youre saying if we get the power companys permission to use their lines were good to go forsyth caught on no one ever actually touches foot on the soil below those lines rotem met eyes with lamoia in the dim light of the glowing communications console lamoia grinned no trespass no probable cause requirement as long as you keep to surveillance how very creative of you it wasnt my idea but ill pass along your appreciation once youre in if youre lucky you use the surveillance to find probable cause and then youre really in providing you get lucky and happen to see something rotem wasnt complaining but it wasnt a gimme theres always that lamoia admitted but if they happen to see you its amazing what kind of felonies take place the bad guys never love to see swat guys dangling from their power lines that borders on entrapment rotem said but seeing how easily one thing might lead to another and win them their probable cause thats showbiz lamoia winked you want my guys to pull out the skyjacks just give the word word rotem said already dialing his cell phone to roust the assistant united states attorney in order to push for the power companys cooperation chapter fiftynine hunched low to the ground larson headed past the outofbounds markers and down the grassy slope toward the barn now fifty yards away the urgency of finding penny only increased as the prospect of an armed federal raid of the romeros meeting loomed things would likely get ugly and he didnt want penny caught in the crossfire this end of the golf course hosted the occasional fairway home it seemed possible the woman might have come from one of them perhaps nothing more than a pregnant mare or a sick horse explained her latenight visit in the dark but larson had convinced himself the barn was worth pursuing and there was no turning back below a set of windows lit up a tack room office or storage roomany one of which would work for sequestering a kidnapped child reaching the barn larson moved away from the glowing windows avoiding what service field instructors called the moth syndrome he held close to the barn wall moving quietly more interior lights switched on directly overhead the yellow glare spilling out and revealing to his right a thick stand of sixtyfoot evergreens larson passed an openended enclosure where bales of hay were stacked there was a pitchfork stabbed into one and for a moment he debated bringing it along he rounded the far corner and encountered two enormous twin barn doors a slice of bright light escaping he placed his eye to this crack and saw the womanquite the beautywalk quickly down the stable aisle toward him midtwenties well postured mediterranean or hispanic a brazen confidence in her dark eyes and pursed lips she stopped at a stall and slid its door open she stepped inside larson hurried now coming fully around the far side of the barn alert for guardsfor if penny was here there should be guardsbut saw none he also failed to spot video or security devices reaching the barns other end before rounding the corner he saw a trapezoid of light spread out onto a pad of pavers suggesting opened doors it was here that the horses were groomed and washed and saddled sheltered from the areas persistent rain by an enormous roof overhang he saw now that the first windows hed seen lit indeed belonged to a tack room still no guards no trap it doused his earlier optimism but then another thought horses meant riding trails even on a large estate like this the trails probably led off the property and into the surrounding woods this meant a safe means of escape for penny should he find her feeling hed blown it by following her here he peered down the stables welllit aisle determined to make something out of it what he lacked was information the strongbodied italian guy whod been driving the mercedes who was almost certainly the man whod come so close to him back on the fairway had shouted at this woman if indeed she proved to be katiehis wife sister associateit implied an intimacy between the two she could know something of value hed wasted too much time not to seize even this small opportunity most of the stall doors remained shut some with lead ropes hanging outside them a few stood open he ducked inside the first open one he found hid in the shadows with the potent but not unpleasant odor of manure and hay and horses enveloping him open stall by open stall larson moved closer to her was it possible that this woman was the guard that shed been caught off her post and been shouted at by the boss at once her whispering voice carried in the air ill miss you so much theyll treat you well i promise larson buoyed with hope riding a seesaw of emotions first failure then possibility pennys guard might be in the stall with her perhaps she was sick or needed an adult womans attention perhaps larson was closer to finding her than he thought he moved to a stall directly across from the one he believed shed entered he listened for the sound of a childs voice twice nearly convincing himself he heard it then silence two excruciating minutes of it he stole a look across the aisle through the wroughtiron bars saw nothing quietly he drew his weapon wondering if he was the reason for the sudden change the gun hung heavily in his hand he realized how tired he was he summoned a deep breath gripped the weapon in both hands and prepared to cross the aisle at that instant the stall door in front of him slid quickly and loudly shut a roar of steel wheels on tracks larson jumped back surprised by it by the time he recovered the door was now closed he heard the fading hurried patter of footfalls on the dirt aisle larson tugged on the door but it didnt move locked from the outside he stuffed the gun away hed been jailed she would signal the others he would have an army after him any chance of saving penny was lost he jumped up and pulled himself over the stalls eightfoot walls topped with ornamental ironwork up and over and gracelessly down larson crossed the aisle tore open the opposing stall door and faced a chestnut mare the woman had been saying goodbye to a horse he sprinted and first caught sight of her again outside the barn she had a good twenty yards on him and was a fast runner if he allowed her to reach the top of the hill it was over she glanced over her shoulder and he gained a step or two on her agile and quick on her feet she coughed as she cut left into the woods she slowed a step a sprinter not a marathoner larson closed on her chapter sixty faint cracks of light were all penny saw dust in the air like when her mom shook a bedsheet by a window little sparks of light like fireflies something cold and damp upon which she sat in this new prison the sweet smell of lumber mixed with other scents foreign to her and unpleasant sour tangy the taste of metal in the cool air where was she her ears rang and her toes felt numb which was to say they didnt feel at all she had to go potty and she was fiercely thirsty and stomachgrowling hungry afraid of the dark she shut her eyes against it finding her private darkness more tolerable than the blind darkness that faced her silence like a sponge soaking up any hint of life even the sound of her own breathing and then as she dared to open her eyes again dared to face that demon of darkness that had for so long made her shut her closet door before bed there in the swirling grays and formless blacks a shape slowly took form and she gasped she was not alone chapter sixtyone larson followed katie into the woods still running she gave away her location with the crunching of broken sticks and the thrashing of undergrowth larson cut an angle to intersect her route having been raised in a house that bordered nine acres of connecticut woods he effortlessly negotiated his way through the stands of pine and fir and cedar moving like a deer he sprang as he ran landing and rebounding moving far more quietly than his prey who crashed and banged her way more deeply into the thick she did not scream or call out suggesting to him that for whatever reason her visit to the barn was offlimits or there was someone here she feared more than a stranger running after her and that gave him the chills he bore down on her now able not only to hear her but finally glimpse her as a darkly moving shadow that strobed between trees paired now like rabbit and hound they darted through the trees the rare foam of gray light penetrating from the houses beyond larson caught a flash of skin as she looked back her face a reflector he could hear her panting as she ran larson pushed harder finding a sudden burst of energy he vaulted a pile of dead limbs again the woman glanced back never breaking her stride she looked behind a fraction of a second too long look out larson called out instinctively too late she collided with the trunk of a fir tree a great whoosh of escaped air as her chest impacted larson skidded to a stop mesmerized by the surreal effect of seeing a human body in motion so suddenly still and quiet her shoulders slumped as if unconscious yet she remained standing a grotesque gurgle arose from her a wet sucking sound mixed with escaping air struggling to catch his breath weapon in hand larson reached her and found her eyes open and blinking her right foot was angled down touching the bed of pine needles with the toe of her shoe she was weightless unsupported not standing and yet erect a stain crept out of her like something living and spread down her left side he holstered his weapon her mouth opened and shut but no sound came out in the limited light that reached into the forest she seemed cut into several long pieces another step forward and he saw it she had impaled herself on a stub of a broken branch that held to the tree like a dagger a jagged splintered sixinch blade of weathered wood the wet gurgling coincided with the slight rise and fall of her shoulders it had pierced her blouse cleaved her ribs and punctured her lung federal agent larson whispered simply to identify himself fear was their biggest enemy now she could live through this but she needed medical attention immediately im going to get you help do you understand her dark eyes moved slightly he realized that by helping her he would likely get himself caught perhaps killed penny would be lost for a moment he considered leaving her resentful that a stupid accidenther own damned faultwould cause him to lose everything but he could not pull himself away he slipped off his belt and withdrew his handkerchief from a back pocket in advance of grabbing her around the waist from behind lifting her slightly and pulling her off the stub she shuddered and fell into his arms and he laid her down on her back he tore open her blouse and mopped around finally finding the wound at her ribs he held his handkerchief there and used the belt to secure the handkerchief applying pressure okay he asked their faces only inches apart again her eyes moved vaguely in shock she was barely with him he would have left me she said hoarsely when the words came out of her mouth some blood did as well and larson felt himself flinch whomever she meant larson thought not no man would leave this woman theres a girl a little girl he said knowing that his chances were slim to none but clinging to hope perhaps he could pass something along to rotem or hampton before he was caught shes my daughter he said his throat constricting her mouth moved but he heard no words he scooped her up and carried her in his arms amazed by how small and light she was he navigated out of the woods carefully up the incline the dense forest giving way to the clipped grass of a fairway she grew heavier in the silence larson felt his legs and back straining a boy she said so breathlessly he thought he might have imagined it himself larson paused they have a boy she said he continued climbing reaching the crest and moving across the fairway no one approached him no one arrived to detain him a young boy he said thinking of what markowitz had written to hope her eyelids closed and openedher way of nodding where theyll kill you probably he said she shook her head and went silent where she managed to point out a mediumsized home that bordered the golf course one of the ones hed seen earlier her home clearly there would be a road on the far side of the house a car in the garage a way out for her she shut her eyes and grew much heavier shed passed out he walked through low bands of ground fog that had appeared in just the past few minutes the fog shifted like chimney smoke and swirled at his waist the air felt noticeably cooler his shoes and socks soaked through he reached the cart path and crossed it into her backyard he saw a swing set and a toy lawnrake and a wheelbarrow heaped with leaves she came awake in his arms risen from the dead leave me she muttered the porch a housekeeper he carried her to the back porch where a porch light shone okay youre here now tell me wheres the boy he stepped toward the porch doorbell he looked at her for a response before ringing it the bunkhouse she said its down the hill from the manor larson rang the bell then pivoted hearing footfalls approaching the door he had to leave and yet couldnt tear himself away until he was sure the doublewide katies eyelids fluttered and closed he heard the lock come off the door he ran chapter sixtytwo hopes maternal instincts soon drove her out of her hiding place and toward the back of the catering truck if she didnt get inside she told herself she had no chance of finding penny larsons blackberry buzzed yet againarea code st louisand again she ended the call to keep the device from vibrating and giving her away wedged between the dumpsters she was in no position to strike up a conversation had it been area code seattle any possibility of being the kidnappers she might have dared answer the two caterers came and went from the truck in roughly twominute intervals hope reached the back of the truck snagged the corner of a plastic cooler and carried it by its two handles bravely now and with great resolve she approached the buildings back door and thumped her foot against it knocking she knew the faces of both caterers from having observed them she was glad to see it was one of these women who opened the door for her hope explained herself they asked me to help you out she offered a perfunctory smile im on the wait staff here where to im donna alice hope supplied automatically we were told thered be six of you well im the first she said brightly the others will be along a stopwatch started in her head by the time someone determined they had seven waiters and waitresses not six she would have to be gone were setting up in the kitchen she was told hope pressed past the woman holding the door we were told it was black bottoms white tops hope noticed that donna had stuck to the uniform yeah ill change into my stuff after loadin midnight to two donna said you always work these hours we see it all here believe me hope answered the cooler growing heavy in her arms at least the pays right for you maybe these guys are real pricks about us keeping to the basement and the upstairs dining room hope completed having overheard this condition same old same old donna shut the door behind herself as she stepped outside hope hurried down the hall and followed a line of water drops like a mouse after crumbs she paused at the kitchen door an exit sign straight ahead a small elevatorno a dumbwaiterto the right of the kitchen door a set of stairs that beckoned her she stepped into the busy kitchen set down the cooler and wondered what came next chapter sixtythree the odessa room had once been a library and still retained the floortoceiling shelves of leatherbound books broken only by mahogany slabs bearing oil paintings under the warm glow of brass tube lights mounted above their frames for years it had doubled as a more intimate dining room for parties of less than thirty some time in the early s its recessed ceiling had been installed an elaborately engineered panel with curving sections that met in the very center surrounding an ovalshaped handpainted depiction of a fox hunt on its north wall was a marble mantel and its matching hearth a working fireplace the mantel was shored up by twin stone columns carved into which were two nude angels bearing baskets of wheat above their heads of flowing locks atop the mantel two silver candelabra their new candles unlit protected a dried arrangement of deepred roses wheat straw and burgundy fruit blossoms around the polished rectangular cherrytopped table sat ten men ranging from thirty to eighty and in every shade of skin african native american far eastern caucasian hispanic they represented reno sacramento los angeles oakland portland and points in between they were not unfamiliar to one another philippe at the head of the table brought the meeting to order he thanked them for coming reached into his black armani sport coat and withdrew a plastic jewel case containing a gold cdrom a computer disk capable of storing ten thousand documents the highest bidder takes home the entire list subsequent sales of the names of individual witnesses or groups of witnesses are at the discretion of the buyer a mexican who wore a collarless shirt open to a gold chain bearing a st christopher said my people tell me a general alarm was put out that most of the people on that list have fled by now and that may or may not be true philippe said but even so do you run every time you hear an alarm do you uproot your entire family this list includes everything there is to know about these people not just new identities but employment banking known associates it would take months years to regenerate all new data for these people whether they run or not theyre out there and theyre leaving trails to follow he paused swallowed once and said the bidding will start at ten million dollars a knock on the doorno cell phones no weapons were allowed in this roomand ricardo who sat to philippes left was summoned by one of the guards philippe considered ricardos departure carefully wondering what trick he might be playing he didnt want him outside this room where he couldnt see him as the door shut behind ricardo philippe heard whispers that included the words your wife fastmoving footsteps followed it was everything philippe could do to remain focused as he turned to face the group of raised hands do i hear fifteen he asked chapter sixtyfour the skyjacks operated as motorized trolleys a battery pack powering a hightorque motor with an oversize pulleywheel that ran atop the steel aviation cable supporting the four black highvoltage lines each of the two ert operatives hung suspended from one of the devices in a harness that featured quickrelease carabiners that allowed them to bail out onehanded and rappel via a weightbalanced recoil falling toward the ground if need be like frightened spiders as they entered the estates airspace each carrying a semiautomatic rifle slung around their shoulders they surveyed the property with highpower nightvision headsets with wireless technology that transmitted the digital images back to the command van the handsfree radios and earbuds allowed continuous communication between all parties you getting this flyswatter a pictures worth a thousand words lamoias voice came back to the dangling operative in the nightvisions eerie greenandblack viewed alternately between the vs of trees they saw a small parking lot crowded with luxury suvs town cars and two stretch limousines a cluster of darkly clad drivers and chauffeurs some of whom were smoking loitered by a door to the building we need more than a couple cars and chauffeurs lamoia told his two men keep looking at each pole the operatives were required to suspend themselves from the crossties and move the skyjack past the pole to the next length of cable such transfers consumed three to five minutes conducted with the utmost care to avoid being electrocuted offline announced the lead operative in a hushed whisper in the command van rotem had had his fill were not going to get anything out of this he announced to no one in particular give it time lamoia said our guys know what to look for when that meeting breaks up rotem said speculating we lose what were after he had yet to explain and never would the loss of laena by then we need legitimate reasons for stopping each and every one of those vehicles and thats not happening in this lifetime if this goes down as a win were going to have to take them as a group while theyre still in that meeting its a catered event lamoia reminded its not going to be over in a half hour theyre probably not even set up yet he said completing his argument give em a minute theres baggage hampton advised from his uncomfortable seat what about your guy inside lamoia asked thats unconfirmed rotem said but then hearing himself say this he ordered hampton to try larsons cell phone again muttering ive waited long enough ert officer peter milton suspended by a woven nylon climbingstrap from one of two wooden booms that supported four highvoltage electric lines was in the midst of transferring his skyjack to the next length of cable when he spotted a small stainlesssteel box screwed into the wooden pole and recognized it immediately hed moonlighted weekends for cablevision milton radioed his discovery to the command van and waited to see if lamoia understood its implications lamoia swiveled on the small stool and faced rotem you may need our help on this one marshal rotemstate law versus the feds and allbut my officer just stumbled upon the unexpected it seems someone in that compound is pirating their cable television television a black box lamoia explained unauthorized intercept of a coaxial cable it could be to steal highspeed internet or a television signal but state laws the same either way are we sure milton knows his stuff believe me if he says its a black box its a black box and i dont know about washington dc but in washington state thats a nobrainer for a searchandseizure to confirm and record the use of the unauthorized interception of radio or television transmission he quoted more to your favor is that our guys typically make such raids evening or nighttimelike right nowwhen people are in their homes its not going to ruffle any judges feathers to cut us the paper this time of night lets make the call rotem said with reservation lamoia could see through to his concern as co im free to solicit the assistance of any lawenforcement personnel that in my judgment will better protect my field personnel a couple federal marshals joining up wont raise many eyebrows weve got that license plate that link to oc to give us good enough reason to go in hot rotem had his phone out he told hampton to get word to larson to keep his head down because they were coming in ive tried him like ten times hampton said well try him again chapter sixtyfive hope spotted a tray holding ten empty water glasses and two pitchers with ice scooping it up she headed into the hall and turned left toward the stairs she climbed quickly arriving into the dizzying smell of oiled wood leather and the lingering sweetness of cigar and pipe tobacco golf championship plaques lined the walls some dating back to yellowed blackandwhite head shots of officiouslooking men in blazers and club ties filled in the gaps between the plaques she forced herself to walk slowly with all the activity in the basement and the dining room being on the first floor she assumed penny was being kept somewhere here the first two doors she encountered were closed she dared not open them the third was open a crack she peered into an empty secretarys station the anteroom of an office the sound of male voices down the hall won her attention and drew her past two more doors the hall opened up then into a large trophy room with pennants hanging from the crown molding clubby with brown leather couches and overstuffed chairs chess sets and backgammon tables an armoire concealed a television hope cut across this room and into an opposing hallway where she came across a small window in a swinging door she peeked through and saw a narrow stairway she pushed through and climbed to the second floor knowingly outofbounds she hoped a simple excuse of being lost might get her by stopping at the landing she heard the elevators electronic groan peering out into this secondfloor hallway she saw the room doors were farther separated than on the ground floor bedrooms or billiards or card rooms perhaps the stairs continued up to her left she knew she was in dangerous territory the tray grew increasingly heavy for her out in the hallway she heard the spit of a radio intercom khakis brown sweater she didnt have to look down to realize she fit that description she set down the tray pushing it into the corner and quickly climbed to the third floor from below she heard a male voice hey i got a tray here glasses pitchers fresh ice if something was said back to this man hope didnt hear it she pushed through the door and stepped out into the thirdfloor hallway struck by the immediate smell of a hospital ward she wondered if meriden manor was serving as a retirement home for mobsters she darted past medical equipment convinced her pursuer was coming through that door behind her at any second the smell of old people intensified like a grandmothers house on a winter day with the windows shut tight through a partially open door she caught sight of a luxury suite of rooms and the back of a bald heada man wearing hospital pajamas not assisted living but assisted dying she thought penny might be locked up in any one of these suites held hostage in front of a color television with room service of ice cream sundaes and grilled cheese sandwiches how simple here to keep a young child placated and free of complaint burning with resentment hungry for her daughters freedom she retraced her steps trying each and every door all locked slots for key cards like hotels the meriden marriott she opened the first door without a lock albeit cautiously a storage room containing linens a pair of upright vacuum cleaners and two rolling buckets with a variety of string mops out of the corner of her eye she caught the door to the stairs swinging open reacting she ducked inside and pulled the door shut she collected herself into the corner crouching behind the pair of vacuum cleaners hunkered down a muffled male voice a guard on a radio checking room to room the complaint of the hallways parquet flooring presaged the doorknobs twisting hope ducked farther down her eyes trained to the floor head as low as she could manage the door opened the room flooding with light she could hear his breathing the light lessened as the door started to close the blackberry lit up and buzzed in her pocket she slapped a hand over it tried to squeeze the buttons through the fabric of her pants the vibration of the plastic continued the room lit up as the door was flung back open come out from there a tentative male voice ordered she heard a bucket kicked out of the way another crash extremely close to her do not move the voice demanded she looked up slowly just as the blackberry stopped buzzing head down she managed to get three numbers typed into the device quickly and hit send he was just a kid twenty twentytwo dark skin he held a gun aimed at her head the barrels small black circular hole staring at her like an unflinching eye chapter sixtysix after twenty minutes of watching the bunkhouse paolo saw something in the dirt by the far end of the structure only as he came up to him did he see it was one of his teamtodi they called him out cold paolo patted himself down looking for his phone only to remember philippe had stripped him of it in the study and hed gotten out of there without it he patted down todihe had a gun but that was all he untaped the injured man for all the good it would do paolo entered the bunkhouse with his razor gripped tightly in his right hand ready for a fight with his one good eye he saw two more men also hurt and unconscious tied up and stretched out on the floor he decided to clear the building he didnt need anyone coming up from behind him as he untied his buddies he moved like a wraith through the small corridor room to room his shadow bending as it followed finding each of the rooms empty he proceeded to where hed left the little girl he stood above the crawl space access door in the back closet of the back room a fabric loop protruded from the carpet the carpet had been cut perfectly to match the pattern paolo pulled on this lifting the trapdoor he stepped back anticipating a gunshot a cool wind wafted up through the crack nerves tingling he stepped forward prepared to jump hed practiced such tunnel raids in his training though hed never used the skills he counted down from three jumped into the dark space and rolled upon impact he crashed into a pony wall of lumber that braced the trailers central support beam with a vertical clearance of less than four feet he squatted on his haunches his razor held out in front of him he struggled to see clearly two low cots with sleeping bags the girl was awake sitting up eyes wide looking right at him the crawl space was as large as the bunkhouse itself framed in with plywood and blue foam insulation the floor consisted of dirt and rock several electrical boxes strung together with romex wiring ran from one porcelain light fixture to the next dividing the structure in half light from the hole seeped down just enough to see dimly corner to corner they were alone here the three of them how that was possible he wasnt sure had whoever had tied up the guards missed the trapdoor clunk a sound from above the trailers front door came softly shut though not softly enough paolo replaced the carpeted trapdoor from below sitting it into its frame he duckwalked over some plastic pipe and took up a position to afford him the greatest surprise he trained his one good eye toward a spot in the blackness the razor pressed tight between his fingers come and get it chapter sixtyseven bloodstained from his rescue of the woman larson had reached the far end of a darkened fairway with a partial view of the doublewide below the more he thought about it the numerous guards the isolation the more it made sense somehow hed missed where they held markowitzs grandson and if hed missed him then maybe hed missed penny too he reentered the bunkhouse his gun at the ready he had no time a woman being badly wounded on the property would sound the alarm no matter what she might tell others within minutes this bunkhouse would be swarming with guards as he passed the bound guards one looked conscious but he made no appeal why so complacent larson raised his weapon someone was here with him he moved stealthily and cleared two small bedrooms and a bath in a matter of a half minute or less arriving at the closed door to a room he recalled as a bunk room he tensed he counted down in his head and kicked the door open it rebounded off the thin hollow wall and he blocked it with his wet shoe he sighted down the gun finding every pattern in the room that worked against his expectation nearly squeezing off a round into what turned out to be a pillow angled awkwardly clear he moved toward the closet looked down and there it was a loop of fabric a crawl space a single guard sleeping in the bunk room could easily defend such a crawl space simple efficient practical larson bent and reached down for the fabric loop he could not only feel guards hurrying toward this bunkhouse but he also sensed at least one down this hole a man charged with defending the space until help arrived larson would be a target from the moment he entered ten fifteen seconds of precious time ticked off larson longing for a stun grenade he retreated and switched off the hallway light behind him evening the playing field by ushering the bunk room to pitch black he let his eyes adjust then he slipped his keychain penlight from his pocket hoping to use it as a diversion or decoy he held the penlight in his right hand along with his gun the glock he knew hed be fired upon the moment he jumped down in there he had no doubt of this and the stupidity of such an act briefly froze him but with no time and no options pennys survival on the linelarson dropped into darkness he landed awkwardly his gun smacking a metal pipe he tossed the penlight to his left as a distraction while rolling right no shots fired as he rolled his gun released its magazine into the gravel floor his thumb touched the guns metal the contact with the pipe had sprung and bent the magazines release switch he fumbled to locate the magazinewondering if the gun would accept it with the broken lever he had one round in the chamberone round he could count on the weak light showed a pair of collapsible cots and on them the blond head of a little girl penny a head of red hair popped up a boy sight of the two kids stole his attention as a figure sprang toward him from behind larson took the blow to his right wrist and the glock tumbled free fire sprang from that wrist and he realized hed been cut he recoiled cowered a flinching reflex to ward off the inevitable he kicked out with his bent right leg moving awkwardly because of the limited space blind luck connected that blow to the man coming after him both men fell away from each other larson smacked his head against the short stud wall the fourfoot limitation of the crawl space restricted movement to a squatting crouched shuffle for both men like crabs attacking each other as his opponent sat up recovering from the kick the penlights dim beam moved across his face revealing chemical welts that occluded his right eye larson knew the razor came next with his gun and its ejected magazine somewhere to his right larson started in that direction but his opponent skillfully anticipated the move and blocked it placing himself between larson and the cots he then lunged at larson with incomprehensible speed and sprang back out of reach just as quickly larsons left forearm went warm and stung in that split second hed been cut again another darting move like the flick of a frogs tongue larsons left leg was bleeding if he stood here any longer the cutter would pick him apart one quick cut after another larson would go down not from a single wound but the combination hed have his throat slit and hed bleed out in a crawl space where theyd bury him a few hours later perhaps penny and hope at his side a thought flickered through him the bad eye larson feinted to the mans righthis blind sidefreezing him and then dived toward the cots somersaulted and came up with the penlight he twisted it off darkness he felt around hoping for his gun and came up with a scrap of a twobyfour nearly puncturing the palm of his left hand with a bent nail held from the other end like a baseball bat the nail then served as a weapon he lunged and rolled guessing at a location hoping to turn the man toward his blind side larson swung the board blindly he missed on the first swing but connected with the second landing the nail into flesh his opponent cried out larson delivered it again and again felt the nail connect with flesh the razor drew a line down larsons left shoulder all at once larson picked up a vague orb of black movement light from a front room seeped through the poorly laid plywood flooring larson kept moving working toward his opponents right he bumped against the cots he heard the ruffle of sleeping bags stay back he hollered having no idea where back was us marshal he called into the dark as he once again swiped the twobyfour in the general direction of the dark shape no contact he rotated to his own left again his thighs cramping and burning from the awkward stance he worked toward where he believed the gun had fallen simultaneously trying to keep rodriguez from it but suddenly a sound came from behind himfeet moving impossibly fast the weight of a man crashed into him larson fell forward onto his face the razor tried to flay his back but hung up in the black windbreakers ripstop fabric larson rolled and swung again roll and swing roll and swing the board and nail bounced off either bone or lumber as larson felt another burn this time along the side of his right calf the cut deep and painful larson miraculously blocked the next attempt with his left forearm five or six hot spots on him all glowing all bleeding crabwalking he scooted away he couldnt afford more cutshe was lightheaded already the cutter sensed an opportunity and attacked larson raised the board with both hands and swung it lodged in the mans headhis cheek neck he wasnt sure the cutter jerked backward and cried out slippery with blood the board came loose in his hands and larson lost it frantic now without a weapon larson furiously patted the ground around himthe glock had to be here somewhere he touched rocks and small chunks of lumber the magazine he pocketed it still no gun movement this time to his left the kids larson scrambled back cramping and dizzy he smacked into the pony wall and tried to collect his bearings hed lost all track of his gun every ounce of him resisted returning toward that razor he paused the silence suddenly alarming larson held his breath and listened in the dark a girls whimpering the kids had been cowering over by the cots the cutter now had penny a nightlight came on unexpectedly blinding him markowitzs grandson dressed in cowboy pajamas cowered but it was he whod turned it on the cutter was crouched behind an upended cot he had his left forearm hooked around pennys throat the twobyfour and its bloody nail lay on the dirt floor to his left the mans right hand clutched his neck just below his left ear attempting to plug the wound where hed taken the nail it looked arterial a bleeder the boy continued to cower penny trembled in the mans grasp no one said a word no one moved the gun lay a full bodylength away to larsons left over by the boy not at all where larson had expected to find it the razor glinted held to pennys neck one pull across that soft flesh and she was gone but in that dim light in that instant as they connected he saw her mothers eyes in the child and he ached at their similarity she was scared out of her mind cairo larson said to the child you hang tough and im going to get you that dog those frightened eyes briefly filled with surprise relief replaced terror as she looked down to take in the wrist of the man holding her and larson knew what that childs mind had planned as her lips parted and her teeth bared the boy courageously but stupidly moved toward the gun dont larson called out sharply to the boy but the kids move was to the cutters blind side forcing him to pivot to track the boy his one good eye flicked back and forth between larson and the boy whether he understood what he was doing or not the boy had stretched the cutters resources thin occupying no more than a couple of seconds the boy moved and penny lowered her chin and bit through to the bone larson threw a handful of dirt at the one remaining eye as he dived straight forward never losing sight of penny while his right hand clutched onto the nail board the cutter reeling from the bite misjudged larson expecting him to go for the gun larson swung the twobyfour for the cheap seats driving the nail squarely into the side of his opponents head penny broke free a gunshot rang out the boy stop larson cried out click click went the empty weapon he was atop the cutter now who lay on his back the nail board stuck to his head he pounded his fist down into the mans disfigured face the razor glinted but larson had the mans wrist pinned he dared not let go but the hand moved like a claw his fingers extended like pincers and both of their arms shaking from waning strength the razor twitched and cut into larsons wrist it dug deeper and more painfully shifting his weight larson swung his elbow and connected with the nail board hammering it more deeply into the mans temple the white of the one good eye rolled into the back of the mans head with each blow of larsons elbow against the board he went still but larson didnt trust it an animal like this could feign unconsciousness larson pinned the two wrists both limp and lifeless he came higher and dropped a knee into the mans chest but saw nothing on his face the razor came loose and fell larson wanted the gunthe useless gunwanted to kill the guy once and for all but then he saw two terrified kids staring at him one his own daughter and he knew he couldnt do this in front of them his vision darkened momentarily no doubt owing to blood loss he saw the boys terrycloth robe and belt on the dirt floor your belt larson said he heard footsteps above them one or two larson tied up the unconscious mans hands behind his back the knot wasnt much due to the thickness of the cloth tie he doubled it then crawled over to the boy and retrieved the gun from where he had dropped it he quickly tried inserting the magazine but it wouldnt stay the guns slide was jammed open as well cairo penny whispered mommy shes waiting he said then he held his finger to his lips and shushed them he moved to screen them from the rectangular hole in the crawl spaces ceilingthe closet floor each of his multiple wounds rang out in sharp hot pain the overhead footsteps hurried toward them larson raised his open palm indicating the kids should stay put he moved to just below the opening reversing the gun in his hand its butt held like a blunt metal club the footsteps stopped immediately above larson motioned for the kids to crouch down and they did he waited and waited movement from the other side of the hole larson imagined a man going down onto his knees preparing to either jump or peer down inside he drew the gun back over his shoulder as the mans head lowered through and he took a look larson waited for him to turn to face him the head slowly pivoted and as it did larson delivered the butt of the handgun squarely into the bridge of the mans nose centered between his eyes the body slipped through the hole like a sea lion into water larson reached for the limp arm and took hold of the mans fallen weapon as the first of two shots came through the floor from above both shots sprayed into the dirt more footfalls above as the man up there took off for reinforcements larson beaded down the barrel he picked up the parallel rows of nails sticking down through the overhead chipboard the hallway his aim tracked the footfalls fluidly first catching those sounds then leading them slightly he popped off two quick rounds they sounded like loud handclaps the third round caused a sharp yelp of pain a collision and then silence neither the kids nor larson made a sound no one was breathing from above a groan larson led with the weapon and poked his head out the trapdoor his first chance at standing his legs throbbed with cramps come on he ordered the kids you stay in the closet he told the boy as he pushed him up through and then he bent to pick up penny his hands touched her little waist he felt it like an electrical charge she placed hers on his shoulders youre bleeding she said as larson clutched her and lifted her through never better he said following her up through a moment later he checked the hallway the man he shot writhed in pain hed taken one in the leg and one in the lower back larson tied him up with a lamp cord and left him the boy had peed his pajama bottoms shoes neither child answered looking up at him with blank faces it was mostly fairway theyd go it barefoot he led them past the two downed guards in the front room peered outside and they made a run for it with shots fired although far from the manor house he expected others the three of them running now across the dark fairway the kids keeping pace larson felt sweat reach his wounds he steered them for the unseen barn he pulled out his phone as they ran he slowed allowing the kids to run a ways in front of him but at that instant the phones face lit upneon blueand announced the arrival of a text message hope the sound of a stream grew close they were nearing the barn desperate for word from her he read only a number on the small screen chapter sixtyeight shots fired lamoia reported into his headset he told those in the van the spiders report hearing six to eight shots fired there was no longer any need to await the ausas warrant hampton and stubblefield over the wall rotem ordered now all those in the back of the police van had spent the last ten minutes preparing for the raid hampton and stubblefield already having donned kevlar vests and radio headsets were handed whitephosphorus grenades and stun grenades by members of spds elite ert squad lamoia said to rotem say the word and youve got twelve of our best special ops on the field with them and two sharpshooters with positions on the lodge how long give me seven to ten minutes okay go but i want no mistake your two spiders and three of my guys are going to be on the ground no friendly fire positive makes or no shots understood rotem also directed lamoia to call up cruisers or patrol personnel and to seal every gate anyone attempting to flee was to be detained as a material witness hampton and stubblefield took off toward ladders set against the wall rotems phone rang and he stuck it to his ear too excited to hear at first then stunned by the voice he heard on the other end shut the fuck up he shouted too loud for the small confines of the back of the truck the men went immediately silent its larson he told the group theyd heard the name bandied about but probably did not understand the significance of the call go ahead rotem barked into the phone a trickle of sweat rolling down his cheek chapter sixtynine philippe suspended the auction at seventeen million five hundred thousand two families having formed a quick alliance across the table and pooling their money to win the witness protection list away from a reno hotelier unwilling to bid higher the hoteliers father brother and two first cousins had all died of mob hits and he believed the names of their killers were on that list philippe called a tenminute break encouraging everyone to try the catered food hed done so not out of greed but because this time one of his own men had interrupted calling him from the meeting first ricardo now him embarrassing as all hell but a few words whispered into his ear convinced him hed had no choice weve got the stevens woman upstairs for a moment he was dumbstruck the news nearly unfathomable he had men out sweeping the grounds while the stevens woman had infiltrated the manor house he rounded the landing on the first floor in time to see outside ricardo climbing into the back of a black navigator philippe hurried to get a better look katrina was propped up in back wrapped in blankets her face smeared with blood her eyes blinking but unseeing the door shut and the car motored off ricardo calling out back gate what the fuck philippe asked his nearest soldier thrown from a horse the man reported more likely ricardo had been pulled from the meeting because katrina had been caught leaving him and this was how hed punished her how bad is she philippe knew it then hed kill ricardo stab wound right below the tit the man said like a fuckin machete got her is what i heard philippe climbed the next flight of stairs heavy with concern over katies condition asking his guy to keep her situation monitored by the minute he arrived into the empty suite of rooms on the third floor to see hope stevens sitting in a comfortable chair she jammed her hand down into a crack in the chair and philippe signaled his man over to inspect he came up with the blue blackberry you let her keep that keep what the young kid said i never saw it you patted her down of course i patted her down but not her crotch did you what the man mistook the question believing himself accused listen mr romero i did not in no way touch her in that kind of way get the fuck out of here philippe ordered him disgusted just before the man left the room philippe stopped him and asked for his gun alone with her now he stepped closer you have been one major pain in the ass ms stevens she held her head down her hands gripped firmly pressed between her legs let my daughter go shut up do what you want with me but let her go shut up shes a child she looked up at him then her eyes glassy but not tearful whats the point in killing a child what can it possibly gain you theres nothing to discuss with you youve wasted far too much of my time and resources as it is he came around the back of the chair hope no longer could control herself her entire body shook her teeth chattered and she heard herself whimpering she so wished she could have been stronger at this moment could have found the words to defend herself and put him in his place this human monster who was behind her daughters abduction her years of running her loss of life despite her living she managed to say you took away my life once already then she added the words that were the most difficult of all to say words she had practiced reciting from the moment shed been discovered down the hall god forgive you she said at first she thought hed fired the shot and blown a hole in her head that somehow shed transformed herself at that moment feeling no pain rising above her own body to hear the guns discharge more distant and disconnected more like a round of fireworks than the last sound she would ever hear but then a flash of light entered the room and she realized she could see that light more fireworks went off only to realize hed not pulled the trigger hed spun around to face the window frozen at the spectacle outside the younger man whod found her burst through the door a look of panic in his eyes boss now she heard gunfire as wellshort handclaps and staccato pops through the window that sounded nothing like she thought they should philippe was frozen picturing his guests on the first floor panicking at the sound of small weapons fire and fleeing for their cars chapter seventy hang on guys larson told the two children the first bursts of light bouncing off the low clouds up by the manor house it reminded him of the fourth of july of festive holidays and drinking too much weak and faint from the loss of blood his every wound stinging unmercifully from the salt of his sweat larson looked and felt far worse off than he was most of the cuts were shallow none lifethreatening and yet he felt himself fading fast penny rode bareback in front gripping the mane the boyadam hed finally told larson his nameheld fast around pennys waist a stranger to horses larson led the quarter horse by the halter first at a walk then a trot following a westbound trail hed discovered a laminated map of the compounds trail system posted outside the tack room and followed it now in his head there were three major forks he would facetwo rights and a leftin order to reach the estates western boundary it was there he was to rendezvous with spd although he wasnt ruling out seeing rotem himself hamp and stubby would be sights for sore eyes but being with hope and penny together was all that mattered now with the detonation of the ordnance he believed hopes chances greatly diminished with the compound now under attack any extra baggage would be dealt with quickly he might have believed her already dead had it not been for the second message from the blackberry mm rd fl meriden manor third floor it had arrived just before the first explosions it at least gave him faint hope that shed escaped or had bought herself time firefly he heard from behind him two blackclad swat operatives converged on larson from behind one took the horses reins from him the other wielding a semiautomatic rifle continued sweeping the surroundings forward and back in constant motion as far away as possible larson instructed as quickly as you can copy that he reached up and touched pennys small hand youre doing great he said but wheres mommy she said the two kids had held up amazingly well penny a leader throughout im gonna go get her larson said the swat guy took off at a jog leading the horse the kids hung on larson turned back down the trail and started to run chapter seventyone lamoia waited at the estates back gate waited for the driver of the navigator to climb out and unlock it he waited for the exact moment the man inserted the key into the padlock and twisted waited for the lock to pop open and the man to remove it and the chain from the gate then he stepped out of shadow and calmly announced police the driver jerked from the surprise and reached for a weapon from just over three feet away lamoia squeezed the trigger and blew the mans kneecap away as the driver spun around screamed and fell to the ground lamoia saw someone inside lunge from the backseat up into the drivers seat he could have fired on the man but until a gun came out either window he had a better option instead he counted silently in his headsinging actuallyto exercise the proper patience right when the man slipped in behind the wheel lamoia fired repeated rounds directly at the cars front bumper one two three four with the fifth round he hit the g spot and the front airbags deployed inflating and snapping the drivers head and body back into the seat like a sixteenounce glove on the fist of muhammad ali he strode forward then the gun trained right into the face of the wouldbe driver ready to send the first person who twitched to his maker he tore the drivers door open not seeing the woman in the far back until the interior lights came on that one needed medical attention he might drive her himselfthe navigator was a nice ride he recognized the man behind the wheel as ricardo romero hed been doing his homework sorry lamoia said road closed chapter seventytwo larson had no craving to run headlong into a firefight but he accepted it as a necessary evil as he chugged uphill with a pronounced limp he reached a gridlock of confusion as a stable of black vehicles battled for position one car backed up onto the grass and shot off in twin rooster tails of mud another followed both came within a matter of feet of larson nearly running him over yet no one bothered with him perhaps no one saw him perhaps he wasnt there maybe hed died beneath the doublewide and was now living out a final fantasy that was nowhere but in his head rotem had orchestrated quite the show to look at it to hear it one would think a hundred agents had stormed the compound when larson knew it had to be many many fewer lacking any organized defense shots were returned sporadically with many of the estates guards already apparently awol amid this hellfire larson made directly for the mansions front door once inside he left behind what looked smelled and sounded like a small war and entered a world of opulence and grandeur in their seclusion within this estate the romeros and others had spared little expense he glimpsed himself in the entranceways oversize gilded mirror wondering at the walking horror there and turning away from it he didnt recognize himself his sleeves and pant legs shredded blood darkening even the black windbreaker he wore larson entered the grand staircase and climbed his legs dragging barely willing to cooperate unmoved by the desperation that drove him he marched toward the third floor another mans gun in hand the lack of electricity was no doubt rotems doing close to the manor house now several percussive stun grenades exploded rattling windows and shaking the foundation designed to throw shock waves meant to rupture sinuses and puncture eardrums inside enclosed spaces the use of the grenades outside where they were less effective but impressive as pyrotechnics smacked of hampton and stubblefield and his squads methods of overwhelming a fugitive prior to a final strike the harsh white light from those flares burned through windows and lit the upstairs hallways he climbed beneath the ostentation of a dozen portraits of jowly old men looking proudly officious with their golf clubs in the distance now the first whine of approaching sirens backup a stupid tactic given hopes captivity the sirens would panic hopes captors and shorten her life considerably if she wasnt dead already chapter seventythree the man held her in a onearmed necklock swinging first toward the rooms windows and then the door back and forth like a drunken dancer it sounded like normandy beach out there his words muddled he spoke aloud for the sake of hearing himself reason all this time of wanting you dead for what it is you claim to know a half minute or so passed before he completed the thought and here you are more valuable to me alive she knew better than to try to speak for each time she opened her mouth he cinched down harder on her windpipe and drove her toward unconsciousness in these brief few minutes under siege hope had come to understand that she would not die the overpowered victim though overpowered she playacted now offering no physical resistance while she searched for opportunity the tendrils of her training as a protected witness creeping back into her consciousness elbows the heels of her feet the opponents groin his windpipe shed been told it took less than twenty pounds of upward pressure to tear a human ear away from the head to grip it by the lobe and work it like a stuck zipper flooded with such thoughts her mind had reached an uneasy calm where time and sound and action seemed to slow and during which time confidence grew in her she had come this far on her own you shouldnt have let me live she thought her moment came sooner than shed expected and when it arrived she knew it she saw it as a gift and she had no intention of allowing it to pass it came as a onetwo punch first a blinding flash much more vivid more present than what had come before a ball of light so bright it flooded the room in a bluish tint that went beyond pure white this was followed nearly instantaneously by a concussive sound wave that found its way deep inside her bones while shattering two of the windows and cracking the third glass rained down sounding like a waiters misfortune hope rocked forward using her bottom as a fulcrum and then snapped to attention catching the mans jaw with the crown of her skull she spun to her right away from the elbow that clamped down on her throat and broke the viselike grip never hesitating for a moment as she sped to the first of the shattered windows and paused only long enough to clear the jagged mouth of broken glass that rimmed the nowlopsided frame she went out through that window like a hurdler one leg stretched before the other bent over toward her extended thigh like a diver three stories up and falling arms flailing now as she saw the two dumpsters slightly to her left and realized shed misjudged and chosen the wrong window but no matter she was free of him in freefall hands out swirling like a teenager leaping from a high rock into the pristine lake below her lake was asphalt and her landing horrific in total disbelief philippe watched his one remaining negotiating tool fly out the window like peter pan the sheer nerve of her jumping out the windowan act he could never have done himselfso pissed him off that he ran to the open wall leaned out and trained the gun down on the collapsed and broken form below he fired off a round not seeing well enough amid the smoke and confusion to have much of an aim and then fired again missed with both he sighted more carefully this time determined to end this finding the bead and locking it onto her sprawled frame then out of the corner of his eye he saw a red firefly light onto his chest his first reaction like anyones who spots a bee or wasp on their person to swat it off but it did not fly for it was no insect his last thought was recognition of what it was a sharpshooters laser sight creating a red circle at the center of his chest and then a hole a ripping and shredding as a largecaliberrifle slug exited a cavity five times larger than it entered philippe was thrown back off his feet as if struck by a truck arms out to his sides on the bed of broken glass that jumped around him like sparkling fairies on the floor chapter seventyfour as larson arrived at the far end of the upstairs hallway he heard two shots exceptionally close bam bam the sound of an execution he arrived at a door and kicked it in gun extended only to see a welldressed man lying dead in a sea of broken glass not bleeding eyes open and dead he might have moved on had he not seen the blue plastic of his smashed blackberry on the carpet in front of an empty overstuffed chair he checked closets he spun around in the center of the room convinced she was here and then his mind reassembled the shattered windows the dead guy in the tailored clothes killed where he was and larson rushed to get a look outside if his mind had been free of emotion if hed been able to clinically abstract how it was that this man could lie dead on the floor he never would have approached the open window but he was desperate for her now and he knew without knowing understood without any evidence whatsoever that hope had jumped he saw her there down on the asphalt writhing in the pain of broken bones and she saw him as well just before it happened he made that connection with her somehow eye to eye or perhaps heart to heart from that great distance the glock in his right hand a red bead lit his jacket like a firefly his head snapped up to face the edgy sharpshooter somewhere out in all that darkness and then the heat of a bee sting and the world went silent chapter seventyfive the sound of applause ethereal or the beating of wings the swirling white lights of angels and a heavenly chorus rising like a whine then blackness broken by a flickering gray wind and the faces of red pulsing demons all looking down at him he the center of attention the focal point it was how hed imagined it might be all but the strained faces of hampton stubblefield and rotem glaring down at him like hed done something wrong leave me alone he wanted to say let me die in peace if this was death it felt anything but peaceful he caught the insignia it was rotem shouting above the roar of the bell jet helicopterfor that turned out to be the source of the wind and the drumming applause and the flashing red lights the white spotlights came from the news choppers high overhead their sharpie caught the insignia on your jacket rotem pointed out the white fraternal order of police insignia on the chest of larsons borrowed windbreaker just as he fired he jerked hampton shouted took your collarbone and a piece of your shoulder but left you your heart they had oxygen on him and intravenous in his arms he tried to speak but could find neither the breath nor the ability to form any words it was as if he were in someone elses body and didnt know the right controls the paramedics hoisted him up and passed him off to their colleagues in the helicopter were right behind you he heard hampton shout larson felt his stretcher turned and placed down a flurry of hands in thin plastic gloves rose above him as straps were pulled across him and tightened if only hed been able to ask someone might have been able to answer and so he tried again his lips unwilling to cooperate his brain a tangle of lifeafterdeath and prayer and penance an incomprehensible moment the red and white lights still flashed rhythmically the only real things convincing him he might indeed be alive how much a dream how much wishful thinking and then he knew it had to be a dream for as it turned out the helicopter was made to carry two not one two stretchers side by side with overhead stainlesssteel hooks for the bags of intravenous fluid there beside him she lay her eyes open and moving to find his which absolutely meant she must too be alive or they were both dead and somehow sharing this moment which wouldnt have surprised him at all he saw on her legs inflated splints and in her eyes a lovingkindness that confirmed in him this must be heaven and he didnt mind a bit finally words did come or at least he heard himself speak and he would wonder in the days and weeks and months to come if hed actually said anything to her she has your eyes he said her hand twitched its fingers stretched at the end of an arm bound by nylon straps it reached for him for his and he too pushed with all his strength to move his index finger toward her her eyes brimmed with tears which rolled down her cheeks clearing tracks through the smudged dirt on her face their fingers did not touch only wiggled out in space toward each other as the helicopter shook and rattled and thundered as it lifted off larson tried to force the snarl of pain into something resembling a smile but didnt know if it took chapter seventysix larson pulled on the oars working the stubborn tissue and tightness in his left shoulder to the point of pain and then backing off to where it was manageable there was something about michigans upper peninsula the smell maybe or the darkness of the water the way the forest crept right to the edge of both the mainland and the island the trees reflected like tall soldiers there were bugs in the air and the smells of early summerthe perfume of fruit blossoms carried on winters freshened air spilling out of canada he heard a redwinged blackbirds sprightly lilting song heard the rhythm of the oars carving into and scooping the lakes mirrored surface heard her joyous squeal and the thrashing of her feet on the island trail as she endeavored to keep pace with him penny was a fast little runner he looked to see her blond hair bouncing her smart little body sprinting the trail in a pair of pink shorts and a white ttop white sneakers and socks her mother had mailordered break fast she called across to him when she knew he was looking he met her at the dock and she helped him stow the scull in the old boathouse and wipe down the oars and rigging she told him of a dream shed had in the night spoken in one continuous monologueof princesses and magic potions and trees that could talkthat lasted from the boathouse clear up the trail to the sprawling log cabin known only as babys breath as they approached the back deck buttoned down with tubs of recently planted annuals hope was there to greet them a pair of binoculars in hand larson slowed as he saw her penny rushed past drawn by the scent of cooking bacon hope was clearly distressed what is it he asked the launch she said pointing at the white dot of a distant boat approaching beyond it the steady green of the mainland through the binoculars the launch carried a distinctive brightblue flag hope knew of what she was speaking the rules were strict concerning the waters around this island you ordered it or it wouldnt be coming here yes he answered i called for it but im not going anywhere its not like that come with me rotem had convinced larson and hope to remain in protection through not only the trial of ricardo romero but his sentencing as well with the trial now less than ninety days away pressure from justice remained high for them to maintain the zero profile theyd kept over the past few months the man driving the launch was on the federal payroll its not time for a rotation she reminded the nearest town was across three miles of lake around a bend to the southwest about a twentyminute boat trip provisions were delivered twice a week two marshals remained on the island rotating in three shifts a day just bear with me would you larson asked she slung the binoculars around her neck crossed her arms defiantly and joined him in the walk down to the dock i thought you were leaving us she said yeah right hope said nothing on the way down the path larson drank in the sounds the sights the smells this is a special place he said only because were sharing it she said damn right are we going to talk about it she asked a pair of squirrels cackled and chased each other overhead their running up the trunk scratching against the heavy bark she said laena your allimportant list sworn to secrecy larson nonetheless owed her an explanation even if lacking in detail hed put it off until shed asked and now she had the disk that was being auctioned took a bullet it was in philippe romeros breast pocket seriously swear to god the sheriff with the bible in his coat she questioned skeptically only it didnt save him larson pointed out but the list itself katrina romeros computer was seized she had compiled the list for philippe it was her email that markowitz had been sending it to she was convicted on a number of counts but to my knowledge hasnt been sentenced and the witnesses weve lost some fewer than wed feared justice has relocated something like five hundred prime targets a huge undertaking there have been some early retirements transfers within witsec itself the water came in and out of view he never got tired of looking at it he said the computerization of the list is under review theres no way theyll go back to paperwork so its only a matter of encryption and how they prevent something like this from happening again its the government dont forget itll take them a couple years to come up with a plan and by then it will be outdated the list will always be vulnerable to some extent what about the children katrinas children he stopped on the trail turned and faced her i dont have an answer for that he said they shouldnt end up the victims no no one should end up a victim but children i understand there was no mention of paolo no mention of larsons having attended the cremation because he had to see the man reduced to ashes seventeen members of ricardo romeros former family had been captured and imprisoned like paolo ricardos empire was ashes larson led her down the trail to waters edge they reached the dock and hope used the binoculars to confirm the launch driver passing the opticals to larson so he could do the same its neville he said i have to tell you i did not like it one bit seeing that launch she didnt look at him as she said i dont want to lose you lars were going to rejoin the world you realize that dont you six months a year weve talked about this i know but dont lose sight that itll be different when were shopping for our own groceries and taking the dry cleaning and driving penny to soccer games as awkward as it is to be this isolated weve been pampered its going to be a whole hell of a lot different and i for one cant wait the launch slowed the wake lessening and putted in toward the dock taking longer than either of them would have wanted so this is some kind of surprise i take it she asked larson he said a promise made is a promise kept she viewed him curiously neville the boats driver coaxed the vessel into reverse foaming the water as larson snagged the bowline and tied it off to the dock special delivery neville announced as he then secured the sternline as well he moved forward and opened the cabin and descended a steep set of steps disappearing he reappeared a moment later with a sandcolored puppy under his right arm oh lars hope said enthusiastically shes a mutt part shepherd part hound dog looks part afghan thats the hound dog saluki is the breed neville passed the pup to hope who then cuddled it and brought the dogs nose to her face and was generously licked she laughed and the dog licked some more meet cairo larson said hope looked up with tears in her eyes neville handed larson several copies each of the new york times the wall street journal and the detroit free press and larson thanked him covers the past four days neville informed him he brought up a large bag of puppy chow and several shopping bags of accessories including two books on dog training there was no mail to be delivered even for larson for all the world hed disappeared after that night north of seattle even hampton and stubblefield did not know his whereabouts see you thursday neville said as larson untied first the bow and then the sternline larson pushed the stern away from the dock and the boats motor gurgled larson offered a small wave of thanks neville mocked a salute and the launch motored off larson left the food but got the bags shes going to flip out hope said i hope so larson switched hands with the bags and threw an arm around hope he was going to hate leaving this place though not what it represented he planned to ask rotem if there might be a way to buy it from the government someday if his finances allowed no law against dreaming isnt she cute hope bubbled larson held her just a little bit closer yes she is he said and the two walked back up the trail toward the cabin about the author ridley pearson is the author of more than twenty crime novels and several books for younger readers he and dave barry cowrote the awardwinning childrens novels peter and the starcatchers and peter and the shadow thieves in he was the first american to be awarded the raymond chandler
