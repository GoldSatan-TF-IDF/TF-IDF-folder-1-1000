sara paretsky indemnity only the first book in the vi warshawski series for stuart kaminsky thanks a note from the author on new years eve flushed with champagne i made a secret resolution to write a novel in or send that fantasy packing along with my daydreams of singing at la scala or dancing with nureyev the next day i began i looked hopefully in my wallet but found only the two greasy singles which had been there in the morning i could get a sandwich or a pack of cigarettes and a cheap shot of scotch i sighed and looked down at the wabash avenue el tracks nine months later id added about fifty pages to this unpromising opening and thought i should resign myself to a life of selling computers to insurance agents at that point a coworker named mary hogan who knew about my efforts showed me the northwestern university fall extension catalog stuart kaminsky was teaching an evening course called writing detective fiction for publication i felt like alice finding the mushroomjust what i needed to get to be the right size stuart read my puny story with great care he gave me essential advice for thinking about my character and my story in the process v i stopped smoking and took up my whiskey black label most important stuart became the voice i needed to hear the voice that said you can write you can do this thing without stuart i would not have had the confidence to push the story through to the end that is why indemnity only is dedicated to him whenever i read the memoirs of a writer like sartre who says he knew from childhood he was destined for words or bellow who knew he was born to be a performing or interpretive creature i wonder what unacknowledged voice spoke to them as children sartre actually tells us it was his mother and his grandfather who bound his childish effusions as novels and passed them with much outspoken pride around the neighborhood without his family creating in him that vision of himself young jeanpaul could not have grown up with such a sense of destiny his cousins told at the same age they were fated to be engineers became engineers i wrote from my earliest childhood but for myself only like the heroine of dream girl i spent vast amounts of my waking hours imagining myself inside different stories when they acquired some kind of shape i wrote them down but i thought my stories were a sign of the sickness afflicting the woman in the play and that true love would cure me as it did her for i grew up in a time and place where little girls were destined to be wives and mothers i did find true love but my husband courtenay wright convinced me that my stories were worth telling that my dreams signaled not sickness but a lively mind his support has not wavered from that cold new years day to the present hot june in which i struggle with my seventh v i novel i have had some years of terrible pain and disability in between courtenay has held on to me and kept me from losing that essential core from which my stories come in a way every word i write is dedicated to courtenay when i finished the manuscript in may with the first weak paragraph and limp chapter exchanged for the current one stuart kaminsky sent it to his agent dominick abel in new york dominick took on v i and me and has stuck with us ever since i dont want to turn this introduction into a volume of the talmud so ill only say of dominick in the old chinese words that i would send him for horses it took him a year to find a publisher for indemnity only indeed when im getting too conceited with myself i pull out the file of rejection letters from that year and read that im too talky have wooden characters wrote a derivative story and that indemnity only was a marginal book which we cant afford to take on the file is a nice fat one and a good antidote for vanity in the face of so much negativism im especially grateful to nancy van itallie and the dial press for taking the gamble on publishing me the dial press is no more and that is sad ftnref the dial press was indeed revived in and flourishes ed but after almost a decade of wandering ive found my proper home at delacorte jackie farber and carole baron provide the kind of editorial and publishing support most writers only dream about indemnity only came to life so precariously that it remains very precious to me sometimes i look at it with amazementamazed that i did find the strength to write a book amazed that someone actually published it and now that delacorte is bringing out a new edition i look at it with a lot of pride i was tempted to go through and polish up the writing change those flaws i wasnt alert enough to see in but i decided it would be unethical to tamper with the text with the exception of two very small corrections this is the same book i sent dominick abel ten years ago sara paretsky chicago june summertime the night air was thick and damp as i drove south along lake michigan i could smell rotting alewives like a faint perfume on the heavy air little fires shone here and there from latenight barbecues in the park on the water a host of green and red running lights showed people seeking relief from the sultry air on shore traffic was heavy the city moving restlessly trying to breathe it was july in chicago i got off lake shore drive at randolph street and swung down wabash under the iron arches of the elevated tracks at monroe i stopped the car and got out away from the lake the city was quieter the south loop with no entertainment beyond a few peepshows and the city lockup was deserteda drunk weaving uncertainly down the street was my only companion i crossed wabash and went into the pulteney building next to the monroe street tobacco store at night it looked like a terrible place to have an office the halls mosaictiled walls were chipped and dirty i wondered if anyone ever washed the scuffed linoleum floor the lobby must create a reassuring impression on potential clients i pushed the elevator button no response i tried again again no response i shoved open the heavy stairwell door climbing slowly to the fourth floor it was cool in the stairwell and i lingered there a few minutes before moving on down the badly lit hallway to the east end the end where rents are cheaper because all the offices look out on the wabash el in the dim light i could read the inscription on the door v i warshawski private investigator i had called my answering service from a filling station on the north side just a routine check on my way home to a shower air conditioning and a late supper i was surprised when they told me i had a caller and unhappy when they said hed refused to give a name anonymous callers are a pain they usually have something to hide often something criminal and they dont leave their names just so you cant find out what theyre hiding ahead of time this guy was coming at which didnt even give me time to eat id spent a frustrating afternoon in the ozoneladen heat trying to track down a printer who owed me fifteen hundred dollars id saved his firm from being muscled out by a national chain last spring and now i was sorry id done it if my checking account hadnt been so damned anemic id have ignored this phone call as it was i squared my shoulders and unlocked the door with the lights on my office looked spartan but not unpleasant and i cheered up slightly unlike my apartment which is always in mild disarray my office is usually tidy id bought the big wooden desk at a police auction the little olivetti portable had been my mothers as well as a reproduction of the ufizzi hanging over my green filing cabinet that was supposed to make visitors realize that mine was a highclass operation two straightbacked chairs for clients completed the furniture i didnt spend much time here and didnt need any other amenities i hadnt been in for several days and had a stack of bills and circulars to sort through a computer firm wanted to arrange a demonstration of what computers could do to help my business i wondered if a nice little desktop ibm could find me paying customers the room was stuffy i looked through the bills to see which ones were urgent car insuranceid better pay that the others i threw outmost were firsttime bills a few secondtime i usually only pay bills the third time they come around if they want the money badly they wont forget you i stuffed the insurance into my shoulder bag then turned to the window and switched the air conditioner onto high the room went dark id blown a fuse in the pulteneys uncertain electrical system stupid you cant turn an air conditioner right onto high in a building like this i cursed myself and the building management equally and wondered whether the storeroom with the fuse boxes was open at night during the years id spent in the building id learned how to repair most of what could go wrong with it including the bathroom on the seventh floor whose toilet backed up about once a month i made my way back down the hall and down the stairs to the basement a single naked bulb lit the bottom of the stairs it showed a padlock on the supplyroom door tom czarnik the buildings crusty superintendent didnt trust anyone i can open some locks but i didnt have time now for an american padlock one of those days i counted to ten in italian and started back upstairs with even less enthusiasm than before i could hear a heavy tread ahead of me and guessed it was my anonymous visitor when i got to the top i quietly opened the stairwell door and watched him in the dim light he was knocking at my office door i couldnt see him very well but got the impression of a short stocky man he held himself aggressively and when he got no answer to his knocking he opened the door without hesitation and went inside i walked down the hallway and went in after him a fivefoothigh sign from arnies steak joynt flashed red and yellow across the street providing spasms of light to my office i saw my visitor whirl as i opened the door im looking for v i warshawski he said his voice husky but confidentthe voice of a man used to having his own way yes i said going past him to sit behind my desk yes what he demanded yes im vi warshawski you call my answering service for an appointment yeah but i didnt know it would mean walking up four flights of stairs to a dark office why the hell doesnt the elevator work the tenants in this building are physical fitness nuts we agreed to get rid of the elevatorclimbing stairs is well known as a precaution against heart attacks in one of the flashes from arnies i saw him make an angry gesture i didnt come here to listen to a comedienne he said his husky voice straining when i ask questions i expect to hear them answered in that case ask reasonable questions now do you want to tell me why you need a private investigator i dont know i need help all right but this placejesusand why is it so dark in here the lights are out i said my temper riding me you dont like my looks leave i dont like anonymous callers either all right all right he said placatingly simmer down but do we have to sit in the dark i laughed a fuse blew a few minutes before you showed up we can go over to arnies steak joynt if you want some light i wouldnt have minded getting a good look at him myself he shook his head no we can stay here he fidgeted around some then sat in one of the visitors chairs you got a name i asked to fill in the pause while he collected his thoughts oh yeah sorry he said fumbling in his wallet he pulled out a card and passed it across the desk i held it up to read in a flash from arnies john l thayer executive vicepresident trust ft dearborn bank and trust i pursed my lips i didnt make it over to la salle street very often but john thayer was a very big name indeed at chicagos biggest bank hot diggity i thought play this fish right vic i urged myself here come de rent i put the card in my jeans pocket yes mr thayer now what seems to be the problem well its about my son that is its about his girl friend at least shes the one who he stopped a lot of people especially men arent used to sharing their problems and it takes them a while to get going you know i dont mean any offense but im not sure i should talk to you after all not unless youve got a partner or something i didnt say anything you got a partner he persisted no mr thayer i said evenly i dont have a partner well this really isnt a job for a girl to take on alone a pulse started throbbing in my right temple i skipped dinner after a long day in the heat to meet you down here my voice was husky with anger i cleared my throat and tried to steady myself you wouldnt even identify yourself until i pushed you to it you pick at my office at me but you cant come out and ask anything directly are you trying to find out whether im honest rich tough or what you want some references ask for them but dont waste my time like this i dont need to argue you into hiring my servicesit was you who insisted on making an appointment for the middle of the night im not questioning your honesty he said quickly look im not trying to get your goat but you are a girl and things may get heavy im a woman mr thayer and i can look out for myself if i couldnt i wouldnt be in this kind of business if things get heavy ill figure out a way to handle themor go down trying thats my problem not yours now you want to tell me about your son or can i go home where i can turn on an air conditioner he thought some more and i took some deep breaths to calm myself ease the tension in my throat i dont know he finally said i hate to but im running out of options he looked up but i couldnt see his face anything i tell you has to be strictly in confidence righto mr thayer i said wearily just you me and arnies steak joynt he caught his breath but remembered he was trying to be conciliatory its really anita my sons girl friend not that petemy son that ishasnt been a bit of a problem too dope i thought morosely all these north shore types think about is dope if it was a pregnancy theyd just pay for an abortion and be done with it however mine was not to pick and choose so i grunted encouragingly well this anita is not really a very desirable type and ever since pete got mixed up with her hes been having some peculiar ideas the language sounded strangely formal in his husky voice im afraid i only detect things mr thayer i cant do too much about what the boy thinks no no i know that its just thattheyve been living together in some disgusting commune or otherdid i tell you theyre students at the university of chicago anyway he pete hes taken to talking about becoming a union organizer and not going to business school so i went down to talk to the girl make her see reason kind of whats her last name mr thayer hill anita hill well as i said i went down to try to make her see reason andright after that she disappeared it sounds to me like your problems solved i wish it was the thing is now petes saying i bought her off paid her to disappear and hes threatening to change his name and drop out of sight unless she turns up again now ive heard everything i thought hired to find a person so her boyfriend would go to business school and were you responsible for her disappearance mr thayer me if i was id be able to get her back not necessarily she could have squeezed fifty grand out of you and gone off on her own so you couldnt get it back or you could have paid her to disappear completely or you may have killed her or caused her to he killed and want someone else to take the rap for you a guy like you has a lot of resources he seemed to laugh a little at that yeah i suppose all that could be true anyway i want you to find herto find anita mr thayer i dont like to turn down work but why not get the policetheyre much better equipped than i for this sort of thing the police and i he started then broke off i dont feel like advertising my family problems to the police he said heavily that had the ring of truthbut what had he started to say and why were you so worried about things getting heavy i wondered aloud he shifted in his chair a bit some of those students can get pretty wild he muttered i raised my eyebrows skeptically but he couldnt see that in the dark how did you get my name i asked like an advertising surveydid you hear about us in rolling stone or through a friend i found your name in the yellow pages and i wanted someone in the loop and someone who didnt knowmy business associates mr thayer i charge a hundred and a quarter a day plus expenses and i need a fivehundreddollar deposit i make progress reports but clients dont tell me how to do the jobany more than your widows and orphans tell you how to run the fort dearborns trust department then you will take the job he asked yes i said shortly unless the girl was dead it shouldnt be too hard to find her ill need your sons address at the university i added and a picture of the girl if you have one he hesitated over that seemed about to say something but then gave it to me south harper i hoped it was the right place he also produced a picture of anita hill i couldnt make it out in the spasmodic light but it looked like a yearbook snap my client asked me to call him at home to report progress rather than at the office i jotted his home number on the business card and put it back in my pocket how soon do you think youll know something he asked i cant tell you until ive looked at it mr thayer but ill get on the case first thing tomorrow why cant you go down there tonight he persisted because i have other things to do i answered shortly like dinner and a drink he argued for a bit not so much because he thought id change my mind as because he was used to getting his own way he finally gave up on it and handed me five hundreddollar bills i squinted at them in the light from arnies i take checks mr thayer im trying to keep people at the office from knowing ive been to a detective and my secretary balances my checkbook i was staggered but not surprised an amazing number of executives have their secretaries do that my own feeling was that only god the irs and my bank should have access to my financial transactions he got up to go and i walked out with him by the time id locked the door he had started down the stairs i wanted to get a better look at him and hurried after him i didnt want to have to see every man in chicago under a flashing neon sign to recognize my client again the stairwell lighting wasnt that good but under it his face appeared square and rugged irishlooking i would have said not what i would have thought of as secondincommand at the fort dearborn his suit was expensive and well cut but he looked more as if hed stepped from an edward g robinson movie than the nations eighth largest bank but then did i look like a detective come to think of it most people dont try to guess what women do for a living by the way they lookbut they are usually astounded to find out what i do my client turned east toward michigan avenue i shrugged and crossed the street to arnies the owner gave me a double johnnie walker black and a sirloin from his private collection dropping out of school i woke up early to a day that promised to be as hot and steamy as the one before four days out of seven i try to force myself to get some kind of exercise id missed the previous two days hoping that the heat would break but i knew id better get out this morning when thirty is a fond memory the more days that pass without exercise the worse you feel going back to it then too im undisciplined in a way that makes it easier to exercise than to diet and the running helps keep my weight down it doesnt mean i love it though especially on mornings like this the five hundred dollars john thayer had given me last night cheered me up considerably and i felt good as i put on cutoffs and a tshirt the money helped take my mind off the thick air when i got outside i did five easy milesover to the lake and around belmont harbor and back to my large cheap apartment on halsted it was only but i was sweating freely from running in the heat i drank a tall glass of orange juice and made coffee before taking a shower i left my running clothes on a chair and didnt bother with the bed after all i was on a job and didnt have timebesides who was going to see it over coffee and some smoked herring i tried to decide how to approach peter thayer about his missing girl friend if his family disapproved of her he would probably resent his father hiring a private detective to look into her disappearance id have to be someone connected with the universitymaybe in one of her classes wanting to borrow some notes i looked pretty old for an undergraduateand what if she wasnt registered for the summer quarter maybe id be from an underground journal wanting her to do an article on something something on labor unionsthayer had said she was trying to push peter into being a union organizer i stacked my dishes by the sink and eyed them thoughtfully one more day and id have to wash them i took the garbage out thoughim messy but not a slob newspapers had been piling up for some time so i took a few minutes to carry them out next to the garbage cans the building supers son made extra money recycling paper i put on jeans and a yellow cotton top and surveyed myself in the mirror with critical approval i look my best in the summer i inherited my italian mothers olive coloring and tan beautifully i grinned at myself i could hear her saying yes vic you are prettybut pretty is no good any girl can be prettybut to take care of yourself you must have brains and you must have a job a profession you must work she had hoped i would be a singer and had trained me patiently she certainly wouldnt have liked my being a detective nor would my father hed been a policeman himself polish in an irish world hed never made it beyond sergeant due partly to his lack of ambition but also i was sure to his ancestry but hed expected great things of me my grin went a little sour in the mirror and i turned away abruptly before heading to the south side i walked over to my bank to deposit the five hundreds first things first the teller took them without a blinki couldnt expect everyone to be as impressed with them as i was it was when i eased my chevy monza onto the belmont entrance to lake shore drive the sky was already bleached out and the waves reflected back a coppery sheen housewives children and detectives were the only people out this time of day i coasted to hyde park in twentythree minutes and parked on the midway i hadnt been on campus in ten years but the place hadnt changed much not as much as i had id read somewhere that the dirty povertystricken collegiate appearance was giving way to the cleancut look of the fifties that movement had definitely passed chicago by young people of indeterminate sex strolled by handinhand or in groups hair sticking out sporting tattered cutoffs and torn work shirtsprobably the closest contact any of them had with work supposedly a fifth of the student body came from homes with an annual income of fifty thousand dollars or more but id hate to use looks to decide which fifth i walked out of the glare into cool stone halls and stopped at a campus phone to call the registrar im trying to locate one of your students a miss anita hill the voice on the other end old and creaky told me to wait papers rustled in the background could you spell that name i obliged more rustling the creaky voice told me they had no student by that name did that mean she wasnt registered for the summer quarter it meant they had no student by that name i asked for peter thayer and was a little surprised when she gave me the harper addressif anita didnt exist why should the boy im sorry to be so much trouble but im his aunt can you tell me what classes he might be in today hes not home and im only in hyde park for the day i must have sounded benevolent for ms creaky condescended to tell me that peter was not registered this summer but that the political science department in the college might be able to help me find him i thanked her benevolently and signed off i frowned at the phone and contemplated my next move if there was no anita hill how could i find her and if there was no anita hill how come someone was asking me to find her and why had he told me the two were students at the university when the registrar showed no record of the girl although maybe he was mistaken about her being at the university of chicagoshe might go to roosevelt and live in hyde park i thought i should go to the apartment and see if anyone was home i went back to my car it was stifling inside and the steering wheel burned my fingers among the papers on the backseat was a towel id taken to the beach a few weeks ago i rummaged for it and covered the steering wheel with it it had been so long since id been in the neighborhood that i got confused in the oneway streets but i eventually made it to harper was a threestory building that had once been yellow brick the entryway smelled like an el stationmusty with a trace of urine in the air a bag labeled harolds chicken shack had been crumpled and thrown in a corner and a few picked bones lay near it the inner door hung loosely in its frame it probably hadnt had a lock for some time its paint once brown had chipped and peeled badly i wrinkled my nose i couldnt blame the thayers too much if they didnt like the place their son lived in the names on the bell panel had been handprinted on index cards and taped to the wall thayer berne steiner mcgraw and harata occupied a thirdfloor apartment that must be the disgusting commune that had angered my client no hill i wondered if hed gotten anitas last name wrong or if she was using an assumed name i rang the bell and waited no response i rang again still no answer it was noon now and i decided to take a break the wimpys i remembered in the nearby shopping center had been replaced by a cool attractive quasigreek restaurant i had an excellent crabmeat salad and a glass of chablis and walked back to the apartment the kids probably had summer jobs and wouldnt be home until five but i didnt have anything else to do that afternoon besides trying to find my welching printer there was still no answer but a scruffylooking young man came out as i was ringing do you know if anyone in the thayerberne apartment is home i asked he looked at me in a glazed way and mumbled that he hadnt seen any of them for several days i pulled anitas picture from my pocket and told him i was trying to track down my niece she should be home right now but im wondering if i have the right address i added he gave me a bored look yeah i think she lives here i dont know her name anita i said but hed already shuffled outside i leaned against the wall and thought for a few minutes i could wait until tonight to see who showed up on the other hand if i went in now i might find out more on my own than i could by asking questions i opened the inside door whose lock id noticed that morning was missing and climbed quickly to the third floor hammered on the thayerberne apartment door no answer put my ear to it and heard the faint hum of a window air conditioner pulled a collection of keys from my pocket and after a few false starts found one that turned the lock back i stepped inside and quietly shut the door a small hallway opened directly onto a living room it was sparsely furnished with some large denimcovered pillows on the bare floor and a stereo system i went over and looked at itkenwood turntable and jbl speakers someone here had money my clients son no doubt the living room led to a hallway with rooms on either side of it boxcar style as i moved down it i could smell something rank like stale garbage or a dead mouse i poked my head into each of the rooms but didnt see anything the hall ended in a kitchen the smell was strongest there but it took me a minute to see its source a young man slumped over the kitchen table i walked over to him despite the window air conditioner his body was in the early stages of decomposition the smell was strong sweet and sickening the crabmeat and chablis began a protest march in my stomach but i fought back my nausea and carefully lifted the boys shoulders a small hole had been put into his forehead a trickle of blood had come out of it and dried across his face but his face wasnt damaged the back of his head was a mess i lowered him carefully to the table something call it my womans intuition told me i was looking at the remains of peter thayer i knew i ought to get out of the place and call the cops but i might never have another chance to look over the apartment the boy had clearly been dead for some timethe police could wait another few minutes for him i washed my hands at the sink and went back down the hall to explore the bedrooms i wondered just how long the body had been there and why none of the inmates had called the police the second question was partially answered by a list taped up next to the phone giving bernes steiners and haratas summer addresses two of the bedrooms containing books and papers but no clothes must belong to some combination of those three the third room belonged to the dead boy and a girl named anita mcgraw her name was scrawled in a large flowing hand across the flyleaves of numerous books on the dilapidated wooden desk was an unframed photo of the dead boy and a girl out by the lake the girl had wavy auburn hair and a vitality and intenseness that made the photo seem almost alive it was a much better picture than the yearbook snap my client had given me last night a boy might give up far more than business school for a girl like that i wanted to meet anita mcgraw i looked through the papers but they were impersonalflyers urging people to boycott nonunionmade sheets some marxist literature and the massive number of notebooks and term papers to be expected in a student apartment i found a couple of recent pay stubs made out to peter thayer from the ajax insurance company stuffed in one drawer clearly the boy had had a summer job i balanced them on my hand for a minute then pushed them into my back jeans pocket wedged behind them were some other papers including a voter registration card with a winnetka address on it i took that too you never know what may come in handy i picked up the photograph and left the apartment once outside i took some gulping breaths of the ozoneladen air i never realized it could smell so good i walked back to the shopping center and called the twentyfirst police district my dad had been dead for ten years but i still knew the number by heart homicide drucker speaking growled a voice theres a dead body at fiftyfour sixtytwo south harper apartment three i said who are you he snapped fiftyfour sixtytwo south harper apartment three i repeated got that i hung up i went back to my car and left the scene the cops might be all over me later for leaving but right now i needed to sort some things out i made it home in twentyone minutes and took a long shower trying to wash the sight of peter thayers head from my mind i put on white linen slacks and a black silk shirtclean elegant clothes to center me squarely in the world of the living i pulled the assortment of stolen papers from my back jeans pocket and put them and the photograph into a big shoulder bag i headed back downtown to my office ensconced my evidence in my wall safe then checked in with my answering service there were no messages so i tried the number thayer had given me i rang three times and a womans voice answered the number you have dialedis not in service at this time please check your number and dial again that monotonous voice destroyed whatever faith i still had in the identity of my last nights visitor i was certain he was not john thayer who was he then and why had he wanted me to find that body and why had he brought the girl into it then given her a phony name with an unidentified client and an identified corpse id been wondering what my job was supposed to befall girl for finding the body no doubt still ms mcgraw had not been seen for several days my client might just have wanted me to find the body but i had a strong curiosity about the girl my job did not seem to include breaking the news of peters death to his father if his father didnt already know but before i completely wrote off last nights visitor as john thayer i should get his picture clear as you go has ever been my motto i pulled on my lower lip for a while in an agony of thought and finally realized where i could get a picture of the man with a minimum of fuss and botherand with no one knowing i was getting it i locked the office and walked across the loop to monroe and la salle the fort dearborn trust occupied four massive buildings one on each corner of the intersection i picked the one with gold lettering over the door and asked the guard for the pr department thirtysecond floor he mumbled you got an appointment i smiled seraphically and said i did and sailed up thirtytwo stories while he went back to chewing his cigar butt pr receptionists are always trim welllacquered and dressed in the extreme of fashion this ones formfitting lavender jumpsuit was probably the most outlandish costume in the bank she gave me a plastic smile and graciously tendered a copy of the most recent annual report i stuck on my own plastic smile and went back to the elevator nodded beneficently to the guard and sauntered out my stomach still felt a little jumpy so i took the report over to rosies deli to read over ice cream and coffee john l thayer executive vicepresident trust division was pictured prominently on the inside cover with some other bigwigs he was jean tanned and dressed in bankers gray and i did not have to see him under a neon light to know that he bore no resemblance to my last nights visitor i pulled some more on my lip the police would be interviewing all the neighbors one clue i had that they didnt because i had taken it with me was the boys pay stubs ajax insurance had its national headquarters in the loop not far from where i was now it was three in the afternoon not too late for business calls ajax occupied all sixty floors of a modern glassandsteel skyscraper id always considered it one of the ugliest buldings downtown from the outside the lower lobby was drab and nothing about the interior made me want to reverse my first impression the guard here was more aggressive than the one at the bank and refused to let me in without a security pass i told him i had an appointment with peter thayer and asked what floor he was on not so fast lady he snarled we call up and if the gentleman is here hell authorize you authorize me you mean hell authorize my entry he doesnt have any authority over my existence the guard stomped over to his booth and called up the news that mr thayer wasnt in today didnt surprise me i demanded to talk to someone in his office i was tired of being feminine and conciliatory and made myself menacing enough that i was allowed to speak to a secretary this is v i warshawski i said crisply mr thayer is expecting me the soft female voice at the other end apologized but mr thayer hasnt been in all week weve even tried calling him at home but no one answers then i think id better talk to someone else in your office i kept my voice hard she wanted to know what my business was im a detective i said something rottens going on which young thayer wanted to talk to me about if hes not in ill talk to someone else who knows his job it sounded pretty thin to me but she put me on hold and went off to consult someone five minutes later the guard still glaring at me and fingering his gun the softvoiced female came back on the line rather breathless mr masters the claim department vicepresident would talk to me the guard hated letting me go uphe even called back up to ms softy in hopes i was lying but i finally made it to the fortieth floor once off the elevator my feet sank deep into green pile i made my way through it to a reception area at the south end of the hall a bored receptionist left her novel and shunted me to the softvoiced young woman seated at a teak desk with a typewriter to one side she in turn ushered me in to see masters masters had an office big enough for the bears to work out in with a magnificent view of the lake his face had the wellfilled faintly pink look a certain type of successful businessman takes on after fortyfive and he beamed at me above a wellcut gray summer suit hold my calls ellen he said to the secretary as she walked out i gave him my card as we exchanged firm handshakes now what was it you wanted missah he smiled patronizingly warshawski i want to see peter thayer mr masters but as hes apparently not in and youve agreed to see me id like to know why the boy felt he needed a private detective i really couldnt tell you that missahdo you mind if i call you he looked at the card what does the v stand for my first name mr masters maybe you can tell me what mr thayer does here hes my assistant masters obliged genially jack thayer is a good friend of mine and when his boywhos a student at the university of chicagoneeded summer work i was glad to help out he adjusted his features to look sorrowful certainly if the boy is in the kind of trouble that it takes a detective to solve i think i should know about it what kinds of things does mr thayer do as your assistant settle claims oh no he beamed thats all done at our field locations no we handle the business side of the businessbudgets that kind of thing the boy adds up figures for me and he does good staff workreviews reports et cetera hes a good boyi hope hes not in trouble with those hippies he runs around with down there he lowered his voice between you and me jack says theyve given him a bad idea of the business world the big point about this summer job was to give him a better picture of the business world from the inside and has it i asked im hopeful missahim hopeful he rubbed his hands together i certainly wish i could help you if you could give me a clue about what was bothering the boy i shook my head he didnt say just called me and asked if i could stop by this afternoon there wouldnt be anything going on here that hed feel would require a detective would there well a department head often doesnt know whats going on in his own department masters frowned importantly youre too remotepeople dont confide in you he smiled again but id be very surprised why did you want to see me i asked oh i promised jack thayer id keep an eye on his boy you know and when a private detective comes around it sounds kind of serious still i wouldnt worry about it too much missahalthough maybe we could hire you to find out where peters gone he chuckled at his joke he hasnt been in all week you know and we cant reach him at home i havent told jack yethes disappointed enough in the boy as it is he ushered me down the hall and back to the elevator i rode down to the thirtysecond floor got off and rode back up i strolled back down the hall id like to see where young thayer sits i told ellen she looked at masterss door for guidance but it was shut i dont think probably not i interrupted but im going to look around his desk anyway i can always get someone else to tell me where it is she looked unhappy but took me over to a partitioned cubicle you know im going to be in trouble if mr masters comes out and finds you here she said i dont see why i told her its not your fault ill tell him you did your best to force me off the floor peter thayers desk was unlocked ellen stood watching me for a few minutes as i pulled open the drawers and sorted through the papers you can search me on my way out to see if ive taken anything i told her without looking up she sniffed but walked back to her own desk these papers were as innocuous as those in the boys apartment numerous ledger sheets with various aspects of the departments budget added up a sheaf of computer printouts that dealt with workers compensation case estimates correspondence to ajax claim handlersdear mr soandso please verify the case estimates for the following claimants nothing youd murder a boy for i was scratching my head over these slim pickings wondering what to do next when i realized someone was watching me i looked up it wasnt the secretary youre certainly a lot more decorative than young thayer my observer remarked you taking his place the speaker was in his shirtsleeves a man in his thirties who didnt have to be told how goodlooking he was i appreciated his narrow waist and the way his brooks brothers trousers fit does anyone around here know peter thayer at all well i asked yardleys secretary is making herself sick over him but i dont know whether she knows him he moved closer why the interest are you with the irs has the kid omitted taxes on some of the vast family holdings deeded to him or absconded the claim department funds and made them over to the revolutionary committee youre in the right occupational ball park i conceded and he has apparently disappeared ive never talked to him i added carefully do you know him better than most people around here he grinned cheerfully and seemed likable despite his arrogance he supposedly did legwork for yardleyyardley mastersyou were just seen talking to him im yardleys budget manager how about a drink i suggested he looked at his watch and grinned again youve got a date little lady his name was ralph devereux he was a suburbanite who had only recently moved to the city following a divorce that left his wife in possession of their downers grove house he informed me in the elevator the only loop bar he knew was billys where the claim department hung out i suggested the golden glow a little farther west to avoid the people he knew as we walked down adams street i bought a suntimes the golden glow is an oddity in the south loop a tiny saloon dating back to the last century it still has a mahogany horseshoeshaped bar where serious drinkers sit eight or nine little tables and booths are crammed in along the walls and a couple of real tiffany lamps installed when the place was built provide a homey glow sal the bartender is a magnificent black woman close to six feet tall ive watched her break up a fight with just a word and a glanceno one messes with sal this afternoon she wore a silver pantsuit stunning she greeted me with a nod and brought a shot of black label to the booth ralph ordered a ginandtonic four oclock is a little early even for the golden glows seriousdrinking clientele and the place was mostly deserted devereux placed a fivedollar bill on the table for sal now tell me why a gorgeous lady like yourself is interested in a young kid like peter thayer i gave him back his money sal runs a tab for me i explained i thumbed through the paper the story hadnt come in soon enough for the front page but theyd given it two quarter columns on page seven radical banking heir shot the headline read thayers father was briefly mentioned in the last paragraph his four roommates and their radical activities were given the most play the ajax insurance company was not mentioned at all i folded the paper back and showed the column to devereux he glanced at it briefly then did a double take and snatched the paper from me i watched him read the story it was short and he must have gone through it several times then he looked up at me bewildered peter thayer dead what is this i dont know id like to find out you knew when you bought the paper i nodded he glanced back down at the story then at me his mobile face looked angry how did you know i found the body why the hell didnt you tell me over at ajax instead of putting me through this charade he demanded well anyone could have killed him you yardley masters his girl friend i wanted to get your reaction to the news who the hell are you my names v i warshawski im a private detective and im looking into peter thayers death i handed him a business card you youre no more a detective than i am a ballet dancer he exclaimed id like to see you in tights and a tutu i commented pulling out the plasticencased photostat of my private investigators license he studied it then shrugged without speaking i put it back in my wallet just to clear up the point mr devereux did you kill peter thayer no i goddamn did not kill him his jaw worked angrily he kept starting to talk then stopping unable to put his feelings into words i nodded at sal and she brought us a couple more drinks the bar was beginning to fill up with precommute drinkers devereux drank his second gin and relaxed somewhat id like to have seen yardleys face when you asked him if he killed peter he commented dryly i didnt ask him i couldnt figure out why he wanted to talk to me though was he really very protective of thayer thats what he intimated no he considered the question he didnt pay much attention to him but there was the family connection if peter was in trouble yardleyd feel he owed it to john thayer to look after him dead he was a hell of a nice boy his radical ideas notwithstanding jesus this is going to cut up yardley his old man too thayer didnt like the kid living where he didand now shot by some junkie how do you know his father didnt like it oh it wasnt any secret shortly after pete started with us jack thayer came storming in showing his muscle and bellowing around like a vicepresident in heathow the kid was betraying the family with his laborunion talk and why couldnt he live in a decent placei guess theyd bought a condo for him down there if you can believe that i must say the boy took it very welldidnt blow up back or anything did he work with anywell highly confidentialpapers at ajax devereux was surprised youre not trying to link his death with ajax are you i thought it was pretty clear that he was shot by one of those drug addicts who are always killing people in hyde park you make hyde park sound like the site of the tong wars mr devereux of the thirtytwo murders in the twentyfirst police district last year only six were in hyde parkone every two months i dont think peter thayer is just the neighborhoods julyaugust statistic well what makes you think its connected with ajax then i dont think so im just trying to eliminate possibilities have you ever seen a dead bodyor at least a body that got that way because of a bullet he shook his head and moved defensively in his chair well i have and you can often tell from the way the body lies whether the victim was trying to fight off the attacker well this boy was sitting at his kitchen table in a white shirtprobably ready to come down here monday morningand someone put a little hole smack in the middle of his head now a professional might have done that but even so hed have to bring along someone whom the boy knew to get his confidence it couldve been you or masters or his father or his girl friend im just trying to find out why it couldnt be you he shook his head i cant do anything to prove it except that i dont know how to handle a gunbut im not sure i could prove that to you i laughed you probably could what about masters yardley come on the guys one of the most respected people you could hope to find at ajax that doesnt preclude his being a murderer why dont you let me know more about what peter did there he protested some more but he finally agreed to tell me about his work and what peter thayer had done for him it just didnt seem to add up to murder masters was responsible for the financial side of the claim operation reserving and so on and peter had added up numbers for him checking office copies of issued drafts against known reserves for various claims adding up overhead items in the field offices to see where they were going over budget and all the dull daytoday activities that businesses need in order to keep on going and yet and yet masters had agreed to see me an unknown person and a detective besides on the spur of the moment if he hadnt known peter was in troubleor even maybe known he was deadi just couldnt believe his obligation to john thayer would make him do that i contemplated devereux was he just another pretty face or did he know anything his anger had seemed to me the result of genuine shock and bewilderment at finding out the boy was dead but anger was a good cover for other emotions too for the time being i decided to classify him as an innocent bystander devereuxs native irish cockiness was starting to returnhe began teasing me about my job i felt id gotten all i could from him until i knew enough to ask better questions so i let the matter drop and moved on to lighter subjects i signed the bar tab for salshe sends me a bill once a monthand went on to the officers mess with devereux for a protracted meal its indian and to my mind one of the most romantic restaurants in chicago they make a very nice pimms cup too coming on top of the scotch it left me with a muzzy impression of dancing at a succession of north side discos i might have had a few more drinks it was after one when i returned alone to my apartment i was glad just to fling my clothes onto a chair and fall into bed that professional touch peter thayer was protesting capitalist oppression by running wildly up and down the halls at ajax while anita mcgraw stood to one side carrying a picket sign and smiling ralph devereux came out of his office and shot thayer the shot reverberated in the halls it kept ringing and ringing and i tried seizing the gun from devereux and throwing it away but the sound continued and i jerked awake the doorbell was shrilling furiously i slid out of bed and pulled on jeans and a shirt as a loud knock sounded the fuzziness in my mouth and eyes told me id had one or two scotches too many too late in the evening before i stumbled to the front room and looked through the peephole as heavy fists hammered the door again two men were outside both beefy with jacket sleeves too short and hair crewcut i didnt know the younger one on the right but the older one on the left was bobby mallory homicide lieutenant from the twentyfirst district i fumbled the lock open and tried to smile sunnily morning bobby what a nice surprise good morning vicki sorry to drag you out of bed mallory said with heavy humor not at all bobbyim always glad to see you bobby mallory had been my dads closest friend on the force theyd started on the same beat together back in the thirties and bobby hadnt forgotten tony even after promotions had moved him out of my dads work life i usually have thanksgiving dinner with him and eileen his warmly maternal wife and his six children and four grandchildren most of the time bobby tries to pretend im not working or at least not working as an investigator now he was looking past me not at me this is sergeant john mcgonnigal he said heartily waving his arm loosely in mcgonnigals direction wed like to come in and ask you a few questions certainly i said politely wishing my hair werent sticking out in different directions all over my head nice to meet you sergeant im v i warshawski mcgonnigal and i shook hands and i stood back to let them into the small entryway the hallway behind us leads straight back to the bathroom with the bedroom and living rooms opening off to the right and the dining room and kitchen to the left this way in the mornings i can stumble straight from bedroom to bathroom to kitchen i took bobby and mcgonnigal to the kitchen and put on some coffee i casually whisked some crumbs off the kitchen table and rummaged in the refrigerator for pumpernickel and cheddar cheese behind me bobby said you ever clean up this dump eileen is a fanatical housekeeper if she didnt love to watch people eat youd never see a dirty dish in their house ive been working i said with what dignity i could muster and i cant afford a housekeeper mallory looked around in disgust you know if tony had turned you over his knee more often instead of spoiling you rotten youd be a happy housewife now instead of playing at detective and making it harder for us to get our job done but im a happy detective bobby and i made a lousy housewife that was true my brief foray into marriage eight years ago had ended in an acrimonious divorce after fourteen months some men can only admire independent women at a distance being a detective is not a job for a girl like you vickiits not fun and games ive told you this a million times now youve got yourself messed up in a murder they were going to send althans out to talk to you but i pulled my rank to get the assignment that still means youve got to talk i want to know what you were doing messing around with the thayer boy thayer boy i echoed grow up vicki mallory advised we got a pretty good description of you from that dopedout specimen on the second floor you talked to on your way into the building drucker who took the squeal thought it might be your voice when he heard the description and you left your thumbprint on the kitchen table i always said crime didnt pay bobby you guys want some coffee or eggs or anything we already ate clown working people cant stay in bed like sleeping beauty it was only i noticed looking at the wooden clock next to the back door no wonder my head felt so woolly i methodically sliced cheese green peppers and onions put them on the pumpernickel and put the openfaced sandwich under the broiler i kept my back to bobby and the sergeant while i waited for the cheese to melt then transferred the whole thing to a plate and poured myself a cup of coffee from his breathing i could tell bobbys temper was mounting his face was red by the time i put my food on the table and straddled a chair opposite him i know very little about the thayer boy bobby i apologized i know he used to be a student at the university of chicago and that hes dead now and i knew hes dead because i read it in the suntimes dont be cute with me vicki you know hes dead because you found the body i swallowed a mouthful of toasted cheese and green pepper well i assumed after reading the suntimes story that the boy was thayer but i certainly didnt know that when i saw the body to me he seemed to be just another corpse snuffed out in the springtime of life i added piously spare me his funeral oration and tell me what brought you down there mallory demanded you know me bobbyi have an instinct for crime where evil flourishes there i will be on my selfappointed mission to stamp it out mallory turned redder mcgonnigal coughed diffidently and changed the subject before his boss hemorrhaged do you have a client of some kind miss warshawski he asked of course id seen this one coming but i still wasnt sure what i wanted to do however she who hesitates is lost in the detective biz so i opted for partial disclosure i was hired to get peter thayer to agree to go to business school mallory choked im not lying bobby i said earnestly i went down there to meet the kid and the door to his apartment was open so i when you got there or after youd picked the lock mallory interrupted so i went in i continued anyway i guess i failed in my assignment since i dont think peter thayer will ever go to business school im not sure i still have a client who hired you vicki mallory was talking more quietly now john thayer now why would john thayer want to hire me bobby you tell me that vicki maybe he wanted some dirt to use as a lever to pry the kid off those potheads down there i swallowed the rest of my coffee and looked at mallory squarely a guy came to me night before last and told me he was john thayer he wanted me to find his sons girl friend anita anita hill theres no anita hill in that setup mcgonnigal volunteered theres an anita mcgraw it looks like he was sharing a room with a girl but the whole setup is so unisex you cant tell who was with who whom i said absently mcgonnigal looked blank you cant tell who was with whom sergeant i explained mallory made explosive noises anyway i added hastily i was beginning to suspect that the guy had sent me on a wildgoose chase when i found there was no anita hill at the university later i was sure of it why mallory demanded i got a copy of thayers picture from the fort dearborn bank and trust he wasnt my client vicki mallory said i think youre a pain in the butt i think tony would turn in his grave if he knew what you were doing but youre not a fool dont tell me you didnt ask for any identification he gave me his card and his home phone and a retainer i figured i could get back to him let me see the card mallory demanded suspicious bastard its his card i said could i please see it anyway tone of father barely restraining himself with recalcitrant child it wont tell you anything it didnt tell me bobby i dont believe he gave you a card mallory said you knew the guy and youre covering for him i shrugged and went to the bedroom and got the card out of my top drawer i wiped it clean of prints with a scarf and brought it back to mallory the fort dearborn logo was in the lower lefthand corner john l thayer executive vicepresident trust was in the middle with his phone number on the bottom i had scribbled the alleged home number mallory grunted with satisfaction and put it in a plastic bag i didnt tell him the only prints on it at this point were mine why spoil one of his few pleasures mallory leaned forward what are you going to do next well i dont know i got paid some money to find a girl and i feel like i ought to find her you going to ask for a revelation vicki mallory said with heavy humor or do you have something to go on i might talk to some people vicki if you know anything that youre not telling me in connection with this murder youll be the first to know bobby i promised that wasnt exactly a lie because i didnt know for sure that ajax was involved in the murderbut we all have our own ideas on whats connected to what vicki were on the case you dont have to prove anything to me about how cute or clever you are but do me a favordo a favor for tonylet sergeant mcgormigal and me find the murderer i stared limpidly at bobby he leaned forward earnestly vicki what did you notice about the body hed been shot bobby i didnt do a postmortem vicki for two cents id kick you in your cute little behind youve made a career out of something which no nice girl would touch but youre no dummy i know when yougot yourself into that apartmentand well overlook just how you got in there right nowyou didnt scream or throw up the way any decent girl would you looked the place over and if something didnt strike you straight off about that corpus you deserve to go out and get your head blown off i sighed and slouched back in the chair okay bobby the kid was set up no dopecrazed radical fired that shot someone he knew whom he would invite to sit down for a cup of coffee had to be there to my mind a pro fired the shot because it was perfectly donejust one bullet and right on the targetbut someone he knew had to be along or it could have been an acquaintance whos a heck of a marksman you looking into his family mallory ignored my question i figured youd work that out its because youre smart enough to see how dangerous this thing could be that im asking you to leave it alone i yawned mallory was determined not to lose his temper look vicki stay out of that mess i can smell organized crime organized labor a whole lot of organizations that you shouldnt mess with you figure because the boys got radical friends and waves some posters hes glued into organized labor come on bobby mallorys struggle between the desire to get me out of the thayer case and the need to keep police secrets to himself showed on his face finally he said we have evidence that the kids were getting some of their posters from a firm which does most of the printing for the knifegrinders i shook my head sorrowfully terrible the international brotherhood of knifegrinders was notorious for their underworld connections theyd hired muscle in the roughandtumble days of the thirties and had never been able to get rid of them since as a result most of their elections and a lot of their finances were corrupt andand suddenly it dawned on me who my elusive client was why anita mcgraws name sounded familiar and why the guy had picked me out of the yellow pages i leaned farther back in my chair but said nothing mallorys face turned red vicki if i find you crossing my path on this case im going to turn you in for your own good he stood so violently that his chair turned over he motioned to sergeant mcgonnigal and the two slammed the door behind them i poured myself another cup of coffee and took it into the bathroom with me where i dumped a generous dollop of azuree mineral salts into the tub and ran myself a hot bath as i sank into it the aftereffects of my latenight drinking seeping out of my bones i recalled a night more than twenty years ago my mother was putting me to bed when the doorbell rang and the man who lived in the apartment below us staggered in a burly man my dads age maybe youngerall big men seem old to little girls id peeped around the door because everyone was making such a commotion and seen him covered with blood before my mother rounded on me and hustled me into the bedroom she stayed there with me and together we heard snatches of conversation the man had been shot possibly by managementhired thugs but he was afraid to go to the police officially because hed hired thugs himself and would my dad help him tony did fixing up the wound but he ordered himunusual in a man usually so gentleto leave the neighborhood and never come around to us again the man was andrew mcgraw id never seen him again never even connected him with the mcgraw who was now president of local and hence in effect of the whole union but hed obviously remembered my dad i guessed hed tried to reach tony at the police and when hed learned my dad was dead had pulled me out of the yellow pages assuming i would be tonys son well i wasnt i was his daughter and not the easygoing type my dad had been i had my italian mothers drive and i try to emulate her insistence on fighting battles to the finish but regardless of what kind of person i was mcgraw might be finding himself now in trouble of the kind that not even easygoing tony would have helped him out of i drank some more coffee and flexed my toes in the water the bath shimmered turquoise but clear i peered through it at my feet trying to figure out what i knew mcgraw had a daughter she probably loved him since she seemed dedicated to the labor movement children usually do not espouse causes or careers of parents they hate had she disappeared or was he hiding her did he know who had killed young peter and had she run away because of this or did he think shed killed the boy most murders i reminded myself were committed between loved ones which made her statistically the oddson favorite what were mcgraws connections with the hired muscle with whom the international brotherhood lived so cozily how easily could he have hired someone to fire that shot he was someone the boy would let in and talk to no matter what their feelings for each other were because mcgraw was his girl friends father the bathwater was warm but i shivered as i finished my coffee you cant scare me im sticking to the union the headquarters of the international brotherhood of knifegrinders shear edgers and blade sharpeners is located on sheridan road just south of evanston the tenstory building was put up about five years ago and is sided with white italian marble the only other building in chicago built with such opulence is the headquarters for standard of indiana i figured that put the brotherhoods excess profits on a par with those of the oil industry local headquarters was on the ninth floor i gave the floor receptionist my card mr mcgraw is expecting me i told her i was shunted down the north corridor mcgraws secretary was guarding the entrance to a lakeside office in an antechamber that would have done louis xiv proud i wondered how the international brothers felt when they saw what their dues had built for them or maybe there were some beatenup offices lower down for entertaining the rankandfile i gave my card to the secretary a middleaged woman with gray sausage curls and a redandwhite dress that revealed an unlovely sag in her upper arms i keep thinking i should lift fivepound weights to firm up my triceps looking at her i wondered if i would have time to stop at stans sporting goods on my way home to pick up some barbells i have an appointment with mr mcgraw youre not in the book she said abruptly not really looking at me i had on my navy raw silk suit with the blouson jacket i looked stunning in this outfit and thought i deserved a little more attention must be those sagging triceps i smiled im sure you know as well as i do that mr mcgraw conducts some of his business on his own he arranged to see me privately mr mcgraw may sometimes take up with whores she said her face red her eyes on her desktop but this is the first time hes ever asked one up to his office i restrained an impulse to brain her with her desk lamp goodlooking lady like you in his front office he doesnt need outside talent now will you please inform mr mcgraw that im here her shapeless face shook under the thick pancake mr mcgraw is in conference and cant be disturbed her voice trembled i felt like a creepi couldnt find a girl or a murderer but i sure knew how to rough up middleaged secretaries mcgraws office was soundproofed but noise of the conference came into the antechamber quite a conference i was about to announce my intention of sitting and waiting when one sentence rose above the din and penetrated the rosewood door goddamnit you set my son up how many people could possibly have sons who might have been set up in the last fortyeight hours and be connected with the knifegrinders maybe more than one but the odds were against it with the sausage curls protesting loudly i opened the door into the inner office not as large as masterss but by no means shabby it overlooked lake michigan and a nice little private beach at the moment it was none too peaceful two men had been sitting at a round table in the corner but one was on his feet yelling to make his point even with his face distorted by anger i didnt have any trouble recognizing the original of the picture in the fort dearborn trusts annual report and rising to his feet and yelling back as i entered was surely my client short squat without being fat and wearing a shiny gray suit they both stopped cold as they saw me what the hell are you doing in here my client roared mildred sausage curls waddled in her eyes gleaming i told her you wouldnt want to see her but no she has to come barging in like shes mr mcgraw i am v i warshawski i pitched my voice to penetrate the din and you may not want to see me but i look like an angel compared to a couple of homicide dicks whore going to be after you pretty soon hi mr thayer i added holding out a hand im sorry about your sonim the person who found the body its all right mildred mcgraw said weakly i know this lady and i do want to talk to her mildred gave me a furious look then turned and stalked out shutting the door with what seemed unnecessary violence mr thayer what makes you think mr mcgraw set your son up i asked conversationally seating myself in a leather armchair in a corner the banker had recovered himself the anger had smoothed out of his face leaving it dignified and blank mcgraws daughter was going out with my son he said smiling a little when i learned my boy was dead had been shot i just stepped in to see if mcgraw knew anything about it i dont think he set peter up mcgraw was too angry to play along with thayer the hell you say he yelled his husky voice rising ever since annie started hanging around with that wheyfaced north shore pipsqueak youve been coming around here calling her names calling me names now the kid is dead youre trying to smear her well by god you wont get away with it all right thayer snapped if thats the way you want to play ball thats how well play it your daughteri saw the kind of girl she was the first time i set eyes on her peter never had a chanceinnocent young kid high ideals giving up everything his mother and i had planned for him for the sake of a girl whod hop into bed with watch what names you call my daughter mcgraw growled i practically begged mcgraw here to leash his daughter thayer continued i might as well have saved my pride this type of person doesnt respond to any human feeling he and his daughter had earmarked peter for some kind of setup because he came from a wealthy family then when they couldnt get any money out of him they killed him mcgraw was turning purple have you shared this theory with the police mr thayer i asked if you have thayer ill have your ass in court for slander mcgraw put in dont threaten me mcgraw thayer growled john wayne impersonation have you shared this theory with the police mr thayer i repeated he flushed slightly under his careful tan no i didnt want it blurted all over the newspapersi didnt want any of my neighbors to see what the boy was up to i nodded but youre really convinced that mr mcgraw hereandor his daughterset up peter and had him shot yes i am damnit and have you any evidence to support this allegation i asked no he doesnt goddamnit mcgraw yelled no one could support such a goddamn asshole statement anita was in love with that north shore snot i told her that it was a colossal mistake get involved with the bosses and you get your ass burned and now look whats happened it seemed to me that the bosses had been the ones to get burned in this case but i didnt think it would do any good to mention it did you give mr mcgraw one of your business cards when you were here before i asked thayer i dont know he said impatiently i probably gave one to his secretary when i arrived anyway what business is it of yours i smiled im a private investigator mr thayer and im investigating a private matter for mr mcgraw here he showed me one of your business cards the other night and i wondered where he got it mcgraw shifted uncomfortably thayer stared at him with a look of disbelief you showed her one of my cards why the hell did you do that for that matter why were you talking to a private investigator at all i had my reasons mcgraw looked embarrassed but he also looked mean i bet you did thayer said heavily he turned to me what are you doing for mcgraw i shook my head my clients pay for privacy what kinds of things do you investigate thayer asked divorces most people think of divorce when they meet a private detective frankly divorce is pretty slimy i do a lot of industrial cases you know edward purcell the man who used to be chairman of transicon thayer nodded i know of him anyway i did that investigation he hired me because his board was pressuring him to find out where the disposable assets were going unfortunately he didnt cover his tracks well enough before he hired me purcells subsequent suicide and the reorganization of a badly damaged transicon had been a tenday wonder in chicago thayer leaned over me in that case what are you doing for mcgraw he lacked mcgraws raw menace but he too was a powerful man used to intimidating others the force of his personality was directed at me and i sat up straight to resist it what business is it of yours mr thayer he gave me the frown that got obedience from his junior trust officers if he gave you my card its my business it didnt have anything to do with you mr thayer thats right thayer mcgraw growled now get your ass out of my office thayer turned back to mcgraw and i relaxed slightly youre not trying to smear me with any of your dirty business are you mcgraw watch it thayer my name and my operation have been cleared in every court in this country in congress too dont give me that crap yeah congress cleared you lucky wasnt it the way derek bernstein died right before the senate hearings began mcgraw walked right up to the banker you sob you get out of here now or ill get some people to throw you out in a way thatll pop your highandmighty executive dignity for you im not afraid of your thugs mcgraw dont threaten me oh come on i snapped both of you are tough as all get out and youre both frightening me to pieces so can you cut out this littleboy stuff why do you care so much about it mr thayer mr mcgraw here may have tossed a business card of yours aroundbut he hasnt tried to smear your name with his dirty businessif hes got dirty business you got something on your conscience thats making you so upset or do you just have to prove youre the toughest guy in any crowd youre in watch what you say to me young lady ive got a lot of powerful friends in this city and they can thats what i mean i interrupted your powerful friends can take away my license no doubt but why do you care he was silent for a minute finally he said just be careful what you get into with mcgraw here the courts may have cleared him but hes into a lot of ugly business all right ill be careful he gave me a sour look and left mcgraw looked at me approvingly you handled him just right warshawski i ignored that why did you give me a fake name the other night mcgraw and why did you give your daughter a different phony one howd you find me anyway once i saw the mcgraw name it began stirring in the back of my mind i remembered you from the night you were shotit came back to me when lieutenant mallory mentioned the knifegrinders whyd you come to me to begin with you think my dad might help you out the way he did back then what are you talking about oh can it mcgraw i was there you may not remember mebut i remember you you came in absolutely covered with blood and my dad fixed up your shoulder and got you out of the building did you think hed help you out of whatever trouble youre in this time until you found out he was dead then whatyou found my name in the yellow pages and thought maybe i was tonys son now why did you use thayers name the fight died down in him a bit i wasnt sure youd do a job for me if you knew who i was but why thayer why drag in the senior guy in chicagos biggest bank why not just call yourself joe blow i dont know it was just an impulse i guess impulse youre not that dumb he could sue you for slander or something dragging his name in like that then why the hell did you let him know id done it youre on my payroll no im not youve hired me to do some independent professional work but im not on your payroll which brings us to the original question whatd you hire me for anyway to find my daughter then why did you give her a false name how could i possibly look for her no i think you hired me to find the body now look here warshawski you look mcgraw its so obvious you knew the kid was dead when did you find out or did you shoot him yourself his eyes disappeared in his heavy face and he pushed close to me dont talk smart with me warshawski my heart beat faster but i didnt back away when did you find the body he stared at me another minute then halfsmiled youre no softie i dont object to a lady with guts i was worried about anita she usually calls me on monday evening and when she didnt i thought i should go down and check up on her you know what a dangerous neighborhood that is you know mr mcgraw it continues to astonish me the number of people who think the university of chicago is in an unsafe neighborhood why parents ever send their children to school there at all amazes me now lets have a little more honesty you knew anita had disappeared when you came to see me or you would never have given me her picture you are worried about her and you want her found do you think she killed the boy that got an explosive reaction no i dont goddamnit if you must know she came home from work tuesday night and found his dead body she called me in a panic and then she disappeared did she accuse you of killing him why should she do that he was bellicose but uncomfortable i can think of lots of reasons you hated young thayer thought your daughter was selling out to the bosses so in a mistaken fit of paternal anxiety you killed the kid thinking it would restore your daughter to you instead youre crazy warshawski no parent is that cuckoo ive seen lots of kookier parents but decided not to argue that point well i said you dont like that idea try this one peter somehow got wind of some shady possibly even criminal activities that you and the knifegrinders are involved in he communicated his fears to anita but being in love he wouldnt welch on you to the cops on the other hand being young and idealistic he had to confront you and he couldnt be bought you shot himor had him shotand anita knew it had to be you so she did a bunk mcgraws nerves were acting up again but he blustered and bellowed and called me names finally he said why in sam hill would i want you to find my daughter if all shed do is finger me i dont know maybe you were playing the oddsfiguring youve been close and she wouldnt turn on you trouble is the police are going to be making the connection between you and anita before too long they know the kids had some tiein with the brotherhood because there was some literature around the house created by your printer theyre not dummies and everyone knows youre head of the union and they know there was a mcgraw in the apartment when they come around theyre not going to care about your daughter or your relationship with her theyve got a murder to solve and theyll be happy to tag you with itespecially with a guy in thayers position pressuring them now if you tell me what you know i mayno promises but maybe able to salvage you and your daughterif youre not guilty of course mcgraw studied the floor for a while i realized id been clutching the arms of the chair while i was talking and carefully relaxed my muscles finally he looked up at me and said if i tell you something will you promise not to take it to the police i shook my head cant promise anything mr mcgraw id lose my license if i kept knowledge of a crime to myself not that kind of knowledge damnit goddamnit warshawski you keep acting like i committed the goddamn murder or something he breathed heavily for a few minutes finally he said i just want to tell you aboutyoure right i didi wasi did find the kids body he choked that out and the rest came easier annieanitacalled me monday night she wasnt in the apartment she wouldnt say where she was he shifted a bit in his chair anitas a good levelheaded kid she never got any special pampering as a child and she grew up knowing how to be independent she and i are well were pretty close and shes always been union all the way but shes no clinging daddys girl and i never wanted her to be one tuesday night i hardly recognized her she was pretty damn near hysterical yelling a lot of halfassed stuff which didnt make any sense at all but she didnt mention the kids murder what was she yelling i asked conversationally oh just nonsense i couldnt make anything out of it same song second verse i remarked what same as the first i explained a little bit louder and a little bit worse once and for all she didnt accuse me of killing peter thayer he yelled at the top of his lungs we werent moving too quickly okay she didnt accuse you of murdering peter did she tell you about his being dead he stopped for a minute if he said yes the next question was why had the girl done a bunk if she didnt think mcgraw had committed the murder no like i said she was just hysterical shewell later after i saw the body i figured she was calling because ofof well that he stopped again but this time it was to collect some memories she hung up and i tried calling back but there wasnt any answer so i went down to see for myself and i found the boy howd you get in i asked curiously i have a key annie gave it to me when she moved in but id never used it before he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a key i looked at it and shrugged that was tuesday night he nodded and you waited til wednesday night to come to see me i waited all day hoping that someone else would find the body when no report came outyou were right you know he smiled ruefully and his whole face became more attractive i hoped that tony was still alive i hadnt talked to him for years hed warned me off good and proper over the stellinek episodedidnt know old tony had it in himbut he was the only guy i could think of who might help me why didnt you call the cops yourself i asked his face closed up again i didnt want to he said shortly i thought about it you probably wanted your own source of information on the case and you didnt think your police contacts could help you he didnt disagree do the knifegrinders have any pension money tied up with the fort dearborn trust i asked mcgraw turned red again keep your goddamn mitts out of our pension fund warshawski we have enough snoopers smelling around there to guarantee it grade a pure for the next century i dont need you too do you have any financial dealings with the fort dearborn trust he was getting so angry i wondered what nerve id touched but he denied it emphatically what about the ajax insurance company well what about them he demanded i dont know mr mcgrawdo you buy any insurance from them i dont know his face was set and he was eyeing me hard and cold the way he no doubt had eyed young timmy wright of kansas city local when timmy had tried to talk to him about running a clean election down there timmy had shown up in the missouri river two weeks later it was much more menacing than his redfaced bluster i wondered well what about your pensions ajax is big in the pension business goddamnit warshawski get out of the office you were hired to find anita not to ask a lot of questions about something that isnt any of your goddamned business now get out and dont come back you want me to find anita i asked mcgraw suddenly deflated and put his head in his hands oh jeez i dont know what to do i looked at him sympathetically someone got you in the squeeze he just shook his head but wouldnt answer we sat it out in silence for a while then he looked at me and he looked gray warshawski i dont know where annie is and i dont want to know but i want you to find her and when you do just let me know if shes all right heres another five hundred dollars to keep you on for a whole week come to me when it runs out it wasnt a formal apology but i accepted it and left i stopped at barbs barbq for some lunch and called my answering service there was a message from ralph devereux at ajax would i meet him at the cartwheel at tonight i called him and asked if he had discovered anything about peter thayers work look he said will you tell me your first name how the hell can i keep on addressing someone as vi the british do it all the time what have you found out nothing im not lookingtheres nothing to find that kid wasnt working on sensitive stuff and you know whyvi because insurance companies dont run to sensitive stuff our product how we manufacture it and what we charge for it are only regulated by about sixtyseven state and federal agencies ralph my first name is victoria my friends call me vic never vicki i know insurance isnt your highsensitivity businessbut it offers lots of luscious opportunities for embezzlement a pregnant silence no he finally said at leastnot here we dont have any checksigning or authorizing responsibility i thought that one over do you know if ajax handles any of the knifegrinders pension money the knifegrinders he echoed what earthly connection does that set of hoodlums have with peter thayer i dont know but do you have any of their pension money i doubt it this is an insurance company not a mob hangout well could you find out for me and could you find out if they buy any insurance from you we sell all kinds of insurance vicbut not much that a union would buy why not look he said its a long story meet me at the cartwheel at seven thirty and ill give you chapter and verse on it okay i agreed but look into it for me anyway please whats the i stand for none of your goddamn business i hung up i stood for iphigenia my italian mother had been devoted to victor emmanuel this passion and her love of opera had led her to burden me with an insane name i drank a fresca and ordered a chefs salad i wanted ribs and fries but the memory of mildreds sagging arms stopped me the salad didnt do much for me i sternly put french fries out of my mind and pondered events anita mcgraw had called up andat a minimumtold her father about the murder my bet was shed accused him of being involved ergo peter had found out something disreputable about the knifegrinders and had told her he probably found it out at ajax but possibly from the bank i loved the idea of pensions the loyal alliance pension fund got lots of publicity for their handling or mishandling of knifegrinder pension money but twenty million or so could easily have been laid off on a big bank or insurance company and pension money gave one so much scope for fraudulent activity why had mcgraw gone down to the apartment well in the first place he knew whatever discreditable secret thayer had uncovered he was afraid that anita was probably in on ityoung lovers dont keep much to themselves and if she called up because shed found her boyfriend with a hole in his head mcgraw probably figured shed be next daughter or no daughter so he went racing down to hyde park terrified hed find her dead body too instead shed vanished so far so good now if i could find anita id know the secret or if i found the secret i could publicize it which would take the heat off the girl and maybe persuade her to return it sounded good what about thayer though why had mcgraw used his card and why had this upset him so much just the principle of the thing i ought to talk to him alone i paid my bill and headed back to hyde park the college political science department was on the fourth floor of one of the older campus buildings on a hot summer afternoon the hallways were empty through the windows along the stairwell i could see knots of students lying on the grass some reading some sleeping a few energetic boys were playing frisbee an irish setter loped around trying to catch the disk a student was tending the desk in the department office he looked about seventeen his long blond hair hanging over his forehead but no beardhe didnt appear ready to grow one yet he was wearing a tshirt with a hole under the left arm and was sitting hunched over a book he looked up reluctantly when i said hello but kept the book open on his lap i smiled pleasantly and told him i was looking for anita mcgraw he gave me a hostile look and turned back to his book without speaking come on whats wrong with asking for her shes a student in the department right he refused to look up i felt my temper rising but i wondered if mallory had been here before me have the police been around asking for her you ought to know he muttered not looking up you think just because im not wearing sloppy blue jeans im with the police i asked how about digging out a departmental course list for me he didnt move i stepped around to his side of the desk and pulled open a drawer okay okay he said huffily he put the book spine up on the desktop capitalism and freedom by marcuse i might have guessed he rummaged through the drawer and pulled out a ninepage list typed and mimeographed labeled college time schedule summer i flipped through it to the political science section their summer schedule filled a page class titles included such things as the concept of citizenship in aristotle and plato idealism from descartes through berkeley and superpower politics and the idea of weltverschwinden fascinating finally i found one that sounded more promising the capitalist standoff big labor versus big business someone who taught a course like that would surely attract a young labor organizer like anita mcgraw and might even know who some of her friends were the instructors name was harold weinstein i asked the youth where weinsteins office was he hunched further into marcuse and pretended not to hear i came around the desk again and sat on it facing him and grabbed his shirt collar and jerked his face up so that i could see his eyes i know you think youre doing the revolution a great service by not revealing anitas whereabouts to the pigs i said pleasantly perhaps when her body is found in a car trunk you will invite me to the party where you celebrate upholding your code of honor in the face of unendurable oppression i shook him a bit now tell me where to find harold weinsteins office you dont have to tell her anything howard someone said behind me and you he said to me dont be surprised when students equate police with fascismi saw you roughing up that boy the speaker was thin with hot brown eyes and a mop of unruly hair he was wearing a blue work shirt tucked neatly into a pair of khaki jeans mr weinstein i said affably letting go of howards shirt he stared at me with his hands on his hips brooding it looked pretty noble im not with the policeim a private detective and when i ask anyone a civil question i like to get a civil answer not an arrogant shrug of the shoulders anitas father andrew mcgraw hired me to find her i have a feeling which he shares that she may be in bad trouble shall we go somewhere and talk about it you have a feeling do you he said heavily well go feel about it somewhere else we dont like policepublic or privateon this campus he turned to stalk back down the corridor well executed i applauded youve been studying al pacino now that youve finished emoting could we talk about anita the back of his neck turned red and the color spread to his ears but he stopped what about her im sure you know shes disappeared mr weinstein you may also know that her boyfriend peter thayer is dead i am trying to find her in the hopes of keeping her from sharing his fate i paused to let him absorb it my guess is that shes hiding out someplace and she thinks she wont be found by whoever killed him but im afraid shes crossed the path of an ugly type of killer the kind that has a lot of money and can buy his way past most hideouts he turned so that i could see his profile dont worry philip marlowethey wont bribe me into revealing her whereabouts i wondered hopefully if he could be tortured into talking aloud i said do you know where she is no comment do you know any of her good friends around here no comment gee youre helpful mr weinsteinyoure my favorite prof i wish youd taught here when i went to school i pulled out my card and gave it to him if you ever feel like commenting call me at this number back outside in the heat i felt depressed my navy silk suit was stunning but too heavy for the weather i was sweating probably ruining the fabric under the arms besides i seemed to be alienating everyone whose path i crossed i wished id smashed in howards face a circular stone bench faced the college building i walked over to it and sat down maybe id give up on this stupid case industrial espionage was more my speed not a corrupt union and a bunch of snotty kids maybe id use the thousand dollars mcgraw had given me to spend the summer on the michigan peninsula maybe that would make him angry enough to send someone after me with cement leggings the divinity school was just behind me i sighed pulled myself to my feet and moved into its stonewalled coolness a coffee shop used to serve overboiled coffee and tepid lemonade in the basement i made my way downstairs and found the place still in operation there was something reassuring in this continuity and in the sameness of the young faces behind the makeshift counter kindly and naive they preached a lot of violent dogma believed that burglars had a right to the goods they took because of their social oppression and yet would be rocked to their roots if someone ever required them to hold a machine gun themselves i took a coke and retired to a dark corner with it the chairs werent comfortable but i pulled my knees up to my chin and leaned against the wall about a dozen students were seated around the wobbly tables some of them trying to read in the dim light most of them talking snatches of conversation reached me of course if youre going to look at it dialectically the only thing they can do is i told her if she didnt put her foot down hed yeah but schopenhauer says i dozed off i was jerked awake a few seconds later by a loud voice saying did you hear about peter thayer i looked up the speaker a plump young woman with wild red hair wearing an illfitting peasant blouse had just come into the room she dumped her book bag on the floor and joined a table of three in the middle of the room i was just coming out of class when ruth yonkers told me i got up and bought another coke and sat down at a table behind the redhead a thin youth with equally wild but dark hair was saying oh yeah the cops were all over the political science office this morning you know he was living with anita mcgraw and she hasnt been seen since sunday weinstein really told them off he added admiringly do they think she killed him the redhead asked a dark somewhat older woman snorted anita mcgraw ive known her for two years she might off a cop but she wouldnt shoot her boyfriend do you know him mary the redhead breathed no mary answered shortly i never met him anita belongs to university women unitedthats how i know her so does geraldine harata her other roommate but geraldines away for the summer if she wasnt the cops would probably suspect her they always pick on women first im surprised you let her into uwu if she has a boyfriend a bearded young man put in he was heavy and sloppyhis tshirt gaped revealing an unlovely expanse of stomach mary looked at him haughtily and shrugged not everyone in uwu is a lesbian the redhead bristled with so many men like bob around its hard to understand why not mary drawled the fat youth flushed and muttered something of which castrating was the only word i caught but i never met anita the redhead continued i only started going to uwu meetings in may has she really disappeared mary mary shrugged again if the pigs are trying to put peter thayers death off on her i wouldnt be surprised maybe she went home bob suggested no the thin youth said if shed done that the police wouldnt have been around here looking for her well mary said i for one hope they dont catch up with her she got up i have to go listen to bertram drone on about medieval culture one more crack about witches as hysterical women and hell find himself attacked by some after class she hoisted a knapsack over her left shoulder and ambled off the others settled closer to the table and switched to an animated discussion of homo versus heterosexual relationships poor bob favored the latter but didnt seem to get many opportunities for actively demonstrating it the thin boy vigorously defended lesbianism i listened in amusement college students had enthusiastic opinions about so many topics at four the boy behind the counter announced he was closing people started gathering up their books the three i was listening to continued their discussion for a few minutes until the counterman called over hey folks i want to get out of here they reluctantly picked up their book bags and moved toward the stairs i threw out my paper cup and slowly followed them out at the top of the stairs i touched the redheads arm she stopped and looked at me her face friendly and ingenuous i heard you mention uwu i said can you tell me where they meet are you new on campus she asked im an old student but i find i have to spend some time down here this summer i answered truthfully well we have a room in a building at fiftyseven thirtyfive university its one of those old homes the university has taken over uwu meets there on tuesday nights and other womens activities go on during the rest of the week i asked her about their womens center it was clearly not large but better than nothing at all which was what wed had in my college days when even women radicals treated womens liberation as a dirty phrase they had a womens health counseling group courses on selfdefense and they sponsored rap groups and the weekly university women united meetings we had been moving across campus toward the midway where my car was parked i offered her a ride home and she flung herself puppylike into the front seat talking vigorously if ingenuously about womens oppression she wanted to know what i did freelance work mostly for corporations i said expecting more probing but she took that happily enough asking if i would be taking photographs i realized she assumed that i must be a freelance writer i was afraid if i told her the truth she would tell everyone at uwu and make it impossible for me to find any answers about anita yet i didnt want to tell glaring lies because if the truth did come out these young radical women would be even more hostile so i said no photographs and asked her if she did any photography herself she was still chattering cheerfully when we pulled up in front of her apartment im gail sugarman she announced as she struggled clumsily out of the car how do you do gail i replied politely im vi warshawski veeyai she exclaimed what an unusual name is it african no i answered gravely its italian driving off i could see her in the rearview mirror scrambling up the front steps of her apartment she made me feel incredibly old even at twenty i had never possessed that naive bouncing friendliness and now it made me feel cynical and remote in fact i felt a bit ashamed of deceiving her gold coast blues lake shore drive long one large pothole was being dug up and repaired only two northbound lanes were open and the traffic was backed up for miles i decided to cut off onto the stevenson expressway going west and then back north on the kennedy which went up the industrial north side toward the airport the rushhour traffic was exacerbated by the load of people trying to get out of town on a stifling friday night it took me over an hour to fight my way to the belmont exit and then fifteen blocks east to my apartment by the time i got there all i could think of was a tall cool drink and a long soothing shower i hadnt noticed anyone coming up the stairs behind me and was turning my key in the lock when i felt an arm on my shoulder id been mugged once before in this hallway whirling reflexively i snapped my knee and kicked in one motion delivering directly onto my assailants exposed shinbone he grunted and backed off but came back with a solid punch aimed at my face i ducked and took it on the left shoulder a lot of the zip was gone but it shook me a little and i drew away he was a short stocky man wearing an illfitting plaid jacket he was panting a little which pleased me it meant he was out of shape and a woman has better odds against an outofshape man i waited for him to move or run away instead he drew a gun i stood still if this is a holdup i only have thirteen dollars in my purse not worth killing for im not interested in your money i want you to come with me come with you where i asked youll find out when we get there he waved the gun at me and pointed down the stairs with his other arm beats me why wellpaid hoods always dress so sloppily i commented your jacket doesnt fit your shirts untuckedyou look like a mess now if you were a policeman i could understand it they he cut me off with an enraged bellow i dont need a goddamn broad to tell me how to dress he seized my arm with unnecessary force and started to hustle me down the stairs he was holding me too close though i was able to turn slightly and bring my hand up with a short strong chop under his gun wrist he let go of me but didnt drop the gun i followed through with a halfturn that brought my right elbow under his armpit and made a wedge of my right fist and forearm i drove it into his ribs with my left hand palm open and heard a satisfying pop that told me id hit home between the fifth and sixth ribs and separated them he yelled in pain and dropped the gun i reached for it but he had enough sense to step on my hand i butted him in the stomach with my head and he let go but i was off balance and sat down hard someone was clattering up the stairs behind me and i only had time to swing my foot and kick the gun away before turning to see who it was i thought it might be a neighbor roused by the noise but it seemed to be a partner dressed nearly to match the first hood but bigger he saw his buddy leaning against the wall moaning and hurled himself onto me we rolled and i got both hands under his chin forcing his neck back he let go but clobbered me on the right side of my head it shook me all the way down my back but i didnt give in to it i kept rolling and leaped up with my back to the wall i didnt want to give him time to draw a gun so i grasped the paneling behind me for leverage and swung my feet at his chest knocking him off balance but falling on top of him he got another good punch in to my shoulder just missing the jaw before i wiggled away he was stronger but i was in better shape and more agile and i was on my feet way in advance of him kicking him hard over his left kidney he collapsed at that and i was hauling back to do it again when his partner recovered himself enough to pick up his gun and clip me under the left ear my kick connected at the same time and then i was falling falling but remembering to fall rolling and rolling off the edge of the world i wasnt out long but long enough for them to hustle me downstairs good work for two partially disabled men i guessed any neighbors alerted by the sound had turned up their tvs to drown it out i regained a sickly sort of consciousness as they pushed me in the car fought to hold it threw up on one of them and went under again i came back more slowly the second time we were still moving the one with the separated ribs was driving id thrown up on the other one and the smell was rather strong his face was very set and i thought he might be close to tears its not nice for two men to go after one woman and only get her after losing a rib and a kidney and then to have her vomit down your jacket front and not be able to move or clean it offi wouldnt have liked it either i fumbled in my jacket pocket for some kleenex i still felt sick too sick to talk and not much like cleaning him up either so i dropped the tissues on him and leaned back he gave a little squeal of rage and knocked them to the floor when we stopped we were close to north michigan avenue just off astor on division in the area where rich people live in beautiful old victorian houses and apartments or enormous highrise modern condominiums my righthand partner flung himself out the door took off his jacket and dropped it in the street your guns showing i told him he looked down at it then at his jacket his face turned red you goddamn bitch he said he leaned into the car to take another poke at me but the angle wasnt good and he couldnt get much leverage behind his arm ribs spoke up come on joeits getting late and earl dont like to be kept waiting this simple statement worked powerfully on joe he stopped swinging and yanked me out of the car with ribs pushing me from the side we went into one of the stately old houses that i always thought id like to own if i ever rescued an oiltanker billionaire from international kidnappers and got set up for life as my reward it was dull red brick with elegant wroughtiron railing up the steps and around the front windows originally built as a singlefamily home it was now a threeflat apartment a cheerful blackandwhite patterned wallpaper covered the entry hall and stairwell the bannister was carved wood probably walnut and beautifully polished the three of us made an ungainly journey up the carpeted stairs to the second floor ribs was having trouble moving his arms and joe seemed to be limping from his kidney kicks i wasnt feeling very well myself the secondfloor apartment was opened by yet another guncarrier his clothes fit him better but he didnt really look like the class of person that belonged in this neighborhood he had a shock of black hair that stood up around his head in a wiry bush on his right cheek was deep red scar cut roughly like a z it was so dark that it looked as though someone had painted him with lipstick what kept you two so long earls getting angry he demanded ushering us into a wide hallway plush brown carpet on the floor a nice little louis quinze side table and a few pictures on the walls charming earl warned us this goddamn warshawski bitch was a wiseass but he didnt say she was a goddamn karate expert that was ribs he pronounced my name worchotsi i looked down at my hands modestly is that joe and freddie a nasal tenor squeaked from inside what the hell took you guys so long its owner appeared in the doorway short pudgy and bald he was familiar to me from my early days in chicago law enforcement earl smeissen how absolutely delightful but you know earl if youd called me up and asked to see me we could have gotten together with a lot less trouble yeah warchoski i just bet we wouldve he said heavily earl had carved himself a nice little niche on the north side with classy prostitution setups for visiting conventioneers and a little blackmail and extortion he had a small piece of the drug business and the rumor was that he would arrange a killing to oblige a friend if the price was right earl this is quite a place youve got inflation must not be hurting business too much he ignored me where the hells your jacket joe you been walking around chicago showing your gun to every cop on the beat joe turned red again and started to mutter something i intervened im afraid thats my fault earl your friends here jumped me in my own hallway without introducing themselves or saying they had come from you we had a bit of a fracas and freddies ribs got separatedbut he pulled himself together nicely and knocked me out when i came to i was sick on joes jacket so dont blame the poor fellow for ditching it earl turned outraged to freddie who shrank back down the hall you let a goddamn dame bust your ribs he yelled his voice breaking to a squeak the money i pay you and you cant do a simple little job like fetch a goddamn broad one of the things i hate about my work is the cheap swearing indulged in by cheap crooks i also hate the word broad earl could you reserve your criticisms of your staff until im not here i have an engagement this eveningid appreciate it if you told me why you wanted to see me so badly you sent two hoods to get me so i can get there on time earl gave freddie a vicious look and sent him off to see a doctor he motioned the rest of us into the living room and noticed joe limping you need a doctor too she beak your leg he asked sarcastically kidneys i replied modestly it all comes from knowing how yeah i know about you warchoski i know what a wiseass you are and i heard how you offed joe correl if freddie knocked you out ill give him a medal i want you to understand you cant mess around with me i sank down into a wide armchair my head was throbbing and it hurt to focus on him im not messing around with you earl i said earnestly im not interested in prostitution or juice loans or he hit me across the mouth shut up his voice rose to a squeak and his eyes got smaller in his pudgy face in a detached way i felt some blood dribbling down my chinhe must have caught me with his ring is this a general warning then are you hauling in all the private eyes in chicago and saying now here thisdont mess around with earl smeissen he swung at me again but i blocked him with my left arm he looked at his hand in surprise as if he wondered what had happened to it dont clown with me warchoskii can call in plenty of people to wipe that smirk off your face i dont think it would take very many i said but i still dont have any idea what part of your turf im messing in earl signaled to the doorman who came and held my shoulders against the chair joe was hovering in the background a lascivious look on his face my stomach turned slightly okay earl im terrified i said he hit me again i was going to look like absolute hell tomorrow i thought i hoped i wasnt shaking my stomach was knotted with nervousness i took several deep diaphragm breaths to try to relieve the tension the last slap seemed to satisfy earl he sat down on a dark couch close to my chair warchoski he squeaked i called you down here to tell you to lay off the thayer case you kill the boy earl i asked he was on his feet again i can mark you good so good that no one will ever want to look at your face again he shouted now just do what i say and keep your mitts outta that i decided not to argue with himi didnt feel in any shape to take on both him and the doorman who continued to hold my shoulders back i wondered if his scar had turned redder with all the excitement but voted against asking him suppose you do scare me off what about the police i objected bobby mallorys hot on the trail and whatever his faults you cant buy bobby im not worried about mallory earls voice was back in its normal register so i concluded the brainstorm was passing and im not buying youim telling you who got you involved earl college kids arent part of your turfunless young thayer was cutting into your dope territory i thought id just told you not to pry into my affairs he said getting up again earl was determined to pound me maybe it would be better to get it over with quickly and get out rather than let him go on for hours as he came at me i pulled my foot back and kicked him squarely in the crotch he howled in anguish and collapsed in a heap on the couch get her tony get her he squealed i didnt have a chance against tony the doorman he was trained in the art of working over loan defaulters without showing a mark when he finished earl came hobbling over from the couch this is just a taste warchoski he hissed you lay off the thayer case agreed i looked at him without speaking he really could kill me and get away with ithed done it to others he had good connections with city hall and probably in the police department too i shrugged and winced he seemed to accept that as agreement get her out tony tony dumped me unceremoniously outside the front door i sat for a few minutes on the stairs shivering in the heat and trying to pull myself together i was violently ill over the railing which cleared my headache a bit a woman walking by with a man said disgusting so early in the evening the police should keep people like that out of this neighborhood i agreed i got to my feet rather wobbly but i could walk i felt my arms they were sore but nothing was broken i staggered over to the inner drive parallel to lake shore drive and only a block away and hailed a taxi home the first one pulled off after a look at me but the second one took me the driver clucked and fussed like a jewish mother wanting to know what id done to myself and offering to take me to a hospital or the police or both i thanked him for his concern but assured him i was all right in the cool of the night id dropped my purse by my door when freddie and i were scuffling and asked the cabdriver to come upstairs with me to get paid off living at the top of the building i was pretty confident that my bag would still be there it was and my keys were still in the door the driver tried one last protest thanks i said but i just need a hot bath and a drink and ill be all right okay lady he shrugged its your funeral he took his money looked at me one last time and went downstairs my apartment lacked the splendor of earls my little hallway had a small rug not walltowall carpeting and an umbrella stand rather than a louis quinze table but it also wasnt filled with thugs i was surprised to find it was only seven it had been only an hour and a half since i had come up the stairs the first time that evening i felt as though id moved into a different time zone i ran a bath for the second time that day and poured myself an inch of scotch i soaked in water as hot as i could bear it lying in the dark with a wet towel wrapped around my head gradually my headache dissipated i was very very tired after thirty minutes of soaking and reheating the tub i felt able to cope with some motion wrapping a large towel around me i walked through the apartment trying to keep my muscles from freezing on me all i really wanted to do was sleep but i knew if i did that now i wouldnt be able to walk for a week i did some exercises gingerly fortifying myself with black label suddenly i caught sight of a clock and remembered my date with devereux i was already late and wondered if he was still there with an effort i found the restaurants name in the phone book and dialed their number the maître dhotel was very cooperative and offered to look for mr devereux in the bar a few minutes passed and i began to think he must have gone home when he came onto the line hello ralph this had better be good if i tried explaining it it would take hours and you still wouldnt believe me i answered will you give me another half hour he hesitated i guessed he was looking for the pride to say nogoodlooking guys arent used to being stood up sure he said finally but if youre not here by eight thirty you can find your own way home ralph i said controlling my voice carefully this has been one absolute zero of a day id like to have a pleasant evening learn a little bit about insurance and try to forget whats gone before can we do that he was embarrassed sure vickii mean vic see you in the bar we hung up and i looked through my wardrobe for something elegant enough for the cartwheel but loose and flowing and found a stringcolored mexican dress that id forgotten about it was twopiece with a long full skirt and a woven squarenecked top that tied at the waist and bloused out below the long sleeves covered my puffy arms and i didnt have to wear pantyhose or a slip cork sandals completed the costume surveying my face under the bathroom light made me want to reconsider going out in public my lower lip was swollen where earls pinky ring had sliced it and a purple smudge was showing on my left jaw extending veinous red lines like a cracked egg along my cheek to the eye i tried some makeup my base wasnt very heavy and didnt conceal the worst of the purple but did cover the spidery red marks heavy shadow took the focus from an incipient black eye and dark lipstick applied more strongly than my usual style made the swollen lip look pouty and sexyor might if the lights were dim enough my legs were stiffening up but my daily runs seemed to be paying offi negotiated the stairs without more than minor tremors a taxi was going by on halsted it dropped me in front of the hanover house hotel on oak street at this was my first visit to the cartwheel to me it typified the sterile place where bright empty north siders with more money than sense liked to eat the bar to the left of the entrance was dark with a piano amplified too loudly playing songs that bring tears to the eyes of yale graduates the place was crowded friday night in chicago ralph sat at the end of the bar with a drink he looked up as i came in smiled sketched a wave but didnt get up i concentrated on walking smoothly and made it to where he sat he looked at his watch you just made it in more ways than one i thought oh youd never have left without finishing your drink there werent any empty stools how about proving youre a more generous soul than i and letting me have that seat and a scotch he grinned and grabbed me intending to pull me onto his lap a spasm of pain shot through my ribs oh jesus ralph dont he let go of me at once got up stiffly and quietly and offered me the barstool i stood feeling awkward i dont like scenes and i didnt feel like using the energy to calm ralph down hed seemed like a guy made for sunshine maybe his divorce had made him insecure with women i saw id have to tell him the truth and put up with his sympathy and i didnt want to reveal how badly smeissen had shown me up that afternoon it was no comfort that he would limp in pain for a day or two i dragged my attention back to ralph would you like me to take you home he was asking ralph id like a chance to explain some things to you i know it must look as though i dont want to be here showing up an hour late and all are you too upset for me to tell you about it not at all he said politely well could we go someplace and sit down its a little confusing and hard to do standing up ill check on our table when he went off i sank gratefully onto the barstool and ordered a johnnie walker black how many could i drink before they combined with my tired muscles and put me to sleep ralph came back with the news that our table was a good tenminute wait away the ten stretched into twenty while i sat with my uninjured cheek propped on my hand and he stood stiffly behind me i sipped my scotch the bar was overairconditioned normally the heavy cotton of the dress would have kept me plenty warm but now i started to shiver slightly cold ralph asked a little i admitted i could put my arms around you he offered tentatively i looked up at him and smiled that would be very nice i said just do it gently please he crossed his arms around my chest i winced a little at first but the warmth and the pressure felt good i leaned back against him he looked down at my face and his eyes narrowed vic what wrong with your face i raised an eyebrow nothings wrong no really he said bending closer youve gotten cutand that looks like a bruise and swelling on your cheek is it really bad i asked i thought the makeup covered it pretty well well theyre not going to put you on the cover of vogue this week but its not too awful its just that as an old claims man ive seen lots of accident victims and you look like one i feel like one too i agreed but really this wasnt have you been to a doctor about this he interrupted you sound just like the cabbie who took me home this afternoon he wanted to rush me to passavanti practically expected him to come in with me and start making me chicken soup was your car badly damaged he asked my car is not damaged at all i was beginning to lose my temperirrationally i knewbut the probing made me feel defensive not damaged he echoed then how at that moment our table was announced in the bar i got up and went over to the headwaiter leaving ralph to pay for drinks the headwaiter led me off without waiting for ralph who caught up with us just as i was being seated my spurt of temper had infected him he said i hate waiters who haul off ladies without waiting for their escorts he was just loud enough for the maitre d to hear im sorry siri didnt realize you were with madame he said with great dignity before moving off hey ralph take it easy i said gently a little too much egojockeying is going onmy fault as much as yours lets stop and get some facts and start over again a waiter materialized would you care for a drink before dinner ralph looked up in irritation do you know how many hours weve spent in the bar waiting for this table no we dont want a drinkat least i dont he turned to me do you no thanks i agreed any more and ill fall asleepwhich will probably ruin forever any chance i have of making you believe that im not trying to get out of an evening with you were we ready to order the waiter persisted ralph told him roundly to go away for five minutes my last remark had started to restore his native good humor however okay v i warshawskiconvince me that you really arent trying to make this evening so awful that ill never ask you out again ralph i said watching him carefully do you know earl smeissen who he asked uncomprehendingly is this some kind of detective guessing game yeah i guess so i answered between yesterday afternoon and this afternoon ive talked to a whole lot of different people who either knew peter thayer or his girl friendthe gal whos vanished you and your boss among others well when i got home late this afternoon two hired thugs were waiting for me we fought i was able to hold them off for a while but one of them knocked me out they took me to earl smeissens home if you dont know earl dont try to meet him he was just starting to muscle to the top of his racketextortion prostitutionwhen i was with the public defender ten years ago and he seems to have kept right on trucking since then he now has a stable of tough guys who all carry guns he is not a nice person i stopped to marshal my presentation from the corner of my eye i saw the waiter shimmering up again but ralph waved him away anyway he ordered me off the thayer case and set one of his tame goons on me to back it up i stopped what had happened next in earls apartment was very raw in my mind i had calculated it carefully at the time decided that it was better to get everything over at once and convince earl that i was scared than to sit there all evening while he took increasingly violent shots at me nonetheless the thought of being so helpless the memory of tony beating me like a disloyal whore or a welching loan customerto be so vulnerable was close to unbearable unconsciously my left hand had clenched and i realized i was slicing it against the tabletop ralph was watching me an uncertain look on his face his business and suburban life hadnt prepared him for this kind of emotion i shook my head and tried for a lighter touch anyway my rib cage is a little sorewhich is why i winced and yelled when you grabbed hold of me in the bar the question thats exercising me though is who told earl that id been around asking questions or more precisely who cared so much that id been around that he askedor paidearl to frighten me off ralph was still looking a little horrified have you been to the police about this no i said impatiently i cant go to the police about this kind of thing they know im interested in the casetheyve asked me to get off too although more politely if bobby mallorythe lieutenant in charge of the caseknew id been beaten up by earl smeissen would deny the whole thing and if i could prove it in court he could say it was a million things other than this that made him do it and mallory wouldnt give me an earful of sympathyhe wants me out of there anyway well dont you think hes right murder really is a police matter and this group seems pretty wild for you to be mixed up with i felt a quick surge of anger the anger i get when i feel someone is pushing me i smiled with an effort ralph im tired and i ache i cant try explaining to you tonight why this is my jobbut please believe that it is my job and that i cant give it to the police and run away its true i dont know specifically whats going on here but i do know the temperament and reactions of a guy like smeissen i usually only deal with whitecollar criminalsbut when theyre cornered theyre not much different from an extortion artist like smeissen i see ralph paused thinking then his attractive grin came i have to admit that i dont know much about crooks of any kindexcept the occasional swindlers who try to rip off insurance companies but we fight them in the courts not with handtohand combat ill try to believe you know what youre up to though i laughed a little embarrassedly thanks ill try not to act too much like joan of arcgetting on a horse and charging around in all directions the waiter was back looking a little intimidated ralph ordered baked oysters and quail but i opted for senegalese soup and spinach salad i was too exhausted to want a lot of food we talked about indifferent things for a while i asked ralph if he followed the cubs for my sins im an ardent fan i explained ralph said he caught a game with his son every now and then but i dont see how anyone can be an ardent cub fan theyre doing pretty well right nowcleaned out the redsbut theyll fade the way they always do no give me the yankees yankees i expostulated i dont see how anyone can root for themits like rooting for the cosa nostra you know theyve got the money to buy the muscle to winbut that doesnt make you cheer them on i like to see sports played well ralph insisted i cant stand the clowning around that chicago teams do look at the mess veecks made of the white sox this year we were still arguing about it when the waiter brought the first course the soup was excellentlight creamy with a hint of curry i started feeling better and ate some bread and butter too when ralphs quail arrived i ordered another bowl of soup and some coffee now explain to me why a union wouldnt buy insurance from ajax oh they could ralph said his mouth full he chewed and swallowed but it would only be for their headquartersmaybe fire coverage on the building workers compensation for the secretaries things like that there wouldnt be a whole lot of people to cover and a union like the knifegrinderssee they get their insurance where they work the big thing is workers comp and thats paid for by the company not the union that covers disability payments doesnt it i asked yes or death if its jobrelated medical bills even if there isnt lost time i guess its a funny kind of setup your rates depend on the kind of business you conducta factory pays more than an office for instance but the insurance company can be stuck with weekly payments for years if a guy is disabled on the job we have some casesnot many fortunatelythat go back to but see the insured doesnt pay more or not that much more if we get stuck with a whole lot of disability payments of course we can cancel the insurance but were still required to cover any disabled workers who are already collecting well this is getting off the subject the thing is there are lots of people who go on disability who shouldntits pretty cushy and there are plenty of corrupt doctorsbut its hard to imagine a fullscale fraud connected with it that would do anyone else much good he ate some more quail no your real money is in pensions as you suggested or maybe life insurance but its easier for an insurance company to commit fraud with life insurance than for anyone else look at the equity funding case well could your boss be involved in something like that rigging phony policies with the knifegrinders providing dummy policyholders i asked vic why are you working so hard to prove that yardleys a crook hes really not a bad guyive worked for him for three years and ive never had anything against him i laughed at that it bugs me that he agreed to see me so easily i dont know a lot about insurance but ive been around big corporations before hes a department head and theyre like gynecologiststheir schedules are always booked for about twice as many appointments as they can realistically handle ralph clutched his head youre making me dizzy vic and youre doing it on purpose how can a claim department head possibly be like a gynecologist yeah well you get the idea why would he agree to see me hed never heard of me he has walltowall appointmentsbut he didnt even take phone calls while we were talking yes but you knew peter was dead and he didntso you were expecting him to behave in a certain guilty way and thats what you saw ralph objected he might have been worried about him about peter because hed promised jack thayer that hed be responsible for the boy i dont really see anything so surprising in yardleys talking to you if peter had been just a stray kid i mightbut an old family friends son the kid hadnt been in for four days he wasnt answering the phoneyardley felt responsible as much as annoyed i stopped considering what ralph said made sense i wondered if i had gotten carried away whether my instinctive dislike of overhearty businessmen was making me see ghosts where there were none okay you could be right but why couldnt masters be involved in a lifeinsurance fiddle ralph was finishing off his quail and ordering coffee and dessert i asked for a large dish of ice cream oh thats the way insurance companies are set up he said when the waiter had disappeared again were bigthird largest in total premiums written which is about eight point four billion dollars a year that includes all lines and all of the thirteen companies that make up the ajax group for legal reasons life insurance cant be written by the same company that writes property and casualty so the ajax assurance company does all our life and pension products while the ajax casualty and some of the smaller ones do property and casualty the waiter returned with our desserts ralph was having some kind of gooey torte i decided to get kahlua for my ice cream well with a company as big as ours ralph continued the guys involved in casualtythats stuff like workers comp general liability some of the autoanyway guys like yardley and me dont know too much about the life side of the house sure we know the people who run it eat with them now and then but they have a separate administrative structure handle their own claims and so on if we got close enough to the business to analyze it let alone commit fraud with it the political stink would be so high wed be out on our butts within an hour guaranteed i shook my head reluctantly and turned to my ice cream ajax did not sound promising and id been pinning hopes to it by the way i said did you check on ajaxs pension money ralph laughed you are persistent vic ill grant you that yeah i called a friend of mine over there sorry vic nothing doing he says hell look into it see whether we get any thirdhand stuff laid off on us i looked a question like the loyal alliance people give some money to dreyfus to manage and dreyfus lays some of it off on us basically though this guy says ajax wont touch the knifegrinders with a tenfoot pole which doesnt surprise me too much i sighed and finished my ice cream feeling suddenly tired again if things came easily in this life we would never feel pride in our achievements my mother used to tell me that standing over me while i practiced the piano shed probably disapprove of my work if she were alive but she would never let me slouch at the dinner table grumbling because it wasnt turning out right still i was too tired tonight to try to grapple with the implications of everything id learned today you look like your adventures are catching up with you ralph said i felt a wave of fatigue sweep over me almost carrying me off to sleep with it yeah im fading i admitted i think id better go to bed although in a way i hate to go to sleep ill be so sore in the morning maybe i could wake up enough to dance if you keep moving its not so bad you look like youd fall asleep on a disco floor right now vic and id be arrested for beating you or something why does exercise help if you keep the blood circulating it keeps the joints from stiffening so much well maybe we could do bothsleep and exercise i mean the smile in his eyes was half embarrassed half pleased i suddenly thought that after my evening with earl and tony id like the comfort of someone in bed with me sure i said smiling back ralph called to the waiter for the bill and paid it promptly his hands shaking slightly i considered fighting him for it especially since i could claim it as a business expense but decided id done enough fighting for one day we waited outside for the doorman to fetch the car ralph stood close to me not touching me but tense i realized he had been planning this ending all along and hadnt been sure he could carry it off and i smiled a little to myself in the dark when the car came i sat close to him on the front seat i live on halsted just north of belmont i said and fell asleep on his shoulder he woke me up at the belmonthalsted intersection and asked for the address my neighborhood is just north and west of a smarter part of town and there is usually good parking on the street he found a place across from my front door it took a major effort to pull myself out of the car the night air was warm and comforting and ralph steadied me with shaking hands as we crossed the street and went into my front hallway the three flights up looked very far away and i had a sudden mental flash of sitting on the front steps waiting for my dad to come home from work and carry me upstairs if i asked ralph to he would carry me up but it would alter the dependency balance in the relationship too much i set my teeth and climbed the stairs no one was lying in wait at the top i went into the kitchen and pulled a bottle of martell from the liquor cupboard i got two glasses down two of my mothers venetian glasses part of the small dowry she had brought to her marriage they were a beautiful clear red with twisted stems it had been a long time since i had had anyone up to my apartment and i suddenly felt shy and vulnerable id been overexposed to men today and wasnt ready to do it again in bed when i brought the bottle and glasses back to the living room ralph was sitting on the couch leafing through fortune without reading it he got up and took the glasses from me admiring them i explained that my mother had left italy right before the war broke out on a large scale her own mother was jewish and they wanted her out of harms way the eight red glasses she wrapped carefully in her underwear to take in the one suitcase she had carried and they had always held pride of place at any festive meal i poured brandy ralph told me that his family was irish thats why its devereux without an athe as are french we sat for a while without talking drinking our brandy he was a bit nervous too and it helped me relax suddenly he grinned his face lighting and said when i got divorced i moved into the city because i had a theory that thats where you meet the chickssorry women but to tell you the truth youre the first woman ive asked out in the six months ive been hereand youre not like any woman i ever met before he flushed a little i just wanted you to know that im not hopping in and out of bed every night but i would like to get into bed with you i didnt answer him but stood up and took his hand handinhand like fiveyearolds we walked into the bedroom ralph carefully helped me out of my dress and gently stroked my puffy arms i unbuttoned his shirt he took off his clothes and we climbed into the bed id been afraid that i might have to help him along recently divorced men sometimes have problems because they feel very insecure fortunately he didnt because i was too tired to help anyone my last memory was of his breath expelling loudly and then i was asleep a little help from a friend when i woke up the room was full of the soft light of late morning diffused through my heavy bedroom curtains i was alone in the bed and lay still to collect my thoughts gradually the memory of yesterdays events returned and i moved my head cautiously to look at the bedside clock my neck was very stiff and i had to turn my whole body to see the time i sat up my stomach muscles were all right but my thighs and calves were sore and it was painful to stand upright i did a slow shuffle to the bathroom the kind you do the day after you run five miles when you havent been out for a couple of months and turned the hot water in the tub on full blast ralph called to me from the living room good morning i called back if you want to talk to me youll have to come hereim not walking any farther ralph came into the bathroom fully dressed and joined me while i gloomily studied my face in the mirror over the sink my incipient black eye had turned a deep blackishpurple streaked with yellow and green my uninjured left eye was bloodshot my jaw had turned gray the whole effect was unappealing ralph seemed to share my feeling i was watching his face in the mirror he seemed a little disgusted my bet was that dorothy had never come home with a black eyesuburban life is so dull do you do this kind of thing often ralph asked you mean scrutinize my body or what i asked he moved his hands vaguely the fighting he said not as much as i did as a child i grew up on the south side ninetieth and commercial if you know the arealots of polish steelworkers who didnt welcome racial and ethnic newcomersand the feeling was mutual the law of the jungle ruled in my high schoolif you couldnt swing a mean toe or fist you might as well forget it i turned from the mirror ralph was shaking his head but he was trying to understand trying not to back away its a different world he said slowly i grew up in libertyville and i dont think i was ever in a real fight and if my sister had come home with a black eye my mother would have been hysterical for a month didnt your folks mind oh my mother hated it but she died when i was fifteen and my dad was thankful that i could take care of myself that was truegabriella had hated violence but she was a fighter and i got my scrappiness from her not from my big eventempered father did all the girls in your school fight ralph wanted to know i climbed into the hot water while i considered this no some of them just got scared off and some got themselves boyfriends to protect them the rest of us learned to protect ourselves one girl i went to school with still loves to fightshes a gorgeous redhead and she loves going to bars and punching out guys who try to pick her up truly amazing i sank back in the water and covered my face and neck with hot wet cloths ralph was quiet for a minute then said ill make some coffee if youll tell me the secreti couldnt find any and i didnt know whether you were saving those dishes for christmas so i washed them i uncovered my mouth but kept the cloth over my eyes id forgotten the goddamn dishes yesterday when i left the house thanks what else could i say coffees in the freezerwhole beans use a tablespoon per cup the grinders by the stoveelectric gadget filters are in the cupboard right over it and the pot is still in the sinkunless you washed it he leaned over to kiss me then went out i reheated the washcloth and flexed my legs in the steamy water after a while they moved easily so i was confident they would be fine in a few days before ralph returned with the coffee i had soaked much of the stiffness out of my joints i climbed out of the tub and enveloped myself in a large blue bath towel and walkedwith much less difficultyto the living room ralph came in with the coffee he admired my robe but couldnt quite look me in the face the weathers broken he remarked i went out to get a paper and its a beautiful dayclear and cool want to drive out to the indiana dunes i started to shake my head but the pain stopped me no it sounds lovely but ive got some work to do come on vic ralph protested let the police handle this youre in rotten shapeyou need to take the day off you could be right i said trying to keep down my anger but i thought we went through all that lastnight at any rate im not taking the day off well how about some company need someone to drive you i studied ralphs face but all i saw was friendly concern was he just having an attack of male protectiveness or did he have some special reason for wanting me to stay off the job as a companion hed be able to keep tabs on my errands and report them to earl smeissen im going to winnetka to talk to peter thayers father since hes a neighbor of your boss im not sure it would look too good for you to come along probably not he agreed why do you have to see him its like the man said about annapurna ralph because hes there there were a couple of other things i needed to do too things id just as soon be alone for how about dinner tonight he suggested ralph for heavens sake youre beginning to act like a seeing eye dog no no dinner tonight youre sweet i appreciate it but i want some time to myself okay okay he grumbled just trying to be friendly i stood up and walked painfully over to the couch where he was sitting i know i put an arm around him and gave him a kiss im just trying to be unfriendly he pulled me onto his lap the dissatisfaction smoothed out of his face and he kissed me after a few minutes i pulled myself gently away and hobbled back to the bedroom to get dressed the navy silk was lying over a chair with a couple of rents in it and a fair amount of blood and dirt my cleaner could probably fix it up but i didnt think id ever care to wear it again i threw it out and put on my green linen slacks with a palelemon shirt and a jacket perfect for suburbia i decided not to worry about my face it would look even more garish with makeup in sunlight than as it was i fixed myself cream of wheat while ralph ate toast and jam well i said time to head for suburbia ralph walked downstairs with me trying to hold out a supporting hand no thanks i said id better get used to doing this by myself at the bottom he won points by not lingering over his goodbyes we kissed briefly he sketched a cheerful wave and crossed the street to his car i watched him out of sight then hailed a passing cab the driver dropped me on sheffield north of addison a neighborhood more decayed than mine largely puerto rican i rang lotty herschels bell and was relieved when she answered it whos there she squawked through the intercom its me vic i said and pushed the front door while the buzzer sounded lotty lived on the second floor she was waiting for me in the doorway when i made it to the top of the stairs my dear vicwhat on earth is wrong with you she greeted me her thick black eyebrows soaring to punctuate her astonishment id known lotty for years she was a doctor about fifty i thought but with her vivid clever face and trim energetic body it was hard to tell sometime in her viennese youth she had discovered the secret of perpetual motion she held fierce opinions on a number of things and put them to practice in medicine often to the dismay of her colleagues shed been one of the physicians who performed abortions in connection with an underground referral service id belonged to at the university of chicago in the days when abortion was illegal and a dirty word to most doctors now she ran a clinic in a shabby storefront down the street shed tried running it for nothing when she first opened it but found the neighborhood people wouldnt trust medical care they didnt have to pay for still it was one of the cheapest clinics in the city and i often wondered what she lived on now she shut the door behind me and ushered me into her living room like lotty herself it was sparely furnished but glowed with strong colorscurtains in a vivid redandorange print and an abstract painting like fire on the wall lotty sat me on a daybed and brought me a cup of the strong viennese coffee she lived on so now victoria what have you been doing that makes you hobble upstairs like an old woman and turns your face blackandblue i am sure not a car accident thats too tame for youam i right right as always lotty i answered and gave her an abbreviated account of my adventures she pursed her lips at the tale of smeissen but wasted no time arguing about whether i ought to go to the police or drop out of the case or spend the day in bed she didnt always agree with me but lotty respected my decisions she went into her bedroom and returned with a large businesslike black bag she pulled my face muscles and looked at my eyes with an ophthalmoscope nothing time wont cure she pronounced and checked the reflexes in my legs and the muscles yes i see you are sore and you will continue to be sore but you are healthy you take good care of yourself it will pass off before too long yes i suspected as much i agreed but i cant take the time to wait for these leg muscles to heal and theyre sore enough to slow me down quite a bit right now i need something that will help me overlook the pain enough to do some errands and some thinkingnot like codeine that knocks you out do you have anything ah yes a miracle drug lottys face was amused you shouldnt put so much faith in doctors and drugs vic however ill give you a shot of phenylbutazone thats what they give racehorses to keep them from aching when they run and it seems to me youre galloping around like a horse she disappeared for a few minutes and i heard the refrigerator door open she returned with a syringe and a small rubberstoppered bottle now lie down well do this in your behind so it goes quickly to the bloodstream pull your slacks down a bit so great stuff this really they call it bute for short in half an hour you will be ready for the derby my dear as she talked lotty worked rapidly i felt a small sting and it was over now sit ill tell you some stories about the clinic im going to give you some nepenthe to take away with you thats very strong a painkiller dont try to drive while youre taking it and dont drink ill pack up some bute in tablets for you i leaned back against a big pillow and tried not to relax too much the temptation to lie down and sleep was very strong i forced myself to follow lottys quick clever talk asking questions but not debating her more outlandish statements after a while i could feel the drug taking effect my neck muscles eased considerably i didnt feel like unarmed combat but i was reasonably certain i could handle my car lotty didnt try to stop my getting up youve rested for close to an houryou should do for a while she packed the bute tablets in a plastic bottle and gave me a bottle of nepenthe i thanked her how much do i owe you she shook her head no these are all samples when you come for your longoverdue checkup then ill charge you what any good michigan avenue doctor would she saw me to the door seriously vic if you get worried about this smeissen character you are always welcome in my spare room i thanked herit was a good offer and one that i might need normally i would have walked back to my car lotty was only about eight blocks from me but even with the shot i didnt feel quite up to par so i walked slowly down to addison and caught a cab i rode it down to my office where i picked up peter thayers voter card with the winnetka address on it then flagged another cab back to my own car on the north side mcgraw was going to have quite a bill for expensesall these cabs and then the navy suit had cost a hundred and sixtyseven dollars a lot of people were out enjoying the day and the clean fresh air lifted my spirits too by two i was on the edens expressway heading toward the north shore i started singing a snatch from mozarts chio mi scordi di te but my rib cage protested and i had to settle for a bartok concerto on wfmt for some reason the edens ceases to be a beautiful expressway as it nears the homes of the rich close to chicago its lined with greensward and neat bungalows but as you go farther out shopping centers crop up and industrial parks and driveins take over once i turned right onto willow road though and headed toward the lake the view became more impressivelarge stately homes set well back on giant carefully manicured lawns i checked thayers address and turned south onto sheridan road squinting at numbers on mailboxes his house was on the east side the side where lots face lake michigan giving the children private beaches and boat moorings when they were home from groton or andover my chevy felt embarrassed turning through twin stone pillars especially when it saw a small mercedes an alfa and an audi fox off to one side of the drive the circular drive took me past some attractive flower gardens to the front door of a limestone mansion next to the door a small sign requested tradesmen to make deliveries in the rear was i a tradesman or woman i wasnt sure i had anything to deliver but perhaps my host did i took a card from my wallet and wrote a short message on it lets talk about your relations with the knifegrinders i rang the bell the expression on the face of the neatly uniformed woman who answered the door reminded me of my black eye the bute had put it out of my mind for a while i gave her the card id like to see mr thayer i said coolly she looked at me dubiously but took the card shutting the door in my face i could hear faint shouts from beaches farther up the road as the minutes passed i left the porch to make a more detailed study of a flower bed on the other side of the drive when the door opened i turned back the maid frowned at me im not stealing the flowers i assured hen but since you dont have magazines in the waiting area i had to look at something she sucked in her breath but only said this way no please no manners at all still this was a house of mourning i made allowances we moved at a fast clip through a large entry room graced by a dullgreen statue past a stairway and down a hall leading to the back of the house john thayer met us coming from the other direction he was wearing a white knit shirt and checked gray slackssuburban attire but muted his whole air was subdued as if he were consciously trying to act like a mourning father thanks lucy well go in here he took my arm and moved me into a room with comfortable armchairs and packed bookcases the books were lined up neatly on the shelves i wondered if he ever read any of them thayer held out my card whats this about warshawski just what it says i want to talk about your relations with the knifegrinders he gave a humorless smile they are as minimal as possible now that peter isgone i expect them to be nonexistent i wonder if mr mcgraw would agree with that he clenched his fist crushing the card now we get to it mcgraw hired you to blackmail me didnt he then there is a connection between you and the knifegrinders no then how can mr mcgraw possibly blackmail you a man like that stops at nothing i warned you yesterday to be careful around him look mr thayer yesterday you got terribly upset at learning that mcgraw had brought your name into this today youre afraid hes blackmailing you thats awfully suggestive his face was set in harsh strained lines of what something was going on between you two that you dont want known your son found it out and you two had him killed to keep him quiet thats a lie warshawski a goddamned lie he roared prove it the police arrested peters killer this morning my head swam and i sat down suddenly in one of the leather chairs what my voice squeaked one of the commissioners called me they found a drug addict who tried to rob the place they say peter caught him at it and was shot no i said what do you mean no they arrested the guy no maybe they arrested him but that wasnt the scene no one robbed that place your son didnt catch anyone in the act i tell you thayer the boy was sitting at the kitchen table and someone shot him that is not the work of a drug addict caught in a felony besides nothing was taken what are you after warshawski maybe nothing was taken maybe he got scared and fled id believe that before id believe your storythat i shot my own son his face was working with a strong emotion grief anger maybe horror mr thayer im sure youve noticed what a mess my face is a couple of punks roughed me up last night to warn me off the investigation into your sons death a drug addict doesnt have those kinds of resources i saw several people who might have engineered thatand you and andy mcgraw were two of them people dont like busybodies warshawski if someone beat you up id take the hint i was too tired to get angry in other words you are involved but you figure youve got your ass covered so that means ill have to figure out a way to saw the barrel off your tail itll be a pleasure warshawski im telling you for your own good drop it he went over to his desk i can see youre a conscientious girlbut mcgraw is wasting your time theres nothing to find he wrote a check and handed it to me here you can give mcgraw back whatever hes paid you and feel like youve done your duty the check was for you bastard you accuse me of blackmail and then you try to buy me off a spurt of raw anger pushed my fatigue to one side i ripped up the check and let the pieces fall to the floor thayer turned white money was his raw nerve the police made an arrest warshawski i dont need to buy you off but if you want to act stupid about it theres nothing more to say youd better leave the door opened and a girl came in oh dad mother wants you to she broke off sorry didnt know you had company she was an attractive teenager her brown straight hair was well brushed and hung down her back framing a small oval face she was wearing jeans and a striped mans shirt several sizes too big for her maybe her brothers normally she probably had the confident healthy air that money can provide right now she drooped a bit miss warshawski was just leaving jill in fact why dont you show her out and ill go see what your mother wants he got up and walked to the door waiting until i followed him to say goodbye i didnt offer to shake hands jill led me back the way id come earlier her father walked briskly in the opposite direction im very sorry about your brother i said as we got to the greenish statue so am i she said pulling her lips together when we got to the front of the house she followed me outside and stood staring up in my face frowning a little did you know peter she finally asked no i never met him i answered im a private investigator and im afraid im the person who found him the other morning they wouldnt let me look at him she said his face was fine dont have nightmares about himhis face wasnt damaged she wanted more information if hed been shot in the head how could his face look all right i explained it to her in a toneddown clinical way peter told me you could decide whether to trust people by their faces she said after a minute but yours is pretty banged up so i cant tell but you told me the truth about peter and youre not talking to me as if i was a baby or something she paused i waited finally she asked did dad ask you to come out here when i replied she asked why was he angry well he thinks the police have arrested your brothers murderer but i think theyve got the wrong person and that made him angry why she asked i mean not why is he mad but why do you think they got the wrong person the reasons are pretty complicated its not because i know who did it but because i saw your brother and the apartment and some other people whove been involved and theyve reacted to my seeing them ive been in this business for a while and i have a feel for when im hearing the truth a drug addict wandering in off the streets just doesnt fit with what ive seen and heard she stood on one foot and her face was screwed up as if she were afraid she might start crying i put an arm around her and pulled her to a sitting position on the shallow porch step im okay she muttered its justeverything is so weird around here you know its so terrible pete dying and everything hehewell she hiccuped back a sob never mind its dad whos crazy probably he always was but i never noticed it before hes been raving on and on about how anita and her father shot pete for his money and dumb stuff like that and then hell start saying how it served pete right like hes glad hes dead or something she gulped and ran her hand across her nose dad was always in such a stew about peter disgracing the family name you know but he wouldnt haveeven if hed become a union organizer he would have been a successful one he liked figuring things out he was that kind of person figuring things out and trying to do them the best way she hiccuped again and i like anita now i suppose ill never see her again i wasnt supposed to meet her but she and pete took me out to dinner sometimes when mom and dad were out of town shes disappeared you know i told her you wouldnt know where shes gone would you she looked up at me with troubled eyes do you think somethings happened to her no i said with a reassurance i didnt feel i think she got scared and ran away anitas really wonderful she said earnestly but dad and mother just refused even to meet her that was when dad first started acting weird when pete and anita began going together even today when the police came he wouldnt believe theyd arrested this man he kept saying it was mr mcgraw it was really awful she grimaced unconsciously oh its been just horrible here nobody cares about pete mother just cares about the neighbors dad is freaked out im the only one who cares hes dead tears were steaming down her face now and she stopped trying to fight them sometimes i even get the crazy idea that dad just freaked out totally like he does and killed peter this was the big fear once shed said it she started sobbing convulsively and shivering i took off my jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders i held her close for a few minutes and let her sob the door opened behind us lucy stood there scowling your father wants to know where youve gone toand he doesnt want you standing around gossiping with the detective i stood up why dont you take her inside and wrap her up in a blanket and get her something hot to drink shes pretty upset with everything thats going on and she needs some attention jill was still shivering but shed stopped sobbing she gave me a watery little smile and handed me my jacket im okay she whispered i dug a card out of my purse and handed it to her call me if you need me jill i said day or night lucy hustled her inside at top speed and shut the door i was really toning down the neighborhoodgood thing they couldnt see me through the trees my shoulders and legs were beginning to hurt again and i walked slowly back to my car the chevy had a crease in the front right fender where someone had sideswiped it in last winters heavy snow the alfa the fox and the mercedes were all in mint condition my car and i looked alike whereas the thayers seemed more like the sleek scratchless mercedes there was a lesson in there someplace maybe too much urban living was bad for cars and people real profound vic i wanted to get back to chicago and call bobby and get the lowdown on this drug addict theyd arrested but i needed to do something else while lottys painkiller was still holding me up i drove back over to the edens and went south to the dempster exit this road led through the predominantly jewish suburb of skokie and i stopped at the bagel works delicatessen and bagel bakery there i ordered a jumbo corned beef on rye and a fresca and sat in the car eating while i tried to decide where to get a gun i knew how to use themmy dad had seen too many shooting accidents in homes with guns hes decided the way to avoid one in our house was for my mother and me to learn how to use them my mother had always refused they gave her unhappy memories of the war and she would always say shed use the time to pray for a world without weapons but i used to go down to the police range with my dad on saturday afternoons and practice target shooting at one time i could clean and load and fire a police revolver in two minutes but since my father had died ten years ago i hadnt been out shooting id given his gun to bobby as a memento when hed died and id never needed one since then i had killed a man once but that had been an accident joe correl had jumped me outside a warehouse when i was looking into some inventory losses for a company i had broken his hold and smashed his jaw in and when he fell hed hit his head on the edge of a forklift id broken his jaw but it was his skull against the forklift that killed him but smeissen had a lot of hired muscle and if he was really pissed off he could hire some more a gun wouldnt completely protect me but i thought it might narrow the odds the corned beef sandwich was delicious i hadnt had one for a long time and decide to forget my weightmaintenance program for one afternoon and have another there was a phone booth in the deli and i let my fingers do the walking through the yellow pages the phone book showed four columns of gun dealers there was one not too far from where i was in the suburb of lincolnwood when i called and described what i wanted they didnt have it after worth of calls i finally located a repeating mediumweight smith wesson on the far south side of the city my injuries were really throbbing by this time and i didnt feel like a fortymile drive to the other end of the city on the other hand those injuries were why i needed the gun i paid for the corned beef sandwich and with my second fresca swallowed four of the tablets lotty had given me the drive south should have taken only an hour but i was feeling lightheaded my head and body not connected too strongly the last thing i wanted was for one of chicagos finest to pull me over i took it slowly swallowed a couple more tablets of bute and put all my effort into holding my concentration it was close to five when i exited from i to the south suburbs by the time i got to rileys they were ready to close i insisted on coming in to make my purchase i know what i want i said i called a couple of hours agoa smith wesson thirtyeight the clerk looked suspiciously at my face and took in the black eye why dont you come back on monday and if you still feel you want a gun we can talk about a model more suited to a lady than a smith wesson thirtyeight despite what you may think i am not a wifebeating victim i am not planning on buying a gun to go home and kill my husband im a single woman living alone and i was attacked last night i know how to use a gun and ive decided i need one and this is the kind i want just a minute the clerk said he hurried to the back of the store and began a whispered consultation with two men standing there i went to the case and started inspecting guns and ammunition the store was new clean and beautifully laid out their ad in the yellow pages proclaimed rileys as smith wesson specialists but they had enough variety to please any kind of taste in shooting one wall was devoted to rifles my clerk came over with one of the others a pleasantfaced middleaged man ron jaffrey he said im the manager what can we do for you i called up a couple of hours ago asking about a smith wesson thirtyeight id like to get one i repeated have you ever used one before the manager asked no im more used to the colt fortyfive i answered but the s w is lighter and better suited to my needs the manager walked to one of the cases and unlocked it my clerk went to the door to stop another lastminute customer from entering i took the gun from the manager balanced it in my hand and tried the classic police firing stance body turned to create as narrow a target as possible the gun felt good id like to try it before i buy it i told the manager do you have a target range jaffrey took a box of ammunition from the case i have to say you look as though you know how to handle it we have a range in the backif you decide against the gun we ask you to pay for the ammo if you take the gun we throw in a box free fine i said i followed him through a door in the back which led to a small range we give lessons back here on sunday afternoons and let people come in to practice on their own during the week need any help loading i may i told him time was when i could load and fire in thirty seconds but its been a while my hands were starting to shake a bit from fatigue and pain and it took me several minutes to insert eight rounds of cartridges the manager showed me the safety and the action i nodded turned to the target lifted the gun and fired the action came as naturally as if ten days not ten years had passed but my aim was way off i emptied the gun but didnt get a bullseye and only two in the inner ring the gun was good though steady action and no noticeable distortion let me try another lot i emptied the chambers and jaffrey handed me some more cartridges he gave me a couple of pointers you obviously know what youre doing but youre out of practice and youve picked up some bad habits your stance is good but youre hunching your shoulderkeep it down and only raise the arm i loaded and fired again trying to keep my shoulder down it was good adviceall but two shots got into the red and one grazed the bullseye okay i said ill take it give me a couple of boxes of ammo and a complete cleaning kit i thought a minute and a shoulder holster we went back into the store larry jaffrey called my clerk came over clean and wrap this gun for the lady while i write up the bill larry took the gun and i went with jaffrey to the cash register a mirror was mounted behind it and i saw myself in it without recognition for a few seconds the left side of my face was now completely purple and badly swollen while my right eye stared with the dark anguish of a paul klee drawing i almost turned to see who this battered woman was before realizing i was looking at myself no wonder larry hadnt wanted to let me in the store jaffrey showed me the bill four hundred twentytwo dollars he said threeten for the gun ten for the second box of cartridges fiftyfour for the holster and belt and twentyeight for the cleaning kit the rest is tax i wrote a check out slowly and laboriously i need a drivers license and two major credit cards or an interbank card he said and i have to ask you to sign the register he looked at my drivers license monday you should go down to city hall and register the gun i send a list of all major purchases to the local police department and theyll probably forward your name to the chicago police i nodded and quietly put my identification back in my billfold the gun took a big chunk out of the thousand dollars id had from mcgraw and i didnt think i could legitimately charge it to him as an expense larry brought me the gun in a beautiful velvet case i looked at it and asked them to put it in a bag for me ron jaffrey ushered me urbanely to my car magnificently ignoring my face you live quite a ways from here but if you want to come down and use the target just bring your bill with youyou get six months free practice with the purchase he opened my car door for me i thanked him and he went back to the store the bute was still keeping the pain from crashing in on me completely but i was absolutely exhausted my last bit of energy had gone to buying the gun and using the target i couldnt drive the thirty miles back to my apartment i started the car and went slowly down the street looking for a motel i found a best western that had rooms backing onto a side street away from the busy road i was on the clerk looked curiously at my face but made no comment i paid cash and took the key the room was decent and quiet the bed firm i uncorked the bottle of nepenthe lotty had given me and took a healthy swallow i peeled off my clothes wound my watch and put it on the bedside table and crawled under the covers i debated calling my answering service but decided i was too tired to handle anything even if it had come up the air conditioner set on high drowned out any street noises and made the room cold enough to enjoy snuggling under the blankets i lay down and was starting to think about john thayer when i fell asleep some visitors dont knock i came to slowly out of a sound sleep i lay quietly not sure at first where i was and dozed again lightly when i woke up the second time i was refreshed and aware the heavy drapes shut out any outside light i switched on the bedside lamp and looked at my watch i had slept more than twelve hours i sat up and cautiously moved legs and neck my muscles had stiffened again in my sleep but not nearly as badly as the previous morning i pulled myself from the bed and made it to the window with only minor twinges looking through a crack i pulled in the drapes i saw bright morning sunlight i was puzzled by thayers account of a police arrest and wondered if there would be a story in the morning paper i pulled on my slacks and shirt and went down to the lobby for a copy of the sunday heraldstar back upstairs i undressed again and ran a hot bath while i looked at the paper drug addict arrested in banking heirs murder was on the lower right side of the front page police have arrested donald mackenzie of s ellis in the murder of banking heir peter thayer last monday asst police commissioner tim sullivan praised the men working on the case and said an arrest was made early saturday morning when one of the residents of the apartment where peter thayer lived identified mackenzie as a man seen hanging around the building several times recently it is believed that mackenzie allegedly addicted to cocaine entered the thayer apartment on monday july believing no one to be at home when he found peter thayer eating breakfast in the kitchen he lost his nerve and shot him commissioner sullivan says the browning automatic that fired the fatal bullet has not yet been traced but that the police have every hope of recovering the weapon the story was continued on page sixtythree here a full page had been devoted to the case pictures of the thayer family with jill another sister and a chic mrs thayer a single shot of peter in a baseball uniform for new trier high school a good candid picture of anita mcgraw an accompanying story proclaimed labor leaders daughter still missing it suggested now that the police have made an arrest there is hope that miss mcgraw will return to chicago or call her family meanwhile her picture has been circulated to state police in wisconsin indiana and michigan that seemed to be that i lay back in the water and closed my eyes the police were supposedly hunting high and low for the browning questioning mackenzies friends and searching his hangouts but i didnt think theyd find it i tried to remember what earls goons had been carrying fred had had a colt but i thought tony might have had a browning why was thayer so willing to believe mackenzie had killed his son according to jill hed been insisting at first it was mcgraw something nagged at the back of my mind but i couldnt put a finger on it could there possibly be any proof that mackenzie had done it on the other hand what proof did i have that he hadnt my stiff joints the fact that nothing had been touched in the apartment but what did it really add up to i wondered if bobby had made that arrest whether he was among those diligent policemen whom police commissioner sullivan unstintingly praised i decided i needed to get back to chicago and talk to him with this in mind i got dressed and left the motel i realized i hadnt eaten since those two corned beef sandwiches yesterday afternoon and stopped at a little coffee shop for a cheese omelette juice and coffee i was eating too much lately and not getting any exercise i surreptitiously slid a finger around my waistband but it didnt seem any tighter i took some more of lottys pills with my coffee and was feeling fine by the time i pulled off the kennedy at belmont sunday morning traffic was light and i made it to halsted by a little after ten there was a parking place across from my apartment and a dark unmarked car with a police antenna on it i raised my eyebrows speculatively had the mountain come to mohammed i crossed the street and looked into the car sergeant mcgonnigal was sitting there alone with a newspaper when he saw me he put the paper down and got out of the car he was wearing a light sports jacket and gray slacks and his shoulder holster made a little bulge under his right armpit a southpaw i thought good morning sergeant i said beautiful day isnt it good morning miss warshawski mind if i come up with you and ask you a few questions i dont know i answered it depends on the questions bobby send you yes we got a couple of inquiries in and he thought id better come over to see if youre all rightthats quite a shiner youve picked up yes it is i agreed i held the door to the building open for him and followed him in how long have you been here i stopped by last night but you werent home i called a couple of times when i stopped by this morning i just thought id wait until noon to see if you showed up lieutenant mallory was afraid the captain would order an apb on you if i reported you missing i see im glad i decided to come home we got to the top of the stairs mcgonnigal stopped you usually leave your door open never i moved past him the door was cracked open hanging a bit drunkenly someone had shot out the locks to get inthey dont respond to forcing mcgonnigal pulled out his gun slammed the door open and rolled into the room i drew back against the hall wall then followed him in my apartment was a mess someone had gone berserk in it the sofa cushions had been cut open pictures thrown on the floor books opened and dropped so that they lay with open spines and crumpling pages we walked through the apartment my clothes were scattered around the bedroom drawers dumped out in the kitchen all the flour and sugar had been emptied onto the floor while pans and plates were everywhere some of them chipped from reckless handling in the dining room the red venetian glasses were lying crazily on the table two had fallen off one rested safely on the carpet but the other had shattered on the wood floor i picked up the seven whole ones and stood them in the breakfront and sat to pick up the pieces of the other my hands were shaking and i couldnt handle the tiny shards dont touch anything else miss warshawski mcgonnigals voice was kind im going to call lieutenant mallory and get some fingerprint experts over here they probably wont find anything but weve got to try in the meantime im afraid youll have to leave things the way they are i nodded the phone is next to the couchwhat used to be the couch i said not looking up jesus what next who the hell had been in here and why it just couldnt be a random burglar a pro might take the place apart looking for valuablesbut rip up the couch dump china onto the floor my mother had carried those glasses from italy in a suitcase and not a one had broken nineteen years married to a cop on the south side of chicago and not a one had broken if i had become a singer as she had wanted this would never have happened i sighed my hands were calmer so i picked up the little shards and put them in a dish on the table please dont touch anything mcgonnigal said again from the doorway goddamnit mcgonnigal shut up i snapped even if you do find a fingerprint in here that doesnt belong to me or one of my friends you think theyre going to go all over these splinters of glass and ill bet you dinner at the savoy that whoever came through here wore gloves and you wont find a damned thing anyway i stood up id like to know what you were doing when the tornado came throughsitting out front reading your newspaper did you think the noise came from someones television who came in and out of the building while you were here he flushed mallory was going to ask him the same question if he hadnt bothered to find out he was in hot water i dont think this was done while i was here but ill go ask your downstairs neighbors if they heard any noise i know it must be very upsetting to come home and find your apartment destroyed but please miss warshawskiif were going to have a prayer of finding these guys weve got to fingerprint the place okay okay i said he went out to check downstairs i went to the bedroom my canvas suitcase was lying open but fortunately had not been cut i didnt think canvas would take fingerprints so i put it on the dismantled box springs and packed going through the array of clothes and lingerie on the floor i put the wrapped box from rileys in too and then called lotty on the bedside phone lotty i cant talk right now but my apartment has been ravaged can i come and stay a few nights naturally vic do you need me to come get you no im okay ill be over in a whilei need to talk to the police first we hung up and i took the suitcase down to the car mcgonnigal was in the secondfloor apartment the door was half open and he was talking with his back to the hallway i put the suitcase in my trunk and was just unlocking the outer door to go back upstairs when mallory came squealing up to the curb with a couple of squad cars hot behind him they doubleparked lights flashing and a group of kids gathered at the end of the street staring police like to create public dramano other need for all that show hello bobby i said as cheerily as i could manage what the hell is going on here vicki bobby asked so angry that he forgot his cardinal rule against swearing in front of women and children not nice whatever it is someone tore my place up they smashed one of gabriellas glasses mallory had been charging up the stairs about to muscle me aside but that stopped himhed drunk too many new years toasts out of those glasses christ vicki im sorry but what the hell were you doing poking your nose into this business anyway why dont you send your boys upstairs and well sit here and talk theres no place to sit down up there and frankly i cant stand to look at it he thought about it for a minute yeah why dont we go sit in my car and you answer a few questions finchley he bellowed a young black cop stepped forward take the crew upstairs and fingerprint the place and search it if you can for any clues he turned to me anything valuable that might be missing i shrugged who knows whats valuable to a ransacker a couple of good pieces of jewelrymy mothers i never wear them too oldfashioneda single diamond pendant set in a white gold filigree with matching earrings a couple of rings theres a little silver flatware i dont knowa turntable i havent looked for anythingjust looked and looked away yeah okay bobby said go on he waved a hand and the four uniformed men started up the stairs and send mcgonnigal down to me he called after them we went to bobbys car and sat together in the front seat his full red face was setangry but not i thought with me i told you on thursday to butt out of the thayer case i heard the police made an arrest yesterdaydonald mackenzie is there still a thayer case bobby ignored that what happened to your face i ran into a door dont clown vicki you know why i sent mcgonnigal over to talk to you i give up he fell in love with me and you were giving him an excuse to come by and see me i cant deal with you this morning bobby yelled top volume a kid is dead your place is a wreck your face looks like hell and all you can think of is getting my goat goddamnit talk to me straight and pay attention to what i say okay okay i said pacifically i give up why did you send the sergeant over to see me bobby breathed heavily for a few minutes he nodded as if to affirm that hed recovered his selfcontrol because john thayer told me last night that youd been beaten up and you didnt believe that mackenzie had committed the crime thayer i echoed incredulous i talked to him yesterday and he threw me out of his house because i wouldnt accept his word that mackenzie was the murderer now whys he turning around telling you that howd you come to be talking to him anyway bobby smiled sourly we had to go out to winnetka to ask a few last questions when its the thayer family we wait on their convenience and that was when it was convenient he believes it was mackenzie but he wants to be sure now tell me about your face theres nothing to tell it looks worse than it isyou know how it is with black eyes bobby drummed on the steering wheel in exaggerated patience vicki after i talked to thayer i had mcgonnigal go through our reports to see if anyone had turned in anything on a battered woman and we found a cabbie had stopped at the town hall station and mentioned picking up a woman at astor and the drive and dropping her at your address quite a coincidence huh the guy was worried because you looked in pretty bad shape but there wasnt anything anyone could do about ityou werent filing a complaint right you are i said mallory tightened his lips but didnt lose his temper now vicki he continued mcgonnigal wondered what you were doing down at astor and the drive looking so bloody its not really a muggers spot and he remembered how earl smeissen owns a condo down there on astor in from state streetor parkway they call it when it gets into the tony part of town so now we want to know why earl wanted to beat you up its your story youre saying he beat me up you give me a reason why he probably had a bellyful of your clowning bobby said his voice rising again for two cents id black your other goddamn eye for you is that why you came over to threaten me vicki i want to know why earl beat you the only reason i can think of is that hes tied to the thayer boymaybe had him shot when someone else fingered him then you dont think that mackenzie is responsible mallory was silent you make the arrest no mallory said stiffly i could see this hurt lieutenant carlson did carlson i dont know him whos he work for captain vespucci mallory said shortly i raised my eyebrows vespucci i was beginning to sound like a parrot vespucci had been a colleague my father was ashamed to talk about hed been implicated in a number of departmental scandals over the years most of them having to do with police bought off by the mob or turning the other cheek to mob activities in their territory thered never been enough evidence to justify throwing him off the forcebut that too the rumors said was because he had the kind of connections that made you keep quiet carlson and vespucci pretty close i asked yes bobby bit off i thought for a minute did someonelike earl saybring pressure on vespucci to make an arrest is donald mackenzie another poor slob caught in a trap because he was wandering around the wrong part of town did he leave any prints in the apartment can you find the gun has he made a confession no but he cant account for his time on monday and were pretty sure hes been involved in some hyde park burglaries but you dont agree that hes the killer as far as the department is concerned the case is closed i talked to mackenzie myself this morning and and nothing my captain says its a defensible arrest your captain owe anything to vespucci i asked mallory made a violent motion with his torso dont talk like that to me vicki weve got seventythree unsolved homicides right now if we wrap one up in a week the captain has every right to be happy all right bobby i sighed sorry lieutenant carlson arrested mackenzie and vespucci told your captain who told you to lay off the case was closed but you want to know why earl beat me up mallory turned red again you cant have it both ways if mackenzie is the killer why would smeissen care about me and peter thayer if he beat me upand i mean ifit could have been for lots of reasons he mightve made a heavy pass i turned down earl doesnt like ladies who turn him down you knowhes beaten a couple before first time i ever saw earl was when i was a starryeyed rookie attorney on the public defenders roster i was appearing for a lady whom earl beat up nice young prostitute who didnt want to work for him sorry i just committed slander she alleged that earl beat her up but we couldnt make it stick youre not going to ask for charges then mallory said figures now tell me about your apartment i havent seen it but take it as read that it was torn apartmcgonnigal gave me a brief description someone was looking for something what i shook my head beats me none of my clients has ever given me the secret to the neutron bomb or even a new brand of toothpaste i just dont deal with that kind of stuff and anytime i do have volatile evidence i leave it in a safe in my office my voice trailed off why hadnt i thought of that sooner if someone had torn the apartment apart looking for something they were probably down in my office now give me the address bobby said i gave it to him and he got on the car radio and ordered a patrol car to go up and check now vicki i want you to be honest with me this is off the recordno witnesses no tapes tell me what you took out of that apartment that someone call him smeissen wants back so badly he looked at me in a kindly worried fatherly way what did i have to lose by telling him about the picture and the pay stub bobby i said earnestly i did look around the apartment but i didnt see anything that smacked remotely of earl or any other person in particular not only that the place didnt look as though anyone else had searched it sergeant mcgonnigal came up to the car hi lieutenantfinchley said you wanted me yeah bobby said who came in and out of the building while you were watching it just one of the residents sir you sure of that yes sir she lives in the secondfloor apartment i was just talking to hermrs alvarezsaid she heard a lot of noise about three this morning but didnt pay any attention to itsays miss warshawski often has strange guests and wouldnt thank hermrs alvarezfor interfering thanks mrs alvarez i thought the city needs more neighbors like you glad i wasnt home at the time but what i wondered was whoever ransacked my place looking for so desperately that pay stub linked peter thayer to ajax but that was no secret and the picture of anita even if the police hadnt connected her to andrew mcgraw the picture didnt do that either i had put them both in my inner safe at my office a small bomb and fireproof box built into the wall at the back of the main safe i had kept current case papers in there ever since the chairman of transicon had hired someone to retrieve evidence from my safe two years ago but i just didnt think that was it bobby and i discussed the breakin for another half hour touching occasionally on my battle wounds finally i said now you tell me something bobby why dont you believe it was mackenzie mallory stated through the windshield im not doubting it i believe it id be happier if we had a gun or a fingerprint but i believe it i didnt say anything bobby continued to look forward with unseeing eyes i just wish id found him he said at last my captain got a call from commissioner sullivan friday afternoon saying he thought i was overworked and he was asking vespucci to assign carlson to help me out i went home under ordersto get some sleep not off the case just to sleep and next morning there was an arrest he turned to look at me you didnt hear that he said i nodded agreement and bobby asked me a few more questions about the missing evidence but his heart wasnt in it at last he gave up if you wont talk you wont just remember vicki earl smeissen is a heavy you know yourself the courts cant nail him dont try to play hardball with himyoure just not up to his weight at all i nodded solemnly thanks bobby ill keep it in mind i opened the door by the way bobby said casually we got a call last night from rileys gun shop down in hazelcrest said a v i warshawski had bought a small handgun down there and he was worriedshe looked rather wild that wouldnt be anyone youd know would it vicki i got out of the car shut the door and looked in through the open window im the only one by that name in my family bobbybut there are some other warshawskis in the city for once bobby didnt lose his temper he looked at me very seriously no one ever stopped you when you had your mind set on something vicki but if youre planning on using that gun get your ass down to city hall first thing tomorrow morning and register it now tell sergeant mcgonnigal where youre going to be until your place is fixed up again while i was giving mcgonnigal my address a squawk came in on mallorys radio about my office the place had been ransacked i wondered if my businessinterruption insurance would cover this remember vicki youre playing hardball with a pro bobby warned get in mcgonnigal they drove off filing a claim when i got to lottys it was afternoon i had stopped on the way to call my answering servicea mr mcgraw and a mr devereux had both phoned and left numbers i copied them into my pocket phone book but decided not to call until i got to lottys she greeted me with a worried head shake not content with beating you they beat your apartment you run with a wild crowd vic but no censure no horrorone of the things i liked in lotty she examined my face and my eye with her ophthalmoscope coming along nicely much less swelling already headache a bit to be expected have you eaten an empty stomach makes it worse come a little boiled chickennice eastern european sunday dinner she had eaten but drank coffee while i finished the chicken i was surprised at how hungry i was how long can i stay i asked im expecting no one this month as long as you like until august tenth i shouldnt be more than a weekprobably less but id like to ask the answering service to switch my home calls here lotty shrugged in that case i wont switch off the phone by the guest bedmine rings at all hourswomen having babies boys being shotthey dont keep ninetofive schedules so you run the risk of answering my calls and if any come for you ill let you know she got up now i must leave you my medical advice is for you to stay in have a drink relaxyoure not in good shape and youve had a bad shock but if you choose to disregard my professional advice well im not liable in a malpractice suitshe chuckled slightlyand keys are in the basket by the sink i have an answering machine by my bedroom phoneturn it on if you decide to go out she kissed the air near my face and left i wandered restlessly around the apartment for a few minutes i knew i should go down to my office and assess the damage i should call a guy i knew who ran a cleaning service to come and restore my apartment i should call my answering service and get my calls transferred to lottys and i needed to get back to peter thayers apartment to see if there was something there that my apartment smashers believed i had lotty was right i was not in prime condition the destruction of my apartment had been shocking i was consumed with anger the anger one has when victimized and unable to fight back i opened my suitcase and got out the box with the gun in it i unwrapped it and pulled out the smith wesson while i loaded it i had a fantasy of planting some kind of hint that would draw smeissenor whomeverback to my apartment while i stood in the hallway and pumped them full of bullets the fantasy was very vivid and i played it through several times the effect was cathartica lot of my anger drained away and i felt able to call my answering service they took lottys number and agreed to transfer my calls finally i sat down and called mcgraw good afternoon mr mcgraw i said when he answered i hear youve been trying to get in touch with me yes about my daughter he sounded a little illatease i havent forgotten her mr mcgraw in fact i have a leadnot on her directly but on some people who may know where shes gone how far have you gone with themthese people he demanded sharply as far as i could in the time i had i dont drag cases on just to keep my expense bill mounting yeah no ones accusing you of that i just dont want you to go any further what i said incredulously you started this whole chain of events and now you dont want me to find anita or did she turn up no she hasnt turned up but i think i flew off the handle a bit when she left her apartment i thought she might be wrapped up in young thayers murder somehow now the police have arrested this drug addict i see the two werent connected some of my anger returned you do by divine inspiration maybe there were no signs of robbery in that apartment and no sign that mackenzie had been there i dont believe he did it look here warshawski who are you to go around questioning the police the goddamn punk has been held for two days now if he hadnt done it hed have been let go by now now where the hell do you get off saying i dont believe it he mimicked me savagely since you and i last talked mcgraw i have been beaten and my apartment and office decimated by earl smeissen in an effort to get me off the case if mackenzie is the murderer why does smeissen care so much what earl does has no bearing on anything i do mcgraw answered im telling you to stop looking for my daughter i hired you and i can fire you send me a bill for your expensesthrow in your apartment if you want to but quit this is quite a change you were worried sick about your daughter on friday whats happened since then just get off the case warshawski mcgraw bellowed ive said ill pay younow stop fighting over it very well i said in cold anger im off the payroll ill send you a bill but youre wrong about one thing mcgrawand you can tell earl from meyou can fire me but you cant get rid of me i hung up beautiful vic beautiful rhetoric it had just been possible that smeissen believed hed cowed me into quitting so why be so full of femalechismo and yell challenges into the phone i ought to write think before acting a hundred times on the blackboard at least mcgraw had agreed to knowing earl or at least to knowing who he was that had been a shotnot totally in the dark however since the knifegrinders knew most of the hoods in chicago the fact that he knew earl didnt mean hed sikked him onto my apartmentor onto killing peter thayerbut it was sure a better connection than anything else i had i dialed ralphs number he wasnt home i paced some more but decided the time for action had arrived i wasnt going to get any further thinking about the case or worrying about intercepting a bullet from tonys gun i changed out of the green slacks into jeans and running shoes i got out my collection of skeleton keys and put them in one pocket car keys drivers license private investigator license and fifty dollars in the other i fastened the shoulder holster over a loose mantailored shirt and practiced drawing the gun until it came out quickly and naturally before leaving lottys i examined my face in the bathroom mirror she was righti did look better the left side was still discoloredin fact it was showing some more yellow and greenbut the swelling had gone down considerably my left eye was completely open and not inflamed even though the purple had spread farther it cheered me up a bit i switched on lottys telephone answering machine slipped on a jean jacket and left carefully locking the doors behind me the cubs were playing a doubleheader with st louis and addison was filled with people leaving the first game and those arriving for the second i turned on wgn radio just in time to hear dejesus lead off the bottom of the first inning with a hard drive to the shortstop he was cut down easily at first but at least he hadnt hit into a double play once clear of wrigley field traffic it was a quick twentyminute drive downtown it being sunday i was able to park on the street outside my office the police had left the area but a patrolman came over as i entered the building whats your business here miss he asked sharply but not unpleasantly im v i warshawski i told him i have an office here which was broken into earlier today and ive come to inspect the damage id like to see some identification please i pulled out my drivers license and my private investigator photoid he examined them nodded and gave them back to me okay you can go on up lieutenant mallory told me to keep an eye out and not let anyone but tenants into the building he told me youd probably stop by i thanked him and went inside for once the elevator was working and i took it rather than the stairsi could keep fit someday when i wasnt feeling quite so terrible the office door was closed but its upper glass half had been shattered when i went inside though the damage wasnt as severe as to my apartment true all my files had been dumped onto the floor but the furniture had been left intact no safe is totally entryproof someone had been into the little one in back of the big one but it must have taken five hours at least no wonder theyd been so angry by the time they got to my apartmentall that effort for nothing fortunately i hadnt had any money or sensitive papers in the place at the time i decided to leave the papers where they were tomorrow id get a kelly girl to come in and file them all for me again but id better call a boarding service for the door or the place would be ransacked by thieves id lost one of gabriellas glasses i didnt want the olivetti to go as well i got a twentyfourhour place to agree to send someone over and went downstairs the patrolman wasnt too happy when i explained what id done but he finally agreed to check it with the lieutenant i left him at the phone and continued on my way to the south side the bright cool weather was continuing and i had a pleasant drive south the lake was dotted with sailboats along the horizon nearer the shore were a few swimmers the game was in the bottom of the third and kingman struck out st louis the cubs had bad days tooin fact more than i did probably i parked in the shopping center lot behind the thayer apartment and reentered the building the chicken bones had disappeared but the smell of urine remained no one came out to question my right to be in the building and i had no trouble finding a key to open the thirdfloor apartment i should have been prepared for the shambles but it took me by surprise when id been here before there had just been the typical disorder of a student apartment now the same hand or hands that had been to my place had done a similar job here i shook my head to clear it of course they were missing something and they had been here first it was only after they hadnt found it that they had come to me i whistled a bit between my teeththe opening bars to the third act of simon boccanegraand tried to decide what to do i wondered what was missing and thought it most likely to be a piece of paper of some kind it might be evidence of fraud or a picture but i didnt think it would be an actual object it didnt seem too likely that it was still in the apartment young thayer might have given it to anita if she had it she was in worse danger than she seemed to be already i scratched my head it looked as though smeissens boys had covered all the possibilitiessofa cushions ripped papers and books dumped on the floor i decided to believe that they had gone through everything page by pageonly if my search didnt turn up anything would i take that job on in a student apartment with several hundred books it would take a sizable chunk of time to examine each one in detail the only things that were still intact were appliances and floors i made a methodical search of all the rooms for loose boards or tiles i found a few and pried them up using a hammer i found under the kitchen sink but didnt turn up anything more interesting than some old termite damage then i went through the bathroom fixture by fixture taking down the shower rod and looking into it and the toilet and sink pipes that was quite a job i had to go to my car for tools and break into the basement to turn off the water it took me more than an hour to get the rusted fittings loose enough to open them i wasnt surprised to find nothing but water in themif anyone had been into them they would have opened more easily it was and the sun was going down when i returned to the kitchen the chair where peter thayer had been sitting had had its back to the stove it was possible of course that the missing thing had not been hidden deliberately but had dropped a piece of paper might float unnoticed under the stove i lay on my stomach and shone a flashlight under it i couldnt see anything and the opening was pretty small how thorough did i want to be my muscles were aching and i had left my phenylbutazone at lottys but i went to the living room and got some bricks from a brickandboard bookcase using the jack from my trunk as a lever and the bricks as a wedge i slowly pried the stove off the floor it was an impossible task the jack would catch and raise the thing and just as i was kicking a brick under the side down it would slip again finally by dint of pulling the table over and wedging the jack underneath it i was able to get one brick under the right side after that the left came up more easily i checked the gas line to make sure it wasnt straining and carefully raised the stove by another brick i then got down on my stomach again and looked underneath there it was a piece of paper stuck by grease to the bottom of the stove i peeled it slowly off in order not to tear it and took it over to the window to examine it was a carbon copy about eight inches square the top left corner had the ajax logo on it in the center it read draft only not negotiable and it was made out to joseph gielczowski of south ingleside in matteson illinois he could take this to a bank and have it certified at which point ajax would pay the sum of to the bank as a workers compensation indemnity payment the name meant nothing to me and the transaction sounded perfectly straightforward what was so important about it ralph would know but i didnt want to call him from herebetter get the stove down and leave while the leaving was good i levered up the stove using the table again as a wedge and pulled the bricks out the stove made a dull thud as it droppedi hoped the downstairs neighbors werent home or were too selfengrossed to call the police i gathered up my tools folded the claim draft and put it in my shirt pocket and left a secondfloor apartment door opened a crack as i went by plumber i called there wont be any water on the third floor tonight the door closed again and i left the building quickly when i got back to my car the game was long over and i had to wait for the eight oclock news to come on to get the score the cubs had pulled it out in the eighth inning good old jerry martin had hit a double ontiveros had singled and wonderful dave kingman had gotten all three of them home with his thirtysecond homer of the season and all this with two out i knew how the cubs were feeling tonight and sang a little figaro on the way home to show it beautiful people lotty lifted her thick eyebrows as i came into the living room ah she said success shows in your walk the office was all right no but i found what they were looking for i took out the draft and showed it to her make anything of it she put on a pair of glasses and looked at it intently pursing her lips i see these from time to time you understand when i get paid for administering to industrial accident victims it looks totally in order as far as i can tellof course i dont read them for their content just glance at them and send them to the bank and the name gielczowski means nothing to me except that it is polish should it i shrugged i dont know doesnt mean anything to me either id better make a copy of it and get it stowed away though have you eaten i was waiting for you my dear she answered then let me take you out to dinner i need itit took a lot of work finding this physical i mean although the mental process helpednothing like a university education to teach you logic lotty agreed i showered and changed into a respectable pair of slacks a dressy shirt and a loose jacket completed the outfit and the shoulder holster fitted neatly under my left arm i put the claim draft in my jacket pocket lotty scrutinized me when i came back into the living room you hide it well vic i looked puzzled and she laughed my dear you left the empty box in the kitchen garbage and i knew i had brought no smith wesson into the house shall we go i laughed but said nothing lotty drove us down to belmont and sheridan and we had a pleasant simple dinner in the wine cellar at the chesterton hotel an austrian wine store it had expanded to include a tiny restaurant lotty approved of their coffee and ate two of the rich viennese pastries when we got home i insisted on checking front and back entrances but no one had been around inside i called larry anderson my cleaning friend and arranged for him to right my apartment not tomorrowhe had a big job on but hed go over with his best crew personally on tuesday not at all hed be delighted i got hold of ralph and agreed to meet him for dinner the next night at ahabs hows your face he asked much better thanks i should look almost presentable for you tomorrow night at eleven i bade lotty a very sleepy good night and fell into bed i was instantly asleep falling down a black hole into total oblivion much later i began dreaming the red venetian glasses were lined up on my mothers diningroom table now you must hit high c vicki and hold it my mother said i made a tremendous effort and sustained the note under my horrified eyes the row of glasses dissolved into a red pooh it way my mothers blood with a tremendous effort i pulled myself awake the phone was ringing lotty had answered it on her extension by the time i oriented myself in the strange bed when i lifted the receiver i could hear her crisp soothing voice saying yes this is dr herschel i hung up and squinted at the little illuminated face of the bedside clock poor lotty i thought what a life and rolled back over to sleep the ringing phone dragged me back to life again several hours later i dimly remembered the earlier call and wondering if lotty were back yet reached for the phone hello i said and heard lotty on the other extension i was about to hang up again when a tremulous little voice said is miss warshawski there yes speaking what can i do for you i heard the click as lotty hung up again this is jill thayer the little voice quavered trying to speak calmly can you come out to my house please you mean right now i asked yes she breathed sure thing honey be right out can you tell me the trouble now i had shoved the receiver between my right shoulder and my ear and was pulling on some clothes it was and lottys burlap curtains let in enough light to dress by without my having to fumble for the lamp switch itsi cant talk right now my mother wants me just come please okay jill hold the fort ill be there in forty minutes i hung up and hurriedly finished dressing in the clothes id worn last night not omitting the gun under my left shoulder i stopped in the kitchen where lotty was eating toast and drinking the inevitable thick viennese coffee so she said the second emergency of the day mine was a silly hemorrhaging child who had a bad abortion because she was afraid to come to me in the first place she grimaced and the mother was not to know of course and you off to winnetka another child but pleasant not silly lotty had the suntimes open in front of her anything new about the thayers she sounded quite panicked lotty poured me a cup of coffee which i swallowed in scalding gulps while scanning the paper but i found nothing i shrugged took a piece of buttered toast from lotty kissed her cheek and was gone native caution made me check the stairwells and the front walk carefully before going to the street i even examined the backseat and the engine for untoward activity before getting into the car smeissen really had me spooked traffic on the kennedy was heavy with the monday morning rush hour and people staggering home at the last minute from weekends in the country once i hit the outbound edens however i had the road chiefly to myself i had given jill thayer my card more to let her feel someone cared than because i expected an sos and with the half of my mind that wasnt looking for speed traps i wondered what had caused the cry for help a suburban teenager who had never seen death might find anything connected with it upsetting yet she had struck me as essentially levelheaded i wondered if her father had gone off the deep end in a big way i had left lottys at and turned onto willow road at pretty good time for fifteen miles considering that three had been in the heavy city traffic on addison at i pulled up to the gates of the thayer house that was as far as i got whatever had happened it was excitement in a big way the entrance was blocked by a winnetka police car lights flashing and as far as i could see into the yard it was filled with more cars and many policemen i backed the chevy down the road a bit and parked it on the gravel verge it wasnt until i turned the motor off and got out that i noticed the sleek black mercedes that had been in the yard on saturday only it wasnt in the yard it was tilted at a strange angle off the road and it was no longer sleek the front tires were flat and the front windshield was a series of glass shards fragments left from radiating circles my guess was that bullets and many of them had caused the damage in my neighborhood a noisy crowd would have gathered to gape over the sight this being the north shore a crowd had gathered but a smaller and quieter one than halsted and belmont would have attracted they were being held at bay by a lean young policeman with a mustache gee they really got mr thayers car i said to the young man strolling over when disaster strikes the police like to keep all the news to themselves they never tell you what happened and they never answer leading questions winnetkas finest were no exception what do you want the young man said suspiciously i was about to tell him the candid truth when it occurred to me that it would never get me past the herd in the driveway my name is v i warshawski i said smiling in what i hoped was a saintly way i used to be miss jill thayers governess when all the trouble started this morning she called me and asked me to come out to be with her the young cop frowned do you have any identification he demanded certainly i said righteously i wondered what use a drivers license would be in proving my story but i obligingly dug it out and handed it to him all right he said after studying it long enough to memorize the number you can talk to the sergeant he left his post long enough to walk me to the gate sarge he yelled one of the men by the door looked up this is the thayer girls governess he called cupping his hands thank you officer i said imitating miss jean brodies manner i walked up the drive to the doorway and repeated my story to the sergeant he frowned in turn we didnt have any word about a governess showing up im afraid no one is allowed in right now youre not with a newspaper are you certainly not i snapped look sergeant i said smiling a bit to show i could be conciliatory how about just asking miss thayer to come to the door she can tell you if she wants me here or not if she doesnt i can leave again but since she did ask for me shes likely to be upset if im not allowed inside the upsetness of a thayer even one as young as jill seemed to concern the sergeant i was afraid he might ring for lucy but instead he asked one of his men to fetch miss thayer minutes went by without her appearance and i began to wonder whether lucy had seen me after all and set the police straight on my governess story eventually jill arrived however her oval face was pinched and anxious and her brown hair had not been brushed her face cleared a little when she saw me oh its you she said they told me my governess was here and i thought it was old mrs wilkens isnt this your governess the patrolman demanded jill gave me an anguished look i moved into the house just tell the man you sent for me i said oh yes yes i did i called miss warshawski an hour ago and begged her to come up here the patrolman was looking at me suspiciously but i was in the house and one of the powerful thayers wanted me to be there he compromised by having me spell out my name letter by laborious letter for his notebook jill tugged on my arm while i was doing this and as soon as we were through spelling before he could ask more questions i gave her a little pat and propelled her toward the hall she led me to a little room near the big green statue and shut the door did you say you were my governess she was still trying to figure that one out i was afraid they wouldnt let me inside if i told them the truth i explained police dont like private detectives on their turf now suppose you tell me whats going on the bleak look reappeared she screwed up her face did you see the car outside i nodded my fatherthat was him they shot him did you see them do it i asked she shook her head and wiped her hand across her nose and forehead tears were suddenly streaming down her face i heard them she wailed the little room had a settee and a table with some magazines on it two heavyarmed chairs stood on either side of a window overlooking the south lawn i pulled them up to the table and sat jill in one of them i sat in the other facing her im sorry to put you through it but im going to have to ask you to tell me how it happened just take your time though and dont mind crying the story came out in little sobs my dad always leavesleaves for work between seven and seven thirty she said sometimes he goes earlier if something specialspecial isgoing on at the bank im usually asleep when he goes lucy makesmade him breakfast then i get up and she makes another breakfast mother has toast and coffee in her room shesshes always on aa diet i nodded to explain not only that i understood these details but why she was reporting them but today you werent asleep no she agreed all this stuff about petehis funeral was yesterday you know and it shook me up so i couldntcouldnt sleep very well shed stopped crying and was trying to control her voice i heard daddy get up but i didnt go down to eat with him hed been so strange you know and i didnt want to hear him say anything terrible about pete suddenly she was sobbing i wouldnt eat with him and now hes dead and now ill never have another chance the words came out in great heaving bursts between sobs she kept repeating them i took her hands yes i know its tough jill but you didnt kill him by not eating with him you know i patted her hands but didnt say anything else for a while finally though as the sobs quieted a bit i said tell me what did happen honey and then we can try to figure out an answer to it she worked hard to pull herself together and then said theres not much else to tell my bedroom is above here and i can see the side of the house i sort ofof wandered to the window and watched himwatched him drive his car down to the road she stopped to swallow but she had herself in hand you cant see the road because of all the bushes in front of it and anyway you cant see all the way down to the bottom from my room but i knew from the sound that hed gotten down and turned onto sheridan i nodded encouragingly still holding her hands tightly well i was sort of going back to my bed i thought i might get dressed when i heard all these shots only i didnt knowknow what they were she carefully wiped two new tears away it sounded horrid i heard glass shattering and then this squeal you know the way a car sounds when its turning a corner too fast or something and i thought maybe daddy had an accident you know he was acting so crazy he could have gone charging down sheridan road and hit someone so i ran downstairs without taking off my nightgown and lucy came running from the back of the house she was yelling something and trying to get me to go back upstairs and get some clothes on but i went outside anyway and ran down to the drive and found the car she screwed up her face shutting her eyes and fought against her tears again it was terrible daddydaddy was bleeding and lying all spread out on the steering wheel she shook her head i still thought hed been in an accident but i couldnt see the other car i thought maybe theyd driven off you know the ones with the squealing tires but lucy seemed to guess about the shooting anyway she kept me from going over to the cari didnt have any shoes on and by then a whole lot of cars had stopped to stare at it and shelucymade one of them call the police on his cb she wanted me to come back to the house but i wouldnt not until the police came she sniffed i didnt like to leave him there all by himself you know yeah sure honey you did real well did your mother come out no we went back to the house when the police came and i came upstairs to get dressed and then i remembered you and called you but you know when i hung up i nodded well lucy went to wake up mother and tell her and sheshe started crying and made lucy get me and she came in just then so i had to hangup so you didnt get a glimpse of the people who killed your dad she shook her head do the police believe he was in the car you heard taking off yes its something to do with shells i think there werent any shells or something so they think they must be in the car i nodded that makes sense now for the big question jill did you want me to come out for comfort and supportwhich im happy to provideor to take some kind of action she stared at me through gray eyes that had seen and heard too much for her age lately what can you do she asked you can hire me to find out who killed your dad and your brother i said matteroffactly i dont have any money only my allowance when im twentyone i get some of my trust money but im only fourteen now i laughed not to worry if you want to hire me give me a dollar and ill give you a receipt and that will mean youve hired me youll have to talk to your mother about it though my moneys upstairs she said getting up do you think the same person killed daddy who killed pete it seems probable although i dont really have any facts to go on do you think its someone who mightwell is someone trying to wipe out my family i considered that it wasnt completely out of the question but it was an awfully dramatic way to do it and rather slow i doubt it i said finally not completely impossiblebut if they wanted to do that why not just get you all when you were in the car together yesterday ill go get my money jill said going to the door she opened it and lucy appeared crossing the hall so thats where you are she said sharply how can you disappear like that and your mother wanting you she looked into the room now dont tell me that detective woman got in here come on you she said to me out you go weve got trouble enough around here without you stirring it up if you please lucy jill said in a very grownup way miss warshawski came up here because i invited her and she will leave when i ask her to well your mother will have something to say about that lucy snapped ill talk to her myself jill snapped back can you wait here please while i get my money she added to me and then would you mind coming to see my mother with me i dont think i can explain it to her by myself not at all i said politely giving her an encouraging smile after jill had gone lucy said all i can say is that mr thayer didnt want you here and what he would say if he could see you well we both know he cant i interrupted however if he had been able to explainto me or to anyone elsewhat was on his mind he would very likely be alive this morning look i like jill and id like to help her out she called me this morning not because she has the faintest idea of what i can do for her as a private detective but because she feels im supporting her dont you think she gets left out around here lucy looked at me sourly maybe so miss detective maybe so but if jill had any consideration for her mother maybe shed get a little consideration back i see i said dryly jill came back downstairs your mother is waiting for you lucy reminded her sharply i know jill yelled im coming she handed me a dollar and i gravely wrote out a receipt on a scrap of paper from my handbag lucy watched the whole thing angrily her lips shut in a thin line we then retraced the route id taken saturday through the long hall we passed the library door and went clear to the back of the house lucy opened the door to a room on the left saying here she is mrs thayer shes got some terrible detective with her whos trying to take money from her mr thayer threw her out of the house on saturday but now shes back a patrolman standing beside the door gave me a startled look lucy jill stormed thats a lie she pushed her way past the disapproving figure into the room i stood behind lucy looking over her shoulder it was a delightful room completely windows on three sides it overlooked the lake out the east side and a beautiful lawn complete with a grass tennis court on the north it was furnished with white bamboo furniture with cheerful color accents in reds and yellows in the cushions lamp bases and floor covering a profusion of plants gave it a greenhouse effect in the middle of this charming setting was mrs thayer even with no makeup and a few tearstains she was very handsome easily recognizable as the original of the picture in yesterdays heraldstar a very pretty young woman an older edition of jill sat solicitously on one side of her and a handsome young man in a polo shirt and checked trousers sat across from her looking a little illatease please jill i dont understand a word you or lucy are saying but dont shout darling my nerves absolutely wont stand it i moved past lucy into the room and went over to mrs thayers couch mrs thayer im very sorry about your husband and your son i said my name is v i warshawski im a private detective your daughter asked me to come up here this morning to see if i could help out the young man answered sticking his jaw out im mrs thayers soninlaw and i think i can safely say that if my fatherinlaw threw you out of the house on saturday that youre probably not wanted here jill did you call her the young woman asked shocked yes i did jill answered setting her jaw mulishly and you cant throw her out jack its not your house i asked her to come up and ive hired her to find out who killed daddy and pete she thinks the same person did it both times really jill the other woman said i think we can leave this to the police without upsetting mother by bringing in hired detectives just what i tried telling her mrs thorndale but of course she wouldnt listen that was lucy triumphant jills face was screwed up again as if she were going to cry take it easy honey i said lets not get everyone more worked up than they are already why dont you tell me whos who sorry she gulped this is my mother my sister susan thorndale and her husband jack and jack thinks because he can boss susan around he can do that to me but steady jill i said putting a hand on her shoulder susans face was pink jill if you hadnt been spoiled rotten all these years you would show a little respect to someone like jack who has a lot more experience than you do do you have any idea what people are going to be saying about daddy the way he was killed and all why why it looks like a gang killing and it makes daddy look as if he was involved with the gang her voice rose to a high pitch on the last sentence mob i said susan looked at me blankly it looks like a mob killing some gangs may go in for that style of execution but usually they dont have the resources now look here jack said angrily weve already asked you to leave why dont you go instead of showing off your smart mouth like susan said its going to be hard enough explaining away the way mr thayer died without having to explain why we got a private detective involved as well is that all you care about jill cried what people will say with pete dead and daddy dead no one is sorrier than me that peter was shot jack said but if he had done what your father wanted and lived in a proper apartment instead of that slummy dump with that slut of a girl he would never have been shot in the first place oh jill screamed how can you talk about peter that way he was trying to do something warm and real instead ofyoure such a fake all you and susan care about is how much money you make and what the neighbors will say i hate you she ended on another flood of tears and flung herself into my arms i gave her a hug and wrapped my right arm around her while i fished in my bag for some tissues with the left jill her mother said in a soft complaining voice jill honey please dont shout like that in here my nerves just absolutely cannot take it im just as sorry as you are that petey is dead but jack is right honey if hed listened to your father all this wouldnt have happened and your father wouldnt bebe her voice broke off and she started weeping quietly susan put an arm around her mother and patted her shoulder now see what youve done she said venomously whether to me or to her sister i wasnt sure now youve caused enough disturbance you polack detective whatever your name is lucy began dont you dare talk to her like that jill cried her voice partly muffled by my shoulder her name is miss warshawski and you should call her miss warshawski well mother thayer jack said with a rueful laugh sorry to drag you into this but since jill wont listen to her sister or me will you tell her that she has to get this woman out of the house oh please jack his motherinlaw said leaning on susan she stretched out a hand to him without looking at him and i was interested to note that her eyes didnt turn red with crying i just dont have the strength to deal with jill in one of her moods however she pulled herself into a sitting position still holding on to jacks hand and looked at jill earnestly jill i just cannot stand for you to have one of your temper tantrums right now you and peter never listen to what anyone has to say to you if petey had he wouldnt be dead now with petey dead and john i just cant take anything else so dont talk to this private detective any longer shes taking advantage of you to get her name in the paper and i cant bear another scandal about this family before i could say anything jill tore herself away from me her little face crimson dont talk like that to me she screamed i care about pete and daddy and you dont youre the one whos bringing scandals into the house everybody knows you didnt love daddy everybody knows what you and dr mulgrave were up to daddy was probably susan leaped up from the couch and slapped her sister hard on the face you goddamn brat be quiet mrs thayer started weeping in earnest jill overcome by assorted strong and uncontrollable feelings began sobbing again at that moment a worriedlooking man in a business suit came into the room escorted by one of the patrolmen he crossed to mrs thayer and clasped her hands margaret i came as soon as i heard the news how are you susan blushed jills sobs died away jack looked as though he had been stuffed mrs thayer turned large tragic eyes to the newcomers face ted how kind of you she said in a brave voice barely above a whisper dr mulgrave i presume i said he dropped mrs thayers wrists and stood up straight yes im dr mulgrave he looked at jack is this a policewoman no i said im a private investigator miss thayer has hired me to find out who killed her father and brother margaret he asked incredulously no miss thayer jill i said jack said mrs thayer just ordered you to leave her house and leave her daughter alone id think even an ambulance chaser like you would know how to take a hint like that oh cool it thorndale i said whats eating you jill asked me to come up here because shes scared sillyas any normal person would be with all this going on but you guys are so defensive you make me wonder what youre hiding what do you mean he scowled well why dont you want me looking into your fatherinlaws death what are you afraid ill find outthat he and peter caught you with your fingers in the till and you had them shot to shut them up i ignored his outraged gasp what about you doctor did mr thayer learn about your relations with his wife and threaten divorcebut you decided a wealthy widow was a better bet than a woman who couldnt make a very good case for alimony now look here whatever your name is i dont have to listen to that kind of crap mulgrave started then leave i said maybe lucy is using this house as a center for burglarizing wealthy homes on the north shoreafter all as a maid she probably hears a lot about where jewelry documents and so on are kept when mr thayer and his son got too hot on her trail she hired a murderer i smiled enthusiastically at susan who was starting to babblei was getting carried away by my own fantasies i could probably think of a motive for you too mrs thorndale all im trying to say is you people are so hostile that it starts me wondering the less you want me to undertake a murder investigation the more i start thinking there might be something to my ideas when i stopped talking they were silent for a minute mulgrave was clasping mrs thayers hands again sitting next to her now susan looked like a kitten getting ready to spit at a dog my client was sitting on one of the bamboo side chairs her hands clenched in her lap her face intent then mulgrave said are you trying to threaten usthreaten the thayer family if you mean am i threatening to find out the truth the answer is yes if that means turning up a lot of sordid junk along the way tough just a minute ted jack said waving an arm at the older man i know how to deal with her he nodded at me come on name your price he said pulling out his checkbook my fingers itched to bring out the smith wesson and pistolwhip him grow up thorndale i snapped there are things in this life that money cant buy regardless of what you or your motherinlaw or the mayor of winnetka says i am investigating this murderthese murders i laughed a little mirthlessly two days ago john thayer tried to give me to buy me out of this case you guys up here on the north shore live in some kind of dream world you think you can buy a coverup for anything that goes wrong in your lives just like you hire the garbagemen to take away your filth or lucy here to clean it up and carry it outside for you it doesnt work that way john thayer is dead he couldnt pay enough to get whatever filth he was involved in away from him nor away from his son now whatever it was that caused their deaths isnt private anymore it doesnt belong to you anyone who wants it can find out about it i intend to mrs thayer was moaning softly jack looked uncomfortable with an effort to save his dignity he said naturally if you choose to poke around in something thats none of your business we cant stop you its just that we think matters are better off left to the police yeah well theyre not batting a thousand right now i said they thought they had a guy behind bars for the crime but while he was eating his prison breakfast this morning john thayer got killed susan turned to jill this is all your fault you brought this person up here now weve been insulted and embarrassedive never been more ashamed in my life daddys been killed and all you can think about is bringing in some outsider to call us names mulgrave turned back to mrs thayer and jack and susan both started talking to him at once while this was going on i walked over to jill and knelt down to look her in the face she was looking as though she might collapse or go into shock look i think you need to get away from all this is there any friend or relative you can visit until the worst of the fuss is over she thought for a minute then shook her head not really ive got lots of friends you know but i dont think any of their mothers would like having me around right now she gave a wobbly smile the scandal you know like jack said i wish anita were here i hesitated a minute would you like to come back to chicago with me my apartments been torn up and im staying with a friend but shell be glad to have you too for a few days lotty would never mind another stray i needed jill where i could ask her some questions and i wanted her away from her family she was tough and could fight back but she didnt need to do that kind of fighting on top of the shock of her fathers death her face lightened do you really mean that i nodded why dont you run upstairs now and pack an overnight bag while everyone is still arguing here when she had left the room i explained what i was doing to mrs thayer this predictably started a fresh uproar from the family finally though mulgrave said its important that margaretmrs thayerbe kept absolutely quiet if jill really is worrying her perhaps it would be better if she did leave for a few days i can make some inquiries about this person and if shes not reliable we can always bring jill back home mrs thayer gave a martyred smile thank you ted if you say its all right im sure it will be as long as you live in a safe neighborhood miss warshawski i said dryly well no ones been machinegunned there this week mulgrave and jack decided i ought to give them some references to call i saw that as a facesaving effort and gave them the name of one of my old law professors he would be startled but supportive if he got an inquiry into my character when jill came back shed brushed her hair and washed her face she went over to her mother who was still sitting on the couch im sorry mother she muttered i didnt mean to be rude to you mrs thayer smiled wanly its all right dear i dont expect you to understand how i feel she looked at me take good care of her for me sure i answered i dont want any trouble jack warned me ill keep that in mind mr thorndale i picked up jills suitcase and she followed me out the door she stopped in the doorway to look at her family well goodbye she said they all looked at her but no one said anything when we got to the front door i explained to the sergeant that miss thayer was coming home with me for a few days to get a little rest and attention had the police taken all the statements they needed from her after some talk with his lieutenant over the walkietalkie he agreed that she could leave as long as i gave him my address i gave it to him and we walked down the drive jill didnt say anything on the way over to the edens she looked straight ahead and didnt pay much attention to the countryside as we joined the stopandgo traffic on the southbound kennedy though she turned to look at me do you think i was wrong leaving my mother like that i braked to let a fiftyton semi merge in front of me well jill it seemed to me that everyone there was trying to play on your guilt feelings now youre feeling guilty so maybe they got what they wanted out of you she digested that for a few minutes is that a scandal the way my father was killed people are probably talking about it and that will make jack and susan very uncomfortable the real question though is why he was killedand even the answer to that question doesnt have to be a scandal to you i threaded my way around a heraldstar delivery van thing is you have to have your own sense of whats right built inside you if your father ran afoul of the type of people who do machinegunstyle executions it may be because they tried to violate his sense of whats right no scandal to that and even if he happened to be involved in some kind of shady activity it doesnt have to affect you unless you want it to i changed lanes i dont believe in the visitation of the sins of the fathers and i dont believe in people brooding over vengeance for twenty years jill turned a puzzled face toward me oh it can happen its just that youve got to want to make it happen like your motherunhappy womanright jill nodded and probably unhappy because of things that happened thirty years ago thats her choice youve got the same choice suppose your father did something criminal and we find that out its going to be rough but it only has to be a scandal and make your life miserable if you let it lots of things in this life happen to you no matter what you do or through no fault of your ownlike your father and brother getting killed but how you make those events part of your life is under your control you can get bitter although i dont think you have that kind of character or you can learn and grow from it i realized that id passed the addison exit and turned onto the belmont offramp sorrythat answer turned into a sermon and i got so carried away i missed my exit does it help any jill nodded and was quiet again as i drove north along pulaski and then turned east on addison its lonely now with peter gone she said finally he was the only one in the family whowho cared about me yeah its going to be rough sweetie i said gently and squeezed her hand thank you for coming up miss warshawski she whispered i had to lean over to hear her my friends call me vic i said friendly persuasion i stopped at the clinic before going to the apartment to let lotty know id made free with her hospitality and to see if she thought jill needed anything for shock a small group of women most of them with younger children were waiting in the little anteroom jill looked around her curiously i poked my head into the inner door where lottys nurse a young puerto rican woman saw me hello vic she said lottys with a patient do you need something hi carol tell her that id like to bring my young friend back to her apartmentthe one i went out this morning to see shell know whom you mean and ask her if she can take a quick look at herhealthy kid but shes had a lot of stress lately carol went into the tiny examining room where she spoke for a few minutes bring her into the office lotty will take a quick look at her after mrs segi has left and of course take her to the apartment i took jill into lottys office among disapproving frowns from those who had been waiting longer while we waited i told her a little bit about lotty austrian war refugee brilliant london university medical student maverick doctor warm friend lotty herself came bustling in so this is miss thayer she said briskly vic has brought you down for a little rest thats good she lifted jills chin with her hand looked at her pupils made her do some simple tests talking all the while what was the trouble she asked her father was shot i explained lotty clicked her tongue and shook her head then turned to jill now open your mouth no i know you havent got a sore throat but its free im a doctor and i have to look good nothing wrong with you but you need some rest and something to eat vic when you get her home a little brandy dont talk too much let her get some rest are you going out yes ive got a lot to do she pursed her lips and thought a minute ill send carol over in about an hour she can stay with jill until one of us gets home at that moment i realized how much i liked lotty id been a little uneasy about leaving jill alone in case earl was close on my trail whether lotty knew that or simply felt a scared young girl should not be left alone it was a worry i now did not have to speak aloud great ill wait until she gets there we left the clinic among more baleful stares while carol summoned the next patient shes nice isnt she jill said as we got into the car lotty or carol both but lotty i meant she really doesnt mind me showing up like this does she no i agreed all of lottys instincts are directed at helping people shes just not sentimental about it when we got back to the apartment i made jill stay in the car while i checked the street and the entranceway i didnt want to add to her fears but i didnt want anyone getting a shot at her either the coast was still clear maybe earl really did believe hed scared me off or maybe with the police arresting poor donald mackenzie he was resting easy when we got inside i told jill to take a hot bath i was going to prepare some breakfast and i would have to ask her a few questions but then she was to sleep i can tell by your eyes that you havent been doing that for a while i said jill agreed shyly i helped her unpack her small suitcase in the room id been sleeping in i could sleep on the daybed in the living room i got out one of lottys enormous white bath sheets and showed her the bathroom i realized that i was quite hungry it was ten and i hadnt eaten the toast lotty had thrust at me i foraged in the refrigerator no juicelotty never drank anything out of cans i found a drawer full of oranges and squeezed a small pitcher of juice and then took some of lottys thick light viennese bread and turned it into french toast whistling under my breath i realized i felt good despite thayers death and all the unexplained dangling pieces to the case some instinct told me that things were finally starting to happen when jill emerged pink and sleepy from the bath i set her to eating holding my questions and telling her a little bit about myself in answer to her inquiries she wanted to know if i always caught the killer this is the first time ive ever really dealt directly with a killer i answered but generally yes i do get to the root of the problems im asked to look into are you scared jill asked i mean youve been beaten up and your apartment got torn up and theythey shot daddy and pete yes of course im scared i said calmly only a fool would look at a mess like this and not be its just that it doesnt panic meit makes me careful being scared does but it doesnt override my judgment now i want you to tell me everything you can remember about whom your father talked to in the last few days and what they said well go sit on the bed and youll drink some hot milk with brandy as lotty ordered so that when im done youll go to sleep she followed me into the bedroom and got into bed obediently sipping at the milk i had put in brown sugar and nutmeg and laced it heavily she made a face but continued sipping it while we talked when i came out on saturday you said your father at first didnt believe this mackenzie theyve arrested killed your brother but the neighbors talked him out of it what neighbors well a lot of people came by and they all more or less said the same thing do you want all their names if you can remember them and remember what they said we went through a list of about a dozen people which included yardley masters and his wife the only name i recognized i got some long histories of relations among the families and jill contorted her face in the effort of trying to remember exactly what theyd all said you said they all more or less said the same thing i repeated after a while was anyone more emphatic about it than the others she nodded at that mr masters daddy kept raving that he was sure that anitas father had done it and mr masters said something like look john you dont want to keep going around saying things like that a lot of things could come out that you dont want to hear then daddy got mad and started yelling what do you mean are you threatening me and mr masters said no of course not john were friends just giving you some advise or something like that i see i said very illuminating was that all yes but it was after mr and mrs masters left that daddy said he guessed he was wrong which made me glad at the time because of course anita wouldnt try to kill peter but then he started saying terrible things about peter yeah lets not talk about that now i want you to calm down so you can sleep did anything happen yesterday well he got into a fight with someone on the phone but i dont know who or what it was about i think it was some deal going on at the bank because he said i wont be a party to itthats all i heard hed been sostrange she gulped and swallowed some more milk at the funeral you know i sort of was staying out of his way and when i heard him start yelling on the phone i just went outside susan was after me anyway to put on a dress and sit in the living room entertaining all these gruesome people who came over after the funeral so i just sort of left and went down to the beach i laughed a little good for you this fight on the telephonedid your father get a call or make a call im pretty sure he made it at least i dont remember hearing the phone ring okay all thats a help now try to put it out of your mind you finish your milk while i brush your hair and then you sleep she was really very tired between the hairbrushing and the brandy she relaxed and lay down stay with me she asked drowsily i pulled the shades behind the burlap curtains and sat down beside jill holding her hand something about her pierced my heart made me long for the child id never had and i watched her carefully until she was in a deep sleep while i waited for carol i made some phone calls first to ralph i had to wait a few minutes while a secretary hunted him down on the floor but he was as cheerful as ever when he came on the line hows it going sherlock he asked breezily pretty well i answered youre not calling me to cancel dinner tonight are you no no i assured him id just like you to do something that you can find out more easily than i can whats that just find out if your boss has had any calls from a guy named andrew mcgraw and do it without letting him know youre asking are you still flogging that dead horse he asked a little exasperated i havent written anyone off ralph not even you but the police made an arrest well in that case your boss is innocent just look on it as a favor to a lady whos had a rough week all right he agreed not too happily but i wish you could believe the police know as much about catching murderers as you do i laughed youre not the only one by the way did you know young peters father was killed this morning what he exclaimed how did that happen well he was shot too bad donald mackenzie is already in jail but there must be some dope dealers on the north shore to take the blame for this one you think peters death is connected to this well it staggers the imagination if two members of the same family are killed within a week of each other and those events are only randomly associated all right all right ralph said youve made your pointno need to be sarcastic ill ask yardleys secretary thanks ralph see you tonight the claim draft masterss remarks to thayer which might or might not have been vague threats it didnt add up to much but it was worth pursuing the other piece to the puzzle was mcgraw and the fact that mcgraw knew smeissen now if i could connect mcgraw and masters or masters and smeissen i should have asked ralph to check on earl too well i could do that tonight say mcgraw and masters were doing an unspecified something together if they were smart they wouldnt leave names when they called each other even mcgraws enchanting secretary might give him away to the police if the evidence was hot enough but they might get together meet for a drink i might make a trip to bars in the loop and near knifegrinder headquarters to see if the two had ever been seen together or thayer with mcgraw for that matter i needed some photographs and i had an idea where to find them carol arrived as i was looking a number up in the directory jills asleep i told her i hope shell sleep through the afternoon good she answered ive brought all the old medical records over were always too busy at the clinic to get them updated but this is a good opportunity we chatted for a few minutes about her mother who had emphysema and the prospects for finding the arsonists who were plaguing the neighborhood before i went back to the phone murray ryerson was the crime reporter for the heraldstar who interviewed me after the transicon case broke hed had a byline and a lot of his stuff was good it was getting close to lunch and i wasnt sure hed be in when i called the city desk but my luck seemed to be turning ryerson he rumbled into the phone this is vi warshawski oh hi he said mind turning over competently and remembering me without trouble got any good stories for me today not today but i might have later in the week i need some help though a couple of pictures whose look if i tell you will you promise not to put two and two together in the paper until i have some evidence maybe depends on how close youre coming to a story that we know is happening anyway andrew mcgraw on any of your hot lists oh hes a perennial favorite but we dont have anything breaking on him right now whos the other guy named yardley masters hes a vicepresident over at ajax and you probably have something in your file from crusade of mercy publicity or something like that you tying mcgraw to ajax stop slobbering in the phone murray ajax doesnt do any business with the knifegrinders well are you tying mcgraw to masters he persisted what is this twenty questions i said irritably i need two pictures if a story breaks you can have ityou did all right from me on transicon didnt you tell you whatyou eaten yet good ill meet you at fiorellas in an hour with the pictures if any and try to pick your brains over a beer great murray thanks i hung up and looked at my watch an hour would give me time to stop and register the smith wesson i started humming chio mi scordi di te again tell lotty ill be back around six but ill be eating dinner out i called to carol on my way out pub crawl the eager bureaucrats at city hall took longer than i expected with forms fees incomprehensible directions and anger at being asked to repeat them i was already running late but i decided to stop at my lawyers office to drop off a xerox of the claim draft id found in peter thayers apartment he was a dry imperturbable man and accepted without a blink my instructions to give the draft to murray ryerson should anything happen to me in the next few days by the time i got to fiorellas a pleasant restaurant whose outdoor tables overlooked the chicago river murray was already finishing his second beer he was a big man who looked like a redhaired elliott gould and he waved a hand at me lazily when he saw me coming a highmasted sailboat was floating past you know theyre going to raise every drawbridge along here for that one boat hell of a system isnt it he said as i came up oh theres something appealing about a little boat being able to stop all the traffic on michigan avenue unless of course the bridge gets stuck up just when you need to cross the river this was an alltoofrequent happening motorists had no choice but to sit and boil quietly while they waited has there ever been a murder when one of these bridges is stucksomeone getting too angry and shooting the bridge tender or something not yet murray said if it happens ill be on the spot to interview you what are you drinking i dont like beer that well i ordered a white wine got your pix for you murray tossed a folder over to me we had a lot of choice on mcgraw but only dug one up for mastershes receiving some civic award out in winnetkathey never ran the shot but its a pretty good threequarter view i got you a couple of copies thanks i said opening the folder the one of masters was good he was shaking hands with the illinois president of the boy scouts of america at his right was a solemnfaced youth in uniform who apparently was his son the picture was two years old murray had brought me several of mcgraw one outside a federal courtroom where he was walking pugnaciously in front of a trio of treasury men another taken under happier circumstances showed him at the gala celebration when he was first elected president of the knifegrinders nine years ago the best for my purposes though was a closeup taken apparently without his knowledge his face was relaxed but concentrating i held it out toward murray this is great where was it taken murray smiled senate hearings on racketeering and the unions no wonder he looked so thoughtful a waiter came by for our order i asked for mostaccioli murray chose spaghetti with meatballs i was going to have to start running again sore muscles or not with all the starch i was eating lately now v i warshawski most beautiful detective in chicago what gives with these pictures murray said clasping his hands together on the table and leaning over them toward me i recall seeing that dead young peter thayer worked for ajax in fact for mr masters an old family friend also somewhere in the thousands of lines that have been churned out since he died i recall reading that his girl friend the lovely and dedicated anita mcgraw was the daughter of wellknown union leader andrew mcgraw now you want pictures of both of them is it possible that you are suggesting they colluded in the death of young thayer and possibly his father as well i looked at him seriously it was like this murray mcgraw has what amounts to a psychopathic hatred of capitalist bosses when he realized that his pure young daughter who had always been protected from any contact with management was seriously considering marrying not just a boss but the son of one of chicagos wealthiest businessmen he decided the only thing to do was to have the young man put six feet underground his psychosis is such that he decided to have john thayer eliminated as well just for spare me the rest murray said i can spell it out for myself is either mcgraw or masters your client youd better be buying this lunch murrayit is definitely a business expense the waiter brought our food slapping it down in the hurried careless way that is the hallmark of business restaurants at lunch i snatched the pictures back just in time to save them from spaghetti sauce and started sprinkling cheese on my pasta i love it really cheesy do you have a client he asked spearing a meatball yes i do but you wont tell me who it is i smiled and nodded agreement you buy mackenzie as thayer juniors murderer murray asked i havent talked to the man but one does have to wonder who killed thayer senior if mackenzie killed the son i dont like the thought of two people in the same family killed in the same week for totally unconnected reasons by unconnected people laws of chance are against that i answered what about you he gave a big elliot gould smile you know i talked to lieutenant mallory after the case first broke and he didnt say anything about robbery either of the boy or of the apartment now you found the body didnt you well did the apartment look ransacked i couldnt really tell if anything had been takeni didnt know what was supposed to be there by the way what took you down there in the first place he asked casually nostalgia murrayi used to go to school down there and i got an itch to see what the old place looked like murray laughed okay vic you wincant fault me for trying though can you i laughed too i didnt mind i finished my pastano child had ever died in india because of my inhumane failure to clean my plate if i find out anything you might be interested in ill let you know i said murray asked me when i thought the cubs would break this year they were looking scrappy right nowtwo and a half games out you know murray i am a person with very few illusions about life i like to have the cubs as one of them i stirred my coffee but id guess the second week in august what about you well this is the third week in july i give them ten more games martin and buckner cant carry that team i agreed sadly we finished lunch on baseball and split the check when it came there is one thing murray he looked at me intently i almost laughed the change in his whole posture had been so completehe really looked like a bloodhound on the trail now i have what i think is a clue i dont know what it means or why it is a clue but ive left a copy of it with my attorney if i should be bumped off or put out of action for any length of time he has instructions to give it to you what is it murray asked you ought to be a detective murrayyou ask as many questions and youre just as hot when youre on the trail one thing i will sayearl smeissens hovering around this case he gave me this beautiful black eye which youve been too gentlemanly to mention it wouldnt be totally out of the question for my body to come floating down the chicago riveryou might look out your office window every hour or so to see murray didnt look surprised you already knew that i asked he grinned you know who arrested donald mackenzie yes frank carlson and whose boy is carlson he asked henry vespucci and do you know whos been covering vespuccis back all these years i thought about it tim sullivan i guessed the lady wins a kewpie doll murray said since you know that much ill tell you who sullivan spent christmas in florida with last year oh christ not earl murray laughed yes earl smeissen himself if youre playing around with that crowd youd better be very very careful i got up and stuck the folder in my shoulder bag thanks murray youre not the first one to tell me so thanks for the pictures ill let you know if anything turns up as i climbed over the barrier separating the restaurant from the sidewalk i could hear murray yelling a question behind me he came pounding up to me just as i reached the top of the stairs leading from the river level to michigan avenue i want to know what it was you gave your lawyer he panted i grinned so long murray i said and boarded a michigan avenue bus i had a plan that was really a stab in the dark more than anything else i was assuming that mcgraw and masters worked together and i was hoping they met at some point they could handle everything over the phone or by mail but mcgraw might be wary of federal wiretaps and mail interception he might prefer to do business in person so say they met from time to time why not in a bar and if in a bar why not one near to one or the other of their offices of course it was possible that they met as far from anyplace connected to either of them as they could but my whole plan was based on a series of shots in the dark i didnt have the resources to comb the whole city so id just have to add one more assumption to my agenda and hope that if they met and if they met in a bar they did so near where they worked my plan might not net me anything but it was all i could think of i was pinning more hope on what i might learn about anita from the radical womens group tomorrow night in the meantime i needed to keep busy ajaxs glassandsteel highrise was on michigan avenue at adams in the loop michigan is the easternmost street the art institute is across the street and then grant park goes down to the lake in a series of pleasant fountains and gardens i decided to take the fort dearborn trust on la salle street as my western border and to work from van buren two blocks south of ajax up to washington three blocks north a purely arbitrary decision but the bars in that area would keep me busy for some time i could expand it in desperation if that was necessary i rode my bus south past the art institute to van buren and got off i felt very small walking between the highrises when i thought of the vast terrritory i had to cover i wondered how much i might have to drink to get responses from the myriad bartenders there probably is a better way to do this i thought but this was the only way that occurred to me i had to work with what i could come up withno peter wimsey at home thinking of the perfect logical answer for me i squared my shoulders and walked half a block along van buren and went into the spot the first bar i came to id debated about an elaborate cover story and finally decided that something approximating the truth was best the spot was a dark narrow bar built like a railway caboose booths lined the west wall and a long bar ran the length of the east leaving just enough room for the stout bleached waitress who had to tend to orders in the booths i sat up at the ban the bartender was cleaning glasses most of the luncheon trade had left only a few diehard drinkers were sitting farther down from me a couple of women were finishing hamburgers and daiquiris in one of the booths the bartender continued his work methodically until the last glass was rinsed before coming down to take my order i stared ahead with the air of a woman in no particular hurry beer is not my usual drink but it was probably the best thing to order on an allday pub crawl it wouldnt make me drunk or at least not as quickly as wine or liquor id like a draft i said he went to his spigots and filled a glass with pale yellow and foam when he brought it back to me i pulled out my folder you ever seen these two guys come in here i asked he gave me a sour look what are you a cop or something yes i said have you ever seen these two guys in here together id better get the boss on this one he said raising his voice he called herman and a heavy man in a polyester suit got up from the booth at the far end of the room i hadnt noticed him when i came in but now i saw that another waitress was sitting in the booth the two were sharing a late lunch after the hectic noonhour rush the heavy man joined the bartender behind the bar whats up luke luke jerked his head toward me ladys got a question he went back to his glasses stacking them in careful pyramids on either side of the cash register herman came down toward me his heavyset face looked tough but not mean what do you want maam i pulled my photos out again im trying to find out if these two men have ever been in here together i said in a neutral voice you got a legal reason for asking i pulled my pi license from my handbag im a private investigator theres a grand jury investigation and theres some question of collusion between a witness and a juror i showed him the id he looked at the id briefly grunted and tossed it back to me yeah i see youre a private investigator all right but i dont know about this grand jury story i know this guy he tapped masterss picture he works up at ajax doesnt come in here often maybe three times a year but hes been doing it as long as ive owned the place i didnt say anything but took a swallow of beer anything tastes good when your throat is dry from embarrassment tell you for free though this other fellows never been in here at least not when ive been here he gave a shout of laughter and reached across the bar to pat my cheek thats okay cookie i wont spoil your story for you thanks i said dryly what do i owe you for the beer on the house he gave another snort of laughter and rolled back down the aisle to his unfinished lunch i took another swallow of the thin beer then i put a dollar on the counter for luke and walked slowly out of the bar i walked on down van buren past searss main chicago store a lot of shortorder food places were on the other side but i had to go another block to find another bar the bartender looked blankly at the photos and called the waitress over she looked at both of them doubtfully and then picked up mcgraws he looks kind of familiar she said is he on tv or something i said no but had she ever seen him in the bar she didnt think so but she couldnt swear to it what about masters she didnt think so but a lot of businessmen came in there and all men with gray hair and business suits ran together in her mind after a while i put two singles on the counter one for her and one for the bartender and went on down the street her tv question gave me an idea for a better cover story the next place i went to i said i was a market researcher looking for viewer recognition did anyone remember ever seeing these two people together this approach got more interest but drew another blank the game was on tv in this bar bottom of the fourth with cincinnati leading i watched biittner hit a single and then die on second after a hairraising steal before i moved on in all i went to thirtytwo bars that afternoon catching most of the game in between the cubs lost id covered my territory pretty thoroughly a couple of places recognized mcgraw vaguely but i put that down to the number of times his picture had been in the paper over the years most people probably had a vague recognition of jimmy hoffa too one other bar knew masters by sight as one of the men from ajax and billys knew him by name and title as well but neither place remembered seeing mcgraw with him some places were hostile and took a combination of bribes and threats to get an answer some were indifferent others like the spot had to have the manager make the decision but none of them had seen my pair together it was after six by the time i got to washington and state two blocks west of michigan after my fifth bar id stopped drinking any of the beer i ordered but i was feeling slightly bloated as well as sweaty and depressed id agreed to meet ralph at ahabs at eight i decided to call it an afternoon and go home to wash up first marshall field occupies the whole north side of the street between state and wabash it seemed to me there might be one other bar on washington close to michigan if my memory of the layout was correct that could wait until another day i went down the stairs to the state street subway and boarded a b train to addison evening rush hour was still in full force i couldnt get a seat and had to stand all the way to fullerton at lottys i headed straight for the bathroom and a cold shower when i came out i looked into the guest room jill was up so i dumped my clothes in a drawer and put on a caftan jill was sitting on the livingroom floor playing with two rosycheeked darkhaired children who looked to be three or four hi honey you get a good rest she looked up at me and smiled a lot of color had returned to her face and she seemed much more relaxed hi she said yes i only woke up an hour ago these are carols nieces she was supposed to babysit tonight but lotty talked her into coming over here and making homemade enchiladas yumyum yumyum the two little girls chorused that sounds great im afraid i have to go back out tonight so ill have to give it a miss jill nodded lotty told me are you doing some more detecting well i hope so lotty called out from the kitchen and i went in to say hi carol was working busily at the stove and turned briefly to flash me a bright smile lotty was sitting at the table reading the paper drinking her everlasting coffee she looked at me through narrowed eyes the detective work wasnt so agreeable this afternoon eh i laughed no i learned nothing and had to drink too much beer doing so this stuff smells great wish i could cancel this evening out then do so i shook my head i feel as though i dont have much timemaybe this second murder even though i feel a little rockytoo long a day too much heat i cant stop i just hope i dont get sick at dinnermy date is getting fed up with me as it is although maybe if i fainted or something it would make him feel stronger more protective i shrugged jill looks a lot better dont you think oh yes the sleep did her good that was well thought of to get her out of that house for a while i talked to her a bit when i came in shes very well be doesnt whine and complain but its obvious the mother has no emotions to spare for her as for her sister lotty made an expressive gesture yeah i agree we cant keep her down here forever though besides what on earth can she do during the day ive got to be gone again tomorrow and not on the kind of errand that she can go along with well ive been thinking about that carol and i had a bit of an idea watching her with rosa and tracythe two nieces jill is good with these childrentook them on we didnt ask her to look after them babies are good when youre depressedsomething soft and unquestioning to cuddle what would you think of her coming over to the clinic and minding children there for a day as you saw this morning theyre always tumbling around the placemothers who are sick cant leave them alone or if one baby is sick who looks after the other when mama brings him in i thought it over for a minute but couldnt see anything wrong with it ask her i said im sure the best thing for her right now would be to have something to do lotty got up and went to the living room i followed we stood for a minute watching the three girls on the floor they were terribly busy about something although it wasnt clear what lotty squatted down next to them moving easily i moved into the background lotty spoke perfect spanish and she talked to the little girls in that language for a minute jill watched her respectfully then lotty turned to jill still balancing easily on her haunches youre very good with these little ones have you worked with young children before i was a counselor at a little neighborhood day camp in june jill said flushing a bit but thats all i never babysit or anything like that well i had a bit of a plan see what you think vic must be gone all the time trying to find out why your father and brother were killed now while you are visiting down here you could be of great help to me at the clinic she outlined her idea jills face lit up but you know she said seriously i dont have any training i might not know what to do if they all started to cry or something well if that happens that will be the test of your knack and patience lotty said i will provide you a little assistance by way of a drawerful of lollipops bad for the teeth perhaps but great for tears i went into the bedroom to change for dinner jill hadnt made the bed the sheets were crumpled i straightened them out then thought i might just lie down for a minute to recover my equilibrium the next thing i knew lotty was shaking me awake its seven thirty vic dont you have to be going oh hell i swore my head was thick with sleep thanks lotty i swung out of bed and hurriedly put on a bright orange sundress i stuck the smith wesson in my handbag grabbed a sweater and ran out the door calling goodbye to jill as i went poor ralph i thought i really am abusing him keeping him waiting in restaurants just so that i can pick his brains about ajax it was when i turned south on lake shore drive and just when i got onto rush street where the restaurant lay one of my prejudices is against paying to park the car but tonight i didnt waste time looking for street parking i turned the car over to a parking attendant across from ahabs i looked at my watch as i went in the door damned good i thought my head still felt woolly from my hour of sleep but i was glad id gotten it ralph was waiting by the entrance he kissed me lightly in greeting then stood back to examine my face definitely improving he agreed and i see you can walk again the headwaiter came over monday was a light night and he took us directly to our table tim will be your waiter he said would you like a drink ralph ordered a ginandtonic i settled for a glass of club sodascotch on top of beer didnt sound too appetizing one of the things about being divorced and moving into the city is all the great restaurants ralph remarked ive come to this place a couple of times but there are a lot in my neighborhood where do you live i asked over on elm street not too far from here actually its a furnished place with a housekeeping service convenient that must cost a fair amount i thought i wondered what his income was thats quite a lot of money with your alimony too dont tell me he grinned i didnt know anything about the city when i moved in here barring the area right around ajax and i didnt want to get into a long lease in a place id hate eventually i expect ill buy a condominium by the way did you find out whether mcgraw had ever called masters yes i did you that little favor vic and its just what i told you hes never had a call from the guy you didnt ask him did you no ralphs cheerful face clouded with resentment i kept your wishes in mind and only talked to his secretary of course i dont have any guarantee that she wont mention the matter to him do you think you could let this drop now i was feeling a little angry too but i kept it under control i still wanted ralph to look at the claim draft tim arrived to take our orders i asked for poached salmon and ralph took the scampi we both went to the salad bar while i cast about for a neutral topic to keep us going until after dinner i didnt want to produce the draft until wed eaten ive talked so much about my divorce ive never asked whether you were ever married ralph remarked yes i was what happened it was a long time ago i dont think either of us was ready for it hes a successful attorney now living in hinsdale with a wife and three young children do you still see him ralph wanted to know no and i really dont think about him but his name is in the papers a fair amount he sent me a card at christmas thats how i know about the children and hinsdaleone of those gooey things with the children smiling sentimentally in front of a fireplace im not sure whether he sent it to prove his virility or to let me know what im missing do you miss it i was getting angry are you trying to ask in a subtle way about whether i wish i had a husband and a family i certainly do not miss dick nor am i sorry that i dont have three kids getting under my feet ralph looked astonished take it easy vic cant you miss having a family without confusing that with dicks family i dont miss dorothybut that doesnt mean im giving up on marriage and i wouldnt be much of a man if i didnt miss my children tim brought our dinners the salmon had a very good pimento sauce but my emotions were still riding me and i couldnt enjoy it properly i forced a smile sorry guess im overreacting to people who think a woman without a child is like welchs without grapes well please dont take it out on me just because ive been acting like a protective man trying to stop you from running after gangsters doesnt mean i think you ought to be sitting home watching soaps and doing laundry i ate some salmon and thought about dick and our short unhappy marriage ralph was looking at me and his mobile face showed concern and a little anxiety the reason my first marriage fell apart was because im too independent also im not into housekeeping as you noticed the other night but the real problem is my independence i guess you could call it a strong sense of turf itsits hard for me i smiled its hard for me to talk about it i swallowed and concentrated on my plate for a few minutes i bit my lower lip and continued have some close women friends because i dont feel theyre trying to take over my turf but with men it always seems or often seems as though im having a fight to maintain who i am ralph nodded i wasnt sure he understood but he seemed interested i ate a little more fish and swallowed some wine with dick it was worse im not sure why i married himsometimes i think its because he represented the white anglosaxon establishment and part of me wanted to belong to that but dick was a terrible husband for someone like me he was an attorney with crawford meadetheyre a very big highprestige corporate firm if you dont know themand i was an eager young lawyer on the public defenders roster we met at a bar association meeting dick thought hed fallen in love with me because im so independent afterwards it seemed to me that it was because he saw my independence as a challenge and when he couldnt break it down he got angry then i got disillusioned with working for the public defender the setup is pretty corruptyoure never arguing for justice always on points of law i wanted to get out of it but i still wanted to do something that would make me feel that i was working on my concept of justice not legal pointscoring i resigned from the public defenders office and was wondering what to do next when a girl came to me and asked me to clear her brother of a robbery charge he looked hopelessly guiltyit was a charge of stealing video equipment from a big corporate studio and he had access opportunity and so on but i took the case on and i discovered he was innocent by finding out who the guilty person really was i drank some more wine and poked at my salmon ralphs plate was clean but he was waving off timwait until the ladys finished well all this time dick was waiting for me to settle down to being a housewife he was very supportive when i was worrying through leaving the public defender but it turned out that that was because he was hoping id quit to stay home on the sidelines applauding him while he clawed his way up the ladder in the legal world when i took on that casealthough it didnt seem like a case at the time just a favor to the woman who had sent the girl to me that had been lotty it had been awhile since id thought about all this and i started to laugh ralph looked a question well i take my obligations very seriously and i ended up spending a night on a loading dock which was really the turning point in the case it was the same night that crawford meade were having a big cocktail party wives invited i had on a cocktail dress because i thought id just slip down to the dock and then go to the party but the time slipped away and dick couldnt forgive me for not showing up so we split up at the time it was horrible but when i look back on it the evening was so ludicrous it makes me laugh i pushed my plate away id only eaten half the fish but i didnt have much of an appetite the trouble is i guess im a bit gunshy now there really are times when i wish i did have a couple of children and was doing the middleclass family thing but thats a myth you know very few people live like an advertisement with golden harmony and enough money and so on and i know im feeling a longing for a myth not the reality its justi get scared that ive made the wrong choice ori dont quite know how to say it maybe i should be home watching the soaps maybe im not doing the best thing with my life so if people try to suggest it i bite their heads off ralph reached across the table and squeezed my hand i think youre remarkable vic i like your style dick sounds like an ass dont give up on us men just because of him i smiled and squeezed his hand in return i know butim a good detective and ive got an established name now and its not a job thats easy to combine with marriage its only intermittently demanding but when im hot after something i dont want to be distracted by the thought of someone at home stewing because he doesnt know what to do about dinner or fussing at me because earl smeissen beat me up ralph looked down at his empty plate nodding thoughtfully i see he grinned of course you might find a guy whod already done the childrenandsuburbia number who would stand on the sidelines cheering your successes tim came back to take dessert orders i chose ahabs spectacular icecreamandcordial dessert i hadnt eaten all my fish and i was sick of being virtuous anyway ralph decided to have some too but i think this earl smeissen business would take a lot of getting used to he added after tim had disappeared again arent there any dangers to claim handling i asked i would imagine youd come across fraudulent claimants from time to time who arent too happy to have their frauds uncovered thats true he agreed but its harder to prove a fraudulent claim than you might think especially if its an accident case there are lots of corrupt doctors out there who will happily testify to nonprovable injuriessomething like a strained back which doesnt show up on an x rayfor a cut of the award ive never been in any danger usually what happens if you know its a blownup claim and they know you know but no one can prove it either way you give them a cash settlement considerably below what it would be if it came to court that gets them off your backlitigation is very expensive for an insurance company because juries almost always favor the claimant so its really not as shocking as it sounds how much of there is that i asked well everyone thinks the insurance company is there to give them a free ridethey dont understand that it all comes out in higher rates in the end but how often do we really get taken to the cleaners i couldnt say when i was working in the field my gut sense was that maybe one in every twenty or thirty cases was a phony you handle so many though that its hard to evaluate each one of them properlyyou just concentrate on the big ones tim had brought the ice cream which was sinfully delicious i scraped the last drops out of the bottom of my dish i found a claim draft lying around an apartment the other day it was an ajax draft a carbon of one i wondered if it was a real one you did ralph was surprised where did you find it in your apartment no actually in young thayers place do you have it id like to see it i picked my bag up from the floor and got the paper out of the zippered side compartment and handed it to ralph he studied it intently finally he said this looks like one of ours all right i wonder what the boy was doing with that on him no claim files are supposed to go home with you he folded it and put it in his wallet this should go back to the office i wasnt surprised just pleased id had the forethought to make xeroxes of it do you know the claimant i asked he pulled out the paper again and looked at the name no i cant even pronounce it but its the maximum indemnity payment for this state so he must be on a total disability caseeither temporary or permanent that means there should be a pretty comprehensive file on him how did it get so greasy oh it was lying on the floor i said vaguely when tim brought the check i insisted on splitting it with ralph too many dinners like this and youll have to give up either your alimony or your apartment he finally let me pay my part of the bill by the way before they kick me out for not paying the rent would you like to see my place i laughed sure ralph id love to the mark of zav ralphs alarm went off at i cracked my eyes briefly to look at the clock and then buried my head under the pillows ralph tried burrowing in after me but i kept the covers pulled around my ears and fought him off successfully the skirmish woke me up more thoroughly i sat up why so early do you have to be at the office at seven thirty this isnt early to me baby when i lived in downers grove i had to get up at five fortyfive every daythis is luxury besides i like morningbest time of the day i groaned and lay down again yeah ive often said god must have loved mornings he made so many of them how about bringing me some coffee he got out of bed and flexed his muscles sure thing miss warshawski maam service with a smile i had to laugh if youre going to be so full of pep this early in the day i think ill head back north for breakfast i swung my legs out of bed it was now the fourth morning since my encounter with earl and his boys and i scarcely felt a twinge clearly exercising paid off id better get at it againit would be easy to get out of the habit on the excuse that i was an invalid i can feed you ralph said not lavishly but ive got toast tell you the truth i want to go running this morning before i eat i havent been out for five days and its easy to go downhill if you dont keep it up besides i have a teenage guest at lottys and i ought to go see how shes doing just as long as you arent importing teenage boys for some weird orgy or other i dont mind how about coming back here tonight mmm maybe not ive got to go to a meeting tonight and i want to spend some time with lotty and my friend i was still bothered by ralphs persistence did he want to keep tabs on me or was he a lonely guy going after the first woman hed met who turned him on if masters were involved in the deaths of john and peter thayer it wasnt impossible that his assistant who had worked for him for three years was involved as well you get to work early every morning i asked unless im sick last monday morning too i asked he looked at me puzzled i suppose why do you askoh when peter was shot no i forgot i wasnt in early that morning i went down to thayers apartment and held him down while yardley shot him yardley get in on time that morning i persisted im not his goddamn secretary ralph snapped he doesnt always show up at the same timehe has breakfast meetings and crapand i dont sit with a stopwatch waiting for him to arrive okay okay take it easy i know you think masters is purity personified but if he were doing something illegal wouldnt he call on you his trusty henchman for help you wouldnt want him relying on someone else someone less able than you would you his face relaxed and he gave a snort of laughter youre outrageous if you were a man you couldnt get away with crap like that if i were a man i wouldnt be lying here i pointed out i held out an arm and pulled him back down into the bed but i still wondered what hed been doing monday morning ralph went off to shower whistling slightly i pulled the curtains back to look outside the air had a faint yellow tinge even this early in the morning the city looked slightly baked the break in the weather was over we were in for another hot polluted spell i showered and dressed and joined ralph at the table for a cup of coffee his apartment included one large room with a half wall making a partially private eating area the kitchen must have once been a closet stove sink and refrigerator were stacked neatly allowing room to stand and work but not enough space even for a chair it wasnt a badlooking place a large couch faced the front entrance and a heavy armchair stood pulled back from the windows at right angles to it id read somewhere that people who lived in rooms with floortoceiling windows keep the furniture pulled back away from themsome illusion of falling if youre right up against the glass a good two feet lay between the chair back and the lightly curtained windows all the upholstery and the curtains were in the same light floral pattern nice for a prefurnished place at ralph stood up i hear those claims calling me he explained ill get in touch with you tomorrow vic fine i said we rode down in the elevator in amiable silence ralph walked me to my car which id had to park near lake shore drive want a ride downtown i asked he declined saying he got his exercise walking the mile and a half to ajax each day as i drove off i could see him moving down the street in my rearview mirror a jaunty figure despite the close air it was only eight when i got back to lottys she was having toast and coffee in the kitchen jill her oval face alive and expressive was talking animatedly a halfdrunk glass of milk in front of her her innocent good spirits made me feel old and decadent i made a face at myself good morning ladies its a stinker outside good morning vic said lotty her face amused what a pity you had to work all night i gave her a playful punch on the shoulder jill asked were you really working all night in a serious worried voice no and lotty knows it i spent the night at a friends place after doing a little work you have a pleasant evening how were the enchiladas oh they were great jill said enthusiastically did you know that carol has been cooking since she was seven she giggled i dont know how to do one useful thing like ironing or even making scrambled eggs carol says id better marry someone with lots of money oh just marry someone who likes to cook and iron i said well maybe you can practice on some scrambled eggs tonight lotty suggested are you going to be here tonight she asked me can you make it an early dinner ive got a seven thirty meeting down at the university of chicagosomeone who may be able to help me find anita how about it jill lotty asked jill made a face i think ill plan on marrying someone rich lotty and i laughed how about peanut butter sandwiches she suggested i already know how to make those ill make you a fritata lotty i promised if you and jill will pick up some spinach and onions on your way home lotty made a face vic is a good cook but a messy one she told jill shell make a simple dinner for four in half an hour but you and i will spend the night cleaning the kitchen lotty i expostulated from a fritata i promise you i thought a minute then laughed no promises i dont want to be late for my meeting jill you can clean up jill looked at me uncertainly was i angry because she didnt want to make dinner look i said you dont have to be perfect lotty and i will like you even if you have temper tantrums dont make your bed and refuse to cook dinner okay certainly lotty agreed amused ive been vics friend these last fifteen years and ive yet to see her make a bed jill smiled at that are you going detecting today yes up to the north side looking for a needle in a haystack id like to have lunch with you but i dont know what my timetable is going to be like ill call down to the clinic around noon though i went into the guest room and changed into shorts tshirt and running shoes jill came in as i was halfway through my warmup stretches my muscles had tightened up in response to their abuse and i was having to go more slowly and carefully than normal when jill came in i was sweating a little not from exertion but from the residual pain she stood watching me for a minute mind if i get dressed while youre in here she asked finally no i grunted unlessyoud feel morecomfortablealone i pulled myself upright you thought about calling your mother she made a face lotty had the same idea ive decided to be a runaway and stay down here she put on her jeans and one of her mansized shirts i like it here its just the novelty youll get lonesome for your private beach after a while i gave her a quick hug but i invite you to stay at lottys for as long as you like she laughed at that okay ill call my mom atta girl bye lotty i called and started out the door sheffield avenue is about a mile from the lake i figured if i ran over to the lake eight blocks down to diversey and back again that would give me close to four miles i went slowly partly to ease my muscles and partly because of the stifling weather i usually run sevenandahalfminute miles but i tried to pace it at about nine minutes this morning i was sweating freely by the time i got to diversey and my legs felt wobbly i cut the pace going north but i was so tired i wasnt paying too much attention to the traffic around me as i left the lake path a squad car pulled out in front of me sergeant mcgonnigal was sitting in the passenger seat good morning miss warshawski morning sergeant i said trying to breathe evenly lieutenant mallory asked me to find you he said getting out of the car he got a call yesterday from the winnetka police seems you fasttalked your way past them to get into the thayer house oh yeah i said nice to see so much cooperation between the suburban and the city forces i did a few toe touches to keep my leg muscles from stiffening theyre concerned about the thayer girl they think she should be home with her mother thats thoughtful of them they can call her at dr herschels and suggest that to her is that why you tracked me down not entirely the winnetka police finally turned up a witness to the shooters car though not to the shooting he paused oh yeah enough of an id to make an arrest unfortunately the witness is only five years old hes scared silly and his parents have roped him around with lawyers and guards seems hed been playing in the ditch alongside sheridan road which was a nono but his folks were asleep so he sneaked out thats apparently why he wentbecause its off limits he was playing some crazy game you know how kids are thought he was stalking darth vader or something when he saw the car big black car he says sitting outside the thayer house he decided to stalk it when he saw a guy in the passenger seat who scared the daylights out of him mcgonnigal stopped again to make sure i was following he emphasized his next words carefully he finally saidafter hours of talk and many promises to the parents that we wouldnt subpoena him or publish the newsthat what scared him about the guy was that zorro had got him why zorro it seems this guy had some kind of mark on his face thats all he knows he saw it panicked and ran for his life doesnt know if the guy saw him or not sounds like a good lead i commented politely all you have to do is find a big black car and a man with a mark on his face and ask him if he knows zorro mcgonnigal looked sharply at me we police are not total idiots miss warshawski its not something we can take to court because of promising the parents and the lawyers anyway the testimony isnt very good but zorroyou know zorros mark is a big z and the lieutenant and i wondered if you knew anyone with a big z on his face i felt my face twitch earls gofer tony had had such a scar i shook my head should i not too many guys with that kind of mark we thought it might be tony bronsky he got cut like that by a guy named zav who objected to tony taking away his girl friend seveneight years ago he hangs around earl smeissen these days oh i said earl and i arent exactly social friends sergeanti dont know all his companions well the lieutenant thought youd like to know about it he said he knew youd sure hate for anything to happen to the little thayer girl while you were looking after her he got back into his car the lieutenant has a fine sense of drama i called after him hes been watching too many kojak reruns late at night tell him that from me mcgonnigal drove off and i walked the rest of the way home id completely lost interest in exercise lotty and jill had already left i took a long hot shower easing my leg muscles and thinking over mcgonnigals message it didnt surprise me that earl was involved in john thayers death i wondered if jill really was in any danger though and if she was was she worse off with lotty and me i toweled dry and weighed myself i was down two pounds surprising with all the starch id been eating lately i went into the kitchen to squeeze some orange juice there was one way in which jill was worse off with me i realized if earl decided i needed to be blown away completely shed make a perfect hostage for him i suddenly felt very cold nothing i was doing was getting me anyplaceunless thayers execution could be called a destination i couldnt tie mcgraw to masters or thayer i didnt have a clue about anita the one person who might supply me with anything was mcgraw and he wouldnt why the hell had he come to me in the first place on impulse i looked up the knifegrinders number in the white pages and dialed the receptionist transferred me to mildred i didnt identify myself but asked for mcgraw he was in a meeting and couldnt be disturbed its important i said tell him it concerns earl smeissen and john thayer mildred put me on hold i studied my fingernails they needed filing at last the phone clicked and mcgraws husky voice came on the line yes what is it he asked this is v i warshawski did you finger thayer for earl what the hell are you talking about i told you to stay out of my business you dragged me in in the first place mcgraw you made it my business now i want to know did you finger thayer for earl he was quiet one of earls men shot thayer you brought thayers name into this to begin with youve hedged about why did you want to be sure he got dragged into the case from the beginning you were afraid the police might jump on anita and you wanted to make sure his name got in the pot then whathe threatened to squeal and you asked earl to kill him just in case warshawski i got a tape running you make any more accusations like this and i could see you in court dont try it mcgraw they might subpoena the rest of your tapes he slammed the phone down i didnt feel any better i dressed in a hurry but checked the smith wesson carefully before putting it in my shoulder holster my continuing hope was that earl thought hed rendered me negligible and that hed continue thinking so until id unraveled enough truth to make it too late for any other action he might take but i took no chances leaving the apartment from the rear and circling the block to come to my car the coast was still clear i decided to abandon loop bars and go to the knifegrinders neighborhood i could return to the loop tomorrow if necessary on my way north i stopped at the clinic although it was early in the day the waiting room was already full i again walked past the baleful glares from those who had been sitting for an hour i need to talk to lotty i said abruptly to carol she took one look at my face and got lotty out of the examining room i quickly explained to her what had happened i dont want to get jill upset i said but i dont want to feel like were sitting on a land mine here lotty nodded yes but whats to stop them from taking her out of the thayer house she asked if they decide she would be a good hostage im afraid they could get her wherever she was it is not your peace of mind but jills we need to think of and i think shes better down here for another couple of days until her fathers funeral anyway she called the in otherthe funeral wont be until friday yes but lotty im running against the clock here ive got to keep going i cant sit guarding jill no she frowned then her face cleared carols brother big bruising goodnatured guy hes an architecture student at circlemaybe he can come and watch out for thugs she called to carol who listened eagerly to the problem threw up her hands at the thought of jill in danger but agreed that paul would be glad to come and help he looks mean and stupid she said a perfect disguise since he is really friendly and brilliant i had to be satisfied with that but i wasnt happy id have liked to ship jill up to wisconsin until everything was over i went on north and drove around the knifegrinder territory staking out my route for the day there werent nearly as many bars here as there were in the loop i picked a twentyblock square and decided to keep the car this morning no matter what sort of ill will it raised in the bars i was not going to drink i cannot face beer before noon or even scotch i started at the west end of my territory along the howard el tracks the first place claras looked so downattheheels i wasnt sure i wanted to go into it surely someone as fastidious as masters looked would not go to a dump like that on the other hand maybe thats the kind of place hed wantsomething that no one would associate with him i braced my shoulders and pushed into the gloom out of the sticky air by noon id drawn nine blanks and was beginning to think id come up with a truly rotten idea one that was wasting a lot of valuable time as well i would finish my present stint but not go back for a second crack at the loop i called the clinic carols brother was in residence enchanted by jill and helping entertain some seven toddlers i told lotty i was going to stay where i was and to give my apologies to jill by now the humid polluted heat was stifling i felt as though i were being pushed to the earth by it every time i walked back outside the smell of stale beer in the bars began to nauseate me everyplace i went into had a few pathetic souls riveted to their stools sipping down one drink after another even though it was only morning i was meeting with the same variety of hostility indifference and cooperation that id found downtown and the same lack of recognition of my photos after calling lotty i decided to get lunch i wasnt far from sheridan road i walked over and found a decentlooking steak house at the end of the block i opted against lunch in a bar and walked in thankfully out of the heat the high corral as the place called itself was small clean and full of good food smells a welcome contrast to sour beer about two thirds of the tables were filled a plump middleaged woman came up with a menu and a cheerful smile and led me to a corner table i began to feel better i ordered a small butt steak an undressed salad and a tall gin fizz and took my time over the food when it arrived no one would ever write it up for chicago magazine but it was a simple wellprepared meal and mellowed my spirits considerably i ordered coffee and lingered over that too at i realized i was procrastinating when duty beckons lo thou must youth replies to age i can i muttered encouragingly to myself i put two dollars on the table and carried my bill over to the cash register the plump hostess bustled up from the back of the restaurant to take my money very pleasant lunch i said im glad you enjoyed it are you new to this neighborhood i shook my head i was just passing by and your sign looked inviting on impulse i pulled out my folder now grimy and wilted around the edges i wonder if these two men have ever come in here together she picked up the pictures and looked at them oh yes i couldnt believe it are you sure i couldnt be mistaken not unless its something id have to go to court for her friendly face clouded a bit if its a legal matter youre talking about she shoved the pictures back at me not at all i said hastily or at least not one that youll have to be involved in i couldnt think of a plausible story on the spur of the moment if anyone sends me a summons i never saw either of them she reiterated but off the record just for my ears how long have they been coming here i said in what i hoped was a sincere persuasive voice whats the problem she was still suspicious paternity suit i said promptly the first thing that came into my mind it sounded ridiculous even to me but she relaxed well that doesnt sound too dreadful i guess its been about five years this is my husbands restaurant and weve been working it together for eighteen years now i remember most of my regular customers do they come in often i asked oh maybe three times a year but over a period of time you get to recognize your regulars besides this manshe tapped mcgraws picturecomes in a lot i think hes with that big union down the road oh really i said politely i pulled thayers picture out what about him i asked she studied it it looks familiar she said but hes never been in here well i certainly wont spread your name any further and thanks for a very nice lunch i felt dizzy walking out into the blinding heat i couldnt believe my luck every now and then you get a break like that as a detective and you start to think maybe youre on the side of right and good after all and a benevolent providence is guiding your steps hot damn i thought ive got masters tied to mcgraw and mcgraw knows smeissen and the twig is on the branch the branch is on the tree the tree is on the hill vic you are a genius i told myself the only question is what is tying these two guys together it must be that beautiful claim draft i found in peter thayers apartment but how i found a pay phone and called ralph to see if he had tracked down the gielczowski file he was in a meeting no i wouldnt leave a message id call later there was another question too what was the connection among thayer mcgraw and masters still that shouldnt be too difficult to find out the whole thing probably revolved around some way to make money maybe nontaxable money if that were so then thayer came in naturally as masterss neighbor and good friend and vicepresident of a bank he could probably launder money in a dozen different ways that i couldnt begin to imagine say he laundered the money and peter found out mcgraw got smeissen to kill peter then thayer was overcome with remorse i wont be a party to it he saidto masters to mcgraw and they got earl to blow him away too steady vic i told myself getting into the car so far you only have one fact mcgraw and masters know each other but what a beautiful highly suggestive fact it was the bottom of the fifth inning at wrigley field and the cubs were rolling over philadelphia for some reason smoggy wilting air acted on them like a tonic everyone else was dying but the cubs were leading kingman hit his thirtyfourth homer i thought maybe id earned a trip to the park to see the rest of the game but sternly squashed the idea i got back to the clinic at the outer room was even more crowded than it had been in the morning a small window air conditioner fought against the heat and the combined bodies and lost as i walked into the room the inner door opened and a face looked around mean and stupid summed it up exactly i went on across the room you must be paul i said holding out a hand im vic he smiled the transformation was incredible i could see the bright intelligence in his eyes and he looked handsome rather than brutish i wondered fleetingly if jill was old enough to fall in love everythings quiet here he said everything but the babies of course do you want to come out and see how jill is doing i followed him to the back lotty had moved the steel table out of her second examining room in this tiny space jill sat playing with five children between the ages of two and seven she had the selfimportant look of someone coping with a major crisis i grinned to myself a baby was asleep in a basket in the corner she looked up when i came in and said hello but her smile was for paul was that an unnecessary complication or a help i wondered hows it going i asked great whenever things get too hectic paul makes a quick trip to the good humor man im just afraid theyll catch on and squawk all the time do you think you could leave them for a few minutes id like to ask you a few questions she looked at the group doubtfully go ahead paul said cheerfully ill fill in for youyouve been at it too long anyway she got up one of the children a little boy protested you cant go he said in a loud bossy voice sure she can paul said squatting easily in her place now where were you i took jill into lottys office looks like youre a natural i said lotty will probably try to talk you into spending the rest of the summer down here she flushed id like to i wonder if i really could no reason not once we get this other business cleared up have you ever met anitas father she shook her head i pulled out my package of pictures and took out the ones of mcgraw this is he have you ever seen him either with your dad or maybe in the neighborhood she studied them for a while i dont think ive ever seen him before he doesnt look at all like anita i stopped for a minute not sure of the least hurting way to say what i wanted i think mr mcgraw and mr masters are partners in some scheme or otheri dont know what i believe your father must have been involved in some way maybe without realizing what it was he was involved in in fact i suddenly thought if thayer had been obviously a party to it wouldnt peter have confronted him first do you remember peter and your father fighting in the last week or two before peters death no in fact peter hadnt been home for seven weeks if he and daddy had a fight it had to be over the telephone maybe at the office but not out at the house thats good now going back to this other business ive got to know what it is your father knew about their deal can you think of anything that might help me did he and mr masters lock themselves up in the study for long talks yes but lots of men do thatdid that daddy did business with lots of people and they would often come over to the house to talk about it well what about money i asked did mr masters ever give your father a lot of money or the other way around she laughed embarrassedly and shrugged her shoulders i just dont know about any of that kind of stuff i know daddy worked for the bank and was an officer and all but i dont know what he did exactly and i dont know anything about the money i guess i should i know my family is well off weve all got these big trusts from my grandparents but i dont know anything about daddys money that wasnt too surprising suppose i asked you to go back to winnetka and look through his study to see if he had any papers that mention mcgraw or masters or both would that make you feel dishonest and slimy she shook her head if it would help ill do it but i dont want to leave here that is a problem i agreed i looked at my watch and calculated times i dont think we could fit it in before dinner this evening anyway but how about first thing tomorrow morning then we could come back here to the clinic in time for the baby rush hour sure she agreed would you want to come along i mean i dont have a car or anything and i would like to come back and they might try to talk me into staying up there once i got there i wouldnt miss it by tomorrow morning the house probably wouldnt be filled with police anymore either jill got up and went back to the nursery i could hear her saying in a maternal voice well whose turn is it i grinned popped my head in lottys door and told her i was going home to sleep in the heat of the night i set off for the university women united meeting at seven id slept for three hours and felt on top of the world the fritata had turned out wellan old recipe of my mothers accompanied by lots of toast a salad constructed by paul and pauls warm appreciation hed decided his bodyguarding included spending the night and had brought a sleeping bag the dining room was the only place with space for him lotty warned him and i want you to stay in it she added jill was delighted i could just imagine her sisters reaction if she came back with paul as a boyfriend it was an easy drive south a lazy evening with a lot of people out cooling off this was my favorite time of the day in the summer there was something about the smell and feel of it that evoked the magic of childhood i didnt have any trouble parking on campus and got into the meeting room just before things began about a dozen women were there wearing work pants and oversized tshirts or denim skirts made out of blue jeans and with the legs cut apart and restitched seams facing out i was wearing jeans and a big loose shirt to cover the gun but i was still dressed more elegantly that anyone else in the room gail sugarman was there she recognized me when i came in and said hi im glad you remembered the meeting the others stopped to look at me this is gail stopped embarrassed ive forgotten your nameits italian i remember you told me that anyway i met her at the swift coffee shop last week and told her about the meetings and here she is youre not a reporter are you one woman asked no im not i said neutrally i have a ba from here pretty old degree at this point i was down here the other day talking to harold weinstein and ran into gail weinstein another one snorted thinks hes a radical because he wears work shirts and curses capitalism yeah another agreed i was in his class on big business and big labor he felt the major battle against oppression had been won when ford lost the battle with the uaw in the forties if you tried to talk about how women have been excluded not just from big business but from the unions as well he said that didnt indicate oppression merely a reflection of the current social mores that argument justifies all oppression a plump woman with short curling hair put in hell the stalin labor camps reflected soviet mores of the s not to mention scheranskys exile with hard labor thin dark mary the older woman whod been with gail at the coffee shop on friday tried to call the group to order we dont have a program tonight she said in the summer our attendance is too low to justify a speaker but why dont we get in a circle on the floor so that we can have a group discussion she was smoking sucking in her cheeks with her intense inhaling i had a feeling she was eyeing me suspiciously but that may have just been my own nerves i obediently took a spot on the floor drawing my legs up in front of me my calf muscles were sensitive the other women straggled over getting cups of evillooking coffee as they came id taken one look at the overboiled brew on my way in and decided it wasnt necessary to drink it to prove i was one of the group when all but two were seated mary suggested we go around the circle and introduce ourselves there are a couple of new people here tonight she said im mary annasdaughter she turned to the woman on her right the one whod protested womens exclusion from big unions when they got to me i said im v i warshawski most people call me vic when theyd finished one said curiously do you go by your initials or is vic your real name its a nickname i said i usually use my initials i started out my working life as a lawyer and i found it was harder for male colleagues and opponents to patronize me if they didnt know my first name good point mary said taking the meeting back tonight id like to see what we can do to support the era booth at the illinois state fair the state now group usually has a booth where they distribute literature this year they want to do something more elaborate have a slide show and they need more people someone who can go down to springfield for one or more days the week of august fourth to tenth to staff the booth and the slide show are they sending a car down the plump curlyhaired one asked i expect the transportation will depend on how many people volunteer i thought i might go if some of the rest of you want to we could all take the bus togetherits not that long a ride where would we stay someone wanted to know i plan to camp out mary said but you can probably find some now people to share a hotel room with i can check back at the headquarters i kind of hate doing anything with now a rosycheeked woman with waistlong hair said she was wearing a tshirt and bib overalls she had the face of a peaceful victorian matron why annette gail asked they ignore the real issueswomens social position inequities of marriage divorce child careand go screwing around supporting establishment politicians theyll support a candidate who does one measly little thing for child care and overlook the fact that he doesnt have any women on his staff and that his wife is a plastic mannequin sitting at home supporting his career well youre never going to have social justice until you get some basic political and economic inequalities solved a stocky woman whose name i thought was ruth said and political problems can be grappled with you cant go around trying to uproot the fundamental oppression between men and women without some tool to dig with laws represent that tool this was an old argument it went back to the start of radical feminism in the late sixties do you concentrate on equal pay and equal legal rights or do you go off and try to convert the whole society to a new set of sexual values mary let the tide roll in for ten minutes then she rapped the floor with her knuckles im not asking for a consensus on now or even on the era she said i just want a head count of those whod like to go to springfield gail volunteered first predictably and ruth the two whod been dissecting weinsteins politics also agreed to go what about you vic mary said thanks but no i said why dont you tell us why youre really here mary said in a steely voice you may be an old uc student but no one stops by a rap group on tuesday night just to check out politics on the old campus they dont change that much but youre right i came here because im trying to find anita mcgraw i dont know anyone here well but i know this is a group she was close to and im hoping that someone here can tell me where she is in that case you can get out mary said angrily the group silently closed against me i could feel their hostility like a physical force weve all had the police on usnow i guess they thought a woman pig could infiltrate this meeting and worm anitas address out of one of usassuming we had it to worm i dont know it myselfi dont know if anyone in here knows itbut you pigs just cant give up can you i didnt move im not with the police and im not a reporter do you think the police want to find anita so that they can lay peter thayers death on her of course mary snorted theyve been poking around trying to find if peter slept around and anita was jealous or if hed made a will leaving her money well im sorryyou can go back and tell them that they just cannot get away with that id like to present an alternative scenario i said screw yourself mary said were not interested now get out not until youve listened to me do you want me to throw her out mary annette asked you can try i said but itll just make you madder if i hurt one of you and im still not going to leave until youve listened to what i have to say all right mary said angrily she took out her watch you can have five minutes then annette throws you out thank you my tale is short i can embellish it later if you have questions yesterday morning john thayer peters father was gunned down in front of his home the police presume but cannot prove that this was the work of a hired killer known to them it is my belief not shared by the police that this same killer shot peter thayer last monday now why was peter shot the answer is that he knew something that was potentially damaging to a very powerful and very corrupt labor leader i dont know what he knew but i assume it had something to do with illegal financial transactions it is further possible that his father was a party to these transactions as was the man peter worked for i stretched my legs out and leaned back on my hands no one spoke these are all assumptions i have no proof at the moment that could be used in court but i have the proof that comes from watching human relationships and reactions if i am correct in my assumptions then i believe anita mcgraws life is in serious danger the overwhelming probability is that peter thayer shared with her the secret that got him killed and that when she came home last monday evening to find his dead body she panicked and ran but as long as she is alive and in lonely possession of this secretwhatever it isthen the men who have killed twice to protect it will not care about killing her as well you know a lot about it ruth said how do you happen to be involved if youre not a reporter and not a cop im a private investigator i said levelly at the moment my client is a fourteenyearold girl who saw her father murdered and is very frightened mary was still angry youre still a cop then it doesnt make any difference who is paying your salary youre wrong i said it makes an enormous difference im the only person i take orders from not a hierarchy of officers aldermen and commissioners what kind of proof do you have ruth asked i was beaten up last friday night by the man who employs the killer who probably killed the two thayers he warned me away from the case i have a presumption not provable of who hired him a man who got his name from an associate on speaking terms with many prominent criminals this man is the person peter thayer was working for this summer and i know the other guy the one with the criminal contacts has been seen with peters boss exboss i dont know about the money thats just a guess no one in that crowd would be hurt by sex scandals and spying is very unlikely what about dope gail asked i dont think so i said but anyway that is certainly an illegal source of income for which you might kill to cover up frankly vi or vic or whatever your real name is you havent convinced me i dont believe anitas life could be in danger but if anyone disagrees with me and knows where anita is go ahead and betray her i have another question ruth said assuming we did know where she is and told you what good would that do herif everything youre saying is true if i can find out what the transaction is i can probably get some definite proof of who the murderer is i said the more quickly that happens the less likely it is that this hired killer can get to her no one said anything else i waited a few minutes i kind of hoped annette would try to throw me out i felt like breaking someones arm radicals are so goddamn paranoid and radical students combine that with isolation and pomposity maybe id break all their arms just for fun but annette didnt move and no one chirped up with anitas address satisfied mary asked triumphantly her thin cheeks pulled back in a smirk thanks for the time sisters i said if any of you changes her mind im leaving some business cards with my phone number by the coffee i put them down and left i felt very depressed driving home peter wimsey would have gone in and charmed all those uncouth radicals into slobbering all over him he would never have revealed he was a private detectivehe would have started some clever conversation that would have told him everything he wanted to know and then given two hundred pounds to the lesbian freedom fund i turned left onto lake shore drive going much too fast and getting a reckless pleasure from feeling the car careening almost out of control i didnt even care at this point if someone stopped me i did the four miles between fiftyseventh street and mccormick place in three minutes it was at that point that i realized someone was following me the speed limit in that area was fortyfive and i was doing eighty yet i was holding the same pair of headlights in my rearview mirror that had been behind me in the other lane when i got on the drive i braked quickly and changed to the outside lane the other car didnt change lanes but slowed down also how long had i been carrying a tail and why if earl wanted to blow me away he had unlimited opportunities no need to waste manpower and money on a tail he might not know where id gone after leaving my apartment but i didnt think so my answering service had lottys phone number and its a simple matter to get an address from the phone company if you have the number maybe they wanted jill and didnt realize id taken her to lottys i drove slowly and normally not trying to change lanes or make an unexpected exit my companion stayed with me in the center lane letting a few cars get between us as we moved downtown the lights got brighter and i could see the car bettera midsized gray sedan it looked like if they got jill they would have a potent weapon to force me off the case i couldnt believe that earl thought i had a case hed given me the big scare hed torn my apartment apart and hed gotten the police to make an arrest as far as i could tell despite john thayers death donald mackenzie was still in jail perhaps they thought i could lead them to the document they had overlooked at peter thayers and not found in my apartment the phrase lead them to clicked in my brain of course they werent interested in me or in jill or even in that claim draft they wanted anita mcgraw just as i did and they thought i could lead them to her how had they known i was going to the campus tonight they hadnt theyd followed me there id told mcgraw i had a lead on a lead to anita and he had toldsmeissenmasters i didnt like the thought of mcgraw fingering his daughter he must have told someone he thought he could trust surely not masters though if my deduction was correct i ought to keep them guessing as long as they thought i knew something my life was probably safe i got off the drive downtown going past buckingham fountain as it shot up jets of colored water high into the night a large crowd had gathered to see the nightly show i wondered if i could lose myself in it but didnt think much of my chances i went on over to michigan avenue and parked across the street from the conrad hilton hotel i locked the car door and leisurely crossed the street i stopped inside the glass doors for a glance outside and was pleased to see the gray sedan pull up next to my car i didnt wait to see what the occupants would do but moved quickly down the hotels long corridor to the side entrance on eighth street this part of the hotel had airline ticket offices and as i walked past them a doorman was calling last call for the airport bus nonstop to ohare field without thinking or stopping to look behind me i pushed in front of a small crew of laughing flight attendants and got on the bus they followed me more slowly the conductor checked his load and got off and the bus started moving as we turned the corner onto michigan i could see a man looking up and down the street i thought it might be freddie the bus moved ponderously across the loop to ontario street some twelve blocks north and i kept an anxious lookout through the rear window but it seemed as though freddies slow wits had not considered the possibility of my being on the bus it was when we got to ohare i moved from the bus to stand in the shadow of one of the giant pillars supporting the terminal but saw no gray sedan i was about to step out when i thought perhaps they had a second car so i looked to see if any vehicle repeated its circuit more than once and scanned the occupants to see if i recognized any of smeissens crew by ten i decided i was clear and caught a cab back to lottys i had the driver drop me at the top of her street then i went down the alley behind her building keeping a hand close to my gun i didnt see anyone but a group of three teenage boys drinking beer and talking lazily i had to pound on the back door for several minutes before lotty heard and came to let me in her thick black eyebrows went up in surprise trouble she asked a little downtown im not sure whether anyone is watching the front jill she asked i dont think so i think theyre hoping ill lead them to anita mcgraw unless i do or unless they find her first i think were all pretty safe i shook my head in dissatisfaction i dont like it though they could snatch jill and hold her to ransom if they thought i knew where anita was i didnt find out tonight im sure one of those goddamned radical women knows where she is but they think theyre being noble and winning a great war against the pigs and they wont tell me its so frustrating yes i see lotty said seriously maybe its not so good for the child to be here she and paul are watching the movie on television she added jerking her head toward the living room i left my car downtown i said someone was following me back from the university and i shook them off in the looptook the bus out to oharelong and expensive way to shake a tail but it worked tomorrow jills taking me out to winnetka to go through her fathers papers maybe she should just stay there well sleep on it lotty suggested paul is loving his guard duty but he couldnt do much against men with machine guns besides he is an architecture student and should not miss too many of his classes we went back into the living room jill was curled up on the daybed watching the movie paul was lying on his stomach looking up at her every few minutes jill didnt seem aware of the impression she was creatingthis seemed to be her first conquestbut she glowed with contentment i went into the guest room to make some phone calls larry anderson said theyd finished my apartment i didnt think youd want that couch so i let one of the guys take it home and about the doorive got a friend who does some carpentry he has a beautiful oak door out of some mansion or other he could fix it up for you and put some dead bolts in it if youd like larry i cant begin to thank you i said much moved that sounds like a beautiful idea how did you close the place up today oh we nailed it shut he said cheerfully larry and i had gone to school together years ago but hed dropped out earlier and further than i had we chatted for a few minutes then i hung up to call ralph its me sherlock holmes i said how did your claim files go oh fine summer is a busy time for accidents with so many people on the road they should stay home but then theyd cut off their legs with lawnmowers or something and wed be paying just the same did you refile that draft without any trouble i asked actually not i couldnt find the file i looked up the guys account though he must have been in a doozy of an accidentweve been sending him weekly checks for four years now he chuckled a little i was going to inspect yardleys face today to see if he looked guilty of multiple homicide but hes taking the rest of the week offapparently cut up about thayers death i see i wasnt going to bother telling him about the link id found between masters and mcgraw i was tired of arguing with him over whether i had a case or not dinner tomorrow night he asked make it thursday i suggested tomorrows going to be pretty openended as soon as i put the phone down it rang dr herschels residence i said it was my favorite reporter murray ryerson just got a squeal that tony bronsky may have killed john thayer he said oh really are you going to publish that oh i think well paint a murky picture of gangland involvement its just a whiff no proof he wasnt caught at the scene and our legal people have decided mentioning his name would be actionable thanks for sharing the news i said politely i wasnt calling out of charity murray responded but in my lumbering swedish way it dawned on me that bronsky works for smeissen we agreed yesterday that his name has been cropping up here and there around the place whats his angle vicwhy would he kill a respectable banker and his son beats the hell out of me murray i said and hung up i went back and watched the rest of the movie the guns of navarone with lotty jill and paul i felt restless and on edge lotty didnt keep scotch she didnt have any liquor at all except brandy i went into the kitchen and poured myself a healthy slug lotty looked questioningly at me but said nothing around midnight as the movie was ending the phone rang lotty answered it in her bedroom and came back her face troubled she gave me a quiet signal to follow her to the kitchen a man she said in a low voice he asked if you were here when i said yes he hung up oh hell i muttered well nothing to be done about it now my apartment will be ready tomorrow nightill go back and remove this powder keg from your home lotty shook her head and gave her twisted smile not to worry vicim counting on you fixing the ama for me someday lotty sent jill unceremoniously off to bed paul got out his sleeping bag i helped him move the heavy walnut diningroom table against the wall and lotty brought him a pillow from her bed then went to sleep herself the night was muggy lottys brick thickwalled building kept out the worst of the weather and exhaust fans in the kitchen and dining rooms moved the air enough to make sleep possible but the air felt close to me anyway i lay on the daybed in a tshirt and sweated dozed a bit woke tossed and dozed again at last i sat up angrily i wanted to do something but there was nothing for me to do i turned on the light it was i pulled on a pair of jeans and tiptoed out to the kitchen to make some coffee while water dripped through the white porcelain filter i looked through a bookcase in the living room for something to read all books look equally boring in the middle of the night i finally selected vienna in the seventeenth century by dorfman fetched a cup of coffee and flipped the pages reading about the devastating plague following the thirty years war and the street now called grabenthe gravebecause so many dead had been buried there the terrible story fit my jangled mood above the hum of fans i could head the phone ring faintly in lottys room wed turned it off next to the spare bed where jill was sleeping i told myself it had to be for lottysome mother in labor or some teenagerbut i sat tensely anyway and was somehow not surprised when lotty came out of her room wrapped in a thin striped cotton robe for you a ruth yonkers i shrugged my shoulders the name meant nothing to me sorry to get you up i said and went down the short hallway to lottys room i felt as if all the nights tension had had its focus in waiting for this unexpected phone call from an unknown woman the instrument was on a small indonesian table next to lottys bed i sat on the bed and spoke into it this is ruth yonkers a husky voice responded i talked to you at the uwu meeting tonight oh yes i said calmly i remember you shed been the stocky square young woman whod asked me all the questions at the end i talked to anita after the meeting i didnt know how seriously to take you but i thought she ought to know about it i held my breath and said nothing she called me last week told me about finding petersfinding peter she made me promise not to tell anyone where she was without checking with her first not even her father or the police it was all ratherbizarre i see i said do you she asked doubtfully you thought shed killed peter didnt you i said in a comfortable tone and you felt caught by her choosing you to confide in you didnt want to betray her but you didnt want to be involved in a murder so you were relieved to have a promise to fall back on ruth gave a little sigh half laugh that came ghostily over the line yes that was it exactly youre smarter than i thought you were i hadnt realized anita might be in danger herselfthat was why she sounded so scared anyway i called her weve been talking for several hours shes never heard of you and weve been debating whether we can trust you she paused and i was quiet i think we have to thats what it boils down to if its true if there really are some mob people after herit all sounds surreal but she says youre right where is she i asked gently up in wisconsin ill take you to her no tell me where she is and ill find her im being followed and itll just double the danger to try to meet up with you then i wont tell you where she is ruth said my agreement with her was that i would bring you to her youve been a good friend ruth and youve carried a heavy load but if the people who are after anita find out you know where she is and suspect youre in her confidence your own life is in danger let me run the riskits my job after all we argued for several more minutes but ruth let herself be persuaded shed been under a tremendous strain for the five days since anita had first called her and she was glad to let someone else take it over anita was in hartford a little town northwest of milwaukee she was working as a waitress in a café shed cut her red hair short and dyed it black and she was calling herself jody hill if i left now i could catch her just as the café opened for breakfast in the morning it was after four when i hung up i felt refreshed and alert as if id slept soundly for eight hours instead of tossing miserably for three lotty was sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and reading lotty i do apologize you get little enough sleep as it is but i think this is the beginning of the end ah good she said putting a marker in her book and shutting it the missing girl yes that was a friend who gave me the address all i have to do now is get away from here without being seen where is she i hesitated my dear ive been questioned by tougher experts than these smeissen hoodlums and perhaps someone else should know i grinned youre right i told her then added the question is what about jill we were going to go up to winnetka tomorrowtoday that isto see if her father had any papers that might explain his connection with masters and mcgraw now maybe anita can make that tiein for me but id still be happier to get jill back up there this whole arrangementpaul under the diningroom table jill and the babiesmakes me uncomfortable if she wants to come back for the rest of the summer sureshe can stay with me once this mess is cleared up but for nowlets get her back home lotty pursed her lips and stared into her coffee cup for several minutes finally she said yes i believe youre right shes much bettertwo good nights of sleep with calm people who like hershe can probably go back to her family i agree the whole thing with paul is too volatile very sweet but too volatile in such a cramped space my car is across from the conrad hilton downtown i cant take itits being watched maybe paul can pick it up tomorrow take jill home ill be back here tomorrow night say goodbye and give you a little privacy do you want to take my car lotty suggested i thought it over where are you parked out front across the street thanks but ive got to get away from here without being seen i dont know that your place is being watchedbut these guys want anita mcgraw very badly and they did call earlier to make sure i was here lotty got up and turned out the kitchen light she looked out the window concealed partly by a hanging geranium and thin gauze curtains i dont see anyone why not wake up paul he can take my car drive it around the block a few times then if no one follows him he can pick you up in the alley you drop him down the street i dont like it youll be without a car and when he comes back on foot if there is someone out there theyll be suspicious vic my dear its not like you to be so full of quibbles we wont be without a carwell have yours as for the second she thought a minute ah drop paul at the clinic he can finish his sleep there we have a bed for nights when carol or i have to stay over i laughed cant think of any more quibbles lotty lets wake up paul and give it a try paul woke up quickly and cheerfully when the plan was explained to him he accepted it enthusiastically want me to beat up anyone hanging around outside unnecessary my dear said lotty amused lets try not to attract too much attention to ourselves theres an allnight restaurant on sheffield off addisongive us a call from there we left paul to dress in privacy he came out to the kitchen a few minutes later pushing his black hair back from his square face with his left hand and buttoning a blue workshirt with the right lotty gave him her car keys we watched the street from lottys dark bedroom no one attacked paul as he got into the car and started it we couldnt see anyone follow him down the street i went back to the living room and dressed properly lotty watched me without speaking while i loaded the smith wesson and stuck it into the shoulder holster i was wearing wellcut jeans and a blouson jacket over a ribbed knit shirt about ten minutes later lottys phone rang all clear paul said there is someone out front though i think id better not drive down the alleyit might bring him around to the rear ill be at the mouth of the alley at the north end of the street i relayed this to lotty she nodded why dont you leave from the basement you can go down there from inside and outside the door is hidden by stairs and garbage cans she led me downstairs i felt very alert very keyed up through a window on the stairwell we could see the night clearing into a predawn gray it was and the apartment was very quiet a siren sounded in the distance but no traffic was going down lottys street lotty had brought a flashlight with her rather than turn on a light that might show through the streetside window she pointed it down the steps so i could see the way then turned it off i padded down after her at the bottom she seized my wrist let me around bicycles and a washing machine and very slowly and quietly drew back the dead bolts in the outside door there was a little click as they snapped open she waited several minutes before pulling the door open it moved into the basement quietly on oiled hinges i slipped out up the stairs in crepesoled shoes from behind the screen of garbage cans i peered into the alley freddie sat propped against the back of the wall at the south end of the alley two buildings down as far as i could tell he was asleep i moved quietly back down the stairs give me ten minutes i mouthed into lottys ear i may need a quick escape route lotty nodded without speaking at the top of the stairs i checked freddie again did he have the subtlety to fake sleep i moved from behind the garbage cans into the shadow of the next building my right hand on the revolvers handle freddie didnt stir keeping close to the walls i moved quickly down the alley as soon as i was halfway down i broke into a quiet sprint the union maid paul was waiting as promised he had a good headthe car was out of sight in the alley i slid into the front seat and drew the door closed any trouble he said starting the engine and pulling away from the curb no but i recognized a guy asleep in the alley youd better call lotty from the clinic tell her not to leave jill alone in the apartment maybe she can get a police escort to the clinic tell her to call a lieutenant mallory to request it sure thing he was very likable we drove the short way to the clinic in silence i handed him my car keys and reiterated where the car was its a dark blue monza good luck he said in his rich voice dont worry about jill and lottyill take care of them i never worry about lotty i said sliding into the drivers seat shes a force unto herself i adjusted the side mirror and the rearview mirror and let in the clutch lotty drove a small datsun as practical and unadorned as she was i kept checking the road behind me as i drove across addison to the kennedy but it seemed to be clear the air was clammy the damp of a muggy night before the sun would rise and turn it into smog again the eastern sky was light now and i was moving quickly through the empty streets traffic was light on the expressway and i cleared the suburbs to the northbound milwaukee toll road in fortyfive minutes lottys datsun handled well although i was out of practice with a standard shift and ground the gears a bit changing down she had an fm radio and i listened to wfmt well past the illinois border after that the reception grew fuzzy so i switched it off it was six in clear daylight when i reached the milwaukee bypass id never been to hartford but id been to port washington thirty miles to the east of it on lake michigan many times as far as i could tell the route was the same except for turning west onto route instead of east when you get twenty miles north of milwaukee at i eased the datsun to a halt on hartfords main street across from ronnas caféhomemade food and in front of the first national bank of hartford my heart was beating fast i unbuckled the seat belt and got out stretching my legs the trip had been just under miles id done it in two hours and ten minutes not bad hartford is in the beautiful moraine country the heart of wisconsin dairy farming theres a small chrysler plant there that makes outboard motors and up the hill i could see a libbys cannery but most of the money in the town comes from farming and people were up early ronnas opened at according to the legend on the door and at seven most of the tables were full i bought the milwaukee sentinel from a coin box by the door and sat down at an empty table near the back one waitress was taking care of the crowd at the counter another covered all the tables she was rushing through the swinging doors at the back her arms loaded up with plates her short curly hair had been dyed black it was anita mcgraw she unloaded pancakes fried eggs toast hash browns at a table where three heavyset men in bib overalls were drinking coffee and brought a fried egg to a goodlooking young guy in a dark blue boiler suit at the table next to me she looked at me with the harassment common to all overworked waitresses in coffee shops ill be right with you coffee i nodded take your time i said opening the paper the men in the bib overalls were kidding the goodlooking guyhe was a veterinarian apparently and they were farmers whod used his services you grow that beard to make everyone think youre grown up doc one of them said naw just to hide from the fbi the vet said anita was carrying a cup of coffee to me her hand shook and she spilled it on the veterinarian she flushed and started apologizing i got up and took the cup from her before any more spilled and the young man said goodnaturedly oh it just wakes you up faster if you pour it all over yourselfespecially if its still hot believe me jody he added as she dabbed ineffectually at the wet spot on his arm with a napkin this is the nicest stuff thats likely to spill on this outfit today the farmers laughed at that and anita came over to take my order i asked for a denver omelette no potatoes wholewheat toast and juice when in farm country eat like a farmer the vet finished his egg and coffee well i hear those cows calling me he said put some money on the table and left other people began drifting out too it was time for the day to be under way for the farmers this was a short break between morning milking and some business in town they lingered over a second cup of coffee by the time anita brought back my omelette though only three tables had people still eating and just a handful were left at the counter i ate half the omelette slowly and read every word in the paper people kept drifting in and out i had a fourth cup of coffee when anita brought my bill i put a five on it and on top of that one of my cards id written on it ruth sent me im in the green datsun across the street i went out and put some money in the meter then got back in the car i sat for another half hour working the crossword puzzle before anita appeared she opened the passenger door and sat down without speaking i folded up the paper and put it in the backseat and looked at her gravely the picture id found in her apartment had shown a laughing young woman not precisely beautiful but full of the vitality that is better than beauty in a young woman now her face was strained and gaunt the police would never have found her from a photographshe looked closer to thirty than twentylack of sleep fear and tension cutting unnatural lines in her young face the black hair did not go with her skin the delicate creamy skin of a true redhead what made you choose hartford i asked she looked surprisedpossibly the last question shed expected peter and i came up here last summer to the washington county fairjust for fun we had a sandwich in that cafe and i remembered it her voice was husky with fatigue she turned to look at me and said rapidly i hope i can trust youive got to trust someone ruth doesnt knowdoesnt know the kind of people whowho might shoot someone i dont either really but i think i have a better idea than she does she gave a bleak smile im going to lose my mind if i stay here alone any longer but i cant go back to chicago i need help if you cant do it if you blow it and i get shotor if youre some clever female hit man who fooled ruth into giving you my addressi dont know i have to take the chance she was holding her hands together so tightly that the knuckles were white im a private investigator i said your father hired me last week to find you and i found peter thayers body instead over the weekend he told me to stop looking i have my own guesses as to what all that was about thats how i got involved i agree that youre in a pretty tough spot and if i blow it neither of us will be in very good shape you cant hide here forever though and i think that im tough enough quick enough and smart enough to get things settled so that you can come out of hiding i cant cure the pain and theres more to come but i can get you back to chicagoor wherever else you want so that you can live openly and with dignity she thought about that nodding her head people were walking up and down the sidewalk i felt as if we were in a fishbowl is there somewhere we can go to talksomewhere with a little more room theres a park thatd be fine it was back along route toward milwaukee i parked the datsun out of sight of the road and we walked down to sit on the bank of a little stream that ran through the park dividing it from the back wall of the chrysler plant on the other side the day was hot but here in the country the air was clear and sweet you said something about living with dignity she said looking at the water her mouth twisted in a harsh smile i dont think ill ever do that again i know what happened to peter you see in a way i guess you could say i killed him why do you say that i asked gently you say you found his body well so did i i came home at four and found him i knew then what had happened i lost my head and ran i didnt know where to goi didnt come here until the next day i spent the night at marys house and then i came up here i couldnt figure out why they werent waiting for me but i knew if i went back theyd get me she was starting to sob great dry sobs that heaved her shoulders and chest dignity she said in a hoarse voice oh chirst id settle for a nights sleep i didnt say anything but sat watching her after a few minutes she calmed down a bit how much do you know she asked i dont know much for certainthat i can prove i mean but ive got some guesses what i know for certain is that your father and yardley masters have a deal going i dont know what it is but i found a claim draft from ajax in your apartment i presume that peter brought it home so one of my guesses is that the deal has to do with claim drafts i know that your father knows earl smeissen and i know that someone wanted something very badly that they thought was in your apartment and then thought that i had taken it and put in mine they wanted it badly enough to ransack both places my guess is that they were looking for the claim draft and that it was smeissen or one of his people who did the ransacking is smeissen a killer she asked in her harsh strained voice well hes doing pretty well these days he doesnt kill himself but hes got muscle to do it for him so my father had him kill peter didnt he she stared at me challengingly her eyes hard and dry her mouth twisted this was the nightmare shed been lying down with every night no wonder she wasnt sleeping i dont know this is one of my guesses your father loves you you know and hes going nuts right now he would never knowingly have put your life in danger and he would never knowingly have let peter be shot i think what happened was that peter confronted masters and masters panicked and called your dad i stopped this isnt pretty and its hard to say to you but your dad knows the kind of people who will put someone away for a price hes made it to the top of a rough union in a rough industry and hes had to know those kinds of people she nodded wearily not looking at me i know i never wanted to know it in the past but i know it now so mymy father gave him this smeissens name is that what youre getting at yes im sure masters didnt tell him who it was whod crossed his pathjust that someone had tumbled to the secret and had to be eliminated its the only thing that explains your fathers behavior what do you mean she asked not very interested your father came to me last wednesday gave me a fake name and a phony story but he wanted me to find you he knew about peters death at that point and he was upset because youd run away you called and accused him of killing peter didnt you she nodded again it was too stupid for words i was off my head with anger and fear andand grief not just for peter you know but for my father and the union and everything id grown up thinking was fine andand worth fighting for yes that was tough she didnt say anything else so i went on your father didnt know at first what had happened it was only a few days later that he connected peter with masters then he knew that masters had had peter killed then he knew that you were in trouble too and thats when he fired me he didnt want me to find you because he didnt want anyone else to find you either she looked at me again i hear you she said in that same weary voice i hear you but it doesnt make it any better my father is the kind of man who gets people killed and he got peter killed we sat looking at the stream for a few minutes without talking then she said i grew up on the union my mother died when i was three i didnt have any brothers or sisters and my dad and iwe were very close he was a hero i knew he was in a lot of fights but he was a hero i grew up knowing he had to fight because of the bosses and that if he could lick them america would be a better place for working men and women everywhere she smiled mirthlessly again it sounds like a childs history book doesnt it it was childs history as my dad moved up in the union we had more money the university of chicagothat was something id always wanted seven thousand dollars a year no problem he bought it for me my own car you name it part of me knew that a workingclass hero didnt have that kind of money but i pushed it aside hes entitled id say and when i met peter i thought why not the thayers have more money than my father ever dreamed of and they never worked for it she paused again that was my rationalization you see and guys like smeissen theyre around the housenot much but some i just wouldnt believe any of it you read about some mobster in the paper and hes been over drinking with your father no way she shook her head peter came home from the office you see hed been working for masters as a favor to his dad he was sick of the whole money thingthat was before we fell in love even although i know his father blamed me for it he wanted to do something really fine with his lifehe didnt know what but just to be nice he agreed to work at ajax i dont think my father knew i didnt tell him i didnt talk to him about peter muchhe didnt like me going around with the son of such an important banker and he is kind of a puritanhe hated my living with peter like that so like i said i didnt talk to him about peter anyway peter knew who some of the big shots in the union are you know when youre in love you learn that kind of thing about each other i knew who the chairman of the fort dearborn trust is and thats not the kind of thing i know as a rule the story was starting to come easily now i didnt say anything just made myself part of the landscape that anita was talking to well peter did rather boring things for masters it was a kind of makework job in the budget department he worked for the budget director a guy he liked and one of the things they asked him to do was check records of claim drafts against claim filessee if they matched you know did joe blow get fifteen thousand dollars when his file shows he should only have gotten twelve thousand dollars that kind of thing they had a computer program that did it but they thought there was something wrong with the program so they wanted peter to do a manual check she laughed a laugh that was really a sob you know if ajax had a good computer system peter would still be alive i think of that sometimes too and it make me want to shoot all their programmers oh well he started with the biggest onesthere were thousands and thousandsthey have three hundred thousand workers compensation claims every year but he was only going to do a spot check so he started with some of the really big onestotal disability claims that had been going on for a while at first it was fun you know to see what kinds of things had happened to people then one day he found a claim set up for carl omalley total disability lost his right arm and been crippled by freak accident with a conveyor belt that happens you knowsomeone gets caught on a belt and pulled into a machine its really terrible i nodded agreement she looked at me and started talking to me rather than just in front of me only it hadnt happened you see carl is one of the senior vicepresidents my dads righthand manhes been part of my life since before i can remember i call him uncle carl peter knew that so he brought home the address and it was carls address carl is as well as you or mehes never been in an accident and hes been away from the assembly line for twentythree years i see you didnt know what to think but you didnt ask your father about it no i didnt know what to ask i couldnt figure it out i guess i thought uncle carl had put in for a fake accident and we kind of treated it like a joke peter and i did but he got to thinking about it he was like that you know he really thought things through and he looked up the other guys on the executive board and they all had indemnity claims not all of them for total disability and not all of them permanent but all of them goodsized sums and that was the terrible thing you see my dad had one too then i got scared and i didnt want to say anything to him is joseph gielczowski on the executive board i asked yes hes one of the vicepresidents and president of local a very powerful local in calumet city do you know him that was the name of the claim draft i found i could see why they didnt want that innocent little stick of dynamite in my hands no wonder theyd torn my place apart looking for it so peter decided to talk to masters you didnt know masters was involved did you no and peter thought he owed it to him to talk to him first you know we werent sure what we would do nexttalk to my dad we had to but we thought masters should know her blue eyes were dark pools of fear in her face what happened was he told masters and masters told him it sounded really serious and that hed like to talk it over with peter in private because it might have to go to the state insurance commission so peter said sure and masters said he would come down monday morning before work she looked at me that was strange wasnt it we should have known it was strange we should have known a vicepresident doesnt do that he talks to you in his office i guess we just assumed it was peter being a friend of the family she looked back at the stream i wanted to be there but i had a job you see i was doing some research for one of the guys in the political science department harold weinstein i guessed yeah you really have been detecting me havent you well i had to be there at eight thirty and masters was coming by around nine so i left peter to it i really left him to it didnt i oh god why did i think that job was so goddamn important why didnt i stay there with him now she was crying real tears not the dry heaves she hid her face in her hands and sobbed she kept repeating that shed left peter alone to be killed and she should have been the one that died her father was the one with all the criminal friends not his i let her go on for several minutes listen anita i said in a clear sharp voice you can blame yourself for this for the rest of your life but you didnt kill peter you didnt abandon him you didnt set him up if you had been there youd be dead too and the truth of what happened might never come out i dont care about the truth she sobbed i know it it doesnt matter whether the rest of the world knows it or not if the rest of the world doesnt know it then youre as good as dead i said brutally and the next nice young boy or girl who goes through those files and learns what you and peter learned is dead too i know this is rotten i know youve been through hell and more besides and youve got worse ahead but the quicker we get going and finish off this business the quicker you can get that part over with it will only get more unbearable the longer you have to anticipate it she sat with her head in her hands but her sobs died down after a while she sat up and looked at me again her face was tearstreaked and her eyes red but some of the strain had gone out of it and she looked younger less like a death mask of herself youre right i was brought up not to be afraid of dealing with people but i dont want to go through this with my dad i know i said gently my father died ten years ago i was his only child and we were very close i know what you must be feeling she was wearing a ridiculous waitress costume black rayon with a white apron she blew her nose into the apron who cashed the drafts i asked the people they were made out to she shook her head theres no way of telling you dont cash drafts you see you present them to the bank and the bank verifies you have an account there and tells the insurance company to send a check to that account youd have to know what bank the drafts were presented to and that information wasnt in the filesonly carbons of the drafts were there i dont know if they kept the originals or if they went to the controllers department or what and peterpeter didnt like to probe too far without masters knowing how was peters father involved i asked her eyes opened at that peters father he wasnt he had to be he was killed the other daymonday her head started moving back and forth and she looked ill im sorry i said that was thoughtless to spring it on you like that i put an arm around her shoulders i didnt say anything more but i bet thayer had helped masters and mcgraw cash in on the drafts maybe some of the other knifegrinders were involved but they wouldnt share a kitty like that with the whole executive board besides that was the kind of secret that everyone would know if that many people knew masters and mcgraw maybe a doctor to put a bona fide report in the files thayer sets up an account for them doesnt know what it is doesnt ask any questions but they give him a present every year maybe and when he threatens to push the investigation into his sons death they stick in the knife hes been involved and he can be prosecuted it looked good to me i wondered if paul and jill would find anything in thayers study or if lucy would let either of them into the house meanwhile there was anita to think of we sat quietly for a while anita was off in her own thoughts sorting out our conversation presently she said it makes it better telling someone else about it not quite so horrible i grunted agreement she looked down at her absurd outfit me dressed up like this if peter could see me hed the sentence trailed off into a sniff id like to leave here stop doing the jody hill thing do you think i can go back to chicago i considered this where were you planning to go she thought for a few minutes thats a problem i guess i cant involve ruth and mary any more youre right not just because of ruth and mary but also because i was followed to the uwu meeting last night so chances are earl will keep an eye on some of the members for a while and you know you cant go home until this whole business is cleared up okay she agreed its justits so hardit was smart in a way coming up here but im always looking over my shoulder you know and i cant talk to anyone about whats really going on in my mind theyre always teasing me about boyfriends like that nice dr dan the one i spilled coffee on this morning and i cant tell them about peter so they think im unfriendly i could probably get you back to chicago i said slowly but youd have to hole up for a few daysuntil i get matters straightened out we could publish an account of the insurance scheme but that would get your dad in trouble without necessarily getting masters and i want him implicated in a way he cant slide out of before i let everything else out do you understand she nodded okay in that case i can see that you get put up in a chicago hotel i think i can fix it so that no one will know you are there you wouldnt be able to go out but someone trustworthy would stop by every now and then to talk to you so you wont go completely stir crazy that sound all right she made a face i guess i dont have any choice do i at least id be back in chicago closer to the things i know thanks she added belatedly i didnt mean to sound so grudgingi really appreciate everything youre doing for me dont worry about your party manners right now im not doing it for the thanks anyway we walked slowly back to the datsun together little insects hummed and jumped in the grass and birds kept up an unending medley a woman with two young children had come into the park the children were rooting industriously in the dirt the woman was reading a book looking up at them every five minutes they had a picnic basket propped under a tree as we walked by the woman called matt eve how about a snack the children came running up i felt a small stirring of envy on a beautiful summer day it might be nice to be having a picnic with my children instead of hiding a fugitive from the police and the mob is there anything you want to collect in hartford i asked she shook her head i should stop at ronnas and tell them im leaving i parked in front of the restaurant and she went in while i used the phone on the corner to call the heraldstar it was almost ten and ryerson was at his desk murray ive got the story of a lifetime for you if you can keep a key witness on ice for a few days where are you he asked you sound like youre calling from the north pole whos the witness the mcgraw girl murray your mind works like a steel trap i want a promise and i need some help ive already helped you he protested lots first by giving you those photos and then by not running a story that you were dead so i could collect your document from your lawyer murray if there was another soul on earth i could turn to right now i would but you are absolutely in if faced with the promise of a good story all right he agreed ill do what i can for you good im in hartford wisconsin with anita mcgraw i want to get her back to chicago and keep her under close wraps until this case blows over that means no one must have a whiff of where she is because if they do youll be covering her obituary i cant bring her down myself because im a hot property now what i want to do is take her to milwaukee and put her on a train and have you meet her at union station when you do get her into a hotel some place far enough from the loop that some smart bellhop on smeissens payroll wont put two and two together when she comes in can do jesus vic you dont do anything in a small way do you sure whats the story why is she in danger smeissen knock off her boyfriend murray im telling you you put any of this in print before the whole story is finished and theyre going to be fishing your body out of the chicago river i guarantee ill put it there you have my word of honor as a gent who is waiting to scoop the city of chicago what time is the train coming in i dont know ill call you again from milwaukee when i hung up anita had come back out and was waiting by the car they werent real happy about me quitting she said i laughed well worry about that on the way down itll keep your mind off your troubles price of a claim we had to wait in milwaukee until for a chicago train i left anita at the station and went out to buy her some jeans and a shirt when she had washed up in the station rest room and changed she looked younger and healthier as soon as she got that terrible black dye out of her hair shed be in good shape she thought her life was ruined and it certainly didnt look great at the moment but she was only twenty shed recover murray agreed to meet the train and get her to a hotel hed decided on the ritz if shes going to be holed up for a few days it might as well be someplace where shell be comfortable he explained the star will share the bill with you thanks murray i said dryly he was to call my answering service and leave a message yes or nono name no meant something had gone wrong with pickup or delivery and i would get back to him i wasnt going to go near the hotel hed stop by a couple of times a day with food and chatwe didnt want anita calling room service as soon as the train pulled out i headed back to the tollway and chicago i had almost all the threads in my hands now the problem was i couldnt prove that masters had killed peter thayer caused him to be killed of course anitas story confirmed it masters had had an appointment with peter but there was no proof nothing that would make bobby swear out a warrant and bring handcuffs to a senior vicepresident of an influential chicago corporation somehow i had to stir around in the nest enough to make the king hornet come out and get me as i left the toll road for the edens expressway i made a detour to winnetka to see if jill had gone home and if she had turned up anything among her fathers papers i stopped at a service station on willow road and called the thayer house jack answered the phone yes jill had come home but she wasnt talking to reporters im not a reporter i said this is v i warshawski she certainly isnt talking to you youve caused mother thayer enough pain already thorndale you are the stupidest sob i have ever met if you dont put jill on the phone i will be at the house in five minutes i will make a lot of noise and i will go and bother all the neighbors until i find one who will put a phone call through to jill for me he banged the receiver down hard on a tabletop i guessed since the connection still held a few minutes later jills clear high voice came onto the line what did you say to jack she giggled ive never seen him so angry oh i just threatened to get all your neighbors involved in whats going on i answered not that they arent anywaythe police have probably been visiting all of them asking questions you get out to winnetka all right oh yes it was very exciting paul got a police escort for us to the clinic lotty didnt want to do it but he insisted then he went and got your car and we got a blastoff with sirens from the clinic sergeant mcgonnigal was really really super sounds good how are things on the home front oh theyre okay mother has decided to forgive me but jack is acting like the stupid phony he is he keeps telling me ive made mother very very unhappy i asked paul to stay to lunch and jack kept treating him as if he were the garbage collector or something i got really mad but paul told me he was used to it i hate jack she concluded i laughed at this outburst good girl pauls a neat guyworth standing up for did you have a chance to look through your fathers papers oh yes of course lucy had a fit but i just pretended i was lotty and didnt pay any attention to her i didnt really know what i was looking for she said but i found some kind of document that had both mr masterss and mr mcgraws names on it i suddenly felt completely at peace as though id been through a major crisis and come out whole on the other side i found myself grinning into the telephone did you now i said what was it i dont know jill said doubtfully do you want me to get it and read it to you thats probably the best thing i agreed she put the phone down i started singing under my breath what will you be o document what kind of laundry ticket its a xerox jill announced back at the phone my dad wrote the date in ink at the topmarch eighteenth then it says agreement of trust the undersigned yardley leland masters and andrew solomon mcgraw are herein granted fiduciary responsibility for any and all monies submitted to this account under their authority for the following she stumbled over fiduciary then it gives a list of namesandrew mcgraw carl omalley joseph gieli cant pronounce it there are aboutlets see i could hear her counting under her breath twentythree names then it adds and any other names as shall be added at their discretion under my countersignature then daddys name and a place for him to sign it is that what you were looking for thats what i was looking for jill my voice was as calm and steady as if i were announcing that the cubs had won the world series what does it mean she asked she was sobering up from her glee at triumphing over jack and lucy does it mean daddy killed peter no jill it does not your father did not kill your brother what it means is that your father knew about a dirty scheme that your brother found out about your brother was killed because he found out about it i see she was quiet for a few minutes do you know who killed him she asked presently i think so you hang loose jill stay close to the house and dont go out with anyone but paul ill come up to see you tomorrow or the next dayeverything should be over by then i started to hang up then thought i should warn her to hide the paper oh jill i said but she had hung up oh well i thought if anyone suspected it was there they would have been around looking by now what that document meant was that masters could set up fake claims for anyone then he and mcgraw could cash the drafts or whatever one did with them put them into the trust account which thayer ostensibly oversaw in fact i wondered why they even bothered to use real names why not just madeup peopleeasier to disguise if theyd done that peter thayer and his father would still be alive maybe theyd gotten to that later id have to see a complete list of the names on the account and check them against the knifegrinders roster it was almost four anita should have made it to chicago by now i called my answering service but no one had rung up with the message of yes or no i got back in the car and returned to the edens inbound traffic moved at a crawl repairs on two of the lanes turned rush hour into a nightmare i oozed slowly onto the kennedy irate and impatient although i didnt have an agenda just an impatience i didnt know what to do next i could certainly expose the fake claim drafts but as id pointed out to anita masters would certainly disclaim all knowledge the knifegrinders might well have set them up with complete doctors reports did claim handlers actually physically look at accident victims i wondered id better talk to ralph explain what id learned today and see if there was some legal angle that would link masters irretrievably with the fraud even that wasnt good enough though i had to link him with the killing and i couldnt think of a way it was by the time i exited at addison and then i had to fight my way across town i finally swung off onto a small side street full of potholes but not much traffic i was about to turn up sheffield to lottys when i thought that might mean walking openarmed into a setup i found the allnight restaurant on the corner of addison and gave her a call my dear vic she greeted me can you believe those gestapo actually had the effrontery to break into this apartment whether they were looking for you jill or the mcgraw girl i couldnt say but they have been here oh my god lotty i said my stomach sinking i am so sorry how bad is the damage oh its nothingjust the locks and paul is here now replacing them its just the wantonness of it that makes me so angry i know i said remorsefully ill certainly repair whatever damage has been done ill come by to get my stuff right now and be gone i hung up and decided to take my chances on a trap it would be just as well if smeissen knew i had gone back homei didnt want lotty put in any more danger or to suffer any more invasions i raced up the street to her building and only gave cursory attention to potential marksmen in the street i didnt see anyone i knew and no one opened fire as i dashed up the stairs paul was in the doorway screwing a deadbolt lock into the door his square face looked very mean this is pretty bad vicyou think jill is in any danger not too likely i said well i think i should go up there and see i grinned sounds like a good idea to me be careful though you hear dont worry his breathtaking smile came but im not sure whether im protecting her from that brotherinlaw or from a gunman well do both i went on into the apartment lotty was at the back trying to reattach a screen to the back door for a woman with such skillful medical fingers she was remarkably inept i took the hammer from her and quickly finished the job her thin face was set and hard her mouth in a fine line i am glad you gave the warning to paul and had that sergeant mcwhatever take us to the clinic at the time i was annoyed with you and with paul but clearly it saved the childs life her viennese accent was very heavy in her anger i thought she was exaggerating about the danger to jill but didnt want to argue the point i went through the apartment with her but had to agree that there really had been no damage not even the medical samples some of which had great street value had been removed lotty kept up a stream of invective during the inspection which became heavily laden with german a language i dont speak i gave up trying to calm her down and merely nodded and grunted agreement paul finally brought it to a halt by coming in to say that the front door was now secure and did she want him to do anything else no my dear thank you go out and visit jill and take very good care of her we dont want her harmed paul agreed fervently he gave me my car keys and told me the chevy was over on seminary off irving park road id thought about leaving him the car but felt id better hang on to it i didnt know what the evening would bring in the way of action i called larry to see if my apartment was ready for occupation it was hed left the keys to the new locks with the firstfloor tenants theyd seemed a bit friendlier than mrs alvarez on the second floor well everything is all set lotty i can go home sorry i didnt yesterday and sleep with the place nailed shutit would have spared you this invasion her mouth twisted in her sardonic smile ah forget it vic my anger storm has passed blown over now i am feeling a little melancholy at being alonei shall miss those two children they are very sweet together i forgot to ask did you find miss mcgraw i forgot to tell youi did and i should check to see whether she is safely ensconced in her new hiding place i put in a call to my answering service yes that longsuffering outfit reported someone had called up and left a message yes they had not left a name but said i would know what it meant i told them they could switch my office calls to my own home number in the activity of the last few days id forgotten to get a kelly girl to tidy my office but at least it was boarded shut id wait until tomorrow to go down there i tried ralph but there was no answer he wasnt at the office either out for dinner was i jealous well lotty this is it thanks for letting me disrupt your life for a few days youve made a major impression on jillshe told me the maid up there was trying to hassle her but she pretended she was lotty and didnt pay her any mind im not sure thats such a good ideato model herself on me that is a very attractive girlamazing that shes avoided all that suburban insularity she sat on the daybed to watch me pack what now canyou expose the killer ive got to find a lever i said i know who did itnot who fired the actual shot thats probably a guy named tony bronsky but it could have been any one of several of smeissens crew but who desired that shot to be firedthat i know but cant prove i know what the crime was though and i know how it was worked i zipped the canvas bag shut what i need is a lever or maybe a wedge i was talking to myself more than to lotty a wedge to pry this guy apart a bit if i can find out that the fiddle couldnt be worked without his involvement then maybe i can force him into the open i was standing with one foot on the bed absentmindedly tapping the suitcase with my fingers while i thought lotty said if i were a sculptor i would make a statue of younemesis come to life you will think of a wayi see it in your face she stood on tiptoe and gave me a kiss ill walk you to the streetif anyone shoots at you then i can patch you up quickly before too much blood is lost i laughed lotty youre wonderful by all means cover my back for me she walked me to the corner of seminary but the street was clear thats because of that sergeant mcsomething she said i think hes been driving around here from time to time still vic be careful you have no mother but you are a daughter of my spirit i should not like anything to happen to you lotty thats melodrama i protested dont start getting old for gods sake she shrugged her thin shoulders in a way wholly european and gave me a sardonic smile but her eyes were serious as i walked up the street to my car shootout on elm street larry and his friend the carpenter had done a beautiful job on my apartment the door was a masterpiece with carved flowers on the panels the carpenter had installed two dead bolts and the action on them was clean and quiet inside the place shone as it had not for months not a trace of the weekend ravage remained although larry had sent the shredded couch away he had moved chairs and an occasional table around to fill the empty space he had left a bill in the middle of the kitchen table two people for two days at an hour the door locks and installation new supplies of flour sugar beans and spices new pillows for the bed it seemed like a pretty reasonable bill to me i wondered who was going to pay me though maybe jill could borrow from her mother until her trust fund matured i went to look through my jewelry box by some miracle the vandals had not taken my mothers few valuable pieces but i thought id better lock them in a bank vault and not leave them around for the next invader larry seemed to have thrown out the shards of the broken venetian glass i should have told him to save them but that couldnt be helped it was beyond restoration anyway the other seven held pride of place in the builtin china cupboard but i couldnt look at them without a thud in my stomach i tried ralph again this time he answered on the fourth ring whats up miss marple he asked i thought you were out after professor moriarty until tomorrow i found him earlier than i expected in fact i found out the secret that peter thayer died to protect only he didnt want to protect it you know that claim draft i gave you did you ever find the file no i told you i put it on the missingfile search but it hasnt turned up well it may never do you know who joseph gielczowski is what is this twenty questions ive got someone coming over in twenty minutes vic joseph gielczowski is a senior vicepresident of the knifegrinders union he has not been on an assembly line for twentythree years if you went to visit him in his home you would find he was as healthy as you are or you could go see him at knifegrinders headquarters where he is able to work and draw a salary without needing any indemnity payments there was a pause are you trying to tell me that that guy is fraudulently drawing workers compensation payments no i said goddamnit vic if hes healthy and is getting indemnity drafts then hes drawing them fraudulently no i reiterated sure theyre fraudulent but hes not drawing them well who is then your boss ralph exploded into the phone youve got this damned bee in your bonnet about masters vic and im sick of it hes one of the most respected members of a highly respected company in a very respectable industry to suggest that hes involved in something like that im not suggesting it i know it i said coldly i know that he and andrew mcgraw head of the knifegrinders union set up a fund with themselves as joint trustees enabling them to cash drafts or whatever it is you do to get payments on drafts drawn to gielczowski and at least twentytwo other healthy people how can you possibly know something like that ralph said furious because i just listened to someone read a copy of the agreement to me over the phone ive also found someone who has seen masters with mcgraw on numerous occasions up near knifegrinder headquarters and i know that masters had an appointment with peter thayerat his apartmentat nine on the morning he was killed i still dont believe it i have worked for yardley for three years and been in his organization for ten years before that and im sure theres a different explanation for everything youve found outif youve found it out you havent seen this trust agreement and yardley may have eaten with mcgraw or drunk with him or somethingmaybe he was checking out some coverage or claims or something we do do that from time to time i felt like screaming with frustration just let me know ten minutes before you go to masters to check the story with him will you so i can get there in time to save your ass if you think im going to jeopardize my career by telling my boss that ive been listening to that kind of rumor about him youre nuts ralph roared as a matter of fact hes coming over here in a few minutes and i promise you without any difficulty that i am not such an ass as to tell him about it of course if that gielczowski claim is fraudulent that explains a lot ill tell him that my hair seemed to stand straight up on my head what ralph you are so goddamn naive its unbelievable why the hell is he coming over you really dont have any right to ask me that he snapped but ill tell you anyway since you started the whole uproar by finding that draft claims that big are handled out of the home office not by a field adjustor i went around to the guys today and asked whod handled the file no one remembered it if anyone had been handling such a big file for so many years theres no way they would forget it this puzzled me so when i called yardley this afternoonhe hasnt been in the office this weeki call him at home once a dayi mentioned it to him oh christ that is the absolute end so he told you it sounded like a serious problem didnt he and that since he had to come down to the city tonight for some other reason hed just drop by and talk it over with you is that right i said savagely why yes it is he shouted now go find someones missing poodle and stop screwing around in the claim department ralph im coming over tell yardley that when he walks in the door as soon as he walks in and maybe it will save your goddamn ass for a few minutes i slammed down the phone without waiting for his answer i looked at my watch masters was due there in twenty minutes roughly say he got there around maybe a few minutes earlier i put my drivers license my gun permit and my pi license in my hip pocket with some moneyi didnt want a purse in my way at this point checked the gun put extra rounds in my jacket pocket wasted fortyfive seconds changing to running shoes locked the new oiled dead bolts behind me and sprinted down the stairs three at a time ran the halfblock to my car in fifteen seconds put it in gear and headed for lake shore drive why was every goddamn person in chicago out tonight and why were so many of them on belmont avenue i wondered savagely and why were the lights timed so that every time you hit a corner they turned and some asshole grandfather wouldnt clear the intersection in front of you on the yellow i pounded the steering wheel in impatience but it didnt make the traffic flow faster no point in sitting on the horn either i took some deep diaphragm breaths to steady myself ralph you stupid jerk making a present of your life to a man whos had two people killed in the last two weeks because masters wears the oldboy network tie and youre on his team he couldnt possibly do something criminal naturally not i swooped around a bus and got a clear run to sheridan road and the mouth of the drive it was i prayed to the patron saint who protects speeders from speed traps and floored the monza at i slid off the drive onto la salle street and down the inner parallel road to elm street at i left the car at a fireplug next to ralphs building and sprinted inside the building didnt have a doorman i pushed twenty buttons in quick succession several people squawked who is it through the intercom but someone buzzed me in no matter how many breakins are executed this way there is always some stupid idiot who will buzz you into an apartment building without knowing who you are the elevator took a century or two to arrive once it came though it carried me quickly to the seventeenth floor i ran down the hall to ralphs apartment and pounded on the door my smith wesson in my hand i flattened myself against the wall as the door opened then dove into the apartment gun out ralph was staring at me in amazement what the hell do you think youre doing he said no one else was in the room good question i said standing up the bell rang and ralph went to push the buzzer i wouldnt mind if you left he remarked i didnt move at least put that goddamn gun away i put it in my jacket pocket but kept my hand on it do me one favor i said when you open the door stand behind it dont frame yourself in the doorway you are the craziest goddamn if you call me a crazy broad i will shoot you in the back block your damned body with the door when you open it ralph glared at me when the knocking came a few minutes later he went straight to the door and deliberately opened it so that it would frame his body squarely i moved to the side of the room parallel with the door and braced myself no shots sounded hello yardley whats all this ralph was saying this is my young neighbor jill thayer and these are some associates whove come along with me i was stunned and moved toward the door to look jill i said are you here vic the clear little voice quavered a bit im sorry paul called to say he was coming up on the train and i started to walk into town to meet him at the station and mrmr masters passed me asked him about that paper and he made me come along with him im sorry vic i know i shouldnt have said anything thats okay honey i started to say but masters interrupted with ah youre here are you we thought wed come visit you and that viennese doctor jill admires so much a little later but youve saved us a trip he looked at my gun which id pulled out and smiled offensively i would put that away if i were you tony here is pretty triggerhappy and i know youd hate to watch anything happen to jill tony bronsky had come into the room behind masters with him was earl ralph was shaking his head like a man trying to wake up from a dream i put the gun back into my pocket dont blame the girl masters said to me but you really shouldnt have gotten her involved you know as soon as margaret thayer told me she had come back home i tried finding a way of talking to her without anyone in the house knowing about it sheer luck really that she walked down sheridan just at that time but we got her to explain quite a bit didnt we jill i could see now that there was an ugly bruise on the side of her face cute masters i said youre at your best when youre beating up little girls id like to see you with a grandmother he was right id been stupid to bring her down to lottys and get her involved in things that masters and smeissen didnt want anyone to know about id save my selfreproach for later thoughi didnt have time for it now want me to put her away tony breathed his eyes glistening with happiness his zshaped scar vivid as a wound not yet tony masters said we want to find out how much she knows and who shes told it to you too ralph its really a shame you got this polish gal over herewe werent going to shoot you unless it was absolutely necessary but now im afraid well have to he turned to smeissen earl youve had more experience at this kind of thing than i have whats the best way to set them up get the warchoski broads gun away from her earl said in his squeaky voice then have her and the guy sit together on the couch so that tony can cover them both you heard him masters said he started toward me no earl squeaked dont go close to her make her drop it tony cover the kid tony pointed his browning at jill i dropped the s w on the floor earl came and kicked it into the corner jills little face was white and pinched over to the couch masters said tony continued to cover jill i went and sat down the couch was firm one good thingone didnt sink into it i kept my weight distributed forward onto my legs and feet move earl squeaked at ralph ralph was looking dazed little drops of sweat covered his face he stumbled a bit on the thick carpet as he came to sit next to me you know masters this cesspool youve built is stinking so high youre going to have to kill everyone in chicago to cover it up i said you think so do you who knows about it besides you he was still smiling unpleasantly my hand itched to break his lower jaw oh the star has a pretty good idea my attorney a few others even little earl over here isnt going to be able to buy off the cops if you shoot down an entire newspaper crew is this true yardley ralph asked his voice came out in a hoarse whisper and he cleared his throat i dont believe it i wouldnt believe vic when she tried to tell me you didnt shoot peter did you masters gave a superior little laugh of course not tony here shot him i had to go along though just as i did tonightto get tony into the building and earl came along as an accessory earl doesnt usually get involved do you earl but we dont want any blackmail after this thats good masters i praised him the reason earls ass is so fat is because hes been protecting it all these years earl turned red you twocent bitch just for that im going to let tony work you over again before he shoots you he squeaked attaboy earl i looked at masters earl never beats anyone up himself i explained i used to think it was because he didnt have any balls but last week i found out that wasnt true right earl earl started for me as i hoped he would but masters held him back calm down earl shes just trying to ride you you can do whatever you want to herafter i find out how much she knows and where anita mcgraw is i dont know yardley i said brightly dont give me that he said leaning forward to hit me on the mouth you disappeared early this morning that heap of shit smeissen had watching the back alley went to sleep and you got away but we questioned some of the girls you talked to at the uwu meeting last night and tony herepersuadedone of them to tell him where anita had gone but when we got to hartford wisconsin at noon shed disappeared and the woman at the restaurant described you pretty well an older sister she thought whod come to take jody hill away with her now where is she i uttered a silent prayer of thanks for the urge that had prompted anita to want to leave hartford theres got to be more to this racket than just those twentythree names on the original deed of trust jill found i said even at two hundred fifty dollars a week apiece that isnt paying for the services of a guy like smeissen roundtheclock surveillance on me that must have cost you a bundle masters tony masters said conversationally hit the girl hard jill gave a gasp a scream held back good girl lots of guts you kill the girl masters you got nothing to stop me i said youre in a little ol jam the minute tony takes that gun off her shes going to roll on the floor and get behind that big chair and im going to jump tony and break his neck and if he kills her the same thing will happen so sure i dont want to watch you rough up jill but youre using up your weapon doing it go ahead and kill warchoski earl squeaked youre going to sooner or later anyway masters shook his head not until we know where the mcgraw girl is tell you what yardley i offered ill trade you jill for anita you send the kid outside let her go home and ill tell you where anita is masters actually wasted a minute thinking about it you do think im dumb dont you if i let her go all shell do is call the police of course i think youre dumb as dick tracy once put it so well all crooks are dumb how many fake claimants do you have pulling indemnity payments into that dummy account he laughed his fakehearty laugh again oh close to three hundred now set up in different parts of the country that deed of trust is quite outdated and i see john never bothered to go back and check the original to see how it was growing what was his cut for overseeing the account i really didnt come here to answer a smartmouthed broads questions yardley said still goodnatured still in control i want to know how much you know oh i know quite a bit i said i know that you called mcgraw and got earls name from him when peter thayer came to you with those incriminating files i know you didnt tell mcgraw who you were having put away and when he found out he panicked youve got him in a cleft stick havent you he knows youre gunning for his kid but he cant turn states evidence or he hasnt got the guts to anyway because then hell be an accessory before the fact sending a professional killer to you lets see i also know that you talked thayer out of continuing the investigation into his sons death by telling him hed been a party to the crime for which peter died and that if he pushed the investigation the thayer name would be mud and hed lose his position at the bank and i know he wrestled with that grim news for two days then decided he couldnt live with himself and called you and told you he wouldnt be a party to his sons death so you got cute little tony here to gun him down the next morning before he could get to the states attorney i turned to tony you arent as good as you used to be tony my boy someone saw you waiting outside the thayer place that witness is on ice nowyou didnt get him when you had the opportunity earls face turned red again you had a witness and you didnt see him he screeched as much of a shout as his high voice could manage goddamnit what do i pay you for i want amateurs i pull one off the street and what about freddie hes paid to watchhe doesnt see anyone goddamn dumb bastards all of you he was pumping his fat little arms up and down in his rage i glanced at ralph his face was gray he was in shock i couldnt do anything about that now jill gave me a little smile shed caught the message as soon as tony lifted the gun shed roll behind the chair see i said disgustedly you guys have made so many mistakes that piling up three more corpses isnt going to help you one bit i told you before earl bobby mallorys no dummy you cant knock off four people in his territory and get away with it forever earl smirked they never hung one on me yet warchoski you know that its warshawski you goddamn kraut you know why polish jokes are so short i asked masters so the germans can remember them this is enough warchoski or whatever your name is masters said he used a stern voice the kind that got him heard with his junior staff you tell me where the mcgraw girl is youre rightjill is as good as dead i hate to do it ive known that girl since she was born but i just cant take the risk but youve got a choice i can have tony kill her one clean shot and its done or i can have him rape her while you watch and then kill her you tell me where the mcgraw girl is and youll save her a lot of grief jill was very white her gray eyes looked huge and black in her face oh jeez yardley i said you big hemen really impress the shit out of me are you telling me tonys going to rape that girl on your command why do you think the boy carries a gun he cant get it up never could so he has a big old penis he carries around in his hand i spoke tony turned crimson and gave a primitive shriek in the back of his throat he turned to look at me now i yelled and jumped jill dived behind the armchair tonys bullet went wide and i reached him in one spring and chopped his gun arm hard enough to break the bone he screamed in pain and dropped the browning as i spun away masters lunged over for it i made a diving slide but he got there first sitting down hard he brandished the browning at me while he got up and i backed away a few paces the report from tonys shot had brought ralph back to life out of the corner of my eye i saw him move over on the couch toward the phone and lift the receiver masters saw it too and turned and shot him in the second he turned i made a rolling fall into the corner of the room and got the smith wesson as masters turned to fire at me i shot him in the knee he wasnt used to pain he fell with a great cry of surprised agony and dropped the gun earl whod been dancing in the background pretending he was part of the fight moved forward to get it i shot at his hand i was out of practice and missed but he jumped back anyway i pointed the smith wesson at tony onto the couch move tears were running down his cheeks his right arm hung in a funny way id broken the ulna you guys are worse than trash and id love to shoot the three of you dead save the state a lot of money if any of you goes for that gun ill kill you earl get your fat little body over on the couch next to tony he looked like a twoyearold whose mother has unexpectedly spanked him his whole face was squashed up as if he too were about to burst into tears but he moved over next to tony i picked up the browning continuing to cover the two on the couch masters was bleeding into the carpet he wasnt in any shape to move the police are going to love this gun i said i bet it fired the bullet that shot peter thayer didnt it tony i called to jill you still alive back there honey yes vic she said in a little voice good you come on out now and call the number im going to give you were going to call the police and have them collect this garbage then maybe youd better call lotty get her over here to look at ralph i hoped there was something left of him for lotty to work on he wasnt moving but i couldnt go to himhed fallen on the far side of the room and the couch and phone table would block me if i went over to where he lay jill came out from behind the big armchair where shed been crouching the little oval face was still very white and she was shaking a bit walk behind me honey i told her and take a couple of deep breaths in a few minutes you can relax and let it all out but right now youve got to keep on going she turned her head away from the floor where masters lay bleeding and walked over to the phone i gave her mallorys office number and told her to ask for him hed gone home for the day she reported i gave her the home number is lieutenant mallory there please she asked in her clear polite voice when he came on the line i told her to bring the phone over to me but not to get in front of me at all bobby vic im at twoohthree east elm with earl smeissen tony bronsky and a guy from ajax named yardley masters masters has a shattered knee and bronsky a broken ulna i also have the gun that was used to shoot peter thayer mallory made an explosive noise into the phone is this some kind of joke vicki bobby im a cops daughter i never make that kind of joke twoohthree east elm apartment seventeenoheight ill try not to kill the three of them before you get here blood is thicker than gold it was ten and the short black nurse said you shouldnt be here at all but he wont go to sleep until you stop by i followed her into the room where ralph lay his face very white but his gray eyes alive lotty had made a good job of bandaging him up and the surgeon at passavant had only changed the dressing without disturbing her work as lotty said shed done a lot of bullet wounds paul had come with lotty to ralphs apartment frantic hed gotten to winnetka and forced his way past lucy about twenty minutes after masters had picked up jill he went straight from there to lottys the two of them had called me called the police to report jill missing but fortunately had stayed at lottys close to the phone jill ran sobbing into pauls arms when they arrived and lotty had given a characteristic shake of the head good idea get her out of here get her some brandy then turned her attention to ralph who lay unconscious and bleeding in the corner the bullet had gone through his right shoulder tearing up a lot of bone and muscle but coming out clean on the other side now i looked down at him on the hospital bed he took hold of my right hand with his left and squeezed it weakly he was pretty drugged i sat on the bed get off the bed the little nurse said i was exhausted i wanted to tell her to go to hell but i didnt feel like fighting the hospital on top of everything else i stood up im sorry ralph said his words slightly slurred dont worry about it as it turned out that was probably the best thing that could have happened i couldnt figure out how to get masters to show his hand no but i should have listened to you i couldnt believe you knew what you were talking about i guess deep down i didnt take your detecting seriously i thought it was a hobby like dorothys painting i didnt say anything yardley shot me i worked for him for three years and didnt see that about him you met him once and knew he was that kind of guy his words were slurred but his eyes were hurt and angry dont keep hitting yourself with that i said gently i know what it means to be a team player you dont expect your teammates your quarterback to do that kind of thing i came at it from the outside so i was able to see things differently he was quiet again but the hold on my fingers tightened so i knew he wasnt sleeping presently he said ive been falling in love with you vic but you dont need me his mouth twisted and he turned his head to one side to hide some tears my throat was tight and i couldnt get any words out thats not true i tried to say but i didnt know if it was or not i swallowed and cleared my throat i wasnt just using you to get masters my words came out in a harsh squawk i liked you ralph he shook his head slightly the movement made him wince its not the same thing it just wouldnt work out i squeezed his hand painfully no it would never work out i wished i didnt feel so much like crying gradually the hold on my fingers relaxed he was asleep the little nurse pulled me away from the bed i didnt look around before leaving the room i wanted to go home and get drunk and go to bed or pass out or something but i owed murray his story and anita should be let out of captivity i called murray from the passavant lobby i was beginning to wonder about you vic he said the news about smeissens arrest just came in and my gofer at the police station says bronsky and an ajax executive are both in the police ward at cook county yeah i was bone tired things are mostly over anita can come out of hiding id like to pick her up and take her down to see her dad thats something thats got to be done sooner or later and it might as well be now masters was sure to squeal on mcgraw as soon as he started talking and i wanted to see him before mallory did tell you what murray said ill meet you in the lobby at the ritz and you can tell me about it on the way down then i can get a few heartrending shots of the crusty old union guy being reunited with his daughter bad idea murray ill meet you in the lobby and fill you in on the broad outline if anita wants you to come along you can but dont bet on it dont worry about your story though youll still scoop the town i hung up and walked out of the hospital i was going to have to talk to bobby myself id gone with lotty and ralph when the ambulance came and mallory had been too busy to do more than shout i need to talk to you at me as i went out the door i didnt feel like doing it tonight jill was going to be okay that was one good thing but poor anitastill i owed it to her to get her down to her father before the police got to him it was only four blocks from the hospital to the ritz the night was clear and warm and caressing i needed a mother just now and mother night felt like a good companion folding dark arms around me the lobby of the ritz plush and discreet hovered twelve stories above the street the rich atmosphere jarred on my mood i didnt fit in too well with it either in the mirrored walls of the elevator riding up id seen myself disheveled with blood on my jacket and jeans my hair uncombed as i waited for murray i half expected the house detective murray and he arrived at the same time excuse me madam he said urbanely i wonder if youd mind coming with me murray laughed sorry vic but you earned that he turned to the house detective im murray ryerson with the star this is v i warshawski a private investigator weve come to pick up a guest of yours and then well be gone the detective frowned over murrays press card then nodded very well sir madam i wonder if you would mind waiting near the desk not at all i said politely i understand that most of your guests never see any more blood than is contained by the average steak tartare actually maybe i could wash up while mr ryerson waits for miss mcgraw the detective ushered me happily to a private washroom in the managers office i scrubbed off the worst of the mess and washed my face i found a brush in the cabinet over the sink and got my hair shaped up on the whole i looked a lot better maybe not material for the ritz but not someone to be thrown out on sight anita was waiting with murray in the lobby when i got back she looked at me doubtfully murray says im out of danger yes smeissen masters and smeissens gunman have been arrested do you want to talk to your dad before hes arrested too murrays mouth dropped open i put a hand on his arm to keep him from talking anita thought for a minute yes she finally said ive been thinking it over today youre rightthe longer i put it off the worse it will be im coming along murray announced no anita said no im not showing all that to the newspapers vic will give you the story later but im not having reporters hanging around for this you got it murray i said catch up with me later on tonight ill bei dont know ill be at my bar downtown anita and i started for the elevator wheres that he demanded catching up with us the golden glow on federal and adams i called a cab to take us back to my car a zealous officer possibly one whod been left guarding the lobby had put a parking ticket on the windshield twenty dollars for blocking a fire hydrant they serve and protect i was so tired i didnt think i could drive and talk at the same time i realized that this was the same day that id made the threehundredmile round trip to hartford and that i hadnt slept the night before it was all catching up with me now anita was preoccupied with her private worries after giving me directions on how to get to her fathers elmwood park house she sat quietly staring out the window i liked her i felt a lot of empathy with her but i was too drained to reach out and give her anything at the moment we were on the eisenhower expressway the road that runs from the loop to the western suburbs and had gone about five miles before anita spoke what happened to masters he showed up with his hired help to try to blow me and ralph devereux away they had jill thayer with themthey were using her as a hostage i managed to jump the gunman and break his arm and disable masters jill is all right is she shes such a good kid id hate like hell for anything to happen to her have you met her at all yes she spent a few days with me shes a great kid youre right shes a lot like peter the mother is very selfcentered into clothes and the body beautiful and the sister is incredible youd think someone made her up for a book but jill and peter both areare she groped for words selfassured but completely turned out on the world everything always iswasso interesting to peterwhat makes it work how to solve the problem every person was someone he might want to be best friends with jills a lot the same i think shes falling in love with a puerto rican boy that should keep things stirred up in winnetka anita gave a little chuckle for sure thatll be worse than mei was a labor leaders daughter but at least i wasnt black or spanish she was quiet for a while then she said you know this week has changed my life or made it seem upsidedown my whole life was directed to the union i was going to go to law school and be a union lawyer nowit doesnt seem worth a lifetime but theres a big empty hole i dont know what to put there instead and with peter gonei lost the union and peter all at the same time i was so busy last week being terrified that i didnt notice it now i do oh yes thats going to take a while all mourning takes a long time and you cant rush it along my dads been dead ten years now and every now and then something comes up that lets me know that the mourning is still going on and another piece of it is in place the hard part doesnt last so long while it is going on though dont fight itthe more you poke away the grief and anger the longer it takes to sort it out she wanted to know more about my dad and our life together the rest of the way out i spent telling her about tony funny that he should have the same name as that stupid gunman of earls my father my tony had been a bit of a dreamer an idealist a man who had never shot another human being in all his years on the forcewarning shots in the air but no one killed because of tony warshawski mallory couldnt believe iti remember that as tony was dying they were talking one evening bobby came over a lot at night those days and bobby asked him how many people hed killed in his years on the force tony replied hed never even wounded a man after a few minutes of silence i thought of a small point that had been bothering me whats with this fakename business when your father first came to me he called you anita hill up in wisconsin you were jody hill i can see he gave you a false name in a nottoobright effort to keep you out of thingsbut whyd you both use hill oh not collusion but joe hill has always been a big hero of ours jody hill just came to me subconsciously he probably picked it for the same reason we had reached our exit and anita started giving me detailed directions when we pulled up in front of the house she sat for a bit without speaking finally she said i couldnt decide whether to ask you to come in with me or not but i think you should this whole thing got startedor your involvement got startedbecause he came to you now i dont know whether hell believe its over without your story okay we walked up to the house together a man was sitting outside the front door bodyguard anita murmured to me daddys had one as long as i can remember aloud she said hi chuck its me anitaive dyed my hair the man was taken aback i heard you ran off that someone was gunning for you you okay oh yes im fine my dad home yup hes in there alone we went into the house a small ranch house on a large plot anita led me through the living room to a sunken family room andrew mcgraw was watching television he turned as he heard us coming for a second he didnt recognize anita with her short black hair then he jumped up annie yes its me she said quietly miss warshawski here found me as you asked her to she shot yardley masters and broke the arm of earl smeissens hired gunman theyre all three in jail now so we can talk is that true he demanded you disabled bronsky and shot masters yes i said but your troubles arent over you know as soon as masters has recovered somewhat hes going to talk he looked from me to anita the heavy square face uncertain how much do you know he finally said i know a lot anita said her voice wasnt hostile but it was cold the voice of someone who didnt know the person she was talking to very well and wasnt sure shed want to i know youve been using the union as a front for collecting money on illegal insurance claims i know that peter found that out and went to yardley masters about it and masters called you and got the name of a hit man listen annie he said in a low urgent tone much different from the angry bluster id heard before youve got to believe i didnt know it was peter when yardley called she stayed in the doorway to the room looking down at him as he stood in his shirtsleeves i moved over to one side dont you see she said her voice breaking a little it doesnt matter it doesnt matter whether you knew who it was or not what matters is that you were using the union for fraud and that you knew a killer when masters needed one i know you wouldnt have had peter shot in cold blood but its because you knew how to get people shot that it happened at all he was silent thinking yes i see he said finally in that same low voice do you think i havent seen it sitting here for ten days wondering if id see you dead too and know that i had killed you she said nothing look annie you and the unionthats been my whole life for twenty years i thought for ten days that id lost both of you now youre back im going to have to give up the unionare you going to make me do without you as well behind us an insanely grinning woman on tv was urging the room to buy some kind of shampoo anita stared at her father it can never be the same you know our life you know the foundations broken look at me annie he said hoarsely i havent slept for ten days i havent eaten i keep watching television expecting to hear that theyve found your dead body someplace i asked warshawski here to find you when i thought i could keep a step ahead of masters but when they made it clear youd be dead if you showed up i had to call her off he looked at me you were rightabout almost everything i used thayers card because i wanted to plant the idea of him in your mind it was stupid everything ive done this last weeks been stupid once i realized annie was in trouble i just lost my head and acted on crazy impulses i wasnt mad at you you know i was just hoping to god youd stop before you found annie i knew if earl was watching you youd lead him straight to her i nodded maybe i should never have known any gangsters he said to anita but that started so long ago before you were born once you get in bed with those boys you dont get out again the knifegrinders were a pretty rough bunch in those daysyou think were tough now you should have seen us then and the big manufacturers they all hired hooligans to kill us and keep the union out we hired muscle to get the union in only once we were in we couldnt get rid of the muscle if id wanted to get away the only way i could have done it was to leave the knifegrinders and i couldnt do that i was a shop steward when i was fifteen i met your mother when i was picketing western springs cutlery and she was a kid herself screwing scissors together the union was my life and guys like smeissen were the dirty part that came along with it but you betrayed the union you betrayed it when you started dealing with masters on those phony claims anita was close to tears yeah youre right he ran a hand through his hair probably the dumbest thing i ever did he came up to me at comiskey park one day someone pointed me out to him hed been looking for years i guesshed figured out the deal you see but he needed someone on the outside to send the claims into him all i saw was the money i just didnt want to look down that road if i had its like some story i heard once some guy greek i think was so greedy he begged the gods to give him a gifteverything he touched would turn to gold only thing is these gods they zap you they always give you what you ask for but it turns out not to be what you want well this guy was like me he had a daughter that he loved more than life but he forgot to look down the road and when he touched her she turned to gold too thats what ive done havent i king midas i said but he repented and the gods forgave him and brought his daughter back to life anita looked uncertainly at her father he looked back his harsh face stripped and pleading murray was waiting for his story i didnt say goodbye sara
