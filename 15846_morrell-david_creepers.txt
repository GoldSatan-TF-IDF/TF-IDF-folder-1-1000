david morrell creepers a bram stoker award nominee to jack finney and richard matheson whose imaginations never fail to inspire places youre not supposed to go subject of the website hell is empty and all the devils are here shakespeare the tempest pm creepers thats what they called themselves and that would make a good story balenger thought which explained why he met them in this godforsaken new jersey motel in a ghost town of people months later he still would not be able to tolerate being in rooms with closed doors the nostrilwidening smell of must would continue to trigger the memory of screams the beam from a flashlight wouldnt fail to make him sweat later as he convalesced sedatives loosened the steel barriers hed imposed on his memory allowing frenzied sounds and images to dart out that chilly saturday night in late october a little after nine that was the moment when he could have turned around and saved himself from the mounting nightmare of the next eight hours but in retrospect even though hed survived he surely wasnt saved he blamed himself for failing to notice how hyper everything felt as he approached the motel the crash of the waves on the beach two blocks away seemed abnormally loud a breeze scraped sand along a decaying sidewalk dead leaves rattled across cracked pavement but the sound that balenger most remembered the one that he told himself should have made him retreat was a mournful rhythmic clang clang clang that drifted along the areas abandoned streets it was harsh as if from a fractured bell but he would soon learn its true origin and how it represented the hopelessness he was about to enter clang it could have been a warning to ships to stay away and avert disaster clang or it could have tolled for a funeral clang or it could have been the sound of doom the motel had twelve rooms only unit was occupied a pale yellow light seeping past its thin curtain the exterior was rundown as much in need of paint and repair as all the other buildings in the area balenger couldnt help wondering why the group had chosen it despite the hard times the community had suffered there were still some decent places in which to stay the cold breeze made him tug the zipper on his windbreaker all the way to his neck a broadshouldered man of thirtyfive he had short sandy hair and an experienceetched face that women found appealing although there was only one woman he cared about he paused outside the room wanting to control his thoughts to prepare his emotions for the role he needed to assume through the flimsy door he heard a mans voice it sounded young the guys late a womans voice also young maybe he isnt coming a second man much older when he contacted me he was enthused by the project a third man young like the first two i dont think its a good idea we never took a stranger with us before hell get in the way we shouldnt have agreed balenger didnt want the conversation to proceed in that direction so he decided he was as focused as he was going to get and knocked on the door the room became quiet after a moment a lock was freed the door came open the length of a security chain a bearded face peered out professor conklin the face nodded im frank balenger the door closed a chain rattled the door came open again revealing an overweight man of sixty silhouetted by light balenger knew the mans age because hed researched him thoroughly robert conklin professor of history at the state university at buffalo vietnam war protestor during his graduateschool years jailed three times at various political events including the march on the pentagon arrested once for possession of marijuana the charge dismissed for insufficient evidence married widowed one year later he became a creeper its after nine we began to wonder if you were coming the professors gray hair matched his beard his glasses were small his cheeks heavy after a careful look outside he shut and locked the door i missed the earlier train from new york sorry to hold you up quite all right vinnie was late arriving also were getting organized the professor who looked out of place in jeans a sweater and a windbreaker indicated a thin man of twentyfour who also wore jeans a sweater and a windbreaker as did the two other young people in the room as did balenger whod followed the instructions he was given including the directive to make certain the clothes were dark vincent vanelli ba in history state university at buffalo high school teacher in syracuse new york unmarried mother deceased father unable to work suffering from smokersrelated emphysema conklin turned toward the remaining two people a man and a woman they too were twentyfour balenger knew from his investigations the woman had ponytailed red hair a sensuous mouth that some men would have worked not to stare at and a figure that the sweater and windbreaker couldnt hide the goodlooking man next to her had brown hair and a solid build even if balenger hadnt researched his background hed have known that the man enjoyed exercise im cora the woman said her voice pleasantly deep and this is rick again only first names although balenger knew that their last name was magill they had bas in history from the state university at buffalo and were now in the graduate history program at the university of massachusetts met in married in pleased to meet you balenger shook hands with everybody an awkward moment ended when he pointed toward objects laid out on the worn bedspread so these are the tools of the trade vinnie chuckled i guess if the wrong person came in here hed get suspicious it was an amazing array of equipment hard hats with batterypowered lights attached to them flashlights candles matches spare batteries work gloves knives knapsacks rope duct tape water bottles hammers a crowbar digital cameras walkietalkies trail mix energy bars and several small electronic devices balenger couldnt identify a leatherman allinone tool pliers wire cutters various types of screwdrivers sat next to a firstaid trauma kit in a red nylon bag the kit labeled pro med was the equivalent to what swat teams and military specialoperations units carried balenger knew anticipating trouble some of these could be considered burglary tools the furthest thing from our minds professor conklin said anyway theres nothing to steal as far as we know cora said not that it would make a difference we look but dont touch of course thats not always possible but thats the general idea to quote the sierra club rick said take nothing but photographs leave nothing but footprints balenger removed a notebook and pen from a windbreaker pocket how long have you been creepers i hope youre not going to use that word in your article vinnie objected but its part of the slang isnt it mice are lawenforcement officers right ball busters are large pipes youre forced to straddle to get over poppers are the crowbars you use to pry up manhole covers and creepers are infiltrators is an equally dramatic term with a less harsh connotation although it does imply were breaking the law professor conklin admitted which strictly speaking we are why not call us urban explorers or urban adventurers cora said balenger kept writing city speleologists the professor suggested metaphoric cave investigators descending into the past wed better set some rules rick said abruptly you work for the new york times sunday magazine they brought me on board to write features about interesting cultural trends movements on the fringe on the fringe is exactly where wed like to stay cora said you cant identify us in your article all i have are your first names balenger lied even so this is especially important for the professor hes got tenure but that doesnt mean his dean wont try to take it away if the university finds out what hes doing balenger shrugged actually im way ahead of you on that point i have no intention of using your names or specific details of your backgrounds itll add to the supposed danger if i make it sound like youre members of a secret group vinnie leaned forward theres no supposed danger about this some creepers have been seriously injured some have even died if you identify us rick emphasized we can go to jail and pay heavy fines do we have your word that you wont compromise us i guarantee none of you will be damaged because of what i write they glanced at each other uncertain the professor explained to me why he thought the article deserved to be written balenger assured them he and i think the same weve got a throwaway culture people plastic pop bottles principles everythings disposable the nations suffering from memory disorder two hundred years ago impossible to imagine a hundred years ago too hard to think about fifty years ago ancient history a movie made ten years ago is considered old a tv series made five years ago is a classic most books have a threemonth shelf life sports organizations no sooner build stadiums than they blow them up so they can replace them with newer uglier ones the grade school i went to was torn down and replaced by a strip mall our cultures so obsessed with whats new we destroy the past and pretend it never happened i want to write an essay that convinces people the past is important i want to make my readers feel it and smell it and appreciate it the room became quiet balenger heard the clang clang clang outside and the waves crashing on the beach im beginning to like this guy vinnie said balengers muscles relaxed knowing thered be other testshe watched the creepers fill their knapsacks what time are you going in shortly after ten conklin hooked a walkietalkie to his belt the buildings only two blocks away and ive already done the reconnaissance work so we dont have to waste time figuring how to infiltrate why are you smiling i just wonder if you realize how much your vocabulary is like the militarys a specialops mission vinnie clipped a folded knife to the inside of a jeans pocket thats what this is balenger sat on a cigaretteburned chair next to the door and took more notes i found a lot of material on the professors website and the other major ones on the net like how many urbanexplorer groups do you think there are yahoo and google list thousands of sites rick answered australia russia france england here in the us theyre all over the country san francisco seattle minneapolis to urban explorers that citys famous for its maze of utility tunnels known as the labyrinth then theres pittsburgh new york boston detroit buffalo balenger said our old stomping grounds vinnie agreed the groups often flourish in areas with decaying inner cities conklin said buffalo and detroit are typical people flee to the suburbs leaving grand old buildings without occupants hotels offices department stores in many cases the owners simply walk away in lieu of taxes the city assumes ownership but often the bureaucrats cant decide whether to demolish or renovate if were lucky the abandoned buildings get boarded up and preserved in downtown buffalo we sometimes infiltrated places that were built around and abandoned in or even earlier as the world moves on they stay the same damaged yes the decay is inevitable but their essence doesnt change with each structure we infiltrate its as if a time machine takes us back through the decades balenger lowered his pen his look of interest encouraged the professor to continue when i was a child i used to sneak into old buildings conklin explained it was better than staying home and listening to my parents argue once in a boardedup apartment complex i found a stack of phonograph records that were released in the s not longplaying vinyl what used to be called lps with a halfdozen songs on each side im talking about discs made of thick brittle plastic easily breakable with only one song on each side when my parents werent home i enjoyed putting the records on my fathers turntable and playing them again and again scratchy old music that made me imagine the primitive recording studio and the oldfashioned clothes the performers wore for me the past was better than the present if you consider the news these dayselevated threat levels and terrorist attacksit makes a lot of sense to hide in the past when we were undergraduates in a class the professor taught he asked us to go with him to an old department store vinnie said conklin looked amused it involved some risk if any of them had been injured or if the university found out i was encouraging my students to commit a crime i could have been dismissed his pleasure made his face look younger i guess im still marching against the rules wanting to raise hell while im still able the experience was eerie vinnie said the department stores counters were still there and a few pieces of merchandise motheaten sweaters shirts that mice had chewed on old cash registers the building was like a battery that stored the energy of everything that happened inside it then it leaked that energy and i could almost feel longdead shoppers drifting around me maybe you belong in the university of iowas creativewriting department rick kidded him okay okay but each of you knows what i mean cora nodded i felt it too thats why we asked the professor to keep us in mind for other expeditions even after we graduated each year i choose a building that i feel has unusual merit the professor told balenger once we infiltrated an almostforgotten sanitarium in arizona rick said another time we got into a texas prison that was abandoned for fifty years vinnie added cora grinned the next time we snuck onto an abandoned oil rig in the gulf of mexico always excitement so what building did you choose this year professor why did you bring us to asbury park a sad story asbury park was founded in by james bradley a new york manufacturer who named the community after francis asbury the bishop who established methodism in america bradley chose the ocean resorts location because it was convenient to get to from new york to the north and philadelphia to the west methodists established summer homes there attracted by the shaded streets and the grand churches the citys three lakes and numerous parks were ideal places for strolls and family picnics by the early s the milelong boardwalk was the pride of the jersey shore when thousands of vacationers werent lying on the beach or splashing in the water they ate saltwater taffy and visited the copperandglass carousel house or else the palace amusements building where they rode the scooter the twister the tunneloflove boat a merrygoround and a ferris wheel ignoring the methodist foundations of the community many also went to the ornate casino that now occupied the southern end of the boardwalk through the first world war the roaring twenties the depression and most of the second world war asbury park flourished but in symbolizing what was to come a hurricane destroyed much of the area rebuilt the resort strove for its former greatness straining to keep it during the s and almost retaining it during the s when rock concerts filled the boardwalks convention hall walls that had felt the swaying chords of harry james and glenn miller now reverberated with the pounding rhythms of the who jefferson airplane and the rolling stones but in asbury park could no longer resist its decline while rock and roll was a force of the times so were vietnam antiwar protests and race riots the latter stormed through asbury park smashing windows overturning cars looting and setting fires that spread until the flames gutted the community thereafter local families fled the devastation while vacationers migrated to newer spots along the shore in their place came the counterculture hippies musicians bikers thenunknown bruce springsteen often played in local clubs singing about the desperation of the boardwalk and the urge to head down the road in the s and s political instability and realestate bankruptcy doomed efforts to rebuild the community as more residents fled entire blocks became uninhabited the palace amusements building dating back to practically synonymous with asbury park succumbed to the wrecking ball in the decaying boardwalk was deserted as was the famous circuit in which bikers and hotrodders once cruised north on ocean avenue sometimes at sixty miles an hour in the old days they veered west for a block then roared south on kingsley avenue slid east for a block and resumed their race north on ocean no more gone a visitor could stand all day in the middle of ocean avenue and never fear being struck the rubble and ruin resembled the aftermath of a war zone although people claimed to be residents of asbury park it was rare to see any of them in the blight of the beach area where a hundred years earlier a multitude of vacationers frolicked in place of carousel music and childrens giggles a loose piece of sheet metal banged in the wind a clang of doom from an uncompleted tenstory condominium building evidence of the citys dismal renewal effort the project ran out of money like the historic buildings around itthe few that remainedthe development was abandoned clang clang clang balenger watched the professor unfold a map then tap a finger on a section two blocks north the paragon hotel cora asked reading built in conklin said as its name indicates the paragon claimed to be the model of excellence the finest amenities the most painstaking service a marblefloored lobby exquisite porcelain dinnerware goldplated eating utensils a telephone in each room at a time when the only phones would normally have been in the lobby a heated indoor swimming pool when that was a rarity a steam room which wasnt common either an early version of a whirlpool spa a ballroom an art gallery an indoor rollerskating area a primitive airconditioning system based on forced air being blown over ice also a full heating system which was unusual even for the finest beach hotelsafter all their clients were summer visitors wanting to get away from the heat four recently invented gearless electric elevators with pushbutton controls room service was available twentyfour hours a day the elevators plus a system of electric dumbwaiters guaranteed prompt delivery throw in some cocktail waitresses and youve got las vegas vinnie said with a grin balenger tried to blend with the group by looking amused the paragon was designed by its owner morgan carlisle who inherited the family fortune after his wealthy parents died in a fire at sea the professors explanation made vinnies grin dissolve carlisle was only twentytwo eccentric withdrawn given to fits of anger and deep depression but he also showed brilliance in whatever he tried he was a genius constantly verging on a nervous breakdown its ironic that a steamship line was the source of his fortune and yet he had a morbid fear of traveling he was a hemophiliac you see the group peered up from the map the bleeding disease cora asked sometimes called the royal disease because at least ten male descendants of queen victoria were afflicted with it the slightest bump or fall causes almost uncontrollable bleeding right balenger asked thats correct basically its a genetic disorder in which blood fails to clot properly without showing symptoms females pass it on to males often the hemorrhaging isnt external blood seeps into joints and muscles with crippling pain that forces the victim to stay in bed for weeks is there a cure balenger made a note no but there are a few treatments in carlisles youth an experimental procedure involved blood transfusions that temporarily supplied him with clotting agents from normal blood his parents were terrified that an accident might cause him to bleed to death so they kept him under strict control almost a prisoner supervised by the servants he was never allowed outside the family home in manhattan his mother and father loved to travel however and frequently left him alone its been estimated that they stayed away six months every year they returned with photographs paintings and stereoscope images showing him the wonders theyd seen he was so programmed to stay indoors that he developed agoraphobia and couldnt bear the thought of going outside but after his parents died he mustered all his frustration courage and anger and vowed that for the first time in his life hed change locations hed never set foot on the fifth avenue sidewalk outside his home but now he was determined to design a hotel and live in it at a fabulous beyondimagining ocean resort that all manhattan was talking about asbury park the model he used came from one of those stereoscope images his parents brought him a mayan ruin in the jungles of mexico balenger noticed how intense the groups eyes became carlisle decided that if he couldnt see an actual mayan pyramid he would build one for himself the professor continued the structure was seven stories tall the height width and depth of the original pyramid but he didnt slavishly imitate instead he decided that each level would be set back the upper floors getting smaller until only a penthouse stood at the top a modified pyramid shape that anticipated artdeco buildings in the s rick frowned but if he had agoraphobia yes conklin studied rick waiting for him to draw the logical conclusion cora was quicker professor are you telling us that carlisle moved into the hotel lived in the penthouse and never left no you just told me conklin put his hands together pleased one of the elevators was for his private use day or night but mostly at night when the guests were asleep he had a small version of the world at his disposal given the cost of the hotel the enterprise never had a chance of making a profit even the rich would have balked at the prices carlisle would have needed to charge those with moderate means would have stayed away entirely so carlisle made his prices competitive after all the point was to surround himself with life not make a profit balenger asked the logical question how long did he live to the age of ninetytwo the general misconception about hemophiliacs is that theyre weak and sickly and indeed some are but one treatment involves keeping physically active noncontact exercises such as swimming and stationary bicycling are encouraged a muscular torso supports painful joints megadoses of vitamins with iron supplements are recommended to prevent anemia and strengthen the immune system steroids are sometimes used to add muscle mass carlisle pursued all these with a vengeance by all accounts he had an arresting physical presence ninetytwo years old cora marveled a sudden thought struck her but if he was twentytwo in then he lived until add seventy more years it was ricks turn to complete coras thought balenger noticed that even this early in their marriage they shared that trait carlisle was there when the riots and the fires happened the year before he probably watched them from his penthouse windows he must have been terrified terrified is an understatement the professor said carlisle ordered shutters to be installed on the inside of every door and window in the hotel metal shutters he barricaded himself inside balenger lowered his notepad sounding intrigued for more than three decades its been boarded up better than that carlisles reaction to the riots did us a favor the interior shutters worked better than any outside boards would have vandals and storms have destroyed the glass on the windows but in theory nothing got in this is a rare opportunity to explore what may be the most perfectly preserved site well ever find before the hotels destroyed destroyed cora looked puzzled after carlisles death the hotel became the property of the family trust with instructions to preserve it but after the stock market crashed in the trust suffered financial problems asbury park seized the building for unpaid taxes a developer bought the land next week a commercial salvager will come in to strip the hotel of whatevers valuable two weeks after that the paragon has an appointment with a wrecking ball but tonight itll have its first guests in decades us balenger sensed the excitement in the group as they turned on their walkietalkies the crackle of static filled the room conklin pushed a button testing his distorted voice came from each of the other units in sequence rick cora and vinnie did the same making sure that their units could send as well as receive the batteries sound strong cora said and weve got plenty of spares weather rick asked showers toward dawn conklin said no big deal its time vinnie said balenger shoved work gloves trail food water bottles a hard hat an equipment belt a walkietalkie a flashlight and batteries into the final knapsack he noticed the group studying him whats wrong youre really coming with us cora frowned balenger felt pressure behind his ears of course wasnt that the idea we assumed youd back out because crawling around an old building in the middle of the night doesnt appeal to me actually youve got me curious besides the story wont amount to much if im not there to report what you find your editor might not be pleased if you get arrested conklin said is there much chance of that asbury park hasnt seen a security guard in this area in twenty years but theres always a possibility sounds like a slight one balenger shrugged hemingway went to dday with a fractured skull what keeps me from doing a little creeping infiltrating vinnie said exactly balenger picked up the last item on the bed the folded emerson knife was black its handle was grooved the grooves insure a tight grip if the handle gets wet rick told him the clip on the handle attaches the knife to the inside of a pants pocket that way you can find it easily without fumbling in your pocket yeah just like a military expedition youd be surprised how handy a knife can be if your jacket gets caught on something when youre crawling through a narrow opening or when you need to open the seal on a fresh set of batteries and youve got only one hand to do it see the stud on the back of the blade shove your thumb against it the blade swung open as balenger applied leverage with his thumb useful if you need to open the knife onehanded rick said its not a switchblade so in case youre caught its perfectly legal balenger made himself look reassured good to know if we were exploring a wilderness area the professor said wed tell a park ranger where we planned to go wed leave word with our friends and families so theyd know where to look if we failed to contact them at a specified time the same rule applies to urban exploration with the difference that what well be doing is against the law so we need to be circumspect about our intentions ive given a sealed envelope to a colleague who is also my closest friend he suspects what ive been doing but hes never put me on the spot by asking if i fail to phone him at nine tomorrow morning hell open the note learn where weve gone and alert the authorities to search for us weve never had an emergency requiring that to happen but its comforting to know the precautions there and of course we have our cell phones vinnie showed his in an emergency we can always call for help but we keep them turned off conklin said its hard to appreciate the tempo of the past when the modern world intrudes questions several balenger was anxious to get started but they can wait till were inside conklin looked at his former students anything weve neglected to do no in that case vinnie and i will go first the three of you follow five minutes later we dont want to look as if were in a parade walk to the street turn left and proceed two blocks theres a weedchoked lot thats where youll find us sorry to get personal he told balenger but please make sure you empty your bladder before you leave it isnt always convenient to attend to bodily functions after we infiltrate and it violates our principle of not altering the site thats why we carry these the professor put a plastic bottle into balengers knapsack dogs winos and crack addicts urinate in old buildings but not us we dont leave traces pm in the darkness to balengers right the crash of the waves on the beach seemed louder than when hed arrived his heart beat faster the october breeze strengthened blowing sand that stung his face clang clang like a fractured bell the strip of flapping sheet metal whacked harder against a wall in the abandoned building two blocks farther north the sound wore on balengers nerves as he cora and rick surveyed their desolate surroundings cracked sidewalks weeds in ravaged lots a few sagging buildings silhouetted against the night but in the foreground were the seven stories of the paragon hotel in the starry darkness it did resemble a mayan pyramid as balenger approached the hotel seemed to grow the symmetry of its receding levels capped by the penthouse in moonlight it so resembled artdeco buildings from the s that carlisle seemed to have been able to peer into the future balenger turned toward his companions you said the three of you were in professor conklins history class in buffalo do you still keep in touch between your yearly expeditions not as much as we used to rick answered holidays birthdays that sort of thing vinnies in syracuse were in boston stuff gets in the way cora added but in those days we sure were close hell vinnie and cora used to date rick said before she and i got serious wasnt that uncomfortable the three of you hanging out together not really cora answered vinnie and i were never an item we just had fun together why do you suppose the professor chose the three of you i dont understand over the years he must have had plenty of other students to choose from why you i guess i always assumed he just liked us cora said balenger nodded thinking and maybe the professor liked cora in particular liked to look at her invited her thenboyfriends to make her feel comfortable and disguise the interest of an aging man whose wife was dead balenger tensed seeing a figure rise eerily from the weeds it rose straight up and stopped at stomach level as if materializing from the earth he took a moment to realize that the figure was vinnie and that he seemed to levitate from a shadowy opening in the ground over here balenger saw a circular hole a manhole cover next to it vinnie disappeared belowground balenger and cora went next descending a metal ladder bolted to a concrete wall the clang of the sheet metal in the condominium building became fainter the air got cooler with a smell of moisture and must balengers boots sounded on concrete as he reached the bottom the darkness thickened metal scraped as rick came down the ladder and tugged the manhole cover into place it was a mark of his strength that he was able to do so finally the darkness was complete and the outside clang could no longer be heard balenger became conscious of the sound of his breathing he couldnt seem to get enough air as if the darkness were something pressed against his face although the tunnel was cold he sweated he relaxed only slightly when the light on a hard hat gleamed it was above the professors bearded face the hats brim casting a shadow down conklins heavy cheeks a moment later the light on vinnies hat went on then balenger heard rick arrive at the bottom heard the scratch of zippers and cloth as rick and cora took their hard hats from their knapsacks balenger did the same feeling uncomfortable from the weight he put on his head everybody spread out trying not to crowd each other at the same time balenger sensed they wanted to remain close their five headlamps bobbed and veered as they studied a tunnel puddles reflected their lights the citys so eager for urban renewal conklin said all i had to do was hint i was a developer and ask for the charts of storm drains and utility tunnels the clerk even made photocopies for me and this leads to the hotel vinnie asked with a few detours carlisle put in this tunnel arrangement he had a longterm vision and knew that his hotels electrical system was bound to need updating to avoid periodic excavation to get at incoming wires he had these tunnels constructed for ready access to keep animals from chewing the wires everythings bundled in these pipes the tunnels also act as a drainage system in wet weather the area near the beach can get marshy to avoid that carlisle had drainage tile buried around the hotel rain and snowmelt seep into these tunnels and exit under the boardwalk that explains the puddles down here the drainage system is one reason the hotel lasted more than a century while others had their foundations rot they took thick belts from their knapsacks the belts had loops clips and pouches reminding balenger of the utility belts that electricians and carpenters wore he was also reminded of police and military belts walkietalkies flashlights cameras and other equipment were quickly attached to them balenger did the same adjusting the weight around his hips then everyone put on work gloves were wearing petzl cavers headlamps the professor told balenger theyre capable of switching between halogen and led bulbs depending on how much light you need at the extreme the batteries can last two hundred and eighty hours before they need changing thats one thing we dont need to worry about but there are others safety check he told the group vinnie cora and rick pulled small electronic devices from their knapsacks balenger remembered seeing them on the bed earlier unable to identify them his companions pressed buttons and watched dials normal cora said were checking for carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and methane rick told balenger all of them are odorless ive got a slight reading on methane it barely registers regardless the professor said if you feel dizzy sick to your stomach headachy uncoordinated let us know immediately dont wait till you think you might be in trouble by the time symptoms are serious we might be too far into the tunnel to be able to evacuate well check the meters often balenger listened to the echo of their footsteps and breathing in the lead the professor glanced periodically at a diagram the tunnel was only five feet high and forced them to stoop rusted pipes ran along the walls and the ceiling as the group splashed through puddles balenger was thankful for the advice to wear waterproof construction boots smells like the ocean vinnie said were just above the hightide mark conklin explained during the hurricane these tunnels were flooded heres something for your article vinnie told balenger walt whitman was one of the first urban explorers whitman the poet in he was a reporter in brooklyn he wrote about exploring the abandoned atlantic avenue subway tunnel that tunnel was dug in the first of its kind but already seventeen years later it was obsolete in another urban explorer rediscovered the same tunnel which had been blocked off and forgotten for more than a century look out cora yelled are you okay rick held out a hand a rat cora tilted her helmets light up toward a section of pipe in front of them a pinkeyed rat glared and scurried away its long tail sliding along the pipe ive seen so many youd think id have gotten used to them by now cora said looks like it has a friend ahead a second rat joined the first and raced along the pipe now a halfdozen rats scurried now a dozen balenger tasted something bitter if they spend their lives down here theyre blind conklin said theyre not reacting to the lights but to the sounds we make and the scent we give off balenger heard their claws scratching along the pipe the rats vanished into a hole through which an adjoining pipe emerged from the wall on the right a rectangular opening appeared on the left their wavering lights revealed a wide rusted pipe that blocked the lower way we go through here conklin said vinnie cora and rick checked their air meters normal vinnie and cora said rick breathed hard the methanes still borderline the professor kept his light aimed toward the rusted pipe he asked balenger did you take my advice and get a tetanus booster you bet but maybe i should have gotten something for rabies or distemper why is that the rats are back five feet farther along several glared from a pipe the headlamps illuminated the red at the back of their sightless eyes are they checking out the new neighbors rick wondered or figuring how to bite a chunk out of us for dinner very funny cora said that big one looks like he could eat a couple of fingers rick if you want sex in this century okay okay sorry ill get rid of them rick pulled a water pistol from his jacket and stepped toward the rats who remained in place refusing to budge from the pipe heres the deal guys its either my wife or you he frowned for gods sake whats the matter one of them has two tails anothers got three ears some kind of genetic defect from inbreeding get the hell out of here rick squeezed the pistols trigger spraying liquid over them balenger heard several shrieks that tightened his spine as the misshapen rats stampeded into another hole beside a pipe whats in the water pistol vinegar if we get caught it seems a lot more innocent than mace or pepper spray now balenger smelled it his nostrils felt pinched i dont suppose anybody took a photograph conklin said shit vinnie gestured in exasperation i was just standing here not doing anything sorry it wont happen again vinnies camera a compact digital canon was in a case attached to his belt he pulled it out and turned it on pressing the flash button to capture the image of a oneeyed rat poking its head from a hole next to a pipe spiderwebs filled the space above the wide pipe ricks gloved hands brushed them away i dont see any brown recluses balenger knew that rick referred to a hermit species of spider whose bite could be fatal the young man squirmed over the obstacle his legs briefly straddling it hence the description of these kinds of pipes as ball busters his shoes crunched down on the other side where he rose knees bent and aimed his helmets light along the new tunnel everythings fine except for the skeleton what balenger asked of an animal cant tell what kind but its bigger than a rat vinnie climbed over the pipe and crouched next to him that belonged to a cat how do you know the low forehead and the slightly forward shape of the jaw plus the teeth arent big enough to be a dogs one by one the rest of the group squirmed over the pipe their clothes scraping on rust conklin came last balenger noticed that the elderly man breathed with effort his weight making it difficult for him to get over how come you know so much about animal skeletons cora asked vinnie just cat skeletons when i was a kid i happened to dig up one in my backyard you must have been a charming kid digging up your parents yard looking for gold find any an old piece of glass balenger kept staring at the skeleton how do you suppose the cat got in here how did the rats get in here animals find a way the professor said i wonder what killed it couldnt have been starvation not with all the rats around here vinnie said maybe the rats killed it rick said funnier and funnier cora told him well this isnt funny heres another skeleton vinnie pointed and another and another their headlamps flickered over the numerous bones what the hell happened here balenger asked the tunnel became silent except for the sound of their breathing the hurricane cora said what do you mean the professor said the hurricane flooded the tunnels these four cats tried to get away by following this tunnel upward see how it rises but the water caught them anyhow when it finally receded their bodies were blocked by that pipe instead of floating away they sank to the bottom here you think these bones date all the way back to balenger asked why not theres no earth to help them decompose cora if you were still in my class id give you an a the professor put a hand on her shoulder balenger noticed that the hand stayed longer than necessary the new tunnel took them past more pipes and spiderwebs shadows bobbed in the lights a couple of times balenger banged against the ceiling and was grateful for the hard hat he splashed through another puddle despite the water dust irritated his nostrils his cheeks felt grimy everything smelled stale the cramped area seemed to compress the air making it feel thick vinnie cora and rick kept checking their meters isnt there an easier way to get in an echo distorted balengers voice the windows are sealed from the inside with metal shutters remember conklin said but the doors the same thing metal we could try to pry something open i suppose we have a crowbar and ricks strong arms but thered be noise and if a security guard came around the damage might be obvious the tunnel ended a new one opening on the right rick checked his air meter the methanes still borderline anybody feel sick vinnie answered for them no as they turned the corner balenger stiffened confronted by gleaming eyes heat shot through his nervous system the eyes were a foot above the tunnels floor a huge albino cat vinnies camera flashed hissing insanely arching its back the cat whipped its right paw at the lights then charged away disappearing into the darkness balenger frowned noticing that the animals hind legs had something wrong with them their rhythm was grotesque vinnies camera flashed again hey kitty youre going in the wrong direction dinners the other way ive got some rats i want you to meet damned big animal cora got over the shock maybe he stuffed himself on rats seemed to me he could see our lights he must have a way in and out otherwise his optic nerves would have stopped working his hind legs balenger said yeah vinnie showed the group the back screen on his camera the photograph hed taken three back legs two growing out of one hip dear god do you see this sort of thing often balenger asked mutations occasionally in tunnels that havent been used in a long time the professor explained more often we see open sores mange and obvious parasite infestation parasite fleas when you got your tetanus booster did you tell your physician youd be traveling to a thirdworld country and wanted to take antibiotics with you just in case yes but i didnt understand why a precaution against plague plague it sounds like a medieval disease but it still exists in the us southwest areas such as new mexico see it in prairie dogs rabbits and sometimes cats very occasionally a human being contracts it from infected fleas as long as you follow the recommended precautions you neednt worry none of us has ever gotten sick from plague what did you get sick from once i was in a tunnel that had standing water as this one does mosquitos i got west nile fever i recognized the symptoms and went to a doctor early enough not to worry now that its autumn the mosquitoes are dead and weve arrived this is it balenger braced himself focusing his light on a rusted metal door rick pressed down on a lever that formed the doors handle nothing happened he tried again straining but got the same result locked maybe rusted in place professor vinnie asked this is always the moment i dislike the elderly man said until now weve merely been trespassing when we look for ways to infiltrate a building i love it when we find a board thats fallen from a hole in a wall a place to squeeze through nothings been altered nothings been destroyed but now were about to do something more serious breaking and entering assuming we can in fact enter id very much like to see whats inside but i cant encourage any of you to break the law it has to be your choice count me in vinnie said youre sure my life isnt that exciting ill never forgive myself if i miss this chance cora rick in conklin looked at balenger keeping his light away from balengers eyes perhaps you shouldnt continue you have no obligation to us yeah balenger made himself shrug but the hell of it is when i was a kid i always found a way to get into places where i wasnt supposed to go youve got me wondering whats on the other side of that door rick took a crowbar from his knapsack and drove it into a rusted area between the door and the jamb the impact rumbled along the tunnel bracing himself he pulled on the crowbar the door scraped open an inch he tugged the crowbar harder and forced the door open enough for even the professor to squeeze through balenger entered cautiously his light scanning a massive utility room after the smothering space of the tunnel the open area was welcome it felt good to be able to lift his head to straighten his back and neck switches levers dials and gauges occupied the shadowy wall to the right pipes filled the murky ceiling and the remaining walls huge metal cylinders stood in the center balenger assumed they were water heaters the chill area smelled of metal and old concrete carlisle kept updating the infrastructure the professor explained this is from the s aiming his headlamp rick scanned the levers and other devices impressive he certainly was organized everythings so clearly labeled an idiot would know what to do the hot water system is isolated for the different floors so is the airconditioning here are switches for the swimming pool heater pump purge balenger searched behind the boilers a doors over here vinnie crossed the room probably leads into the main part of the hotel hey guys cora yelled they turned their lights swiveling maybe this is one of those venusmars things but thats really going to bother me cora aimed her light toward the open door and the tunnel theyd left if that fivelegged cat gets in here or those rats with two tails vinnie chuckled he and rick shoved the door closed specks of rust dropped from creaky hinges now lets see whats beyond the other door the professor said they crossed the utility room after rick tugged the next door open they stood spellbound their lights revealing something that rippled amazing balenger said after a moment cold humidity drifting over him vinnie flashed another photograph for heavens sake they didnt empty it cora stepped closer the reflection of their lights shimmered across their faces but after all these years wouldnt the water have evaporated rick asked something plopped on balengers hard hat worried about bats he jerked his light toward the ceiling but all he saw were beads of moisture another drop splashed on him as long as the doors seal the area theres no place for the evaporation to go the professor said the waters trapped in here feel how humid the air is dank is more like it balenger said cora shivered cold what they stared at was the hotels swimming pool to their astonishment it still contained water green from algae growing in it and it rippled vinnies camera flashed somethings in the water cora said probably an animal that heard us coming and jumped in to hide conklin said but what kind the algae kept rippling a muskrat perhaps whats the difference between a rat and a muskrat a muskrat is bigger just what i needed to hear rick found a slimy pole on the floor it had a net at the end a pool skimmer i could poke around in the water and see what i catch you mean what drags you in cora said vinnie laughed no im serious cora said this door was closed so is the one on the other side of the pool her light streaked across the scum and indicated the other door so how did that thingwhatever it isget in here lights flashed in all directions searching for another entrance rats can work their way into almost any place the professor said theyre determined and tough enough to chew through concrete blocks and what in gods name is this stuff balenger pointed toward what resembled a white carpet on a wall mold cora said the scummy water rippled again rick let me know when you find the creature from the green lagoon youre leaving ive run into enough rats for one night im a historian not a biologist if i stay here longer ill grow moss while cora rounded the pool vinnie took another picture with an unnerving clatterooops sorry rick dropped the pole everyone followed trying to stay balanced on the slippery tiles they joined cora at a set of swinging doors rick pressed against a rusted metal plate on one of them with the now familiar squeak and scrape the door yielded they entered a cobwebbed corridor in which a door on each side had a tarnished plaque with the word gentlemen engraved on one and ladies on the other farther along was a dusty counter behind which rubber sandals were scattered when people abandon a house they usually take everything with them its their stuff and they want to keep it rick told balenger but when it comes to closing a hospital a factory a department store an office building or a hotel everybodys in charge and nobody is its assumed that somebody else will take care of the final details but it often doesnt happen they passed elevator doors whose metal was rusted stairs led up conklin pointed take a close look at the stairs marble vinnie said then turned toward balenger most places we infiltrate the floors have nails poking through thats why we warned you to wear thicksoled boots at the top they came to another pair of swinging doors looks like mahogany cora said a sturdy wood even so these doors are rotting she indicated a crumbling area at the bottom of each when she pushed at the doors they didnt budge theres no lock rick said puzzled something on the other side must be jamming them he used his knife to pry one of the doors in his direction the doors suddenly flew open with a crash rick hurtled back slamming into balenger knocking him down several things cracked and snapped cascading cora screamed large objects banged around them burying balenger in darkness he felt something blunt and hard jabbing into his chest and stomach a mushy fetid substance weighed against his face heart racing he struggled to free himself he heard rick cursing he heard wood breaking as if it were being thrown against a wall abruptly he saw the light from headlamps and pushed something heavy with rotting fabric off him rick are you all right cora screamed coughing struggling to his feet balenger saw cora yank at a tangle of large objects hauling them off rick vinnies hands were on balenger helping him up are you hurt no balenger felt nauseous from the odor of what had pressed on his face he tried to wipe away the smell but what rick cora pulled him up im okay i just what fell on us balenger demanded furniture conklin said furniture broken tables and chairs sections of sofas an animal made a terrible screeching sound balenger saw a rat scurry from a hole in a decaying sofa a second rat streaked after it a third balengers stomach thrust bile to his mouth somehow all kinds of bangedup shattered furniture got piled against that door conklin said when rick opened it the movement was enough to dislodge everything balenger rubbed his aching chest where what he now realized was a table leg had jammed into him adrenaline shot through him but how did the furniture get broken how did it get thrown there maybe a crew started to do some renovating and was told to quit conklin suggested these old buildings have all kinds of puzzles in that abandoned department store in buffalo we found a halfdozen fully dressed mannequins sitting in a circle of chairs as if having a conversation one of them even had a coffee cup in its hand that was somebodys idea of a practical joke balenger scanned the darkness fine so is this a practical joke is somebody telling us to stay away whatever it is vinnie said it happened a long time ago he showed balenger a broken table leg see this break balenger aimed his headlamp at it the woods old and dirty if this were a fresh break the inside of the leg would be clean conklin smiled you get an a also rick picked up his knife well at least we got the doors open balenger noted coras relief that rick wasnt injured but he also noted the way vinnie looked at cora pained that her affection wasnt directed toward him the young man subdued his emotions and raised his camera its flash made an animal scamper the open doors beckoned past the murky outlines of more broken furniture balenger and the others paused in astonishment now this is what makes the effort worthwhile rick said they stood in the shadows of a vast lobby the ceiling was so high that their lights barely reached it the floor was grimy marble at several pillars there were tangles of battered furniture cracked chairs tables and sofas onceplush upholstery moldering a cleanup crew that was told to stop is still the logical explanation conklin said some pillars were surrounded by rotting velvet divans elaborate crystal chandeliers drooped balenger kept a distance concerned that they would fall vinnie took a photograph of a chandelier but its crystals didnt reflect the cameras flash everything in the lobby was dull and smelled of dust while another acrid hardtoidentify smell hovered cobwebs hung like ragged curtains a mouse scurried from a settee suddenly a panicked bird catapulted from one of the chandeliers balenger flinched how did that get in here vinnie said a cricket screeched rick coughed welcome to wild kingdom or miss havishams memorial chamber in great expectations stay away from animal nests conklin warned believe me i intend to balenger said what im concerned about is the urine smell now balenger recognized the odor again he wiped his face trying to lose the feeling that something mushy and fetid still pressed against his mouth if you get too strong a whiff of the urine theres a risk of hantavirus balenger knew the professor referred to a recently identified flulike virus sometimes found in rodents nests harmless to its animal hosts the disease was potentially fatal to humans not that you need to be paranoid about it from time to time cases turn up in the american west but its rare around here that certainly relieves my mind conklin chuckled perhaps i should change the subject and talk about the lobby as i mentioned morgan carlisle took pains to update the infrastructure of the hotel the professors voice sounded hollow in the huge area but he never changed the design of the interior apart from the damage this is the way the lobby appeared when it was first constructed in periodically the furniture wore out and needed to be replaced of course but the look of it never varied schizoid rick said the exterior anticipates art deco of the s but the furnishings are turn of the century victorian queen victoria died in as the paragon was being built the professor explained although carlisle was american he felt that the world had changed and not for the better this was the style of the new york mansion in which he was raised the exterior symbolized where his parents went and he was not allowed the interior represented the place in which he felt safest yeah schizoid no wonder the hotel had trouble making a profit it must have seemed oldfashioned even when it was built actually it achieved the status of a theme hotel conklin gestured toward their surroundings because the interior remained firmly entrenched in over the years oldfashioned became viewed as historical and then a kind of trip back into time the staff wore uniforms in the style of the turn of the century the porcelain dishes and goldplated eating utensils remained the same as did the menu the music in the ballroom was from that era and the musicians wore period costumes everything was from another time balenger studied the shadows must have been a hell of a shock when a guest went upstairs turned on the tv and saw jack ruby shoot lee harvey oswald or firefights in vietnam or the riots at the democratic convention in chicago but maybe carlisle didnt allow televisions in the rooms reluctantly he did guests didnt want to go that far back in time but by then asbury park was in decline and people had pretty much stopped coming yeah a damned sad story balenger said are all the sites you explore this well preserved dont i wish salvagers and vandals often violate buildings before i get to them the chandelier and the marble plant stands at the entrance for example drug addicts would usually have stolen them long ago the walls would be covered with obscene graffiti its a tribute to carlisles precautions that the hotel survived as completely as it has look at these photographs the group turned toward a wall of framed blackandwhite images each had a tarnished copper plaque under it all the way to each depicted the lobby and showed festive guests but although the lobby remained the same in every image the style and placement of the furniture never varying the clothing styles changed abruptly lapels wider or narrower dresses higher or lower hair longer or shorter like timelapse photography cora wandered across the lobby turning her light this way and that but theres no photograph of the guests in the lobby in when the paragon was built i can imagine them around me moving calmly speaking softly dresses rustle the women carry gloves and parasols the men wouldnt dream of going anywhere without ties and jackets they have pocket watches on chains attached to their vests some have canes others have spats over their shoes to protect them from the sand on the boardwalk as they enter the lobby from outside they take off their homburg hats or maybe theyve allowed themselves to be slightly casual at the seashore and their hats are straw they approach the checkin desk cora did the same meanwhile rick went to the double doors at the entrance inspecting them as you said professor the interior doors are metal he tried to open them without effect proceeding to a window on the right he pushed away rotted curtains only to jerk back when another bird erupted this one from the top of the curtains damned floors covered with bird shit rick grumbled he examined a shutter behind the curtain metal with effort he freed a bolt the shutter was mounted on a rail he tried to push it but wasnt successful you mentioned that vandals smashed the windows rain and snow must have come in through the holes and rusted the rollers in place the good thing is nobody can see our lights and if a security guard happens to pass he wont hear us either conklin said rick pressed an ear against the shutter i cant hear the waves on the beach or the sheet metal clanging in that condo building weve got the place to ourselves but how on earth did the birds get in a bell rang balenger whirled cora stood behind the checkin counter her right hand on a domeshaped bell the brass of which would once have been shiny facing the group she set her hard hat on the counter her red hair glistening in their lights cobwebbed mail slots occupied the wall behind her there were pieces of paper in a few of them welcome to the paragon hotel she said her strong beauty was enhanced by the lights directed at her i trust your stay will be enjoyable there is no finer hotel in the world she reached beneath the counter and took out a wooden box setting it on the counter raising dust but this is our busiest season conventions weddings family vacations i do hope you made reservations mr she looked at the professor conklin robert conklin cora pretended to flip through cards in the box nope sorry doesnt seem to be a reservation for conklin are you positive you contacted us absolutely this is quite irregular our reservation department never makes a mistake and what about you mr magill rick said well there is a reservation for magill but its for a woman only im afraid the noted historian cora magill i assume youve heard of her the best people stay here cora again reached under the counter and this time set down a thick ledger raising more dust she opened it and pretended to read names marilyn monroe arthur miller adlai stephenson grace kelly norman mailer yves montand of course only welltodo people can afford to stay here she picked up a card from next to the bell our rates vary from ten to twenty dollars when twenty dollars was twenty dollars rick laughed actually youre not wrong about some of those guests the professor said marilyn monroe arthur miller and yves montand did stay here monroe and the playwright were having domestic difficulties after miller checked out in a huff montand arrived to console marilyn cole porter stayed here as well so did zelda and f scott fitzgerald pablo picasso the duke and duchess of windsor maria callas aristotle onassis who was having an affair with callas and so on in fact onassis tried to buy the hotel the paragon attracted a lot of famous and powerful people and a few who were infamous and powerful senator joseph mccarthy for example and the gangsters lucky luciano and sam giancana balenger frowned carlisle let gangsters stay here he was fascinated with their lifestyle he ate dinner and played cards with them in fact he allowed carmine danata to keep a permanent suite here a place to roost danata called it when he wasnt working as an enforcer in atlantic city philadelphia jersey city and new york carlisle gave danata permission to have a vault put in behind a wall in his suite it was done in the coldest part of the winter of when the hotel was virtually empty nobody knew about it but if nobody knew about it cora shook her head from side to side this reminds me of whats wrong with citizen kane theres something wrong with citizen kane vinnie asked in disbelief thats impossible its a masterpiece with a big flaw in the opening scene kanes an old man hes dying in bed in his fabulous mansion he has a snow globe in his hand everybody knows that opening vinnie said you and i once watched that movie together on the classics channel you never mentioned anything about a flaw i only realized it after you moved to syracuse kane murmurs rosebud then drops the globe which shatters on the bedroom floor the noise makes a nurse charge through a door all of a sudden the newspapers and the newsreels are filled with the mystery of kanes last word rosebud then a reporter sets out to solve the puzzle yeah so well if the nurse was out of the room and the door was closed and the bedroom was empty except for kane when he died how does anybody know his last word oh vinnie said shit now youve ruined the movie for me the next time you watch it just skip over that part but what does this have to do with professor cora said how could you know about a secret vault in danatas room one that was installed in the winter of when the paragon was deserted conklin smiled you are indeed my student balenger waited for the answer it turns out that carlisle kept a diary not about himself but about the hotel all the interesting events he observed over the decades he was especially fascinated by the suicides and other deaths that occurred here there were three murders for example a man shot his business partner for cheating him a woman poisoned her husband for threatening to leave her for another woman a thirteenyearold boy waited until his father fell asleep and then beat him to death with a baseball bat the father had molested the child for years it took all of carlisles wealth and influence to keep those incidents from being publicized after he died how balenger asked old age heart failure actually he committed suicide the group became still suicide balenger scribbled a note he used a shotgun to blow the top of his head off the group seemed to stop breathing despair because of ill health balenger asked the autopsy report was among the documents i examined conklin said thanks to the strict health regimen and exercise program with which he tried to offset his hemophilia he was remarkably fit for a man of ninetytwo he didnt leave a note no one was able to explain why he killed himself his mind must have been as sharp as his body rick said otherwise he wouldnt have been able to hide his intentions from his servants in his last few years carlisle didnt have any servants what he took care of himself in this huge place all alone cora frowned wandering the halls but if he was alone vinnie sounded puzzled you mean how was he found conklin said for probably the first time in his life he left the hotel in the middle of the night went down to the beach and shot himself there even then asbury park was in such decline it wasnt until noon the next day that someone found him a man with agoraphobia going down to the beach for the first time in his life so he can kill himself balenger shook his head firmly that doesnt make sense the police wondered if hed been murdered the professor said but it had rained earlier in the night the only footprints on the beach were carlisles eerie cora said after his suicide the old mans personal papers were deposited in the carlisle family library which is actually a storage area in the basement of the manhattan building that used to be the family mansion carlisles trust occupied the building until its funds ran out the papers include the diary balenger asked yes when i chose the paragon for this years expedition i did my usual research and discovered the existence of the storage area the man who oversees the trust allowed me to examine the materials he was trying to get various universities to bid on them evidently he thought i had my universitys authority to participate in the auction i was given a day with the papers thats when i discovered the diary you werent just repeating a rumor there really is a vault in danatas suite balenger asked all i can tell you is theres no record of its having been removed hell this is going to be more interesting than usual vinnie rubbed his hands together of course we still have to figure out which suite danata had sixten conklin said according to the diary it has the best view in the hotel not the penthouse because of carlisles agoraphobia he couldnt bear large windows a full view of the ocean would have terrified him but he had other ways of looking when i told you earlier that aristotle onassis wanted to buy the paragon i didnt add that carlisle couldnt have sold it even if hed been tempted without major reconstruction almost tearing the hotel to the ground carlisle would have been publicly embarrassed and probably arrested arrested rick asked in surprise because of his curiosity the building has hidden corridors that allowed him to watch his guests without their knowledge peepholes twoway mirrors balenger wrote hurriedly carlisle was diseased in more ways than his hemophilia he allowed his diary to survive because he believed it served a social purpose he thought of himself as a cross between a sociologist and a historian who else knows about this no one the professor said carlisle left no heirs the man who administers the trust has remarkably little curiosity about his dead client hes a blankfaced bureaucratic type the sort that does nothing but think about retirement when hes in his fifties does his work by rote no expression in his eyes reminds me of my dean at buffalo i hid the diary at the bottom of carlisles papers hell never notice but if a university buys those documents eventually many people will learn what i just told you of course it wont make a difference the hotel will be a vacant lot by then thats why this is the most important building weve ever infiltrated the chance to verify and document the paragons history has all kinds of cultural implications begging to be included in a book one that youll write i hope vinnie said my final project the professor looked pleased cora glanced at her watch then wed better get going the nights flying by balenger tilted his headlamp toward his watch surprised to see that almost an hour had passed from when theyd left the motel like the air in the tunnels time felt compressed cora glanced at the message slots and reached into one of the few that contained something the paper was brittle mmm mr ali karims credit card doesnt seem valid the manager wishes to speak with him well dont be embarrassed mr karim ive had that happen a few times myself putting on her hard hat she joined them in front of the counter too bad the elevators dont work vinnie said weve got a lot of stairs to climb can you do it professor try to keep up with me balenger warily studied dark corners as he and the others crossed the lobby theres the ballroom conklins headlamp indicated open doors to their right an empty oakfloored space beyond can i have this dance cora rick asked gosh my dance cards all filled but the only thing that matters is who i go home with rick glanced into the ballroom smiled and disappeared a moment later an outoftune piano began playing moon river my favorite song cora said to the group a little oldfashioned for someone your age isnt it the professor teased rick and i love watching those old movies henry mancini and johnny mercer wrote songs for the romantic ones dear heart charade moon river in breakfast at tiffanys balenger imagined how vinnie felt about that blank spaces interrupted the notes some of the keys not working the tinny music reverberated in the huge space it put balenger on edge not that rick was pounding away the offkey melody wasnt much louder than their voices someone outside wouldnt be able to hear it all the same it felt like a violation the piano stopped rick showed his sheepish face around the corner couldnt resist sorry im sure if there were any more rats around here you got rid of them vinnie said rick laughed and rejoined the group they reached the grand staircase between magnificent banisters the marble steps rose then divided curving higher toward shadows on the right and left but that wasnt where the group focused its lights instead they stared at swaths of discoloration on the stairs dried water probably from holes in the roof vinnies shoes crunched on shattered glass so covered with grime that the shards didnt glint from the reflection of his headlamp the water flowed all the way down to here look at all the dirt it brought along as we go higher watch your footing the professor warned balenger therell be rotted wood pm they reached the division in the staircase other swaths of discoloration filled the right and left continuations of the steps a lot of water rick said years of it when theres a strong storm it must really pour down be careful the professor said it could still be slippery they ascended the left curve of the stairs probing shadows at the top they found a row of elegant doors with tarnished brass numbers on them murky woodpaneled walls were covered with dust at intervals corridors disappeared into darkness the smell of mold and age was powerful balenger peered down at rotted persian carpeting its intricate pattern faded and flecked with mildew they turned left and followed a balcony every dozen paces a narrow table was positioned against the wall some had vases with desiccated flowers their petals looking as if the slightest touch would make them crumble then the group angled left again and came to more stairs these were made of finely crafted wood but balenger couldnt be sure what kind because of the water damage theyd sustained he peered up vinnie did the same my god the stairs keep following a central open column all the way to the top of the building hard to know for sure but i think i see a glass roof moonlight clouds moving a huge skylight occupies the top of the roofs pyramid conklin said the column rises through the middle of what used to be carlisles living quarters he could walk from room to room and look down at the guests on the stairs and those in the part of the lobby that was visible to him wouldnt the guests have thought his behavior a little weird cora asked the walls of his rooms blocked him people couldnt see him looking down he used peepholes the skylight must be broken thats where the waters coming from thats how the birds got in balenger said abruptly wood creaked under him his heart lurched he grabbed the banister everyone paused i dont feel the stairs moving rick tried to assure him its just normal settling sure balenger wasnt convinced he tested the next step i need more light cora pulled her flashlight from her belt the others drew theirs also the shifting rays gave the shadows vitality making it seem as if guests had just entered their rooms and were closing the doors the water stains became more pronounced as balenger eased higher whats that line william shatner says at the beginning of every star trek episode spacethe final frontier vinnie asked good old captain kirk but as far as im concerned this is the final frontier sometimes when i explore like this i feel like im on mars or someplace discovering things i never thought id see like this cora aimed her flashlight toward the steps above what is it more mold green tendrils projected from debris on the stairs no way its some kind of weed rick said can you imagine during the day there must be just enough sun coming through the skylight to allow it to grow the damned things take root anywhere he looked at balenger we once found dandelions growing from an old carpet near a broken window in a hospital scheduled to be torn down the wood creaked again balenger kept his grip on the banister i still dont feel anything shifting rick said were fine sure right the group reached the fourth level and kept going but the professor hesitated a dark corridor stretched ahead of him he pressed his hand against a wall then leaned against it catching his breath always test a wall before putting weight against it cora warned balenger on one of our expeditions in buffalo rick leaned against one he went right through then part of the ceiling collapsed if he hadnt been wearing a hard hat professor vinnie frowned are you okay the overweight man breathed hard through glasses fogged with exertion he waved away their concerns all these flights of stairs i can tell some of you feel it too balenger raised a hand guilty conklin drew a water bottle from a slot on the side of his knapsack untwisted the cap and drank ill join you balenger said taking a bottle from his knapsack to tell the truth i wish i had some scotch in this by popular demand i dont touch the stuff anymore conklin said cora offered a bag of granola anybody want an hors doeuvre silhouetted by darkness rick and vinnie each took a handfulbalenger heard the crunch of it in their mouths the professor swallowed more water waited and finally put away his bottle okay im ready youre certain absolutely take a little more time vinnie said i wonder what the rooms look like he tested a door pleased when it opened as his lights pierced the gloom he nodded this rooms got a metal shutter too balenger walked cautiously over stale air drifted past him carrying a bitter undercurrent their scanning lights revealed that the room had a standard layout a closet on the right a bathroom on the left and a bedroom area beyond a short corridor cora glanced into the bathroom a marble countertop the dust makes it difficult to tell but those fixtures look as if theyre goldplated conklin said wow there were two small beds each with four posts and a dusty floralpatterned bedspread a victorian sofa table and bureau contrasted with a television set apart from cobwebs grime and peeling wallpaper the room presumably remained as it had looked in or earlier vinnie walked toward the television no coloradjustment knobs its an old blackandwhite the screen has rounded corners and look at this phone the oldfashioned rotary kind ive seen them in movies but despite all the buildings weve explored ive never come across a dial phone until now imagine the eternity it took to make a call that metal shutter rick pointed whats it covering were in the core of the building there must be several rooms between here and the outside theres no point in having a window theres nothing to see actually the professor said carlisle put a window in every room each quadrant of the hotel has an air shaft at one time there were flower gardens shrubs and trees for guests to look down at some rooms next to the shafts even have doors leading onto balconies the shafts end at the fifth level the sixth level and the penthouse dont need them because at the top of the pyramid they have direct views of the outside until carlisle installed the metal shutters cora said was the old man so paranoid that he thought rioters would scale the air shafts the rampage the fires the gutted buildings for him it must have seemed like the end of the world vinnie looked at the professor did he say anything about it in his diary no the diary ends in the year he closed the hotel to guests three years before he died balenger looked around no explanation why he stopped writing it or why he closed the hotel none maybe life stopped being interesting cora said or maybe it was too interesting conklin said from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis from the depression to the threat of nuclear annihilation hed seen the twentieth century get worse and worse what happened that year balenger asked the assassinations of martin luther king and robert kennedy two months apart the group became silent whats on the bed balenger pointed where i dont see anything there balengers lights centered on the first bed and a flat object on the pillows a suitcase why would anybody leave a hotel and not take a suitcase cora wondered maybe somebody couldnt pay the bill and snuck out lets see whats in it vinnie set down his flashlight and pressed two levers one on each side of the suitcases handle locked balenger unclipped his knife from his pocket he opened it and pried at one of the locks no rick insisted we look but dont touch but weve been touching a lot of things dont touch means dont damage dont disturb dont alter this is the equivalent of an archaeological site we dont change the past but then youll never know whats in the suitcase balenger said i suppose there are worse things i wont ever be able to do if i can open it without breaking it do you have a problem not at all but i dont see how you can manage it balenger pulled out his ballpoint pen he unscrewed the top and removed the ink cartridge along with the spring that controlled the tips inandout movement humming to disguise his tension he put the end of the spring into a keyhole in the suitcase he pressed twisted and heard the latch pop free he did the same to the other lock although it took him a little longer handy skill rick said well i once did a story about a master locksmith a guy the police send for when they really need to open something and nobody else can do it he showed me a few easy tricks the next time i lock myself out of my car ill give you a call vinnie said so who wants to do the honors balenger asked cora she rubbed her arms ill pass vinnie how about you youre the first one who tried to open it thanks vinnie said uneasily but since you got it open you should do it okay but remember if this is a monumental discovery it gets named after me balenger lifted the suitcases lid as a bitter smell escaped from the interior five helmet lights and flashlights blazed on the contents no one moved i feel like im going to be sick cora said what am i looking at the suitcase was filled with fur a mummified torso and head paws hands my god is it human vinnie asked a child wrapped in a monkey balenger said i think its a monkey yeah welcome to wild kingdom why would anybody do you think somebody put it in there locked the suitcase and smothered it rick said or maybe it was already dead the professor suggested and somebody was carrying it around for old times sake cora raised her hands this is one of the sickest things ive ever maybe it was a pet and somebody tried to smuggle it into the hotel but it suffocated before the owner could let it out sick cora said sick sick sick if it was such a prized pet why didnt the owner take it out of here and bury it perhaps the owner was overcome with grief balenger said then why lock the suitcase before leaving im afraid i dont have an explanation for that balenger said in my experience all the humaninterest articles ive written people are more crazy than theyre sane well this is crazy all right balenger reached into the suitcase youre going to touch it vinnie said im wearing gloves balenger nudged the carcass which felt disturbingly light the fur scratched along the bottom of the suitcase as he moved it he found a rubber ball with flecks of red paint on it noticing a flap on the inside of the suitcases lid he looked inside heres an envelope the paper was yellow with age he opened it and found a faded blackandwhite photograph that showed a man and woman of around forty they leaned against the railing of a boardwalk it stretched to the right while the ocean extended behind them presumably the boardwalk was asbury parks balenger thought he recognized the shape of the casino at the end the man wore a shortsleeved white shirt squinted from the sun and looked to be in emotional pain the woman wore a frilly dress and smiled desperately each wore a wedding ring they had a monkey between them it held a ball that looked like the one in the suitcase it grinned and reached toward the camera as if the photographer were holding up a banana balenger turned the photograph over theres a filmprocessing date he looked closer atthe envelope something else is in here he removed a yellowed newspaper clipping an obituary august a man named harold bauman aged fortyone died from a brain embolism an exwife named edna survived him ex rick asked balenger used his flashlight to study a name tag on the suitcase edna bauman trenton new jersey he took another look at the photograph they have wedding rings in within a year they divorced and the exhusbandwhats his name harolddied a portrait of despair vinnie said his camera flashed shut the suitcase cora demanded lock it put it back where it was on the pillows we shouldnt have disturbed it lets get out of this room and close the damned door reminds me of what i said back at the motel vinnie lowered his camera some buildings make the past so vivid its like theyre batteries theyve stored the energy of everything that happened in them then they leak that energy like the emotion coming from that suitcase rick cora asked suddenly continuing to rub her arms what do me a favor go into the bathroom the bathroom what on earth for go in there and look in the bathtub make sure theres not another body in here someone who slit her wrists or took pills or rick studied her then touched her hand sure whatever you want balenger watched rick guide his light back the way theyd come to the bathroom the young man went in a silence lengthened broken by the scrape of hooks on a showercurtain rod rick cora asked he remained silent a moment longer nothing he finally answered empty thank god sorry everybody cora said im embarrassed that i let my emotions get carried away when i was a kid i had a cat that disappeared just before my family moved from omaha to buffalo her name was sandy she used to spend most of the day sleeping on my bed the day we moved i looked everywhere for her after several hours my dad said we needed to get in the car and leave we had two days of driving ahead of us and he said we couldnt waste any more timehe had a new job in buffalo and couldnt arrive late he asked the neighbors to look for sandy and let us know if they found her he promised hed pay them to send the cat to us two weeks later when i was unpacking some of my toys i found sandy in a box shed crawled into she was dead you wouldnt believe how dried out her body was she suffocated in what my dad said would have been the hundredandtwentydegree heat that accumulated in the moving van a month later my parents told me they were getting a divorce cora paused when i saw that dead monkey in the suitcase i dont mean to be a i promise i wont get upset again dont worry about it vinnie said my imagination got carried away too i wish i hadnt brought us in here cora smiled always a gentleman outside after everyone left the room vinnie closed the door balenger stood across from the group his headlamp showing vinnie and rick next to each other vinnie was thin with slightly rounded shoulders and pleasant but soft features while rick had an athletes solid build and was outright handsome all things being equal it was easy to see why cora had chosen the latter balenger thought it was also easy to see that vinnie still cared for her that was no doubt one of the reasons he went on expeditions with them as vinnie and the professor looked toward cora rick stroked her shoulder he was clearly bothered about what had happened in the room in the harsh lights his face was stark his eyes now darting toward the door the photograph appears to have been taken on the boardwalk outside ricks voice was tight as he tried to express what troubled him i wonder if the woman came back here to try to revive better memories the likely time for her to do that would have been while her grief was strongest right after her exhusbands death not a couple of years later when she wasnt in as much shock a reasonable assumption the professor said so lets say or at the latest again thats reasonable carlisle died in the suitcase sat on that bed at least four years prior to that professor you said carlisle had peepholes and hidden corridors that allowed him to see what his guests were doing in private he must have known about the suitcase why the hell didnt he do something have it removed i dont know maybe he liked the idea of gradually shutting down the hotel leaving each room the way it was when its final guest checked out wanting every room to have a memento that he could visit what a wacko nutjob vinnie said yeah weve come a long way from calling him a visionary and a genius ricks face remained stark how many other rooms have stories to tell vinnie moved toward a door farther along he tested the knob pushed the door open and stalked into blackness the door banging against the interior wall the noise reverberating the others followed cora reluctantly balenger heard drawers being opened and closed nothing vinnie said his light probing the room the beds made everythings tidy apart from the dust the place looks ready for its next guest nothing in the drawers not even the customary bible hotel toiletries on the bathroom counter but nothing else and nothing in the waste cans towels on a rack next to the shower everything the way it should be except for this vinnie opened the closet doors wider and showed them a burberry raincoat its wide lapels drooping its tan belt dangling back then these things were a status symbol even more than they are now dustin hoffman talks about how much he wants one but cant afford it in kramer vs kramer okay that movies more recent than when the hotel closed but the points the same burberrys were exclusive and damned expensive so why would somebody not take this an oversight the professor suggested weve all forgotten something when were traveling it happens but this isnt a pair of socks or a tshirt this is a very desirable overcoat why didnt the owner phone the hotel and ask a staff member to look for it youve got a point rick looked troubled but im not sure where youre going with it what if carlisle arranged for the owner to be told that the burberry wasnt here what if carlisle made the owner think hed lost it someplace else vinnie suggested after vinnie took a photograph of the coat they left the room on the balcony it was now rick who went to the next door it too wasnt locked he pushed it open for the love of the group followed the room was a mess a pile of used towels on the bathroom floor the wastebasket full the bed unmade sheets rumpled bedspread thrown aside a full ashtray on the nightstand a glass and an empty bottle of whiskey next to it i guess it was the maids day off balenger said the professor read the bottles label black diamond bourbon never heard of it must have gone out of business a long time ago vinnie used a gloved hand to lift a cigarette butt from the ashtray a camel unfiltered remember how people used to smoke all the time how awful hotel rooms smelled well this room isnt a bouquet of roses balenger turned whats your theory professor another room with a story when carlisle stopped accepting guests in he could have made sure the hotel was spotless and sanitized but it looks as if he stopped renting the rooms one at a time and kept each in a kind of suspended state each room retaining a hint of life or death cora said glancing back toward the room where theyd found the suitcase professor are you suggesting that after carlisle closed the hotel he wandered from room to room looking in at scenes hed preserved absorbing himself in the past balenger asked conklin spread his hands maybe to him it wasnt the past maybe the riots and his advanced years caused a nervous breakdown maybe he imagined the hotel was still in its heyday jesus vinnie said he took a photograph and left the room lets see what other surprises he created his light wavering vinnie walked along the balcony reached the next door twisted its knob and pushed with obvious confidence that the door would open but it didnt and its resistance startled him a do not disturb sign hung on it vinnie turned the knob with greater force pressing his shoulder against the door the others arent locked why is this one he rammed against it the door shuddering conklin restrained him you know the rules we dont disturb anything then what was that we did to the door in the tunnel taking a crowbar to it that wasnt disturbing anything vinnie slammed his shoulder against the door again granted conklin said but an argument can be made that the door in the tunnel wasnt part of the time scheme of the site what youre doing is wrong what difference does it make if i smash it theyre going to tear the place down in a couple of weeks i cant allow us to become vandals fine okay vinnie looked at balenger you know something about locks can you get this open balenger studied the lock which had an oldfashioned design with a large slot he unclipped his knife from his pocket assuring the professor dont worry i wont damage anything he opened the blade and tried to slide it past the edge of the door to pry at the bolt theres a lip i cant get past cant you pick the lock i suppose i could get a coat hanger from one of these rooms make a hook out of it and try to no need cora said behind everybody they turned their lights merging on her downstairs when i was behind the checkin counter i noticed keys in the mail slots keys rick chuckled now theres an original idea whats the door number four twentyeight ill go down and get the key are we sure we want to do this conklin asked our objectives were the penthouse and the vault in danatas suite if the unlocked doors have weird things behind them i want to know whats behind a locked one balenger said do we cora asked if we dont rick said then why are we here the professor sighed very well if youre determined but you cant go alone rick thats always been another rule we dont explore anywhere alone then well all go down balenger said the elderly man shook his head from side to side the stairs were too strenuous for me im afraid id take forever to walk down and come back and we dont need any heart attacks vinnie said i seriously doubt theres any risk of that but ill go with rick cora glanced again toward the door to the room that contained the suitcase use your walkietalkies conklin unhooked his from his equipment belt set one to transmit and the other to receive that way i can hear you go down and come back at the same time i can talk to you without pressing buttons all the time and saying over fine rick and cora each unclipped a walkietalkie from a belt im transmit rick said im receive cora said well do the same the professor said vinnie set your walkietalkie to receive ill set mine to transmit rick and cora went to the top of the staircase and started down their headlamps and flashlights making arcs in the gloom balenger heard their footsteps echoing as they descended a distorted version of those sounds came through vinnies walkietalkie were at level three ricks voice reverberated from below while a staticky version came from vinnies walkietalkie the footsteps sounded fainter balenger peered over the balustrade their lights were weak below him level two rick said balenger could barely see or hear them ricks voice crackled one were starting toward the lobby vinnies headlamp moved causing balenger to look in his direction vinnie was inspecting his surroundings hey theres an elevator in this corridor were crossing the lobby ricks voice said while im here maybe i should go into the ballroom and play an encore of moon river please dont cora begged joking besides the professor said into his walkietalkie that music is far too recent for this hotel carlisle would never have allowed it more likely the tune would have been something like on the banks of the wabash or my gal sal did you know theodore dreisers brother wrote both of those vinnie asked were approaching the checkin counter ricks voice said for gods sake cora exclaimed whats wrong conklin blurted into his walkietalkie another rat im so sick of rats balenger heard breathing from vinnies walkietalkie were at the message slots they have keys attached to metal discs with paragon hotel stamped on them almost every mail slot has a key except in four twentyeight what vinnie asked puzzled theres no key for sixten either ricks voice said thats danatas suite conklin said or to three twentyeight five twentyeight and six twentyeight rooms directly above and below this one the professor said wait ricks voice crackled whats the matter i heard something balenger vinnie and the professor listened tensely rick conklin asked something scraped another damned rat coras voice said i think theyre having a convention this is bullshit vinnie said balenger suspected that he was annoyed with himself that he hadnt gone with cora ricks voice said were looking in the office behind the checkin counter vinnie aimed his flashlight at his watch its already near midnight at this rate well never finish before dawn no keys rick said from the walkietalkie but there are several filing cabinets balenger heard a metallic sound from the walkietalkie presumably a cabinet drawer being slid open rick mostly maintenance records staff assignments bills and receipts of payments cora this drawer has a reservation folder its empty theres a folder devoted to which rooms are occupied thats empty too but a lot of other folders are crammed guests who used to come here on a yearly basis any special needs they had any preferences for particular rooms flowers favorite foods the most recent guest in that category stopped coming in the basic tedious details of trying to run a business ricks voice said all the paper that got wasted before computers were invented hell we probably waste just as much paper printing everything out they could be down there forever vinnie said as long as were just standing around why dont we try the next door we should wait till they come back the professor said but vinnie was already turning the knob he pushed this ones unlocked the door swung open balenger watched him stare into the darkness looks like the maid cleaned this one smells damp though vinnie stepped inside and was swallowed the sound was like wet cardboard being torn as vinnie fell his arms shot up his flashlight flipping away he screamed something crashed below him balenger charged toward the open door and dove landing on his stomach at the entrance to the murky room the impact sent his hard hat clattering along the floor its light twisting in sickening angles he grabbed vinnies knapsack where it had caught the edge of a jagged hole in the floor vinnie moaned the splintered boards collapsed as vinnie plummeted balenger tightened his grip on the knapsack the force of vinnies fall dragging him toward the hole cross your arms over your chest balenger shouted tight the knapsack keep the straps from slipping off your shoulders in a frenzy vinnie clamped his arms across his chest balenger felt him trembling felt the force with which vinnie pressed the straps close to him something crashed downward vinnies headlamp pierced the shadows of the room into which hed stepped the floor was a rotted gaping crater the crash had come from a bureau falling through and smashing on the floor below in turn that floor gave way its furniture cascading lower the floor under balengers chest began to buckle his body slipped forward bob get over here grab my legs im sliding in he heard the professors heavy footsteps rushing toward him at once he felt thick fingers squeezing his ankles trying to hold him vinnie squirmed his legs flailing desperate to find something to support his feet another board gave way repeating the dull wet cardboard sound vinnie jerked lower forcing balengers arms into the dark widening hole a damp moldy smell rose stop moving balenger yelled for gods sake keep still gonna fall gonna fall now vinnies headlamp showed a gloomy fourposter bed moving the floor buckled the bed plummeting crashing into the darkness below vinnies struggling weight dragged balenger closer to the widening hole bob hold my ankles harder i feel your hands letting go trying cant help it lie on my legs what my legs lie on them damn it your weight will keep me from sliding in balenger felt a crushing impact on his legs he winced from the pain but at least he was no longer being dragged into the hole the light from the professors headlamp glared past revealing the crater only vinnies head showed meanwhile balengers own head was almost in the hole vinnie listen to me i can get you out of there balenger said god i hope stop squirming youre making things worse stop squirming vinnie told himself trying to calm his frenzy count from one hundred backward why would i just do it concentrate on the numbers one hundred ninetynine ninetyeight do it ninetyseven ninetysix ninetyfive ninetyfour slowly breathing hoarsely vinnie managed to still his body good balenger said his arms aching im going to twist you around so youre looking up at me balenger shifted his arms to the left causing vinnie to turn sideways to him balengers left arm took most of the strain he had to lean farther into the pit in order to give his right arm the leverage to help despite the chill of the hotel sweat trickled down his face thats as far as i can turn you the strain on balengers muscles made him grit his teeth his voice echoed into the pit dont let go vinnie said i promise balenger couldnt hold his grip on the knapsack much longer can you see my left arm yes vinnies voice trembled balenger studied the way vinnie clamped his arms across his chest to keep the knapsack from slipping off his shoulders vinnies right hand was pressed against his left shoulder raise your right hand grab my left arm its just over your shoulder cant vinnie said ill fall balenger struggled to keep his hands from slipping off the knapsack no you wont fall lets do this another way he didnt say try to do it try implied weakness try suggested possible failure every word had to involve a command that left no doubt of a positive outcome keep pressing your right hand against your left shoulder release it just enough to slide it farther up your shoulder toward your neck the straps wont slip off scared vinnie said this is almost over do what i tell you balengers arms were in agony he felt the professors weight on his legs pay attention slide your right hand up your shoulder toward your neck vinnie obeyed do you feel my left arm yes vinnies voice quivered turn your body keep sliding your hand until you grab my arm do it youre almost out of there balenger felt vinnies body turning slowly to the left the strain on his arms was almost unbearable got it vinnie said breathlessly youre doing great youre almost out now im going to shift my left hand up the strap on your knapsack i have to do it slowly so i can keep my grip on it okay vinnies voice sounded terribly dry okay at the same time move your hand down my arm at one point our hands will touch grab onto my wrist wrist youre almost out of there vinnie more sweat dripped from balengers face got it ive got your wrist hang on tight i need to let go of the strap so i can grab your wrist holy mary mother of balenger felt vinnie clutching his left wrist at once balenger released his left hand from the knapsack and grabbed for vinnie for an instant vinnie dropped he moaned then balenger had him although the sudden movement caused vinnie to sway no vinnie said itll stop itll stop balenger said his right hand felt tortured as it continued to grip the knapsack vinnies body again became still hold my wrist as hard as you can balenger said his right hand could no longer bear the strain of the awkward angle that vinnies position forced on it good as hard as you can now raise your left arm not much just enough so i can hook my right hand under it i need to release the knapsack no we can do this vinnie youre almost out on three im going to release my right hand from the knapsack and grab your left arm are you ready i youll soon be up here with me ready its going to happen on three one two three vinnie shouted and gripped balengers wrist with all his might balengers right hand shot from the knapsack and drove under vinnies left arm the effort pivoted vinnie so they faced each other bob balenger yelled can you pull us up the professor tried breathing heavily i no not two of you i dont have the strength vinnie try climbing up my arms cant balenger thought frantically okay well do something else keep it positive he thought his voice was hoarse im going to roll sideways to the right thatll pull up our arms on the left get your elbow over the rim of the hole ill keep rolling sideways while you squirm up ill try vinnie said no balenger said youre going to do it youre getting out of there racked by the effort of holding vinnies weight balenger rolled slowly from his stomach onto his right side his left shoulder threatening to pop from its socket yes vinnie said my elbows over the edge higher balenger gasped get your knee over cant suddenly headlamps and flashlights charged at them holy the voice was ricks he grabbed vinnies arm thank god balenger thought his heart pounding with relief we heard noises from the walkietalkie but we couldnt figure what was happening cora yelled we ran up here as fast as we could she tugged at balenger pulling with the professors help five seconds later vinnie lay on the floor shaking we did it no thats wrong you did it he told balenger we all did balenger said thank you vinnie had trouble speaking thank you everybody he turned his head studying the hole and squirmed farther from it his chest heaved with emotion balenger continued to lie on the floor catching his breath he pulled a water bottle from his knapsack took a long drink and handed it to vinnie my throats so dry i dont know if i can swallow but once vinnie started drinking he couldnt stop water trickling from his mouth he finished the entire bottle never tasted anything so delicious what happened rick shifted carefully toward the hole he gripped coras outstretched hand so hed have support if the hole opened wider he aimed his flashlight into the crater theres a faint light down there my flashlight vinnie said i dropped it every floor collapsed rick said the furnitures in a heap all the way at the bottom smells awfully damp rick stooped and pulled a chunk of wood from the edge of the hole he eased away returning to the group the woods soft and pulpy he raised it to his nose smells like an old basement from rot the professor said the roof must have a leak when it rains or snows water seeps down through this column of rooms after more than thirty years one step from vinnie was all it took to make the supports give way maybe its a good thing we cant get into the locked room cora said its next to this room maybe the floor in there is rotten too still didnt find a key balenger rose to a crouch then stood his arms shoulders and legs ached no key cora said youre a handy guy to have around rick told balenger you know about locks balenger started to say not really but rick continued you have quick reactions the height didnt bother you because i couldnt see the bottom anyway when i was a teenager i did a lot of rockclimbing me too whered you go wyoming the tetons why is he asking so many questions balenger thought does he suspect i havent been telling the truth theyre out of my league the grand in particular scares me no i took a course from a wilderness survival school its in lander near the wind river range sorry everybody vinnie struggled to his feet sorry about what balenger was glad to change the subject you couldnt have known the floor was rotten what i meant is their lights showed a wide dark stain on his jeans all the way from his crotch to his left ankle where hed urinated on himself embarrassed vinnie tried not to look at cora in your place id have done the same the professor said vinnie peered down at the floor speaking of that problem balenger took the empty bottle from his knapsack in all the excitement it almost happened to me if you can bear to be away from me for a while ill find some privacy down that corridor not too far conklin said weve learned a lesson about separating stay close enough so we can see your lights after youre finished maybe wed all better do the same thing rick said balenger picked up his hard hat adjusted the light on it and put it on he walked to the corridor scanned his flashlight along it and proceeded cautiously testing the floor past a tarnished elevator door and a dusty table with a cobwebbed vase on it he stopped in the darkness and holstered his flashlight on his belt in the illumination of his headlamp he unscrewed the bottle and urinated into it he knew that the corridors echo carried the liquid sound he made but he didnt care if the others heard him as he screwed the cap on the bottle he heard faint conversation from around the corner then he heard a slight thump in the opposite direction and aimed his headlamp toward the gloom at the end of the hallway doors stretched along each side the angle of his light created shadows that made the doors seem slightly open he set down the bottle with his left hand and used his right to lower his windbreakers zipper he reached under the fabric and circled his fingers around a heckler kochcaliber pistol in a shoulder holster no keep control balenger warned himself youre letting this damned place get to you stay focused youve been through worse than this he had a sudden sweatproducing memory of a foulsmelling sack tied around his head no dont think about that suppose one of the others sees you holding the gun if they learn youre armed theyll surely wonder what else they dont know about you he waited studying the shadows inhaling through his nose exhaling through his mouth holding each breath for three counts he calmed himself the sound at the end of the hall was not repeated it could have been caused by anythingthe building settling or the wind outside knocking something against a wall around the corner the faint conversation continued nothing to get alarmed about he thought everything okay rick asked from the entrance to the corridor just finishing managing not to seem startled balenger closed his fly you took a while we were worried you might be in trouble enjoying a quiet moment balenger zipped up his windbreaker then picked up the bottle its plastic warm from his urine where do i leave this he asked as he came around the corner seeing the crisscross of headlamps not in here the professor said leave no trace remember in your knapsack rick said he went around the corner heading toward where balenger had been first time for everything balenger made sure the lid was tight and shoved it into his pack from down the hall he heard rick urinating into his bottle well were getting to know each other were talking about whether we should continue cora said im okay honestly vinnie assured them you looked awfully shaken up a minute ago im fine to balenger it seemed that vinnie was determined not to show weakness in front of cora we traveled a long way to get here weve all been looking forward to this not to mention the time and money we put in i wont let you go back because of me but are you able cora asked theres nothing the matter with me vinnie insisted good rick said coming back zipping his knapsack shut i still want to know whats in carlisles penthouse and danatas vault whose turn next conklin asked cora she looked as if she was trying to avoid the awkward moment but was eager to get it finished as she left balenger glanced down at an object on the floor a file folder we found it in the office behind the checkin counter rick said it had an interesting label so we pulled it out thats when we heard shouts from the walkietalkie balenger picked up the file and scanned his flashlight over the label police reports yeah thats an attention getter he flipped through the pages a lot of crimes happen in hotels mostly theft but the guests never know about any of it he said bad for business usually the police keep their investigations discreet this file starts with the most recent incident and cora screamed rick was suddenly in motion charging around the corner balenger racing behind him with vinnie and the professor next to him balenger stared down the corridor zigzagging headlamps showed cora with her back pressed against the wall her jeans half down kleenex was on the floor next to her halffilled bottle she gaped toward the far end of the corridor somethings down there she said rick hurried to get in front of her blocking any threat good man balenger thought in a frenzy she pulled her jeans up buckling them all the while continuing to stare along the corridor see anything conklin asked no balenger said conscious of the gun under his windbreaker yes vinnie said there fierce eyes blazed from the end of the corridor near the floor balenger allowed himself to relax a little another animal the converging lights revealed its head glaring around the corner hell another albino cat rick said it bared its teeth hissing look how it stands its ground vinnie said not afraid of us feral furious that were intruding must weigh twenty pounds rick said from that banquet of rats downstairs when i was a kid i spent summers on my grandmothers farm vinnie said there were a bunch of feral cats in an abandoned barn down the road they ate every mouse rabbit and groundhog for miles the birds got smart and stayed away finally the cats took to killing chickens then they graduated to goats and thanks vinnie conklin said i believe we get the idea what happened to the cats balenger asked as the white animal hissed again a farmer left poisoned meat didnt work the cats were too smart to touch it the guy said he counted at least fifty of them and was glad to jump back in his car and get out of there a neighbors wife claimed they made a try for her infant daughter so finally about ten farmers got permission from the game warden or the sheriff or whoever and went out there with guns i remember the shots lasted all afternoon my grandmother said she heard they killed over a hundred vinnie cora warned well this is just one scram rick shouted he took out his water pistol and sprayed vinegar in the cats direction the liquid didnt come close even so the cat gave a final hiss and disappeared around the corner see it doesnt like us any better then we like it balenger noticed that during the commotion cora put the bottle of urine into her knapsack she shoved the kleenex into a plastic bag sealed it and stuffed that into her knapsack also are you okay rick asked fine she sounded apologetic it surprised me is all maybe we shouldnt go on hey it wasnt anything embarrassment made her stand straighter weve all had jumpy moments in various buildings isnt that some of the point to get an adrenaline rush just because i yell on a roller coaster doesnt mean i dont want to take another ride but it seemed to balenger that she wished they were leaving if thats what you want rick said he sounded reluctant also lets go balenger said midnight like the darkness that seemed to thicken time felt even more compressed balenger noticed vinnie limping slightly had he lied about not being injured then balenger realized that vinnies awkward motion came from the wet feel of his pants they returned to the balcony i dont have the need the professor said but perhaps this is the best time i dont want to delay us later he removed his plastic bottle from his knapsack we know the first three rooms we checked are safe ill use one of those safe if you dont count a dead monkey in a suitcase cora said the room i had in mind is the one with the burberry coat professor vinnie said one of us should go with you just to be extra cautious being cautious is good conklin agreed balenger watched them open the door they tested the floor even though it had supported them earlier their lights went into the darkness balenger put a hand against the balconys wall satisfied that it was sturdy he slid down sitting with his back against it even if he wasnt relaxed the illusion of resting felt good rick and cora slid down next to him they looked as exhausted as he felt well thats what adrenaline does to you he thought eventually it wears you out might as well use the time balenger reached for the file folder hed dropped when cora shouted police reports want some reading material he gave pages to rick and cora keeping the most recent one for himself it was dated august as the professor had explained that was the year the hotel stopped receiving guests balenger expected that the file would be dominated by reports about thefts the most common crime in a hotel but what he read was far more serious an inquiry about a missing person in august one week after a woman named iris mckenzie stayed in the paragon a police detective arrived asking questions about her no one had seen or heard from her after she paid her bill and left the hotel someone who worked for the paragon made detailed handwritten notes about the conversation with the detective iris mckenzie lived in baltimore maryland balenger learned she was thirtythree single a copywriter for an advertising firm that collaborated with big agencies in new york after a summer business trip to manhattan she went to asbury park and spent a weekend in the paragon at least the phone reservation she made indicated that she intended to stay for a weekend arriving friday evening leaving monday morning instead she checked out on saturday morning balenger had a suspicion that she realized how misinformed she wasthat asbury park was no longer the place to go for a peaceful weekend getaway the person who took notes about the detectives inquiries the handwriting seemed masculine indicated that he showed the detective the reservation card and the receipt that iris mckenzie had signed when she paid her bill and checked out early the phone charges to her room showed a am longdistance call to a number the detective identified as belonging to iriss sister in baltimore the detective indicated that the sisters seventeenyearold son answered the phone and told iris that his mother wouldnt be home until dinnertime iris told the boy to tell his mother shed be returning to baltimore that night iris then took a cab to the train station and got a ticket for baltimore but she never arrived at her destination awfully talkative detective balenger thought he volunteered way too much information ask questions dont provide details let the person youre talking to provide the details the hotel had no idea what might have happened to iris after she left the document indicated it then went on to note that a month later a private investigator arrived from baltimore asking the same questions the hotel representative who summarized the inquiries gave the impression that he was keeping a record in order to make sure everyone understood the hotel wasnt at fault balenger felt his pulse quicken with the sudden thought that perhaps carlisle himself had written the document as darkness hovered beyond the balustrade he concentrated on faded ink that was almost purple his flashlights beam went through the brittle yellow paper and cast a shadow of the handwriting onto balengers hand was there a hint of age in the handwriting an imprecise quality in the letters that might have been caused by the arthritic fingers of someone in his late eighties vinnie and the professor returned as conklin put the plastic bottle in his knapsack and zipped it shut balenger asked was carlisles diary handwritten yes why see if this looks familiar balenger handed the report to him the harsh lights made conklin squint through his spectacles the degree of his concentration was obvious yes thats carlisles handwriting let me have a look vinnie said he surveyed the handwriting as if it posed a riddle then he passed the document to rick and cora makes me feel a little closer to him rick said you told us carlisle had a how did you put it an arresting physical presence because of the steroids and the exercise but what was his face like his manner was he attractive or homely charming or overbearing in his prime he was compared to a matinee idol his eyes were the color of aquamarine sparkling charismatic people felt hypnotized by him rick gave the missingperson report back to balenger and indicated a yellowed page from a newspaper ive got one of the murders the thirteenyearold boy who took a baseball bat to his fathers head while he was sleeping hit him twentytwo times really bashed his brains in happened in the boys name was ronald whitaker it turns out his mother was dead and his father sexually abused him for years his teachers and the kids he went to school with described him as quiet and withdrawn moody a common description of sexabuse victims balenger said theyre in shock ashamed afraid they dont know who to trust so they dont dare talk to anybody for fear they might blurt out whats being done to them the abuser usually threatens to do something awfulkill a pet cut off a penis or a nippleif the victim tells anybody whats going on at the same time the abuser tries to make the victim believe that whats happening is the most natural thing in the world eventually some victims feel everybodys an abuser in one way or another that the worlds all about manipulating people and they cant rely on anyone rick pointed at the document in this case the father took ronald to asbury park on the fourth of july weekend a socalled summer treat a child psychiatrist tried for several weeks to get ronald to talk about what happened next eventually the words came out in a torrent how ronalds father accepted money for another man to spend an hour alone with the boy the stranger gave ronald a ball bat and cheap baseball glove as a bribe after the man left the father came back to the room drunk and fell asleep ronald found a use for the baseball bat thirteen years old cora was sickened what happens to someone like him because of his youth he couldnt have been tried in a regular court balenger replied if hed been of age hed have probably been found innocent by reason of temporary insanity but in the case of a minor a judge likely sent him to a juvenile facility where he received psychiatric counseling hed have been released when he was twentyone his court and psychiatric records would have been sealed so that no one could learn about his past and use it against him then it was up to him to try to move ahead with his life but basically that life was ruined cora said theres always hope i guess balenger said always tomorrow you sure know a lot about this rick studied him is he questioning me again balenger wondered i was a reporter on a couple of cases like this this hotel soaked up a lot of pain vinnie said look at this report the aged paper rustled in his hands the woman who owned the suitcase with the dead monkey in it what was the name on the suitcase tag edna bauman cora said yeah its the same edna bauman she committed suicide here what august she took a hot bath and slit her wrists cora your instincts are finely tuned the professor said remember you asked rick to look in the bathtub you were afraid something might be in there cora shuddered almost forty years earlier august twentyseventh rick said when was the date of the obituary for her exhusband august twentysecond balenger answered five days as soon as the funeral was over she came back here to where she and her thenhusband spent their last vacation the previous summer vinnie thought a moment maybe that summer was her last happy memory thats when the photograph of the two of them and the monkey was taken one year later her life was in ruins surrounded by better memories she killed herself yes cora said this hotel soaked up a lot of pain but wouldnt the police or somebody have removed the suitcase with the dead monkey in it rick wondered why did they leave it behind maybe they didnt balenger told him i dont understand maybe carlisle took it before the police arrived later he returned it the group became silent balenger thought heheard the wind outside then realized that the sound came from an upper level the room that has the burberry coat conklin said when i was in there vinnie thought to search the pockets i found this vinnie handed a letter to rick and cora cora read the heading and the date the mayo clinic february dear mr tobin your recent chest x rays indicate that the primary tumor has spread from the upper lobe of your right lung a secondary tumor has appeared on your trachea a new course of aggressive radiation needs to be scheduled at once tobin rick sorted through the pages balenger had given him and found another yellowed newspaper clipping edward tobin philadelphia stockbroker age fortytwo suicide february right after he received that letter february vinnie asked even if he was suicidal winters an odd time to come to the jersey shore not if he intended to walk into the ocean and freeze to death before he drowned rick pointed toward the newspaper article the guy was wearing only a shirt and trousers when his body was found icedover where the tide brought him in again balenger was conscious of the shriek of wind above him odd to have two rooms next to each other both associated with a suicide not if you think about it conklin said thousands and thousands of guests stayed here over the paragons many years a changeover in each unit every few days decades and decades eventually every single room would have been associated with a tragedy heart attacks miscarriages strokes fatal concussions from falls in bathtubs drug overdoses alcoholic rages beatings rape sexual abuse marital and business betrayals financial disasters suicides murders cheery rick said a small version of the world balenger said thats why carlisle was fascinated with his guests a calvinist god watching the damned capable of intervening but choosing not to cora rubbed her arms in distress if were going to finish this tonight wed better keep moving rick gathered the pages theyd been reading he put everything inside the file and zipped it into a slot on the back of his knapsack well need to remember to return it to the file cabinet when we leave the professor said i dont know what the point would be vinnie said this hotel will soon be a pile of rubble but thats a rule rick told him if we break it even once eventually well break others then well merely be vandals right vinnies tone became flat when we leave well put the file back flashing their lights around them they left the balcony and headed up the stairs feels solid cora said but after what happened to vinnie to be safe maybe we should go up in single file that way theres less pressure on the stairs excellent idea the professor was always ready with praise for cora balenger noted keeping a slight distance between each of us would be useful too forming a line they climbed higher through the shadows on occasion the stairs creaked making balenger tense but the wood remained steady and he decided the sound wasnt any different from the normal sounds that old stairs made when someone climbed them the professor gasped as a bird on an upper banister panicked bursting into the air desperate to escape their intrusion it slammed into a wall and swung away in greater panic blinded it circled their lights its wings thrashing at once it veered down the stairs disappearing into the darkness well that certainly got the old heart racing conklin said balenger turned toward him are you sure youre okay professor couldnt be better the stocky man was out of breath again only two more levels to go terrific footsteps echoing they reached level five uh rick jumped away whats wrong cora shouted this rick pointed something brushed the top of my hat they aimed their lights above ricks head for gods sake that looks like roots vinnie said what resembled ropes and strings dangled from the floor of the balcony above them threads seemed attached to them smaller roots ive never seen anything like whats growing up there they reached the continuation of the stairs rick took the lead then cora vinnie balenger and finally the professor whose slow pace made it natural for him to be the last balenger now had a chance to study the skylight it was spacious perhaps forty feet square shaped like the tip of a pyramid large segments of glass were held in place by crisscrossing copper supports their metal green with age but many segments were missing or broken after so many years heavy accumulations of ice and snow had weakened the supports balenger remembered the shattered glass at the bottom of the stairwell yes this is how the birds get in he thought he saw a half moon disappearing behind clouds the wind whistled past the gaps in the skylight the source of one of the sounds hed earlier heard the air got colder somethings wrong he realized the stairs dont go higher were coming to the sixth level there should be another set of stairs leading up to carlisles penthouse on the seventh but there arent any how do we get up to it take a look at that rick aimed his flashlight at the balcony he climbed toward as one the group imitated him their lights revealing the area from which the roots dangled some kind of cora paused in astonishment for the love of is that a tree five feet tall leafless and listing its scraggly trunk and branches cast shadows from their lights but how the hell a bird brought a seed in cora said or the wind did it yes but how did it manage to grow balangers flashlight revealed a shattered urn dirt lay in a pile among the broken pieces the tree grew out of the dirt theres your explanation add a little rain from the broken skylight and it manages to stay alive barely rick said it looks like its trying to feed off the carpet and the wooden floor thats why the roots are so long its desperate to find food the floor will be weak over there conklin paused behind balenger stay away from it ahead rick stepped onto the balcony cora got there next then vinnie balenger left the stairs and looked for a way up to carlisles penthouse he glanced behind him toward where conklin trudged up creak the professor stiffened i feel he exhaled the stairs shifting creak hesitant he took another step upward creak definitely shifting dont move balenger watched the staircase begin to sway i suddenly feel as if im on a boat conklin said crack the staircase swayed more discernibly no try to take my hand rick braced himself at the top of the stairs and reached down cora vinnie his voice was stark grab me from behind so i dont get pulled onto the stairs crack if i reach up conklin said thatll shift my weight and make the staircase as if anticipating his next words the staircase wobbled rick extended his arm farther straining damn it i cant quite crack it sounds like its going to vinnie held rick tighter rick leaned farther down the stairs even if i stretch my arm im not close enough conklins voice trembled crack we cant just let him cora held rick with all her might the rope balenger demanded whos got it i do vinnie said balenger rushed to him unzipped his pack and tugged out the rope it was bundled in a figure eight thin made of twisted strands of blue nylon climbers rope urgent balenger made a loop at one end and tied a slipknot he hurried next to rick his headlamp revealing the professors frightened features im going to throw a loop around you balenger told him behind his spectacles conklins eyes were huge with apprehension raise your arms through the loop balenger ordered adjust the rope so its under your arms crack the professor flinched as the stairs jerked when the ropes under your arms tighten the slipknot make the rope as secure around your chest as possible no reply professor do you understand me crack the stairs swayed out of control no balenger swung the rope above his head and hurled it toward conklin it fell past the heavy mans shoulders he swung the rope again threw it and felt his heart speed as the loop dropped over the professors head catching on his left shoulder reach through it conklin pushed his hands under the loop and enfolded it with his arms under your arms the slipknot tighten it barely able to control his movements the professor obeyed rick cora vinnie grab the rope we need to anchor it this post on the balustrade rick said wrap the e around it might not hold wrap the rope around each of you balenger said lean back hang on theres going to be a hell of a jolt he secured the rope around his chest in a belaying position and braced himself professor try to walk up walk conklin tried to keep his balance on the swaying stairs maybe theyll hold the professor swallowed he took a step upward the stairway collapsed balenger was almost jerked off his feet the noise was overwhelming he felt most of the force through his legs and arms even so the sudden pressure of the rope around his chest took his breath away clutching the rope with his gloves leaning back against the dropping force of the professors weight he groaned his feet slid pull he shouted to rick cora and vinnie the pressure around balengers chest tightened as the others stopped him from going over the edge if not for his windbreaker hed have suffered rope burns struggling to breathe he suddenly felt the professor quit falling the light from a headlamp bobbed below the edge of the fallen staircase balenger stared at the rope where it dug tautly into the remnants of broken wood professor balenger managed to draw a breath no answer for gods sake can you hear me a faint murmur talk to me balenger said are you hurt uh sweat slicked balengers face professor feel suffocated thats the pressure of the rope around your chest cant breathe christ is he having a heart attack balenger wondered take slow shallow breaths slow he emphasized if you hyperventilate youll throw yourself into a panic panics an understatement the rope creaked balenger looked behind him rick cora keep holding the rope vinnie get over here and help me pull him up vinnie hurried next to him and grabbed the section of rope that led to conklin hurt the professor said as the rope shifted upward well soon free your chest not the rope what leg balenger and vinnie strained to raise him conklins headlamp came into view a chin strap securing it then his anguished face appeared paler than before his spectacles were gone without them his eyes looked vulnerable fear made them wide balenger and vinnie pulled him higher the professor gasped stuck on something balenger was conscious of rick and cora behind him pulling on the rope preventing him from being dragged over he heard the effort in their breathing vinnie balengers voice sounded as if hed swallowed sand let go of the rope and tug him onto the balcony vinnie gradually released his grip as soon as the professors weight was fully transferred to balenger vinnie eased toward the edge he grabbed the professors arm and pulled the professor winced but didnt move i see it vinnie said the front of his jackets caught on a board you know what to do the knife thats what you brought it for cut the jacket vinnie seemed to suddenly remember that he had it he unclipped it from the inside of his jeans pocket opened it and sliced at conklins jacket for a brief moment he looked in terror at the abyss into which the stairs had collapsed done he rushed back to balenger and grabbed the rope this time when they pulled the professor moved slowly painfully the elderly man was able to help them bracing his elbows on the edge of the balcony he squirmed his right knee over the edge with an inward shout of triumph balenger moved along the rope grabbed the professor and helped vinnie drag him to safety rick and cora were suddenly with him as well the professor lay on his back gasping as balenger freed the slipknot and pulled the rope from him can you breathe now balenger frantically checked the professors pulse conklins chest heaved as he sucked in air balenger counted a pulse of the equivalent of an athletes heart rate after running several miles for an overweight outofcondition man it was far too high does your chest still hurt better it feels better i can catch my breath oh shit rick said his left leg cora pointed balenger registered the strong smell of copper lowering his gaze toward the professors pantleg he saw that it was soaked with blood all the way from his thigh to his shoe conklin moaned okay everybody listen up balenger said as the professors thigh oozed more blood cora turned away in horror forget what youre feeling do exactly what i tell you balenger ordered rick put a hand to his mouth we dont have time for this balenger said everybody pay attention do what i tell you he unclipped his knife and cut the professors jeans from the groin to the cuff he spread the fabric whos got the firstaid kit conklin squirmed there was a deep fourinchlong gash in his thigh blood spreading from it whos got the firstaid kit balenger repeated vinnie blinked in shock rick i think rick has it get it out now balenger tugged the rope around the professors thigh tying it above the wound whos got the hammer cora forced herself to look at the blood in the headlamps her red hair contrasted harshly with her pale cheeks i do give it to me cora forced herself into motion unholstering the hammer from her equipment belt balenger wedged the handle under the rope and twisted tightening the rope around conklins thigh the blood stopped flowing hold it like that balenger took the pro med kit from rick your water bottle get it out rinse the wound whos got the duct tape i do vinnie came out of his shock get it ready duct tape we use it for covering the sharp edges of pipes so we dont get cut hows it going to just do what i say balenger unzipped the pro meds bag and opened its two compartments about to reach in he frowned at his dirty gloves and replaced them with latex ones from the kit cora your right hands free aim your flashlight toward the kit he pulled out packets of alcohol wipes and ripped them open rick pour water on the wound cora aim your flashlight toward the gash using his jacket sleeve to wipe sweat from his eyes balenger stared at the water rinsing the wound with the bleeding temporarily stopped he saw the jagged flesh the artery hasnt been cut he used an alcohol wipe to clean dirt from the edges then leaned close staring hard at a piece of wood projecting from the wound whos got the leatherman tool i do rick freed the snap on its pouch and handed it over balenger opened it to the pliers mode keep rinsing the wound how are you feeling professor sore is the rope cutting into you yes if thats your only pain youre doing well the rope not only stops the bleeding the lack of circulation numbs the wound but we cant keep it like that too long swallow these balenger tore open two extrastrength tylenol packets and gave him four pills theyre not vicodin but theyre better than nothing conklin shoved them into his mouth rick gave him a drink of water my flashlight i dropped it when the stairs collapsed the professor sounded as if he blamed himself vinnie lost his also we still have three balenger used an alcohol wipe to clean the end of the pliers he smelled the sharp fumes here we go cora keep your light steady balenger inserted the pliers into the gash and gripped the splinter just above where it was embedded into flesh as gently as possible he pulled it out the professor gasped the worst parts almost over balenger tried to assure him keep aiming the flashlight cora more water rick as blood was rinsed away balenger saw another piece of wood smaller almost hidden in the flesh working to steady his hand he probed the pliers into the gash heard the professor moan and tugged out the splinter he stared into the wound searching for other debris then picked up his open knife and cleaned it with an alcohol wipe he inserted the tip and moved it back and forth over the raw flesh feeling for any resistance anything hard within the flesh he exhaled then set down the pliers and the knife that wound needs stitches cora said a lot of them well have to make do with what weve got rinse it again balenger told rick he ripped open four packs of triple antibiotic ointment and squeezed their contents into the wound doing okay professor feel sick i dont doubt it youre on the verge of shock vinnie get over here and kneel beside me good now take off your work gloves and put on gloves from the firstaid kit excellent now squeeze the wound together what squeeze the wound together are you crazy its the only way to do this you need to hold it together while i seal it for gods sake seal it with what the duct tape you have got to be fucking kidding me never mind if you cant do it balenger turned rick get over here put on latex gloves and hold the wound together all right all right all right vinnie said he squeezed the edges of the wound together as ointment and watery blood oozed out the professor screamed i know this is tough balenger told conklin i promise its almost over but first i need to ask you to do something really hard what keep your knee straight while rick lifts your lower leg yes conklin said thats going to be hard he closed his eyes and fought the pain ready the professor nodded rick balenger said as rick lifted conklins leg and vinnie held the wound together balenger peeled duct tape from its roll the silvery strip reflecting the lights he pressed it over the bottom of the wound and began wrapping it around the professors thigh as more of the wound was covered vinnie shifted his hands up still squeezing the edges together the professor sounded as if he was about to weep from the pain balenger kept winding the tape around the wound he put on a second layer then a third a fourth okay rick you can lower the leg the professor shuddered now lets find out if anything leaks cora untwist the rope the group tensed as cora removed the hammers handle from the rope creating slack balenger aimed his flashlight at the duct tape they stared pins and needles the professor said that means the circulations returning throbs hurts god balenger kept staring at the duct tape and silently prayed he watched for blood to leak from the edges and the seams looking okay the tape remained silvery he grabbed the professors wrist and again checked his pulse one hundred and twenty lower than it was not good but not terrible given what the professor had been through still no blood seeped past the duct tape yeah looking okay he pulled his cell phone from his jacket what are you doing conklin asked calling no the professor found the strength to raise his voice dont no choice balenger said you need an ambulance bob a hospital stitches antibiotics treatment for shock maybe an ekg if that duct tape stays on too long youll get gangrene you mustnt call but we cant screw around with this just because i patched you up doesnt mean youre out of danger no conklin said put down the phone but hes right professor cora said we need to get you to a hospital as soon as possible outside what take me outside then call if ambulance attendants find you in here theyll alert the police youll all be arrested who the hell cares about being arrested vinnie said listen to me conklin drew a breath youll spend months in jail the legal bills the fines what happened to me is exactly why the police dont want us doing this theyll make an example of you he shivered vinnie youll lose your teaching job rick and cora no university will hire you if frank makes that call your lives will be ruined he said bob rick frowned whats going on i dont understand the professor said a minute ago balenger called you bob not professor not even robert bob id never dream of calling you that at the motel he introduced himself but after three hours for the life of me i couldnt remember his first name not you though professor just now you called him frank my god the two of you have met before you know each other youre imagining things balenger told him like hell you came in here as an observer and all of a sudden youre running the show you saved two of us from getting killed and acted like it was business as usual clint eastwood crossed with dr kildare who the hell are you i dont know what youre talking about balenger said his stomach churning there isnt time for this we need to get the professor to a hospital get me outside conklin said then phone it took us two and a half hours to go this far because we dawdled if you hurry you can get me outside in a half hour quicker if we use the crowbar to pry the front door open vinnie said no you cant leave a sign that you were in here if the police look around and find a broken door the professor trembled ill never forgive myself if i ruin your lives you need to take me back the way we came inthrough the tunnel but what about your life balenger demanded what if you hemorrhage while were trying to get you out of here illtake that risk this is crazy in your experience does duct tape seal a wound for an acceptable length of time conklin asked balenger didnt answer who the hell are you rick repeated the duct tape the professor said how long if its removed within a couple of hours help me up conklin said what do you think youre doing get me up rick and vinnie can support me i can hobble on my good leg but conklin winced i weigh two hundred and ten pounds itll take forever if you try to carry me calm down balenger said you dont want to have a heart attack on top of everything else why is he trembling cora asked shock we could have been on our way by now conklin said were wasting time balenger studied him bob is this really what you want bob rick said again ive lost my professorship lost your vinnie looked stunned what are you talking about ive been ordered to leave the university by the end of the term what in gods name happened the dean found out what i was doing hes been looking for ways to cut costs especially tenured positions he had the faculty senate terminate me for breaking the law and endangering students no rick said im an old man i dont have much to lose but you three are just starting ill never forgive myself if i ruin your future help me up get me out of here how balenger asked the staircase collapsed what are we supposed to do lower you by rope from balcony to balcony therell be emergency stairs they scanned their lights around over there a corridor rick said keep us together rick vinnie help me up the professor groaned as he was lifted with one arm around rick and the other around vinnie he balanced on his good leg they helped him limp forward balenger headed along the balcony toward the hallway cora hurried next to him past an elevator they flashed their lights at a sign fire exit finally a break balenger said he opened the door and flinched as something rushed past his legs cora shouted something hissed racing toward the balcony almost drawing his pistol balenger heard rick yell its another white cat the place must be lousy with them no conklin said not another he sounds delirious balenger thought the same conklin murmured the same youre not making sense look at its hind legs balenger flashed his light toward the panicked awkwardly fleeing animal so did cora and everyone else the glare of their beams showed it dashing along the balcony toward the grotesque tree growing through the floor but the albino cat was grotesque also three back legs rick whispered its got three back legs just like the cat we saw in the tunnel not just like the professor said weakly mutations of that sort arent common the odds are against it the same cat balenger said the one we saw on level four but thats impossible cora said we closed the door that led from the tunnel into the utility room i know we did i insisted we do it so how did the cat get in maybe the rats chewed holes through the concrete walls like the professor said vinnie suggested maybe balenger said theres no maybe about it vinnie said thats the only way it could have gotten in no balenger said moving toward the balcony theres another way i dont see what someone could have come in after us and left the door open except for the wind shrieking past the holes in the skylight the hotel became deathly silent then the silence was interrupted by another highpitched sound slow but rhythmic beautiful but mournful wait a minute cora said whats that doom balenger thought through the gaps in the skylight the wind carried the distant tolling clang clang clang from the strip of sheet metal flapping in the abandoned condominium building but it didnt obscure the sound below him lyrical terrifyingly evocative a mournful tune that summoned lonely images to his mind in the dark abyss below them someone was whistling moon river jesus cora lurched back from the balcony the others followed the whistling continued echoing upward from the darkness the melody evoked images of dreams and heartbreaks and longing to move on right balenger thought what i wouldnt give to move on right now who rick whispered a security guard vinnie kept his voice low the police cora shut off her headlamp and flashlight if only were that lucky balenger thought vinnie and rick turned off their lights cora extinguished the professors as the gloom tightened around them balengers headlamp and flashlight were the only illumination shut your lights off rick whispered urgently maybe whoever it is doesnt know were up here but balenger left them on at normal volume his voice was forceful compared to their whispers a policeman wouldnt be strolling around whistling in the dark and whoever it is definitely knows were up here thats the tune you played on the piano oh ricks voice dropped with unease then who the professor asked his weakness made his voice low all of you change the batteries in your flashlights your headlamps will last quite a while but the flashlights are fading we need to be ready for what just do what i tell you with the beam from his flashlight narrowing to yellow instead of white balenger took fresh batteries from his knapsack unscrewed the end of his flashlight and exchanged the old batteries with the new ones the light blazed again he moved to toss the old batteries into a corner no the professors voice was feeble we dont leave our trash with a sigh of impatience balenger shoved the old batteries into his knapsack the whistling drifted to a stop now the only sound was the shriek of the wind through the gaps in the skylight and the distant clang clang clang of the flapping sheet metal whoevers down there knows were here and took pains to tell us balenger thought itll look strange if we dont react time to find out what were dealing with hey he yelled down the echo of his voice dwindled into silence we work for jersey city salvage the company thats stripping this place next week balenger shouted a security guards with us weve got every right to be here which is more than i can say for you well give you a chance to leave before we call the police again the echo dwindled into silence okay you made your choice a mans voice yelled from below working at night we work when the boss says day or night doesnt make a difference its pretty much always dark in here anyhow must be nice to get the overtime only one voice balenger felt encouraged look im not interested in a conversation im telling you to leave this place isnt safe yeah what happened to the staircase sure proves that leave naw we like it here you might say were at home in the dark we balenger thought you bet a second voice said we love it andwhat was all that screaming a minute ago the first voice shouted sounded like somebody got a halloween screw balenger stared down toward the darkness he heard footsteps scraping but he didnt see any lights he spun toward the group cora call hes right professor vinnie said helping to hold conklinup i dontcare if anybodys life gets ruined because of the police balenger said at this point i just want to make sure you get to have a life you really think rick started to ask cora balenger repeated make the call she already had her phone out and was pressing numbers surrounded by shadows the group watched her a recording cora frowned a damned recording what balenger took the phone hey the first voice yelled from below if youre trying to phone youre in for a big surprise balenger pressed the phone against his ear a recording said due to an unusual amount of calls all our emergency dispatchers are busy please wait and the next available person will speak with you i guess you dont live around here the voice shouted otherwise youd know it was on tv the local got a new telephone system its all messed up nobody can get through wont be fixed till monday maybe later the message repeated itself due to an unusual amount of calls now the regular police lines jammed all the time the second voice yelled takes thirty minutes to get an answer progress another voice added everythings new and fancy and so damned complicated i cant figure how anything works three of them balenger thought when it does work the second voice said back when this old place was in business they knew how to make things dependable built to last the first voice said hey why dont you tell us more about those gold knives and forks we heard you talking about balenger gave the phone back to cora everybody pack your stuff the leatherman the duct tape the rope the hammer the pro med kit we might need all of it he folded his knife and clipped it inside a pocket got everything lets go where the professor wavered in pain supported between vinnie and rick the only place we can go down one things sure we cant stay put passive is dangerous passive means we lose balenger led the way he returned to the corridor and paused at the fire exit door hed opened scanning his lights down a narrow cobwebbed stairway as everybody joined him he tugged down the zipper on his windbreaker reached inside and pulled out the pistol oh christ a gun cora said rick stared at him with deep hostility who are you your guardian angel balenger said now keep quiet walk as softly as you can dont let them know where you are for now the only lights we need are mine hey the first voice yelled from below i asked you to tell us more about those gold knives and forks balenger eased down the narrow stairs he tested each board fearful that the steps would collapse cora came next then vinnie and rick edging down sideways supporting the professor their shoes thumped their jackets scraped against the walls the combined sound of everyones breathing was amplified in the stairwell balenger reached a closed door at a landing presumably the entrance to the fifth level was anyone hiding behind it would someone step out after they passed feeling dizzy as if he dropped from a great height he shut off his flashlight and holstered it then he took off his hard hat and held it away from him at head level with the light angled toward the door he stepped back pressed himself against the wall tucked the gun under his belt and used his free hand to open the door a crack then he drew the gun and used its barrel to nudge the door the rest of the way open all anybody would see was the light someone on the other side would attack it thinking it was above his head when actually it was away from him nothing happened balengers palms were moist his stomach felt hot he peered beyond the door seeing a deserted hallway nothing appeared wrong or out of place with a nod of momentary relief he put on his hard hat then followed the downward continuation of the stairs they seemed darker and narrower more smothering behind him the professor groaned his good leg barely holding his weight as vinnie and rick eased him down the steps too loud balenger thought hes making too much noise then he heard other noises the footfalls of one or more people climbing the stairwell ssshh he told the others halting he strained to listen yes someone was climbing toward them but he didnt see any lights which meant that whoever made the sounds was still far below it also meant that his own headlamp was for the moment not visible he saw another door ten steps below him partly open suddenly he realized that this was the door to the fourth level where vinnie had fallen through the rotted section and where theyd seen the white cat for the second time the partly open door was how the cat had gotten onto that level balenger crept down the ten steps opened the door all the way and waited tensely for the others to follow him into a hallway the moment the group entered he shut the door and guided everyone around the hallways corner hiding them on the balcony when he extinguished his headlamp nearly absolute darkness enveloped them the exception came from the skylight three levels higher faint moonlight filtering past swiftly passing clouds dont move he whispered he concealed most of his body behind the balconys corner while he aimed along the hallway toward the unseen door moments passed as time lengthened his mouth became dry as if someone had rubbed a towel around his tongue the roof of his mouth and the inside of his cheeks the heat in his stomach spread he heard wary footsteps then the rustle of cloth he saw faint lights beyond the bottom of the door now the creak of wood was replaced by the scrape of hinges the door came open as lights probed the hallway balenger ducked fully behind the balconys corner think theyre in there the first voice whispered dont see any sign of em the second voice said im telling you theyre still above us the third voice said then what are we waiting for its party time the footsteps crept higher the lights dimmed then disappeared balenger peered around the corner theyd left the door open from this angle he could see their receding lights as soon as he estimated that the three were far enough away he would take a position on the stairs aiming upward providing cover while vinnie rick and cora got the professor down the rest of the stairway into the tunnel and out of the building were almost finished he told himself close it was awfully close but in a half hour thisll be over now not even the slightest reflection from the lights was visible time to get going he raised his hand to turn on the headlamp then stiffened the heat in his stomach was replaced by a surge of ice shooting along his veins almost paralyzing him a floorboard made a noise in the darkness not from behind him not from the group or from his own movement the sound came from the floor in front of him he realized that they hadnt all gone up the stairs someone was standing in the darkness before him alarms jangled in his mind he remembered that he hadnt seen lights when hed peered over the balustrade and shouted down to the whistler at home in the dark we like it here the voice had said what did that mean again weight shifted on the floor balenger aimed at the sound abruptly a hard object crashed down on his gun hand the unexpected impact shocked him the pain making him groan the gun was twisted from his hand something drove into his stomach doubling him over breath rushing from his lungs his feet were kicked from under him as he landed hard on the side of his head a shoe rammed into his side he rolled in the darkness crashing against a wall i got him a voice yelled who said that cora called and i got something else a gun balenger heard the slide being racked someone making sure a round was in the firing chamber damn it they know how to handle firearms frank the professor managed to say what happened he sounded helpless in the gloom are you hurt footsteps rumbled down the stairs two people charged onto the balcony but as balenger peered up through painblurred eyes he didnt see any lights have i gone blind he wondered friggin smart a voice said i told you it would work youre ahead of me a third voice said let me give him a kick to catch up as soon as we know whos who and whats what why cant i see their lights balenger thought frantically what happened to my head at home in the dark we like it here what do you want rick shouted for you to shut up the first voice said balenger heard a groan someone struck the floor hard was it rick you wont let me hit anybody the third voice said but you go ahead and whack the shit out of them okay okay the next one who doesnt listen you get to play catchup balengers head ached he had the confused sense he was spinning in the darkness uh cora shouted somebody touched me only us ghosts i want all of you on the floor a voice said you heard him on the floor vinnie groaned and fell then the professor wailing in pain as he landed no one there to hold him up take off your knapsacks the first voice ordered stop touching me cora yelled do what youre told balenger heard the rustle of knapsacks being removed you too hero the first voice said a metal object tapped balengers shoulder moving as quickly as his injured stomach and side would allow he slipped off his knapsack lets see what we got a voice said balenger heard zippers being opened objects dumped on the floor rope duct tape a crowbar a leatherman tool equipment belts a hammer walkietalkies hard hats headlamps flashlights tons of batteries i have no idea what these meters are for hell a person could open a hardware store with all this stuff the third voice said a firstaid kit candles matches look candy bars the second voice sounded excited look he said look balenger began to understand he heard a wrapper being torn open a bar being chewed noisily water bottles but whats in these other bottles balenger heard a lid being unscrewed smells like piss these dummies are carrying piss around in bottles in their knapsacks found another gun the third voice said what kind of this things not real its a damned water pistol balenger heard someone sniffing vinegar the third voice asked is that what youve got in here thats as stupid as carrying around piss piss and vinegar the first voice said knives got plenty of knives balenger felt a hand at his jeans before he could resist his knife was unclipped from his pants pocket his spare pistol magazine was yanked from a pouch on his belt yeah a hardware store the first voice said or a knifeandgun store hands pawed and poked him searching found a cell phone me too theyve all got one stop touching me cora said hey we gotta make sure you dont have weapons in my underwear leave her alone rick suddenly groaned oh jesus my nose i think you broke my nose that was the idea the third voice said anybody else got something to complain about except for the shriek of the wind far above them the landing became silent finally a little cooperation the first voice said okay everybody put your arms out in front of you balenger heard a few hesitant movements hey dont make me say it again the movements became rapid balenger put his hands out his right one hurt where it had been struck but at least nothing seemed broken now press your wrists together the first voice said balenger knew what was coming hed suffered through an ordeal like this before except that the darkness had come from a sack tied around his head he still had nightmares about it he wanted to scream to fight but he was powerless sweat soaking his clothes he struggled not to hyperventilate footsteps approached he strained not to wince anticipating a blow to his head instead he felt duct tape on his wrists heard the sticky sound of a strip being pulled off a coll the tape got tighter and tighter thatll hold you for a while the second voice said the footsteps went away what are you doing cora said in alarm shut up and keep still or ill shove my hand in your pants again the only sounds became coras harsh breathing and the unpeeling of duct tape whos next how about buddy boy with the broken nose the tape made a repeated tearing sound now you pal balenger didnt know whether that referred to vinnie or the professor hey this old guy passed out the second voice said from the pain when he fell and his leg hit the floor balenger thought his fury helped distract him from his increasing fear the terrible suffocating impression that he again had a sack tied around his head banged up as he is he cant hurt us the third voice said tape his wrists together anyway the professor moaned good the first voice said now lets have some light balenger felt air move against his face a hand reached for his headlamp its sudden beam made him squint he found himself looking at a large belt buckle a piece of pipe was tucked under the belt must be what he hit my arm with balenger thought dirty black pants a grimy denim overcoat except for the professors the other headlamps came on beams zigzagged across the balcony revealing three young men as balenger raised his eyes toward the one before him he heard cora gasp then he saw what made her do so and felt as if an icy needle touched the back of his neck the men wore nightvision goggles making them resemble characters in a sciencefiction thriller bulky binoculars that seemed to grow from their faces at home in the dark we like it here look candy bars surprised the first man asked balenger was surprised but by something else the first man was tall and muscular a build that reinforced his cyber appearance his scalp was shaved it and his face and the portion of his neck that showed above the overcoat were red blue purple and green with tattoos a swirl of unrecognizable forms what are you staring at the first man asked the goggles balenger lied yeah clever huh i hear ten years ago they cost a fortune and the army kept control of them now you can buy them cheap in any militarysurplus store you can use them to hunt bambi or spy on your neighbors the second man said balenger swung his gaze to his left and saw a slightly less muscular guy in dirty dark clothes taking off goggles his left cheek was covered by the whorls of a burn scar almost as white as the fivelegged albino cat this young manaround twenty balenger estimated had his scalp shaved also but no tattoos all things are revealed the third man said removing his goggles they left red marks around his eyes standing between rick and the professor he was well built and yet seemed almost skinny compared to his companions he was also shorter than the others who seemed to be over six feet unlike the others his scalp showed hair a close militarystyle cut lets own the night kind of cool makes everything look green the first guys swirling tattoos extended almost to his eyelids reminds me of that song he started humming its not easy being green those were the days the third guy said watching sesame street not a care in the world when the fuck did you ever watch sesame street theyre talking so fast are they high on drugs balenger wondered he fought to control his trembling muscles like the last time he thought if i let fear get the better of me im done passive means i lose time to get acquainted the first man announced so our new friends here can try to bond with us the way it happens in what do they call it the sweden syndrome isnt that what they call it he asked balenger on the floor the stockholm syndrome balenger told him the first guy kicked his left leg balenger clutched it groaning who the fuck asked you the first guy said im sure they called it the sweden syndrome in that kevin spacey movie we watched the other night the negotiator the second guy said was that the title all i remember is the hostages kept trying to make pals with their captor or maybe it was another movie that had the sweden syndrome in it it is the sweden syndrome right right balenger said sure it is so lets get acquainted my names tod and this is mack said the man with the burn scar on his cheek call me jd the younger man said the one with the military haircut he looked to be about eighteen and you are tod asked balenger frank tod looked demandingly at the others vinnie rick ricks broken nose made him sound like he had a terrible head cold whats your name sweets mack asked cora he rubbed the top of his shaved head as if it gave him erotic pleasure cora cute name and the old guy jd asked bob his name is bob balenger looked with pity at the halfconscious professor duct tape wrapped around his bare leg his blood crusting pleased to meet you were so glad you could join our party any questions nobody said anything come on im sure youve got questions this is the time ask me anything i dont bite mack and jd snickered frank tod said ask me a question you watched us go down the manhole yep weve been trying to figure how to get into this building the damned metal doors and shutters wont budge the walls are so strong wed make so much noise chopping through even people who normally mind their business would notice the next thing theyd find any hole we made theyd break in and steal stuff before we could or that guy who comes around would notice jd said of the three his was the only face that didnt give balenger chills guy vinnie asked aha see the atmospheres thawing weve got another question yeah a guy tod said his tattoos rippling two different nights he came by mack said taking his gaze from cora what was he doing balenger asked keep them talking he thought as long as theyre talking theyre not hurting us just walked around the building checked the walls and the possible entrances we used our goggles to watch from the weeds down the street he seemed to be making sure everything was buttoned up maybe hes a security guard in the beach area of asbury park mack said dont make me laugh but he wasnt like us jd said this guy had a suit and tie overcoat straight as can be then maybe he works for the salvage company balenger said that stupid story was true in a week this place gets stripped then the wrecking ball finishes it off guess you showed us how to get in here just in time any more questions nows your chance questions questions balenger indicated the professor can i go over and check him no what could you do for him anyhow well for starters if he was having a heart attack i could give him cpr blow in his mouth and all that yes youre a braver man than me at least i could make him comfortable hes lying on his hurt leg turn him on his back you think thats the thing to do balenger didnt reply hell if thats all youre worried about jd went over and rolled the professor onto his back the professor moaned the movement having roused him he slowly shook his head from side to side he opened his eyes and squinted at the three men focusing his perceptions terrified see that took care of the problem mack said questions questions tod said no fine you had your chance now its my turn heres my question are you ready its a tough one are you sure youre all ready silence how are we going to decide which one of you to kill am balenger stared at tods watch trying to disassociate to distance himself from his emotions it was an athletes watch the kind with several dials black rubber coated the case tilting his head he was able to see that the time was a little after one his heart pounded so fiercely it seemed to fill his chest whos it gonna be tod asked anybody want to volunteer no then i guess its up to jd to decide tough choice jd said lets see now eenie meenie moe jd yanked rick to his feet jammed a hand behind his neck clutched the back of ricks belt and rushed him toward the balustrade no cora screamed rick wailed just as he was about to fly over the railing jd pulled back hard on ricks belt spun him and threw him onto the floor coras ducttaped hands were raised to her mouth in terror ricks face was ashen his chest kept heaving as he hyperventilated did that get everybodys attention mack asked the alternating heat and cold in balengers stomach made him nauseous if we give you a few simple instructions do you think you can follow them without making trouble jd asked rick nodded weakly blood dripping from his nose onto his windbreaker then heres the drill tod said all of you are going to come slowly to your feet no quick moves nothing to make us think youre attacking us unable to use their hands to push themselves off the floor they shifted to their knees wobbled raised one foot then the other and stood balenger felt dizzy as blood rushed from his head his stomach side leg and forearm ached you kept talking about a vault mack said according to you a gangster put it in jd said only three reasons to do that money guns or drugs sixten mack rubbed his bald head we heard you say that was the number of the gangsters room move were gonna check it out balenger nodded toward the professor on the floor we need to help him up the stairs no tod said hes not going anywhere jd opened a knife yeah hes the weak link hes the guy we kill to keep your attention wait balenger said his muscles cramping the professor did all kinds of research hes an expert about this hotel he can help you get into the vault tod mack and jd exchanged looks what makes you so sure he can do that mack asked because thats why he asked me to join the group rick cora and vinnie straightened youre not a reporter rick said glaring balenger shrugged i once watched all the presidents men you son of a bitch cora said the professor lost his teaching job he got to keep his pension but not his health insurance as you saw he has heart problems but theres no way his pension will pay for the treatment he needs hes desperate so he asked me to join the group and learn how to get into the hotel and watch how the vault was opened later i was supposed to return on my own follow the route we took go back to the vault and grab whats in there and what exactlys in there mack stepped close if the professors information is correct balenger hesitated gold coins gold the professors been teaching me a lot about history in particular about gold coins in the united states ten and twentydollar gold pieces designed by let me think a second augustus saintgaudens vinnie said yeah thats the name the tendollar gold coins were called eagles the twentydollar coins were called double eagles until the depression people used them as currency but then black friday happened what the hell was black friday tod asked the great stock market collapse of cora answered balengers heart pounded less frantically thats right keep them talking he thought get to the point mack rubbed the burn scar on his cheek in the early s cora told him the american economy was in such trouble the government feared it would collapse to keep the value of the dollar fluid the government went off the gold standard speak english sweets prior to the depression the value of a dollar was linked to the value of the gold that the us treasury had in its reserves she said in theory you could go to a bank put down thirtyfive dollars and ask for the equivalent in gold one ounce of it but during the depression the government wanted to say that the dollar was worth whatever the government decided it was worth regardless of how much gold the government owned so we went off the gold standard that meant gold could no longer be used as currency under the gold reserve act of it became illegal for private citizens to own gold bars or gold coins except for jewelry all gold had to be surrendered to the treasury the government stole the gold jd said people who turned in the coins and the bars got receipts that they could apply to their bank accounts vinnie said since then the only way an american can own a gold coin is by treating it as a historical collectors piece you can look at it you can hold it in your hand you can buy and sell it at a rarecoin store but you cant buy a tank of gasoline with it certainly these days the face value of a twentydollar gold coin wont buy a tank of gas balenger said keep the conversation going he thought what about the gangster tod fingered the piece of pipe stuck under his belt carmine danata was a mobster in the roaring twenties balenger said one of his trademarks was giving gold coins to his favorite hookers when the depression hit he was sure the government was cheating everybody by confiscating the gold coins and gold bars so he never surrendered his coins instead he started hoarding them finally he had so many hiding places he couldnt keep track of them all thats when he had the vault put into his suite in youre saying the gold coins are still in there macks eyes sparkled danata died in a gang shootout in brooklyn in balenger answered the suite was rented only to him he paid for it yearround his roosting place he called it after his death the hotels owner carlisle we heard you talking about him a nutjob with more money than he deserved he never rented the suite to anyone else balenger said from to when the hotel closed and carlisle lived here alone it remained unoccupied carlisle had a thing about spying on people about living his life through their lives the professor suspected that carlisle preserved the room the way it was when danata was alive the theory is that carlisle enjoyed the idea of having a secret stash of gold coins in the vault of looking at them when no one else could theyre supposed to be beautiful a soaring eagle on one side lady liberty carrying a torch on the other the sick fuck didnt try to smuggle them out of the country and turn them into cash mack asked he had agoraphobia he was afraid to leave the hotel another country would have been like another planet to him why try to turn the coins into cash you dont need when you can have the pleasure of owning more gold coins than any private citizen has looked at since tonight when we explored some of the rooms we discovered carlisle was obsessed with preserving them the waythey looked when the lastguests checked out maybe he started doing that as early as when danata was killed whats gold worth these days over five hundred dollars an ounce so we could melt the coins down and that would cost you a double eagle less than an ounce of gold is worth more than seven hundred dollars on the collectors market jesus but listen to this balenger continued the double eagle was minted just before the us government went off the gold standard before the coins could be released they were declared illegal and had to be destroyed most of them several were stolen recently one of the stolen coins was found by the government and put up for auction at sothebys the winning bid was almost seven million dollars seven million dollars the theory is danata got his hands on five of the coins tods eyes reflected the headlamps he gestured for everybody to move i cant wait to see this vault help me with the professor balenger told vinnie vinnie glared furious at him for lying nonetheless the threat and his affection for the professor made him come over it quickly became clear how their taped wrists limited them by process of trial and error they discovered that the only way they could lift the professor was by shoving their hands under his arms because his wrists were taped also he couldnt help with effort they raised him conklin moaned but managed to steady himself on his good leg how bad do you feel balenger asked im still alive the professor drew a pained breath hey under the circumstances im not about to complain is it true vinnie demanded you and this guy were going to take the gold coins im not perfect conklin said thats something you have to realize about your teachers but as i listened to all of you explain about the gold reserve act of saintgaudens vinnie you actually remember saintgaudens and you were going to split the money just the two of you the elderly man looked ashamed would you have agreed to be part of it all along weve insisted on taking nothing but photographs now we wouldnt just have broken that rule wed have been committing a serious crime would you have risked going to prison for the rest of your life or would you have told the authorities but you were ready to risk prison at the moment i dont have a lot to lose mack and jd shoved the equipment into the knapsacks cramming in so much that they needed only three knapsacks instead of five the urine bottles were all they left behind mack put the water pistol in his belt its been a while since i had a toy he picked up one of the knapsacks jd the second tod the third their nightvision goggles hung around their necks the way this works tod said adjusting the knapsack straps with one hand while holding balengers pistol is i go up first moving backward aiming at you mack and jd come after you but they keep a distance that way you cant bump against them and try to push them down the stairs if you try anything mack and jd will drop flat on the stairs then ill start shooting i dont care what anybody knows about the vault if you fuck with us ill shoot you first and then piss on you for making me mad tod left the balcony passed through the door at the end of the hallway reached the fire stairs and started climbing them backward headlamps wavering balenger and vinnie came next their taped hands under the professors arms awkwardly helping him rick and cora came after that then mack and jd their footsteps were loud in the confined space now that you know im not a reporter balenger told vinnie easing the professor up the stairs ive got a question what is it you were talking about the composer who wrote on the banks of the wabash and my gal sal you said he was theodore dreisers brother as if that was a big deal who the hell was theodore dreiser he wrote sister carrie sister who keep talking balenger urged himself establish a bond with them its one of the first gritty american novels vinnie seemed to understand what balenger was trying to do its set in the slums of chicago the plots about a woman whos forced to sleep around to survive sounds like real life to me mack said in the darkness down the stairs vinnie kept the conversation going the theme is pessimistic determinism no matter what we do our bodies and our surroundings doom us yeah definitely real life mack said its working balenger thought moving upward he felt the professor wince the novel was published in a year before this hotel was built vinnie continued before then a lot of american novels were about working hard and succeeding what william dean howells called the smiling aspects of american life ill wait to ask you who howells was balenger said helping the professor steady himself but dreiser grew up in terrible poverty he saw enough suffering to decide the american dream was a fraud to make his point he called one of his other novels an american tragedy doubleday was the company that published sister carrie but when doubledays wife read the book she was so shocked she insisted her husband keep all the copies in the warehouse banning it it wasnt until several years later when the novel was republished that it became a classic guess ill have to read it balenger said like i believe that vinnie said the storys powerful but the writings terrible dreisers idea of polished prose was to call a bar a truly swell saloon below them jd laughed slowed by conklin they reached the fifth level and trudged higher balenger worried about the professors labored breathing he debated whether to lunge up the stairs and try to grab the pistol from tod but tod was too far above him the stairs were too confining tod would start shooting or maybe mack and jd would use their knives on the rest of the group who couldnt run anywhere it would be a massacre no he decided this wasnt the time this sister carrie reminds me of the chick in that movie sweets here mentioned mack referred to cora balenger knew his rage grew the one moon river is in whats it called sweets stop touching me whats the movie called breakfast at tiffanys yeah hell before i saw it on tv one night i thought it was a restaurant movie like my dinner with fucking andre but no its about this screwedup chick whats her name sweets holly golightly even her names screwed up holly the cock tease that should have been her name she made guys take her to fancy restaurants naturally they expected to get in her pants but after she ate a fabulous dinner she asked them for money so she could go to the bathroom never been to a bathroom where i had to pay to get in but i guess rich people put up with that stuff then she snuck out of the restaurant and they never got what they paid for she didnt sleep with them but as far as im concerned she was still a whore they reached the sixth level wheres sixten tod asked their headlamps showed doors with tarnished numbers six twentytwos on the right jd aimed his light toward the tree growing into the floor then sixtens the other way tod motioned with his pistol for the group to proceed toward the darkness on the left and that stupid ending mack said the heros supposed to be a smart writer he knows the twat gets paid to take messages to a gangster in prison he knows shes gonna marry a south american millionaire to get her hands on the money but the dumb hero still falls in love with her in the end theyre in this alley in the rain looking for a cat she threw away and they find the cat and theyre kissing and the music gets all weepy and im thinking you stupid fuck run get away from that whore as fast as you can shell break your heart and dump you the first time a guy with cash comes along apart from that how did you like the movie jd laughed damn it vinnie suddenly shouted at balenger id have gone along with you he was so furious he couldnt restrain himself all the professor needed to do was ask me and ive have gone along you think i dont need the money i make a shit salary in a school where the students beat teachers for giving them homework i dont have rich parents like rick has hell my fathers dying from emphysema he doesnt have health insurance all i do is pay for his damned medical bills if youd asked me id have gone now theres a guy who knows cash is king mack said if youve got dough you not only pay your old mans doctor bills you get holly the cock tease im sure i care tod said heres sixten a sign indicated do not disturb tod twisted the doorknob and pushed locked im not surprised balenger worked to keep the conversation alive tell me about it cora and rick couldnt find a key for it or for a handful of other rooms the missing keys must belong to the few doors that are locked well in case you wonder why you and your friends are still alive one reason is youre going to do the heavy lifting while we take it easy but thats not the only reason mack said looking at cora plus the old mans gonna help us get into the vault jd said put him down on the floor balenger and vinnie obeyed making the professor as comfortable as possible balenger felt relieved to be able to stand on his own he wished his hands were free to massage his arms now get that door open tod switched on a flashlight how tod aimed the pistol his flashlight made balenger squint i really hate it when you disagree with me rick vinnie give me a hand ricks nose caked with dried blood was twice its normal size he and vinnie joined balenger in front of the door although his wrists were taped together vinnie managed to twist the knob and test the door no result ill keep the knob turned while you try to force the door open mack laughed sounds even they work while you stand there balenger and rick pounded their shoulders against the door the wall shook they stepped back and charged crashing the door didnt budge feels like it has a metal core balengers shoulder pulsed i dont care if its kryptonite get it open my turn to keep the knob turned rick said shoving vinnie out of the way vinnie joined balenger they stepped back and charged hitting the door with their full weight we could ram it all day balenger said it isnt going to budge well youd better think of how to open it tod said because im getting impatient and when im impatient the crowbar ah the crowbar its the only way or maybe the hammer the hammer mack said maybe youd like some knives to cut through the wall or the gun to shoot the lock i dont think that would do any good glad to hear that jd said for a second there it sounded like you wanted us to give you weapons just a crowbar if you want to get this door open oh we want to get the door open definitely whos got the crowbar me mack said his shaved head cast a reflection from balengers headlamp get it out you bet mack pulled the crowbar from his knapsack now you guys wouldnt be thinking of trying to use this against us would you we just want to do what you say cause if you do try to use this crowbar against us you know whatll happen dont you yes no i dont think you do jd said i think i should demonstrate jd approached the group suddenly he used one hand to grab rick behind the neck and shoved his other hand under ricks belt at his spine hey what are you but jd was already running pushing rick toward the balustrade no balenger shouted this time when jd reached the edge he didnt shove rick the other way to safety instead he increased speed abruptly stopped and hurtled rick over the balustrade noooooo plummeting rick disappeared into the darkness his wail faded silence a muted crash echoed from far below the echo died balengers heart seemed to stop he felt suspended in the space between pulses he couldnt move the stillness was broken by jd who peered down toward the lobby six levels below what do you know i can see a little pinpoint of light glowing down there his headlamp survived the crash whats the old joke tod said the fall isnt what kills you its landing well sweets i guess itll be me making music with you now mack said cora slid to the floor her lips moved in a murmur no balenger could barely hear her in the beam from his headlamp he noted how frantic her eyes were no she whispered her eyes bulged the tendons in her neck stood out like ropes her shriek filled the sixth level stronger than the wind that whistled through the gaps in the skylight a level above no all right all right okay we get the idea tod aimed his flashlight straight into her eyes you miss him get used to it and shut up or youll go over the railing next not until im done with her mack said no somebody shut her up tod warned im not kidding if she doesnt stop balenger went over to where she slumped on the floor cora she kept screaming cora he put his taped hands on her left shoulder stop no cora balenger nudged her stop right now tears streamed down her face as she wailed snot dripped from her nose saliva leaked from her open mouth cora balenger managed to grasp her arm he shook her shook harder her body was like a rag dolls her head flopped forward and back he slapped her and abruptly she became silent her cheek was red she looked stunned her eyes remained wide but she hardly blinked just sank back against a wall and whimpered you didnt need to hit her so hard vinnie said bitterly it shut her up didnt it tod said i swear she was going over the railing the professor lay on the floor horrified mack tapped the crowbar across one of his hands so now you know whatll happen if you try to use this against us get that door open he set the crowbar on the floor and backed away balenger tried to control his emotions his hands trembled when he picked up the crowbar and wedged it into the doorframe he braced himself and tugged wood splintered no the professor moaned we dont destroy the past just steal from it right pops jd asked vinnie give me some help balenger said in shock vinnie joined him he put his hands next to balengers who felt them tremble just as his did the two of them yanked crack splinter crack the wood broke almost as loudly as a gunshot balengers ears rang as the door flew open darkness beckoned put down the crowbar and step away from it tod warned balenger did what he was told he watched mack retrieve the crowbar and return it to his knapsack now lets find the vault tod said balenger and vinnie lifted the professor to his good leg cora vinnies voice was unsteady we need to go but cora didnt move she just remained slumped against the wall her head was down the beam from her lamp illuminated her knees it bobbed as her chest and shoulders heaved with quiet sobs ill get her inside mack said he pulled her up with an arm around her waist close to a breast he walked toward the open door dont touch me she struggled as mack forced her into the darkness balenger shouted the floor what you need to test the floor first some of the rooms have rotten wood thats what happened to the staircase mack lurched back the three of you go first jd said yeah if its rotten the fat old guyll drop through tod said they shuffled over weighed down by the professor balenger put a shoe across the threshold and pressed down the wood felt secure he applied more weight and still detected no weakness ready he asked vinnie why not vinnies voice quavered the way this is going if we dont get killed one way itll soon happen another the beams of their headlamps pierced the darkness showing balenger that the room was larger than those theyd already explored numbed by ricks death and the near certainty of his own he turned his hard hat to the right and left seeing vague shapes of furniture they were in the living room of a suite mack brought in cora jd and tod followed their flashlights and the four remaining headlamps were the only illumination revealing chairs couches and tables an odd array of black red and gray theyre going to need more light to find the vault tod said candles somebody mentioned finding candles i did mack let go of cora who remained in place leaning one way and then another almost catatonic from grief he took off his knapsack and brought out a plastic bag of candles with a waterproof container of matches inside he lit a candle and put it in a chrome tubular holder on a table against a wall the flame wavered then grew steady he went about the room lighting more candles finding other holders or else dripping wax on the tables and sticking the base of the candles into it the flames made balenger feel he was in a desecrated church the room had the modest depth of the other rooms balenger had seen but it was three times as wide an expansive shutter a door and another shutterall dusty metaloccupied the wall across from him he imagined danata gazing past the wide windows toward the boardwalk the beach and the ocean carlisle stood in this room after danatas death he realized enjoying danatas view filling danatas space but only at night a full view during daylight would have terrified him footsteps made balenger turn to where jd came back from checking behind two doors on the left closet and bedroom jd said bathrooms through the bedroom nothing to worry us they scanned their lights around the room filling the shadows between candles no tv in the old days mack said what did he do with the time he mustve been bored to death that balenger pointed toward a felttopped card table that occupied a corner keep the damned conversation going he reminded himself and that vinnie worked to follow balengers example indicating an oddlooking object a flat rectangle with a semicircle rising from it its surface was black with red trim what is it a radio they sure disguised it whats that shiny stuff its made of bakelite vinnie said an early form of plastic check these magazines lying open as if danata just went to take a leak jd said esquire the saturday evening post never heard of it mack went over to a bookcase that had ascending levels in the shape of a skyscraper again the colors were black with red trim gone with the wind how to win friends influence people yeah danata influenced people all right with a gun to their head balenger kept staring at the candlelit room he couldnt get over what he saw another time capsule he thought the terror of ricks falling scream reverberated in his memory somebody tell me what kind of furniture this is tod said art deco the professor murmured tired of waiting for permission balenger and vinnie eased him onto a sofa that had black vinyl cushions black lacquered wooden arms and a fiveinch strip of chrome along the bottom the dusty chrome was the gray balenger had first glimpsed the cushions had red piping itsa style of architecture and furniture from the s and s vinnie resignedly explained his voice had little energy nonetheless he forced himself to continue seeming to realize that as long as he was useful his captors would allow him to remain alive the name comes from an art exposition in paris in the exposition international des arts decoratifs industriels et modernes speak english vinnie breathed with difficulty it means the international exposition of industrial and modern art decorations art decorations was shortened to art deco industry and art put simply it tried to make a living room look like a cross between a factory and an art gallery the materials are industrial the professor leaned wearily back on the sofa he too seemed to realize that if he didnt make himself useful hed be dead soon glass steel chrome nickel vinyl lacquer hard rubber not normally attractive vinnie pressed on but they were given a lustrous veneer and the shapes they were formed into tended to be curved and sensuous look at that chair a strip of lacquered wood black with red trim molded into a reclining s that looks like a body rippling or look at the tubular steel legs on the glass coffee table over there you want to stroke them no balenger thought quit talking that way dont reinforce macks obsession with sex or that lampvinnie pointedwhich has three nickel tubes holding up a frostedglass shade with three circles forming a lip on top of a lip on top of a lip the candles and flashlights showed furniture that worshiped geometry made seductive circles ovals squares triangles pentagons sometimes the furniture doesnt look sensuous even though it is vinnie said the sofa the professor is on the lacquer makes the back look hard and uncomfortable so do the stiff edges on the wooden arms theyre designed as a deception because the deep vinyl cushions are in fact comfortable surprisingly so isnt that true professor carmine danata could have happily napped here but youre not going to jd said i looked in all the rooms wheres the vault conklins mouth opened and closed he lost a lot of blood balenger said hes dehydrated jd took a bottle of water from his knapsack and tossed it to balenger lubricate him mack snickered balenger twisted off the cap and offered it to the professor but conklin didnt seem to notice it so balenger raised the bottle to the injured mans lips and helped him drink if conklin didnt get to an emergency room in the next couple of hours gangrene would set in he knew water trickled from the professors mouth and into his beard use the opportunity balenger warned himself he raised the bottle to his mouth gulping the tepid water wheres the vault mack demanded an eerie whisper made them turn moon cora sang to herself river she swayed from side to side as if hearing private music ghostly refrains of the melody her dead husband had played for her wide her raw red eyes were huge but she seemed to see nothing in front of her drifting as she shifted her weight from one foot to another balenger had the disturbing impression that she danced with someone slowly chest to chest cheek to cheek never leaving the spot where she was rooted dream tears rolled down her cheeks as candlelight wavered over her heartbreak shes your date tod told mack do something to shut her up conklin gathered the strength to interrupt balenger gave the injured man credit for trying to distract attention from cora the vault was hidden that was the whole idea the professor leaned back on the sofa his eyes closed if people knew there was a vault theyd wonder what was inside hidden where tod asked conklin didnt answer if you dont know why the hell did we bring you well find it vinnie give me a hand balenger sensed lethal impatience building in his captors hed been there before felt it before from beneath a sack tied around his head we need to keep making them think were useful he pivoted toward mack give me the crowbar dont think so cora kept singing faintly swaying as if on drugs or dancing with a ghost her blank eyes saw nothing cross her throat sounded raw her voice breaking that bitch is getting on my nerves jd said no crowbar balenger said to draw their attention all right damn it ill improvise he grabbed a stainless steel ashtray from a glassandchrome table clamped it between his taped hands and went to the wall on the right in a fury he pushed away the bookcase and pounded the ashtrays edge against the wall the noise blocking coras lament a stylized painting of a woman in a streamlined s roadster her long hair flying in the wind fell from the wall no the professor murmured balenger shifted along the wall continuing to hammer with the ashtray plaster cracked another painting crashed forget the gold coins vinnie told jd raising his voice to be heard above the noise that ashtray hes destroying was in mint condition you could have sold it for a thousand dollars on ebay and those two paintings that fell a thousand dollars probably more and then theres the chrome candleholder and the frosted green glass vases and the stainlesssteel cigarette case mack picked the case off a table and opened it it still has cigarettes he pulled one out paper and tobacco crumbled in his fingers the lamps the chairs the glass tables the lacquered sofa perfect condition vinnie emphasized all told youre looking at a quartermillion dollars probably higher and you dont need to worry about the government coming after you for trying to sell gold coins stolen from the mint easy job rent a truck well help you load it well smile and wave as you drive away just leave us alone i swear to god ill never tell anybody about you a thousand dollars tod repeated for an ashtray but not anymore now its junk balenger overturned a glass table and whacked the ashtray against the continuation of the wall the table shattered there goes twenty thousand dollars vinnie said hey mack told balenger stop but you ordered us to find the vault hows pounding the wall going to arent you listening the walls hollow from bare spaces between the joists balengers hands throbbed from the force of his hammering his chest heaved from the frenzy of his exertion we need to keep pounding till we find a section that sounds solid thats where the vault is then why are you just standing there mack told vinnie give him a hand vinnie grabbed a stainlesssteel vase and headed toward the wall how much is that worth probably five thousand put it down use this mack hurled the crowbar toward vinnies feet try to hit us with it tod said and ill shoot your eyes out vinnie grabbed the crowbar between his taped hands and walloped it against the wall it smashed a huge hole in the plaster now were getting somewhere jd said mighty nice gun heckler and koch p it says here on the side forty caliber tod emphasized balenger and vinnie kept pounding more powerful than a nine millimeter less powerful than a fortyfive like goldilocks and the three bears not too much not too little just right a forty calibers a police load right balenger kept slamming the ashtray against the wall hey hero i asked you a question tod said im talking to you stop and look at me balenger turned he breathed deeply a forty calibers a police load tod said im not a cop right far from it sure the more i look at this gun the fancier it is its got a slide release lever on both sides so you can reload with either hand if one of your arms is wounded its got a magazine release lever behind the trigger guard where either hand can reach it if one of your arms takes a bullet mostly those features are for lefthanded shooters of course of course why didnt i think of that whats your name again frank well frank while your buddy works and gives you a rest why dont you tell us about yourself yeah mack said convince us youre not a cop vinnie paused hey big ears nobody told you to quit jd said blankfaced cora sobbed and sang vinnie whacked the crowbar against the wall frank maybe youre not taking us seriously tod said believe me i am then talk to us mack said convince us youre not a cop yeah tod said convince us not to shoot you slowly carefully balenger set down the ashtray he didnt want to tell them what they wanted to know but he didnt see an alternative maybe this would help him bond with them im former military and how come you know the professor tod asked i took a class from him i dont get the connection i was in iraq i still dont get the connection the first gulf war desert storm i was a ranger hi yo tonto jd said after i came back home to buffalo i got sick aches fever hey i didnt ask for your medical history what i want to know is vinnie pounded another hole in the wall the va hospital in buffalo kept telling me i had a stubborn case of the flu then i heard that a lot of other veterans were sick and finally the newspapers and tv started calling it gulf war syndrome the military said saddam hussein might have used chemical or biological weapons on us if you dont answer the question or maybe it was caused by a disease spread by sand fleas the desert has a lot of insects i ask you to prove youre not a cop and i get your life story but the more i read about it the more i suspected what made me sick was the depleted uranium in our artillery shells the uranium hardens them and makes it easy for the explosive heads to go through enemy tanks uranium vinnie frowned hey big ears tod said a little less listening and a little more pounding on that wall youre too close to that candle move it away before you have an accident the military claims depleted uranium is safe balenger shook his head in fierce disagreement but i hear it makes a geiger counter click we fired an awful lot of artillery shells in desert storm the wind blew a lot of smoke and dust in our direction it took years before i felt normal again it ended my military career thats when you became a cop im telling you im not a cop i drifted from job to job mostly driving trucks then the second iraq war happened balenger paused he was getting close to his previous nightmare sweating he wondered if he could make himself talk about it no choice ive got to he thought our military got overextended corporations trying to rebuild iraq hired civilian guards for their convoys former specialoperations personnel the need was so great they even accepted guys like me whod been out of the service for a while and the pay was fabulous one hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars a year to make sure supply trucks didnt get ambushed one hundred and twentyfive thousand tod was impressed a year then conditions deteriorated and more convoys got hit and the pay got even better twenty thousand a month shit youre rich not hardly the companies paid by the month because not a lot of guys were willing to make themselves targets you needed to have not much going for you at home bad job prospects nobody close to you like me i mean it was really crazy over there snipers and booby traps all along the road most guys didnt last long either they got killed or they said to hell with this and quit in my case balenger paused listening to vinnie pound with the crowbar i got a chance to collect only one paycheck only one shit what happened finally ive got them balenger thought i was guarding a convoy we were attacked an explosion knocked me unconscious he rushed through it not wanting to remember the pain and gunfire and screams the next thing i knew i was tied to a chair in a filthy smelling room most of the smell came from a sack tied around my head tod mack and jd stared and jd said an iraqi insurgent told me he was going to cut off my head vinnie stopped pounding and looked at him in the silence cora sank to the floor hugging her knees her eyes were vacant cut off your head tod frowned after hours of keeping me tied to that chair a sack around my head thats what they told me i was sore from bruises and cuts my bladder was full i held it as long as i could i pissed my pants i sat in my urine and then my shit the memory seized him he feared hed throw up he had the sense that he was talking faster and faster cut off my head but first they had to brag that theyd caught me so they set up a video camera and then of course they had to prove who i was so they took the sack off my head after i quit blinking and squinting i saw i was in a battered concreteblock room with a halfdozen men next to me they were wearing hoods with holes for the eyes and mouth the guy who threatened mehe was the only one who spoke englishhad his hand stuck through a gap in his robe he was holding something under there and it didnt take a lot of thinking to know it was a sword the video camera was on a tripod in front of me it had a red light that kept winking and the guy ordered me to say my name and who i worked for he told me to beg all americans to leave iraq or else what was going to happen to me would happen to them balenger knew he was talking too fast but he couldnt control himself just kept spewing out the words i dont know how long id been unconscious from the explosion how long it had been since id had anything to eat and drink name rank and serial number thats what they taught us in the rangers i sure as hell wasnt going to beg americans to leave the country but there was nothing wrong with buying time and saying my name when i tried to speak though my voice made a croaking sound they realized they needed to give me water before i could say anything somebody shoved a bottle to my lips i swallowed i felt water dripping off my chin i swallowed some more then the bottle was yanked away and the guy ordered me to say my name to the camera i tried again and they gave me more water and the third time i tried to speak and couldnt the guy who spoke english pulled out the sword seconds tick tick tick no past no future just now just that sword i swore to myself that id make now last as long as possible the guy drew back the sword balenger told his story the way he always did the same words the same torrent the way the psychiatrist always heard it for what might have been the hundredth time i dont know how but i managed to say my name he held back the sword and ordered me to say who i worked for that was the same as rank and serial number no harm in it so i told the camera the company i worked for blackwater now i kept making now last as long as possible then he ordered me to beg for my life i thought whats the harm in pleading i knew it wouldnt do any good but at least it kept now lasting longer i couldnt do it though faster and faster fear made my voice break i was sobbing and they had to give me more water but i still couldnt force the words out so the guy drew back the sword and now was almost over and suddenly the walls shook the room filled with dust concrete blocks tumbled my ears were ringing the guys wearing hoods were shouting at each other they yanked a door open sunlight blinded me there was another explosion outside some grabbed rifles two of them threw me in another room small a dirt floor they locked the door i heard them running away i heard another explosion gunfire i was still tied to the chair when they threw me into the room the chair broke when i landed i twisted away from the shattered wood piss and shit were all over me my hands were still tied behind me but i could move and as soon as i squirmed away from the chair i forced my tied hands down under my hips and legs dislocated my right shoulder but i got my hands in front of me like this in the flashlights and the wavering candlelight balenger raised the hands secured with duct tape and jd asked balenger rushed on the gunfire and the explosions got worse the room had a closed wooden shutter i pulled at it but it was secured from outside so i grabbed the chair seat and i pounded i cant tell you how hard i pounded finally i broke through the shutter i squirmed through and fell on my dislocated shoulder i didnt allow myself to faint from pain i had to keep going i had to keep now lasting longer people were running in panic from the shots and the explosions and the next explosion lifted me off my feet it was shockingly close behind me this time i did pass out and when i regained consciousness i realized that the explosion came from the building where i was kept prisoner a mortar round hit it and leveled it and tod asked an american ranger patrol found me the company i worked for blackwater arranged for me to have medical attention id been in iraq only two weeks they gave me the full month of wages they paid for me to fly home i had an insurance policy theyd gotten for me fifty thousand if i was killed twentyfive thousand if i was injured twentyfive thousand thats what ive been living on the veterans hospital psychiatrist i go to says i have posttraumatic stress disorder no shit stress is right the worlds a waking nightmare theres plenty of stress especially if you try not to think about a guy wearing a hood who wants to cut off your head balenger was aware of switching from i to you the psychiatrist called it disassociation his voice shook his heart beat so fast pressure swelled the veins in his neck so now you know im not a cop do we how did you and the professor get together i told you i took a course from him balengers clothes were soaked with sweat when you live a waking nightmare how do you get away from the world iraq its everywhere how do you get away from fucking iraq the past all i wanted to do was escape into the past my psychiatrist thought it would help to read old novels books that made me feel i was in the past i tried dickens i tried tolstoy i tried alexandre dumas but that chapter in the count of monte cristo where the heros in a sack and gets thrown over a wall into the ocean was too much like reality to me so i started reading history books biographies about benjamin franklin and wordsworth and the founding of the house of rothschild i didnt give a shit about franklin or wordsworth or the house of rothschild but it was in the safe unthreatening past anything before the twentieth century big fat books that almost gave me a hernia the thicker the better the more details the better footnotes how i love footnotes the only modern novels i read were by jack finney and richard matheson time and again bid time return characters who wanted desperately to leave the present they concentrated so hard they went into the past if only i went to the state university at buffalo and pretended i was a student and took as many history classes as i could sneak into when the professor realized i wasnt enrolled we had a conference in his office i told him about myself he let me go to more of his classes we talked more and a month ago after he got fired he asked if id help him he said wed have so much money wed never have to worry about the present a faint rumble shifted through the building sack over your head huh tod asked balenger nodded all that time in darkness mack added yes and you made yourself go through those tunnels into this hotel and you made yourself come all the way up here through the darkness jd said you must have been reminded a lot of what happened to you in iraq a couple of times balenger said flatly the rumble sounded again youre tough i dont think so sure you are you saved big ears over there you saved the professor but god help me i couldnt save rick balenger thought yeah a hero tod said the rumble was a little louder but if you try to be a hero again tod raised the pistol aimed at balenger and fired the bullet snapped past balengers head he felt the shock of air it displaced heard it slam into the wall behind him jesus vinnie said it didnt come anywhere close tod said my ears mack put his hands over them for gods sake why didnt you warn me theyre ringing like crazy so were balengers but not so much that he didnt hear another rumble dont try to be a hero tod said otherwise that now thing you talked about wont last much longer all i want is to walk out of here well see how this goes so far youve been useless wheres the vault whats that noise mack asked the ringing in your ears no jd said i heard it too a rumble thunder balenger said they stared toward the ceiling thunder vinnie shook his head there arent any thunderstorms predicted only showers around dawn the professor said vinnies voice dropped professor no answer professor vinnie started toward the sofa the crowbar tod warned aiming put it down before you come near us vinnie dropped it and crossed the room he passed cora who continued to hum in shock and reached the professor whose head was back his eyes closed vinnie nudged him you told us the weather report was for showers around dawn conklins eyes remained closed you told us i lied conklin said wearily what next week the salvagers are coming i needed all of you to help me scout the building tonight conklin breathed tomorrow night after we showed frank how to get into the building and into the vault conklin took another breath he was supposed to return and take as many coins as he could carry tonight and tomorrow night thats when it needed to happen you prick i estimated that wed be out of here before the storm arrived the professors bearded face was ravaged with regret apparently i was wrong whats the big deal about a storm jd wanted to know getting out of here vinnie said in despair depending on how hard it rains the tunnels might be flooded right now youve got bigger problems than worrying about a flooded tunnel tod said well just have to wait and get more acquainted yeah mack said putting a hand on coras shoulder well just have to find ways to pass the time she was on the floor now sitting bent forward with her arms around her raised knees and her head braced on them she didnt seem aware of macks touch leave her alone vinnie said make me balenger tried to distract them the vault your great idea didnt work out smart guy tod said the wall on that side sounds hollow too if this stuff about the vault and the gold coins turns out to be bullshit balenger examined the holes in the wall he went over and peered into the dark bedroom then studied the doorjamb and the space between the rooms looks like five inches wide bob are you sure the diary didnt say it was a wall safe a vault the professor murmured through his pain that was what carlisle always called it then were wasting our time on this wall its too narrow balenger stared at the long living room wall at the metal shutters and the metal door between them no room for the vault there either he tugged open the closet door and saw coats and suits all in a style that suggested the s their smell was nauseating he yanked the garments off a wooden rod and hurled them across the living room then entered the closet and pounded on the wall normal that leaves the far bedroom wall or maybe the bathroom careful hero tod said ill need light in the bedroom balenger picked up the crowbar vinnie help me with an angry look toward mack whose hand remained on coras shoulder vinnie followed balenger into the bedroom their headlamps revealed a lacquered black dresser with red trim a chrome strip at the bottom and a circular mirror on top a reading chair had the same black with red trim so did the bed but balenger hardly noticed as he and vinnie shoved it away from the wall standing in the doorway tod and jd aimed their flashlights as balenger pounded the hollowsounding wall black and red tod said who did danata think he was the prince of darkness im sure all the men he shot believed it balenger said vinnie took an ashtray off a nightstand ill check the bathroom as balenger swung the crowbar against the wall he heard vinnie pounding the wall in the bathroom even at a distance the hollow sound made it obvious nothing was behind the wall at last balenger ran out of surface he stepped back breathing heavily scanning his headlamp along the holes hed made nothing he started back toward the living room drop the crowbar tod warned from the doorway throwing it onto a chair balenger entered the living room bob he roused the professor try to remember the diary the vault isnt here did the diary mention any other place the vault might be all bullshit jd said danatas suite conklin said the ceiling maybe the floor leg hurts balenger stared at the duct tape around it the tape remained gray no blood leaking but the leg was alarmingly swollen he should have been in an ambulance a half hour ago balenger thought does it throb constant pain sharp maybe i left a shard in there balenger put a hand on the professors forehead hes got a fever gosh tod said mack was still rubbing coras shoulders the firstaid kit balenger said we need to give him more painkillers we jd said all we care about is all right all right if i can find the vault will you give him the painkillers sounds like a deal to me balenger thought frantically the ceilings out of the question danata would have wanted easy access that leaves the floor vinnie get the crowbar maybe theres a trapdoor vinnie didnt answer he was staring at macks hands on coras shoulders vinnie the crowbar balenger shoved furniture away pulled up a rug and knelt to study the floor the strips of hardwood showed no obvious gaps we need to clear the room move all the furniture balengers headlamp swept along the first wall and the holes he and vinnie had pounded into it the beam illuminated the darkness behind the holes he shivered with understanding theres a lot of space behind that wall he aimed his headlamp through the biggest hole a hell of a lot of space he shoved his gloved hands into the hole and tried to pull at the plasters edge but with his wrists taped together he couldnt manage a grip the crowbar wheres abruptly vinnie was next to him ramming the crowbar into the hole he pried out a chunk of plaster theres something in here the vault jd asked quickly vinnie pried away more plaster no not the vault balenger threw debris onto the floor it looks like a staircase vinnie said what mack moved away from cora a circular staircase vinnie pried at the wall balenger kept throwing the plaster away they soon had an opening large enough to squeeze through the roar of a shot made balenger flinch a bullet slammed the wall to his right stay tod ordered nobodys going in there till that holes a lot wider and we can see everything that happens one of you might get tempted to run down that staircase bear in mind weve got the professor here and whats her namecora sweets mack said ill shoot them if anybody tries to escape do we have an understanding balengers voice cracked yes then open that wall vinnie pounded with the crowbar enlarging the hole by angling his taped hands sideways balenger was able to grip chunks of plaster and tear them away joists were exposed twobyfours a frame onto which plasterboard had been nailed more and more of the space behind the wall became visible hell you could have a party back there tod said there was a sixfoot gap between danatas living room and the wall for the next room on the right close to the balcony wall a spiral staircase led up and down it was metal and reminded balenger of a gigantic corkscrew explain it jd said carlisle used the staircase to move secretly behind the walls balenger told him ill bet the staircase goes all the way to the ground floor and ill bet there are other staircases vinnie said the nutcase that built this hotel was a peeping tom jd asked he lived through other people he had to limit contact he was afraid of injuries a hemophiliac whats a blood disease carlisles blood didnt have thickening agents the slightest bump or scratch could cause him to bleed and stopping it could seem impossible so he got his jollies spying on his guests tod asked balengers headlamp revealed the wall on the other side of the passageway every five feet what looked like the eyepiece of a microscope protruded from the wall with those the wall on the opposite side probably has tiny holes hidden at the side of a painting or under a light fixture attached to the wall lenses on this side magnified the image he could watch people undressing mack said or going to the bathroom or screwing or arguing balenger said or a man getting drunk and beating his wife or a woman getting into a warm bath and committing suicide by slitting her wrists and bleeding to death or a boy using a baseball bat to smash his fathers head into jelly vinnie said all of those things happened here eventually over the life of the hotel every room had something terrible happen in it that was the whole idea of the paragon hotel balenger said all our emotions good and bad carlisle wanted to see everything humans were capable of so he built himself a small version of the world do i look like i care tod demanded wheres the damned vault balenger glanced from the staircase all the way along the exposed passageway his gaze rested on a section of wall in line with the long wall in danatas living room where metal shutters hid windows that once looked out on the boardwalk and the beach theres a door between those shutters where do you suppose it leads a balcony vinnie suggested or maybe a patio each of the hotels levels is set back balenger said when danata walked out the original door he was standing on the roof of the room below him i bet he had a patio there planters filled with bushes and trees an outdoor table and chairs maybe a sun lounge lean back have a drink watch the girls on the beach thats how id have wanted it but danata had a long career as a mob enforcer he didnt stay alive for decades by being stupid and sitting out in the open people in the rooms to the right and left would have been able to see him a guy whose brother got shot by him might be tempted to rent the room next door and blow a hole in danatas head while he was having a drink and watching the girls so tod asked in danatas place id have built extensions along both walls of my suite extensions that went all the way to the edge of the patio and the roof walls that kept people in the other rooms from seeing him so fucking what maybe the extension on this side is as wide as this passageway maybe the passageway continues all the way to the edge of the roof balenger studied the sixfootwide section of wall at the end of the passageway at shoulder level a screw projected from the right and left without asking permission he walked along the corridor and tapped the wall sounds hollow again he studied the screws with my hands taped i cant pull at these stand back tod aimed the pistol when balenger was an unthreatening distance away jd stepped between upright twobyfours and approached the end wall he gripped the screws on each side and pulled but nothing happened those screws are in solid tug harder i think theyre handles jd yanked then stumbled back as a partition broke free headlamps and flashlights pierced the dark continuation of the passageway and theres your vault balenger said it was about ten feet farther along occupying the height and width of the passageway its borders were black metal while its door was brass now tarnished green balenger imagined how it had once gleamed in the middle the door had a handle and a dial imprinted at the top was corrigan security the name of what balenger assumed was a nolongerexisting company we had to tear down the wall to get in here vinnie said how could danata have reached this balenger noticed an alcove to the left he stepped back to where jd had removed the partition that hid the continuation of the passageway the partition had been in line with the wall that faced the boardwalk and the beach a bookcase occupied the right corner of that wall balenger hadnt tried to move the bookcase because it seemed obvious that nothing could be behind it now he went back to the room and tugged at the bookcase vinnie give me a hand but both of them were unable to budge it ill get the crowbar vinnie said carefully jd said wait a second hampered by his taped wrists balenger shoved aside books on the right of the middle shelf pawed along the inside of the case and touched a metal catch he flipped the catch upward and pulled at the case it swung open the space behind it was the alcove balenger had seen the extension that goes to the edge of the roof must have a box in this corner he said some kind of decorative effect probably with flowers or shrubs in front so danata didnt have to look at just a plain wall when he sat outside the box and whatevers in front disguise the exterior of the alcove balenger stepped through the open bookcase entered the alcove turned right reached the passageway and turned left to face the vault okay that explains how danata went from his living room to the vault tod said but it doesnt explain the staircase wouldnt it have bugged him wouldnt danata have started wondering what kind of creep carlisle was that he needed a hidden staircase i dont think danata knew about the staircase balenger said all the construction was outside on the patio the workers didnt have a reason to break into the interior wall all i care about is the vault tod said open it balenger pushed down on the handle and pulled the door didnt move his spirit sank locked you begged us not to kill the old guy you said he knew how to get into the vault now we come to it balenger thought the moment for which they kept us alive in a sweat he recalled the iraqi insurgent threatening to cut off his head the question again insisted how do i make now last a little longer balenger crossed the room toward the professor who continued to lean back in pain bob conklin moaned bob do you know the combination maybe maybe tod asked his tattoos seemed like creatures rippling across his cheeks concentrate bob this is really important tell us how to get into the vault a guess a guess tod said angrily conklin breathed with effort the diary yes tell us about the diary balenger said carlisle used one of his peepholes to watch danata unlock the vault carlisle saw the combination and mack asked what are the numbers carlisle wrote in his diary that danata used his name for the numbers whats that supposed to mean bob was he talking about some kind of alphabetnumber transference balenger asked think so think so isnt good enough tod aimed balenger saw an end table next to the sofa the professor lay upon he drew a finger along its dusty surface this is the alphabet he wrote in a fury ill match a number with each letter a is bs cs we get the fucking idea mack said danata d is a is n is a is t is a is if we put them in a sequence we get thats the combination youd better be right jd said balenger rushed into the exposed passageway and reached the vault trying to steady his hands he dialed to the right the other numbers cant remember vinnie read them to me vinnie did balenger continued dialing to the left to the right and to the left pulse racing he turned the handle and tugged at the door it resisted no lets cap em all and grab as many of these thousanddollar ashtrays and candleholders and shit that we can carry jd said but we dont cap the girl right away mack said sweets and i have a date i started in the wrong direction balenger insisted i should have started left instead of right he dialed to the left to the right to the left and to the right praying he yanked at the handle pulling the door remained solidly in place no end of story tod said please give me a chance to think the theory makes sense what am i doing wrong he thought the professor murmured something balenger only caught the last word name what wrong name conklin strained to speak louder not danata hes delirious jd walked over with the crowbar ready to swing it the youngest of the group he craved the most violence balenger realized lets put the old bird out of his misery while i show sweets the bedroom mack said first name conklin said carmine balenger said wait he moved to another table and wrote carmine in the dust c is a is r is m is i is n is e is the sequence is thats the combination five sets of numbers five sets tod asked a little while ago you were sure there were four just leave the professor alone he gave us a direction if this works he earned the right to live a little longer balengers throat cramped that was all he worked forthe right to live a little longer but this time despite the rumble of thunder that sounded so much like approaching explosions there wouldnt be a ranger unit to rescue him show us macks hands slid along coras shoulders she was oblivious her eyes staring at infinity balenger ran to the vault and tried to steady his shaking headlamp vinnie read me the numbers this time he started to the left right left right left flashlights blazed toward him as tod mack and jd stepped into the passageway they shoved vinnie ahead of them turn the handle hero pull the door jd said please god please balenger thought and pulled suddenly jd screamed whirling balenger saw a dark specter crash into jd and knock himdown husband killed my husband cora had an ashtray in her hands pounding motherfucker killed my husband jd groaned lights zigzagged insanely motherfucker cora aimed the ashtray at jds teeth jd raised his arm taking the blow on his wrist he moaned dont try anything hero tod aimed the pistol at balenger furthest thing from my mind shes your date tod told mack i thought you were watching her get the bitch under control pull her off me jd shouted frantically protecting his face motherfucker motherfucker cora plunged the ashtray toward jds forehead jd blocked it mack grabbed her straining to pullher away but her fury was more than he expected get her off mack yanked the ashtray out of her hands now she pounded with her fists i sure hate to do this mack picked up the crowbar a terrible waste no balenger said ill do it ill stop her he lunged toward cora hooking his taped wrists over hers she struggled to disentangle her arms but balenger twisted to the side the pressure torquing her off jd he crawled onto her resisting her efforts to squirm away i guess youre useful for something after all tod said you need her dont kill her balenger said oh i need her all right mack said but afterward jd came to his feet wiping blood from his lips give me the crowbar no you need her you need all of us the gold coins are you still bullshitting about that mack said those gold coins if they even exist are worthlesswe cant get into the damned vault no i think i heard the tumblers click i think i unlocked it from the start all you did is lie if i can open the vault if i can show you the gold coins youre going to need all of us for what to carry the coins theyll be heavy youll need help getting them downstairs and through the tunnels otherwise itll take twice as long you wont get out before the storm hits you think there are that many why else would danata have put in a vault that big tod and mack looked at each other do it tod told mack while i make sure this bunch doesnt try anything balenger felt pressure inside his rib cage the force of adrenaline made his chest seem to swell about to explode still holding the crowbar mack put his flashlight under his arm so he could grip the vaults handle tick tick tick no past no future nows almost over balenger thought mack shoved down on the handle he pulled the vault door moved time seemed to stop fucking amazing mack said he got out of the way as he swung the door outward balengers headlamp shone inside so did vinnies and the flashlights that tod mack and jd aimed thunder rumbled through the broken skylight outside the room the hotel trembled then everything became silent no one seemed to breathe the gold coins were in metal trays on shelves all the way up the right side of the vault more coins than any of them could have imagined perfectly preserved in pristine condition the absence of dust on them made them seem to absorb the lights aimed into the vault and give off a glow but that wasnt what they stared at it wasnt what made them gape no vinnie said the stench of piss and shit escaped from the vault what occupied all their stunned attention was a woman in a dirty transparent nightgown which showed her breasts her nipples and the triangle of her pubic hair for an instant balenger was tricked by the shadows his horror mounting she appeared to be someone he knew the womans blond hair hung like a rag mop frail haggard in her late twenties she cowered pressing as far back into the vault as possible a sleeping bag was crumpled at her feet candybar wrappers and empty water bottles lay on it a toilet pail was in a corner she raised her hands to shield her frightened eyes from the stabbing lights balenger felt his knees weaken he had the dizzy sensation of dropping through a trapdoor into insanity am jesus vinnie said macks voice broke what the hell is as balenger rose to his knees he noticed that even cora was stunned into submission mack stepped toward the vaults entrance his flashlight cast a stark shadow of her head lady how did you get in there she whimpered cowering with such desperation that it almost seemed possible she could push her way through the vaults back wall mack still had the crowbar in his hand what happened for gods sake youre scaring her tod said give jd the damned crowbar and get her out of there is he here is he coming the woman moaned is who here did he send you nobody sent us help me mack stepped into the vault headlamps and flashlights cast his shadow as he reached for her who did this to you the woman gaped at his hand whoever he is im not him mack said not him the woman gaped now at the grotesque nightvision goggles dangling around macks neck he didnt send me send you but id sure like to know who the sick fuck is take my hand lets get you out of there legs unsteady the woman stepped across the sleeping bag she hesitated sobbed and took his hand how did she breathe in there tod wanted to know mack peered at the back of the vault holes somebody drilled them you need to the woman almost collapsed mack held her up hurry get me away from him dont worry jd said if he shows up with us here hes the one wholl need to worry thirsty how long has it been since dont know no sense of time give her some water tod said she drank greedily so desperate that she didnt seem to notice the white burn scar on macks cheek hurry she pleaded before he comes back whats your name mack took her from the passageway into the candlelight of the living room amanda her voice was raspy from not having been used evert are we in brooklyn i live in brooklyn no this is asbury park asbury new jersey it was as if shed been told she was thousands of miles from home she frowned at the shadowy wreckage my god what is this place the paragon hotel its abandoned amanda inhaled sharply in the candlelight she recoiled from the tattoos rippling across tods cheeks his hand shot angrily to his face youre not listening amanda begged we need to get out of here before he comes back who is this guy mack asked ronnie thats what he makes me call him no last name eyes wild amanda shook her head desperately from side to side whats he look like there isnt time amanda wailed tugging at mack to take her to the door there are three of us jd said believe me if we find him whatever he did to you the bastard wont be doing it anymore three but what about amanda turned toward balenger vinnie and cora her gaze dropped to the duct tape binding their wrists she moaned thunder rumbled to hell with this jd said we found what we wanted lets go before the rain starts hey big ears were you telling the truth that the tunnels might flood thats part of what they were designed for to carry away storm water vinnie said empty the knapsacks tod ordered load them with as many coins as theyll hold stuff your pockets but what about them jd pointed toward their captives tod raised the pistol wait balenger said somethings wrong a chill sped along his nerves through the open door he heard the shrieking wind thunder boomed through the broken skylight the smell of rain gusted in he heard water pelting the remaining glass in the skylight heard it splashing on the balcony and the balustrade somethings wrong for sure the storm already started mack dumped the equipment out of his knapsack and hurried toward the vault not what i mean balenger stared toward the professor leaning back on the sofa the light from the professors headlamp slowly shifted sinking until it shone on his ample chest then it rolled onto his lap shining up between his legs as if his hard hat had come loose but balenger remembered that conklins hard hat had stayed firmly on his head even when the stairs collapsed a chin strap holding it in place legs numb he shuffled toward the professor not sure if he had the strength to get there please god let me be wrong but as he forced himself dizzily closer the smell of rain gave way to the stench of copper blood the sofa was drenched in blood so was the professor and it was more than a hard hat that lay pointing upward in his lap it was his head acid gushed into balengers mouth he clamped a hand to his lips hoping it would stop him from throwing up he swung toward tod gagging get her away from the sofa what the woman amanda get her to the other side of the room what are you talking about tod peered behind balenger and saw what was on the sofa oh fuck he swung as abruptly as balenger had mack get a sheet from the bedroom why just do what youre told whats wrong jd asked then he saw the professors bloodsoaked headless torso on the sofa and groaned ronnie amanda whimpered vinnie and cora turned away in shock ronnies here amanda said how tod demanded we were all in the passageway balenger fought his dizziness his arms and legs were numb with mounting panic emotions from iraq threatened to overwhelm him no he told himself if you let it take charge you die passive gets you killed we left the door open thunder roared rain pelted the balcony somebody came in while we were distracted by opening the vault and finding amanda ronnie amanda said he stood outside in the dark he listened for a long time balengers voice was unsteady a long time tod stared at the gloom beyond the open door how do you know twenty minutes ago i told you about iraq about the guy who threatened to cut off my head and now we find the professor with his head mack rushed from the bedroom hurried to the sofa and threw a sheet over the professors body blood soaked it the headlamp between the professors legs shone dully upward through the fabric it stinks mack said in disgust i never realized how much yeah balenger said blood stinks mutilated bodies stink ronnie amanda repeated it seemed the only word she knew he might still be here jd scanned his flashlight into every corner shut the door tod ordered lock it lock it how the crowbar broke the door frame cram furniture against it jd dragged the bookcase toward the door somebody give me a hand vinnie helped him balenger rushed to a heavylooking table cora was next to him sobbing helping him push the table against the door mack lifted a chair on top nobodys coming through there mack grabbed the crowbar but what if hes still in the room again jd scanned his flashlight toward the corners its trembling beam made shadows dance ronnies here amanda said check the bedroom the bathroom and the closet tod shouted he hurried toward the bedroom then turned and aimed at balenger dont go anywhere im not planning on it right now id sooner be with you balenger grabbed a hammer from a pile of equipment dumped from a knapsack he entered the exposed passageway turned off his headlamp to hide himself and stood near the staircase ready with the hammer listening for the sound of anyone climbing the stairs what he heard instead were the pounding of his pulse and thunder rattling the walls he became aware of cora and vinnie next to him shutting off their lights guarding the staircase each held a lamp as if it were a club he glanced toward amanda who cowered in the living room whimpering ronnies name cora maybe you should stay with her try to calm her down cora wiped tears from her face do i look like i can calm anybody nonetheless she went to amanda balenger watched cora touch amandas arm and talk softly to her then he returned his attention to the black mouth of the spiral staircase for all he knew someone was down there watching him hes not in the closet the bedroom or the bathroom tod said returning with mack and jd mack grabbed a water bottle from the floor and drank half of it we might need to ration the rest of the bottles balenger said we tod asked i need to amanda said what relieve my so do i cora said whats keeping you you took away the bottles we use for go in the bathroom you wont have water to flush it but so what i dont want to be in there alone ill go with you mack grinned j will vinnie said he turned on his headlamp and motioned for the women to follow him into the bedroom ill be right outside the door cora put an arm around amanda and led her toward the bedroom balenger noticed mack staring toward the back of amandas nightgown the two women and vinnie disappeared into the darkness watching them leave and then scanning the wreckage of the living room the broken furniture the destroyed walls balenger thought leave nothing but footprints take nothing but photographs theres not much left to ruin what now hero tod asked any suggestions use a cell phone to call the police dont you remember the local emergency number isnt working and the regular police number has a long wait then phone the police in another city yeah right so instead of facing this ronnie jerkoff we get charged for killing your pal not to mention kidnapping the rest of you somehow i think our odds are better against ronnie not so far yeah well we werent organized a little while ago we didnt know what we were dealing with you still dont we will when the woman comes back and we get some information out of her jd took an empty knapsack into the vault man does it ever stink in here he threw coins into the knapsack they made a dull clinking sound heres another suggestion balenger said keep making them feel were together he thought collectors wont pay seven hundred dollars for coins that are scratched those are perfect and hes ruining them hey asshole tod called be careful with those dont scratch them use the trays put the coins in trays and all i was confused a minute ago he told balenger needed to think but now ive got everything covered with our goggles well see ronnie before he sees us has it occurred to you that he might have goggles too tod frowned his furrowed brow twisting his tattoos footsteps made him turn toward vinnie cora and amanda coming back tell us about ronnie he demanded amandas face tightened shaken by memories she took a deep breath he she bit her lip and forced herself to continue i work in a bookstore in manhattan he came in a couple of times friendly she hugged herself he must have followed me home to brooklyn and figured where to park a car where to hide a few days earlier my boyfriend moved out i was living alone in an apartment i couldnt afford by myself i was so worried about paying the rent i didnt pay attention when i got off the subway and walked home when was this mack asked i have no idea amanda shivered what date is it october twentyfourth oh amandas voice dropped she sank into a chair whats wrong balenger asked the night he grabbed me was june fourteenth amandas eyes communicated her dismay and loss the store stayed open that night until ten an author signing i didnt get home until midnight he had a cloth with some kind of chemical in it something that he pressed over my mouth when i passed an alley she took another deep breath when i woke up i was on the bed upstairs he was sitting next to me holding my hand she closed her eyes lowered her head and quivered as if she tasted something disgusting thats when he explained the facts of my new life what does he look like tod demanded does he have a gun if we end up fighting him what do we need to expect old what much older than me older than you amanda looked at balenger who was thirtyfive how old tod asked im no good at judging that anybody over forty looks you think hes over forty balenger asked yes is he real old he cant be if he overpowered you maybe in his fifties tall thin nervous thin he has a neutral expression on his face even when he smiles its neutral a thin guy in his fifties tod began to look confident i think we can handle him just fine hes very strong stronger than this tod held up the pistol he lifts weights thin weightlifters dont exactly leave me quaking in my shoes tod looked at mack and jd questions yeah jd said what are we hanging around for mack looked regretfully at cora then nodded right lets grab the coins and get out of here and them jd asked we tape them to chairs tod said he took the hammer from balengers hand and tossed it onto the pile of equipment we let ronnie take care of them for us that way hell get blamed the cops will probably also blame him for the guy you threw over the railing please amanda said get me out of here cant help me hey im sorry but youre the reason hes pissed off if we try to take you out of here hell come after you which means hell come after us you cant expect us to be stupid about this you bastard well if thats how youre gonna be get in that chair tod shoved her into it jd grabbed the duct tape from a pile of equipment on the floor sweets get in this chair mack told cora hero you get in this one tod said the remaining chair was propped against the door and big ears you stand against a twobyfour in the wall jd finished taping amanda to the chair securing her ankles and shoulders then he went to cora ill do it mack said balenger saw him feel coras legs and breasts while he worked the tape they put on the heavy knapsacks then went to the vault and stuffed their pockets with coins the weight made their bulging coats and pants droop i hate to waste the pocket space but wed better take walkietalkies in case we get separated tod said moving awkwardly they returned to the door while tod aimed at it mack and jd shifted the furniture away mack opened the door and stepped back thunder boomed rain pelted the balcony a chill breeze gusted in tod shouted to be heard above the storm ronnie you dont need to worry were not taking your girlfriend were leaving her for you and theres a bonus were leaving some new pals of hers too theyre wrapped up like presents all ready for you to enjoy no harms been done well get out of your way maybe you dont know this place is gonna be torn down the salvagers come next week you might want to set up shop someplace else hows that for being helpful sorry we barged in no hard feelings were going now have fun they put on their goggles and headed for the staircase tod hesitated and looked at balenger im an artist do you know that he crossed the room and went into the bedroom straining balenger turned his head and watched him come out with an object in his hands you need this to complete the picture tod said approaching no balenger said the realization of what was about to happen filled him with despair tod threw balengers hard hat away please dont balengers voice broke the object in tods hands was a pillowcase he tugged it over balengers head it reeked of age and dust no balenger begged take it off what would be the fun in that in panicked sightlessness balenger heard tod cross the room so long everybody mack said its been great jd said balenger heard them descending the staircase the sound of their footsteps getting fainter in his tortured memory he sat tied to a wooden chair in a dirty concreteblock building in iraq a sack over his head while the only one of his captors who spoke english threatened to decapitate him until this moment he was certain that nothing more terrifying could ever happen to him now he realized how wrong hed been the second time was worse this was worse thunder booming rain pelting unable to see anything through the pillowcase except the faint light of the candles and the dim beam of the professors headlamp pointing up from between his legs the lamps glow barely pierced the sheet that covered the headless body yes this was worse ducttaped to a chair breathless under the hood knowing that three other people shared the same death sentence waiting for ronnie not being able to see when ronnie arrived not being able to hear his footsteps because of the wind the thunder and the rain ronnie might be standing in front of him right now about to slash with whatever he used to cut off the professors head balengers chest heaved his breathing was so labored he didnt believe he could survive sweat surged from his body from every pore more sweat than he thought could possibly gush from him it soaked his clothes he was hot and then suddenly cold shivering he told himself that now had to end sometime it couldnt be prolonged forever hed managed to make it last a year since iraq a year was something a year more than hed expected but now was about to end thunder shook the building was ronnie standing silently in front of him about to use a scythe or a sword or a butcher knife will i feel the force of the blow before my throat gushes blood and my brain shuts down hero thats what tod called me hero a joke a putdown hero i toss from the same nightmare every night i wake up exhausted afraid to get out of bed i needed every ounce of my remaining strength to force myself to come to this godawful place all of it gone hero the son of a bitch leaving us to die the cocksucker putting this pillowcase over my head i wont let him get away with this ill find him ill track him down ill squeeze my hands around his throat ill vinnie balengers voice was muffled under the pillowcase can you hear me yes can you move at all maybe theres a nail or a jagged edge of wood that you can rub the tape against and cut it too tight balenger heard someone sobbing at first he thought he was disassociating hearing his own sobs then he realized they came from amanda amanda we havent been introduced under the circumstances the normalsounding statement was insane balenger knew but he had to try to calm her if they were going to get out of this they wouldnt be able to do it with someone who was hysterical my names frank thats vinnie over there and coras the gal near you i guess im not supposed to say gal its not politically correct amandas sobs changed rhythm lessening balenger sensed she was puzzled so now that were all acquainted i want you to do something for me do you thinkyou can move the duct tape and get out of the chair trying balenger waited balenger sweated and felt time passing no its too tight cora cant while that bastard was feeling me up he really made the tape secure what are we going to do balenger wondered his hot breath accumulated under the pillowcase threatening to smother him he strained to remember the room to identify something that could help them glass glass on the floor from the table hed broken amanda she sniffled what can you see the broken glass on the floor halfway between me and vinnie pause yes if i can overturn my chair and drag it with me do you think you can give me directions toward the glass yes i really need your help the chair was heavy balenger shifted his weight from one side to the other but the chair resisted when he shifted his weight harder faster the chair started rocking abruptly it was offbalance unable to see and judge the fall he couldnt prepare himself as the chair toppled sideways the shock of hitting the floor startled him he rubbed his head along the carpet hoping to tug off the hood but sweat stuck the material to his head it wouldnt come free no time for all balenger knew ronnie was directly outside the open door smiling that neutral smile amanda had described amused by balengers pathetic efforts holding a knife now balenger told himself crawl although the tape was tight around his ankles he could move his knees by flexing his lower body and pressing his hips forward he dug his right shoulder and the side of his right knee into the carpet and did his best to shove the chair along more sweat gushed from his body groaning he felt the chair move a little harder try harder he told himself his shoulder and knee felt burned by friction against the carpet the chair moved a little farther he gasped with effort amanda how close am i to the broken glass under the pillowcase breath vapor beaded his face twelve feet no itll take me forever try cant move thunder roared the walls shook then an eerie silence gripped the hotel between thunderclaps and rain gusts balenger heard something else distant faint from the direction of the stairwell echoing up a shot what was that vinnie said dont think about it move mustering all his strength balenger inched the chair forward twelve feet away too far cant make it another shot several more rapid god help us vinnie said harder try harder balenger thought he heard screams now far below magnified by the stairwell drifting upward please god help us vinnie said balenger strained moving the chair three inches wait amanda said whats wrong youre going to bump into a coffee table theres a candle youll knock it over and set fire to the room and get burned alive before ronnie cuts off our heads balenger thought on the verge of losing his mind he wanted to shriek until his vocal cords hemorrhaged wheres the table about ten inches to the side of your chair more screams from the stairwell wheres the candle on the corner nearest you im never going to reach the broken glass he thought on the verge of exhaustion he budged the chair in a different direction youre going to hit the table amanda said want to what need the candle the stairwell was now silent twelve feet versus ten inches balenger groaned flexed and shifted the chair thunder roared the corners in front of your face amanda said balenger inhaled as best he could moisture beading his upper lip under the pillowcase the tape was around his upper arms but he was able to flex his elbows and move his forearms he touched the tables smooth metal leg wincing from stress in his elbows and shoulders fearing he would dislocate them he groped higher feeling the tables glass corner just a little higher he thought his elbows and wrists in agony he reached over the tables corner and sobbed with relief when his gloves touched the candle he pulled it from its base and eased it over the tables side he felt wax drip onto his windbreaker holding the candle horizontally he shoved its base between his legs his thighs gripped it firmly seen through the pillowcase the flame was just visible enough for balenger to guide his taped wrists over it he felt heat through his gloves and sleeves duct tape doesnt burn it melts he imagined it bubbling and shriveling as he concentrated to pull his wrists apart the heat intensified in pain he felt the tape softening loosening at once the tape parted he jerked his wrists from the flame and twisted them hard freeing them from the remainder of the tape dizzy from the accumulation of carbon dioxide he tugged the sweatsoaked hood off his head and inhaled greedily it felt glorious to be able to use both hands he grabbed the candle from between his thighs and drew its flame along his left shoulder melting the tape that bound his chest to the chair his windbreaker started to burn the heat felt blistering he transferred the candle to his left hand and used his gloved right hand to stamp out the flames on his chest the stench of melted duct tape made him gag but he stifled the reflex and pulled at the separated tape freeing his shoulders frenzied he bent toward his ankles and melted the tape that secured them to the chair he wavered to his feet tense listening for more sounds in the stairwell he reached down for a shard of glass only to notice a knife among the equipment that had been dumped from the knapsacks sure he thought they had more knives than they needed somebody wanted to make room for more coins a footstep echoed in the stairwell balenger rushed to vinnie and sliced the tape at his shoulders wrists and ankles he heard another footstep higher in the stairwell vinnie took a shard of glass from the floor and ran to cora while balenger ran to amanda the two men hacked at the tape working to free the women lightning cracked in its relatively quiet aftermath the footsteps ascended slow and measured they made balenger think of someone who walked with painful deliberate care because of alcohol or drugs or maybe the sound came from someone so confident of the endgame that he didnt need to hurry cora and amanda yanked away the last of the tape and lunged from their chairs balenger noticed the hammer tod had dropped on the pile of equipment he threw it to vinnie then held his knife in an attack position turn off your headlamps in the candlelight he focused all his attention on the stairwells black mouth the slow footsteps kept rising steady patient a shadow appeared balenger prepared to attack an arm waved up and down a pistol was at the end of it but the arm wasnt aiming the pistol it was moving the pistol the way a blind man would use a cane testing the area before him a head appeared nightvision goggles tattoos tod he emerged from the staircase he looked dazed in the light from the candles balenger saw that he was covered with blood is it are you tod lowered his goggles as if convinced they made him see things that werent real he didnt seem puzzled that balenger vinnie cora and amanda were free of their bonds nor did he look fearful that all four might be able to overpower him before he could defend himself what he did look was relieved thank god he plodded from the weight of the gold coins in his knapsack and pockets he backed from the stairwell gaping at it were gonna need to stick together need all the help we can get are you hurt balenger asked theres blood not mine the sound of rain made tod frown toward the howling darkness beyond the open door no jesus gotta close it gotta barricade it again hurry no time get it shut now ill guard the stairs ill shoot anybody who comes up the stairs but the candlelight revealed that the slide on the pistol was back its magazine was empty give it to me balenger said need it you fired all the rounds in it what you emptied it emptied it vinnie amanda cora shouted help with the door they reclosed it and piled the furniture the spare magazine balenger asked tod where is it tod kept gazing trancelike toward the stairwell give me the damned gun balenger twisted it from his hand amazed at how things had changed a while ago tod would have shot him dead for even looking as if hed try for the gun balenger found the spare magazine in tods belt with military expertise he dropped the empty magazine shoved in the loaded one and pressed the guns release lever so the slide rammed forward and chambered a round it gave him a moments confidence to be armed again balenger aimed toward the stairs what happened not sure tod said he twitched oh i know what happened all right im just not sure how it was done where are your buddies we went down the stairs i know that tell me about we kept going down and down around and around turning and turning at each level there was a passageway like up here but the passageways got longer sure each level below us gets bigger and wider for carlisle to eavesdrop he had to extend the passageways farther to reach all the rooms longer and longer tod said finally we reached the bottom vinnie balenger said you and cora and amanda take off his knapsack dump the coins fill the knapsack with as much equipment as you can stuff into it the rest well carry but there wasnt a door tod said we couldnt find a door his facial tattoos were almost hidden by blood no matter how hard we looked we couldnt find one we ran all the way to the end of the bottom corridor it went on forever we still couldnt find a door but at the end we found something else what a body amanda made a noise in her throat shed been dead a long time tod said she a dress the body wore a dress an oldfashioned dress but she looked like a mummy thats how long shed been dead all dried up her eye sockets hollow hard to tell with the green from the goggles but i think her hair was blond like hers tod indicated amanda the corpse was sitting in a corner like shed run there and got tired and sat down to rest and never woke up she even had her purse in her lap amandas throat made that noise again we ran back to the staircase mack was so panicked he raised the crowbar to knock a hole in the wall so we could get out but before he could swing it somebody pounded on the other side ronnie amanda said i could see where the wall trembled i fired at it then the pounding was somewhere else and i fired at that suddenly the pounding was all along the wall and i fired and fired mack and jd ran up the stairs i followed turning and turning around and around above me i heard a scream mack he fell toward me his legs were split open his blood sprayed like it came from a hose he dropped through the space between the stairs and the railing what cut him jd yelled i didnt have a chance to say anything the room with the vault jd yelled we know how to get out of that room he raced up the stairs all of a sudden he was falling his legs were split open his blood was spraying i thought id lost my mind i wanted to run but i warned myself i had to slow down to find whatever was on the stairs so i inched up waving the gun in front of me and thats when i touched it touched a wire strung across the staircase tight thin even with the goggles i could hardly see it i felt it with the gun then i touched it with my finger jesus it was so sharp all i needed was a little nudge for it to cut me razor wire balenger said maybe i did lose my mind i eased under the wire i inched up the stairs waving the gun searching for other wires you left mack and jd alive down there believe me the way they were bleeding they werent going to live long from the stairwell far below someone screamed it sounds like one of them lived longer than you expected balenger said another scream weve all lost our minds cora said but how did ronnie he followed you down balenger said he was behind us on the stairs tod looked startled when you reached the bottom he rigged the wire above you then he used a hidden door to enter the main part of the hotel he pounded on the wall to panic you into running upstairs tod pulled out a cell phone what are you doing vinnie asked calling my brother in atlantic city hell tell the police hell get help you finally decided going to prison was better than facing ronnie cora asked in disgust my brotherll save me tod finished pressing numbers and shoved the phone to his ear my brotherll get the police here and listening he moaned no no no whats wrong thunder rumbled out of service tod said the fucking storms interfering with the phone guess you should have called a little sooner huh vinnie said his face red with fury we ought to tape you to the chair and let ronnie do what he wants to you but you wont youre sure of that you think im not pissed off at you enough to you cant afford to were pals now tod said dont you get it we need to stick together you need all the help you can get vinnie told balenger we stuffed as much equipment as we could into the knapsack what didnt fit we hooked to our belts the policereport file is still in the slot in the knapsack i guess they didnt know it was there otherwise theyd have dumped that also you want a souvenir vinnie gave him a coin balenger held it feeling its weight its thickness its perfect edges a magnificent eagle was on one side on the other a buxom lady liberty carried a torch the gold seemed to glow twenty dollars in god we trust thats a great word souvenir it means we might live to remember this heres hoping balenger kissed it and put it in a pocket maybe itll bring us luck cora pointed this is the equipment we jeff for you balenger put on the remaining tool belt he hooked a walkietalkie to it along with the hammer and a halffull water bottle wheres the crowbar i told you mack had it tod said you damned stupid balenger studied the air meters and left them they were luxuries now heres something else we can leave he held up the water pistol must have thrown it away in favor of carrying more coins give it to me cora raised it to her nostrils as if hoping it retained her dead husbands scent but the disgusted shake of her head indicated that all she smelled was vinegar amanda looked frozen here take my windbreaker vinnie put it around her she zipped it over her nightgown looking grateful for the warmth the windbreaker was long enough to cover her hips ready balenger asked for what tod said theres nothing we can do we can take the high ground high ground what are you talking about the penthouse balenger picked up his hard hat where tod had thrown it its light was out he flicked the switch nothing happened you piece of shit you broke the headlamp penthouse tod said appalled i cant amanda shuddered thats where ronnie takes me there are other hidden staircases im sure of it balenger said bitterly examining the useless lamp on his hard hat they all lead to the penthouse ronnie cant guard them all we might be able to find a staircase that gets us out of here before he realizes were gone yeah and we might pick one that leads us straight to him tod said your way he knows where we are and he comes for us weve got a gun with only twelve rounds left thanks to you and how do you know ronnie doesnt have a gun also tod looked sick you should dump those coins balenger pointed at tods bulging pockets the weight will slow you down no way am i tossing that much money vinnie and cora have headlamps wheres your flashlight lost it fucking great which leaves this one that mack or jd dropped so he could carry more coins vinnie indicated the flashlight holstered to his belt not much light wed better blow out these candles and take them with us balenger said and something else when he was taped to the chair with the pillowcase over him waiting for ronnie to cut off his head balenger had told himself that there couldnt be anything more nightmarish hed be forced to suffer but the pattern of his life made him realize he was wrong things got worse they always got worse and what he needed to do now proved it he turned toward the professors headless body on the sofa between conklins legs the headlamp continued to glow up through the sheet seized by revulsion balenger lifted the edge of the bloodsoaked sheet and felt under it his trembling hands touched the professors beard with greater revulsion he pried the chin strap free and tugged the hard hat away feeling the professors head tilt he pulled the hat from under the sheet and almost wept at the blood on it sorry bob he said im so sorry he put the lamp on his head and felt his muscles cramp lets go after a cautious look down the stairwell balenger climbed toward the penthouse he heard footsteps on metal below him the others following as he was about to press up on a hatch amanda said theres a switch to the side behind the twobyfour on the wall to your right ronnie always presses it before he lifts the door i think it shuts off a trap of some kind balenger felt behind the board touched a switch and flicked it he pushed at the hatch to his relief and then suspicion it rose smoothly with none of the creak of hinges hed heard in the rest of the hotel what he heard instead was the increased din of the storm the skylight didnt extend this far no rain poured through but the rain did its best to penetrate pounding relentlessly on the roof the light on balengers hard hat revealed a dark chamber a chair a bureau a canopied bed wallpaper all were in a lush victorian style his nostrils picked up the smell of strong household cleaners wary he peered along the floor and noticed a lever that the rising trapdoor had flipped upward the lever was linked to wires that led to a metal box he imagined what would have happened if amanda hadnt remembered to tell him about the switch looks like explosives i guess ronnie figured if the wrong person came up here it was time to make sure the evidence was destroyed continuing to scan his light around the room balenger climbed all the way up and aimed his pistol toward the shadows tod amanda cora and vinnie followed their headlamps and vinnies flashlight searched the room no dust no cobwebs cora sounded puzzled amandas voice shook ronnie keeps it absolutely spotless when vinnie shut the trapdoor he discovered a bolt on it and rammed it into a metal slot anchored to the floor no way to free the bolt from underneath compared to the chill of danatas suite balenger noticed the penthouse was curiously warm hurry we need to find the other trapdoors and lock them before ronnie gets to one of them he headed toward a door straight ahead no thats the bathroom amanda said balenger shifted toward a door on the left and suddenly a blazing light filled the room it was overhead making him shield his eyes with his left hand while he crouched ready with the pistol in his right how did amanda stood against a wall her hand on a switch the penthouse has electricity the information was so surprising balenger took a moment to adjust to it now he understood why the penthouse felt warmthe heating system was on tods single word expressed his dismay but also functioned as an unintentional prayer christ balenger ran to the next room groped for a switch and flicked it another overhead light assaulted his eyes blinking he saw an array of electronic equipment and monitors ronnies surveillance system amanda explained turn everything on along the wall to his left balenger noticed that a metal shutter was smaller than those hed seen elsewhere in the hotel but what he concentrated on was a trapdoor in the floor below it the door was bolted shut it too had a lever with wires attached to a metal box the next rooms door took him in a new direction balenger had a sudden mental image of the penthouse divided into four quadrants two rooms per quadrant the interior of each quadrant faced a wall that separated it from the hotels center column where the grand staircase had been when he flicked the light switch he saw a library floortoceiling wooden shelves countless leatherbound books two victorian reading chairs another locked trapdoor another lever with wires to a metal box his unease intensified a row of shelves along the inside wall had no books in their place the eyepieces of small telescopes projected from holes in the wall another way carlisle used to monitor what happened in the hotel a primitive version of ronnies surveillance system the next room transported balenger from to more than a century later it was a modern media room with a flatscreen tv a surroundsound system a dvd player a vhs player racks of dvds and videotapes and a sofa on which to enjoy them again wires led from a bolted hatch to a metal box the subsequent door led to another quadrant balenger faced a kitchen in a s style the refrigerator and stove the avocadogreen color popular during that era sure he thought ronnie could carry video and audio equipment in here by himself and not be noticed but getting a new fridge and stove in here not to mention the equipment to remodel the kitchen would have attracted a lot of attention even the sink was green but a gourmets array of copper pots and pans hung from hooks in the ceiling a hatch the same as the others the schizoid pattern continued in the next room for when balenger flicked the light switch he was again in looking at a victorian dining room another hatch no different from the others more eyepieces in the wall now a door to the right another quadrant an overhead light revealed primitive exercise equipment an early version of a treadmill and a stationary bicycle balenger imagined carlisle laboring on them trying to build the muscle tone and stamina that along with steroids and vitamin supplements helped him combat his bleeding but the heavy weights in the corner had to be ronnies not carlisles the strain of the weights on carlisles body would have caused bleeding in his muscles rather than have helped prevent it where balenger expected to find a bolted wired hatch and a small metal shutter he saw a compartment with a door a button was next to the door an elevator aiming he opened the door finding a brass gate and dark shaft he closed the door and pushed several weights against it then he hurried to the final quadrant where vinnie stood looking troubled having come through a door in the bedroom and turned on the light as cora amanda and tod caught up to balenger he saw another bolted wired hatch but this time what made him frown was a primitive medical clinic a glass cabinet filled with medicines hypodermics a doctors examining table stainlesssteel poles with hooks from which bottles containing blood transfusions would have been linked to a needle in carlisles bruised arm the desperation was insane how do you stop a hemophiliac from bleeding after youve stuck a needle in his arm to give him medication to try to prevent him from bleeding all the trapdoors are secured balenger said we bought some time vinnie said but wed better find a way to disconnect those explosives in case ronnie has a way of setting them off by remote control everyone looked at balenger for guidance he felt helpless in the rangers explosives werent my specialty but you must have had some training in them amanda said not enough balenger crossed toward the metal box behind him he heard tod ask how come the shutters on the windows are so small we told you carlisle was agoraphobic vinnie said open spaces terrified him he never left the hotel except once balenger thought remembering that the old man shot himself on the beach the only views he could have tolerated cora said were through small windows what a nutjob tod shifted several vials examining them never heard of some of this stuff theyre bloodclotting agents vinnie said not this one its morphine did he like to shoot up carlisle needed it for the pain when blood seeped into his joints into his joints now ive heard everything the label on the morphines from tod looked tempted to put it in his pocket then thought better stuff probably doesnt work anymore its probably poison by now balenger unzipped his windbreaker and shoved the pistol into his shoulder holster kneeling he studied the wires connected to the lever hooked over the trapdoor you might want to be in another room while i do this they didnt move except tod guess im the only one with the brains to take cover he went into the bedroom if that thing blows up i have a feeling it wont make a difference where we are cora said vinnie knelt beside him besides how can we help if we dont see what youre doing balenger gave them a look of respect then held his breath and pulled the wires from plugs on the lever he exhaled and gently lifted the boxs lid they peered over his shoulder plastic explosive balenger managed to keep his voice calm the detonators pushed into a block of the stuff the thing that looks like a short pencil is that the detonator cora asked yes theres some kind of electronic device hooked to it when the trapdoor rises it flips the lever and brings these wires in contact with another pair of wires that closes a batterydriven circuit and triggers the detonator can the electronic device be activated by remote control vinnie asked dont know it might also be programmed to blow up if anybody cuts the wires the simplest tactic balenger steadied himself is to pull the detonator from the block of explosive maybe motion also sets it off vinnie said then were back to where we started and we wait to see if ronnie can trigger these bombs from a distance damned if we do damned if we dont vinnie said were damned all right amanda said balenger wiped sweat from his brow he reached into the metal box then hesitated and took off his gloves again he reached into the box thunder made him flinch working to control his trembling fingers he gently pulled the detonator out he lifted the block of explosive from the boxit felt like puttyand set it a distance away vinnie stepped back isnt that dangerous to move you mean like nitroglycerin and the slightest jolt blows it up no balenger dried his palms on his jeans plastic explosives stable you can pound it with a hammer you can throw it against a wall you can hold a lit match against it the stuff wont go off unless theres a preliminary explosion with enough heat to do the job he pointed toward the block hed put aside right now thats one of the least dangerous things in this hotel im not encouraged cora said six to go balenger said with the tone of someone rolling a boulder up a hill if ronnie can trigger these things by remote control once we remove the explosives only the detonators will go off but even they have a kick stay away from them urgency accumulating in him he headed toward the bedroom to disable the bomb in there theres an elevator in the exercise room he said to amanda does it work i dont know cora you said you couldnt find keys for some of the rooms yes the penthouse danatas suite and a column of rooms from three twentyeight all the way up to six twentyeight i think we know whats behind the doors to those rooms the shaft for carlisles private elevator all these lights vinnie said maybe they can be seen from outside maybe someone will come and help us no amanda said no one can see the lights ronnie bragged that the penthouse was completely blacked out balenger cursed and hurried to the trapdoor in the bedroom i watched what you did vinnie told him ill work on some of the other boxes slow and careful bet on it tod balenger shouted im in the surveillance room watching the monitors balenger went to the door on the opposite side of the bedroom and peered inside an array of screens showed greentinted nightvision images tods facial tattoos were rigid with concentration maybe well get a look at what this psychos doing the top row of monitors displayed various angles of the hotels exterior but the rain was so dense that balenger had difficulty seeing the outside walls and metal shutters a lower row of screens revealed parts of the hotels dark interior the lobby the collapsed staircase the fire stairs and the utility room where a hidden camera was aimed toward the door through which theyd entered from the tunnel the door was open confirming balengers suspicion that tods group had failed to shut it after following their quarry into the building so far all i saw were rats a bird and a freaky cat with three back legs tod said the cats beginning to seem normal balenger didnt recognize one of the interior images a deserted garage area where the camera was aimed toward a metal door that must be where ronnie comes into the hotel balenger said he hurried back to the bedroom where he disconnected the wires from the trapdoors lever he lifted the metal boxs lid and separated the detonator from the explosive two down three he heard vinnie say from another room four cora said from farther away this is him amanda said balenger wasnt sure what she meant as rain pounded the roof he looked up and saw her holding a framed photograph ronnie she said pointing at the photograph this is ronnie chilled balenger came slowly to his feet fixated on what amanda showed him in the blackandwhite photograph an elderly man wearing a suit stood next to a young man wearing a sweater the old mans broad shoulders would once have looked strong his large chest would once have been solid despite deep wrinkles his squarejawed face retained a suggestion of his youthful handsomeness his full head of white hair reminded balenger of billy graham in his later years indeed everything about the old man especially his piercing eyes reminded balenger of an evangelist morgan carlisle he whispered this is how bob described him those hypnotic eyes in the photograph carlisle smiled as did the young man next to him who seemed barely out of his teens a thin face a thin body even his hair which was trimmed closely at the sides and was thick on top emphasized his thinness unlike carlisles eyes the young mans were not expressive nor was his smile which seemed entirely on the surface ronnie amanda said in disgust balenger studied the photograph more intensely a dark woodpaneled wall in the background matched walls in the hotel despite the pleasure in carlisles smile the elderly man kept a slight distance from the young man his arms at his sides the young mans sweater was a crew neck a shirt collar tucked under it in a style balenger remembered seeing in movies from the sixties he had a plain face soft at the cheekbones and the chin amanda pointed this other man was ronnies father carlisle no he couldnt have been ronnie insisted that this man was his father theres no record that carlisle married which means nothing vinnie said from the doorway to the surveillance room he and cora had finished disarming the explosives the child could have been the result of an affair but carlisle was a watcher a romantic fling doesnt seem in his nature unless one of the women he spied on gave him inspiration cora came into the room and looked at the photo carlisle so finally we get to see him the monster responsible for the paragon hotel how can anybody so twisted look so attractive i bet this sob was irresistible in his prime those eyes finding a willing partner wouldnt have been difficult or maybe the partner wasnt willing vinnie said balenger shook his head from side to side rape doesnt match his profile even drugged the victim might have fought back carlisle would have been terrified of cuts and scratches and not being able to stop his bleeding but if carlisle had a son hed have mentioned it in his diary cora insisted not if the boy was illegitimate vinnie said he might have wanted to keep the child a secret balenger sounded doubtful it still doesnt fit his profile from what ive read about hemophiliacs i gather many choose not to have children for fear of passing the disease on amanda pointed emphatically at the photograph ronnie told me this was his father how old is the photograph cora asked balenger freed catches at the back of the frame pulled off the back and studied the rear of the photograph theres a developers date july carlisle would have been eightyeight balenger heard the crack of nearby lightning amanda you said ronnies in his fifties that means vinnie did the math faster thirtyseven years ago im guessing hes in his late teens or early twenties in this picture lets say twenty so that makes him around fiftyseven surely to god five of us can take him hes strong amanda said flatly tod anything on the surveillance monitors just more rats im watching the elevator vinnie peered through the medical room toward the exercise room amanda what else did ronnie tell you balenger asked he bragged he never had any trouble getting girlfriends he often recited their names names balengers hands felt cold iris alice vivian joan rebecca michelle a lot more always in the same order the list never varied he repeated it enough for me to remember the names balenger felt pressure building inside him he worked to control his emotions his rapid breathing and heartbeat almost overwhelming him i want you to think carefully when he went through the names did he ever mention someone called diane diane vinnie frowned who is did he amanda balenger put a hand on her shoulder did he ever mention a woman called diane amanda didnt answer for a moment near the end of the list whos diane cora asked mystified now it was balengers turn to pause he could barely get out the words my wife am wife cora whispered in shock balenger looked at tod in the surveillance room what i told you was the truthim not a cop he hesitated but i used to be tod shook his head in disgust and that stuff about iraq and the hood over your head and the guy with the sword was true i was a detective on asbury parks police force my wife and i live lived here she works worked i have trouble with tenses when i think about her two years ago she disappeared they listened so intently that despite the rain the bedroom seemed quiet she was blond thin like amanda thirtythree but she looked younger in her twenties like amanda balenger stared down at his clenched hands when mack pulled the vault door open and i saw amanda in there god help me at first i thought she was diane i thought id finally found her that a miracle had happened and my wife was still alive balengers chest ached as he stared at amanda who reminded him so much of his wife diane worked for a real estate developer here in town the same developer wholl be tearing down this hotel in two weeks she often went to new york city to negotiate with the carlisle trust for the land the paragon sits on the trust kept refusing its a damned cruel joke that the trust eventually had to surrender the land for taxes but two years ago it still had control and on dianes last trip to manhattan she vanished balenger drew a pained breath a lot of people disappear in new york i used to go there on weekends and unofficially help the missing persons bureau leg work shoe leather finally the case got so cold i was the only person doing anything i kept asking for more time off work to look for diane until my boss suggested it would be better if i resigned and took all the time i wanted i ran out of money then an exranger buddy told me about the quick cash to be earned in iraq guarding convoys provided i didnt mind dodging booby traps and snipers hell at that point i didnt much care if i lived or died what i did care about was the twenty thousand dollars id earn for one months work so i could get back to trying to find out what happened to my wife balenger forced himself to continue after a year i didnt have much hope she was still alive but i needed to keep trying it gives you an idea how desperate i was that i went to iraq again diane had gotten me back on my feet after the first time damned gulf war syndrome she never tired of nursing me it was her idea that i use my military experience and apply for a job with the asbury park police nothing demanding a way to feel useful fucking iraq i told you how the second time turned out but with the cash i got i made myself keep searching i followed every lead every sex criminal who might have come in contact with her every mugger who was known to work in the areas where she went double and triplechecked in the end all i had was the feeling id had from the start but couldnt prove that dianes disappearance had something to do with the negotiations for the hotel no not the negotiations exactly something to do with the hotel itself i asked permission to go inside but the trust refused safety reasons i did my best to break in but the paragons a damned fortress balengers voice tightened three months ago i read a newspaper article about urban explorers how their expeditions are like specialops missions and how some of them have a genius for infiltrating buildings that are supposedly impregnable i checked urbanexplorer websites and approached a group but i made the mistake of telling the first group why i needed their help getting in they treated me like i was an undercover agent wearing a wire with the next group i tried to convince them to take me into the hotel because it was a fascinating old building but they didnt trust an outsider any more than the first group did plus there were plenty of old buildings they already had plans to explore so i used the professors website next and arranged to meet him this time i tried the greed motive i showed him copies of old newspaper articles from when danata was killedrumors about gold coins the gangster supposedly hoarded in a secret vault bob was polite he said hed look into it i figured he was brushing me off but it turned out hed just been fired and a week later he phoned and said hed help me on one condition that youd get some of the coins for him vinnie said yes he admired you and cora and rick so much he was certain you wouldnt agree to take the coins he was afraid about his health and how hed pay for his heart treatments he was angry about losing his professorship you cant imagine how angry so the deal was youd unknowingly help me search the hotel for some clue about what happened to diane then id come back the next night and get the coins for the professor of course once i knew how to get in i also planned to do a lot more searching i know ronnie kept at least one other woman here amanda said what makes you sure in the dark in the vault the first time he locked me in i touched something on the floor about a halfinch long and wide one end was smooth the other jagged i didnt want to admit to myself what it was a broken fingernail rain lashed the building amanda pulled the windbreaker around her you need to understand what it was like we had candlelight dinners ronnie made me watch him prepare elaborate gourmet menus the best wine cds of bach or handel or brahms playing in the background amanda grimaced we spent hours reading in the library often he read to me out loud philosophy history literary novels hes especially fond of proust in search of lost time lost time her voice wavered he made me discuss what we read i think thats one of the reasons he kidnapped mebecause i worked in a bookstore we watched movies always art movies most were foreign with subtitles cocteaus beauty and the beast bergmans the seventh seal renoirs the rules of the game all about the past he never let me watch regular television he never let me have any idea of what was going on in the world or how long id been here with the shutters closed i didnt have any sense of whether it was day or night there werent any clocks i couldnt tell hours from days i had no way of calculating weeks i couldnt depend on my body rhythms to give me a sense of time for some meals ronnie made me eat when i wasnt the least bit hungry for other meals he made me wait till i was starving in the vault i couldnt tell if i was dozing for a few minutes or sleeping for hours he must have slept also cora said how did he stop you from getting away from him except for the first time when i woke in that damned bed the only place he ever let me sleep was the vault when i was with him he never turned his back on me he kept a metal belt locked to my waist the belt had a box on it like the ones by the trapdoors he said if i tried to escape he could blow me in half even if i was a mile away he said the charge was shaped to blow inward so that even if he was in the room with me he wouldnt be injured wheres the belt balenger asked amanda made a futile gesture i dont know weve got to find it his nerves on fire balenger pulled out bureau drawers searching them he heard cora going through the closet vinnie looked under the bed nothing cora said ill check the medical room and ill take the exercise room balenger said vinnie you take the wait a minute vinnie stared upward he grabbed a post on the bed and used it for support while he stepped up onto the ornate bedspread he stretched and peered over the canopys top there it is got it amanda looked sick when he stepped down with a metal belt that had a box attached to it balenger tugged at the lid but it wouldnt come off sealed i cant disarm the i see him tod said what balenger whirled toward the surveillance room the son of a bitch is waving at me on one of the screens balenger charged into the surveillance room the others followed on the bottom right monitor tinted green by a nightvision camera a tall thin plainfaced man waved at them silently saying either hello or goodbye amanda began to weep at least it seemed that he was plainfaced hard to be sure when the mans eyes were covered with what balenger had feared he would have nightvision goggles unlike the ones that dangled around tods neck these were streamlined almost elegant the latest hightech version he had a weak chin his thin nose was a counterpart to his thin lips the babysoft look of his skin made the wrinkles on his brow and around his mouth seem painted on his saltandpepper hair was receding he wore a dark suit a white shirt and a conservative striped tie he always dresses that way amanda said never takes his coat off never loosens his tie never vinnie asked but how did i recognize him balenger said what he turned toward cora and vinnie the professor described him for us remember a blankfaced bureaucratic type in his fifties no expression the guy in charge of carlisles trust vinnie looked startled i spoke with him several times after my wife disappeared the son of a bitch said diane spent an hour in his office the day it happened he showed me her name in his appointment book eleven in the morning after their meeting he said he had a lunch appointment and he had no idea where she went but he doesnt call himself ronnie the name he uses is walter harrigan not walter carlisle cora asked so much for his claim that hes carlisles son but why does he use different names vinnie asked who is he on the monitor ronnie pointed toward something behind him when he moved balenger saw that ronnie was in the utility room that the door to the tunnel was now shut more than shut balenger realized jesus whats he done to it cora asked a metal bar seemed to hang in midair in front of the door no balenger thought in dismay not in front of the door on the door ronnie pointed toward something next to it what the hell is that tod said a metal cylinder resembled the kind of tank that scuba divers used the tank was on a cart a slender hose was attached to the tank a short pole with a handle was attached to the other end of the hose a mask with thick glass was propped against the cart balenger felt nauseous vinnie answered welders tools god help us he welded a bar across the door theres no way out balenger stared down at the metal box in his hands all the time he watched the monitor he tugged fiercely at the lid but the seal held firm he feared that at any moment ronnie would press a remote detonator need to get rid of this he rushed to the trapdoor in the surveillance room cora free the bolt holding the belt with his left hand he drew his pistol with his right open the trapdoor maybe this is a trick maybe were watching a video maybe ronnies actually waiting under this trapdoor balenger aimed if he is ill blow him to hell vinnie shine your flashlight at the opening ready cora do it open the trapdoor cora pulled it up vinnies flashlight blazed into the darkness of another spiral staircase balenger reached under the curved handrail and dropped the belt and the box they plummeted clattering off metal cora slammed the trapdoor shut while she locked it and balenger darted back tod said the bastards doing something else balenger whirled toward the monitor there ronnie continued to display his neutral smile as he pointed toward something indistinct on a wall to the side whats that on the floor vinnie asked its moving tod said water from the storm cora realized ronnie stepped sideways through the rippling water and reached the object on the wall it was so far to the side that the camera hardly showed it the object had a handle no amanda said realizing what it was an electrical transformer looking surreal in his goggles suit and tie amid the water rippling in the utility room ronnie waved again almost looking enthusiastic now definitely communicating goodbye he pulled down the lever the lights went out the monitors became blank the rain pounding the roof seemed to get louder as the group found itself for the first time in absolute darkness not even the skylight was available to show flashes from the storm to balenger the darkness seemed to have density and weight compressing around him squeezing cora gasped fabric rustled the sound of vinnies arm moving as he turned his headlamp on so did balenger and cora the beams darting around the surveillance room give me the flashlight tod told vinnie it gleamed for the previous four and a half hours balenger had been in semidarkness he had almost gotten used to it by contrast the bright lights of the penthouse had at first seemed unnatural paining him but how quickly he had adjusted to them and now how quickly the semidarkness was hateful amanda cora asked im okay fine but she didnt sound fine at all i can handle this i can handle this she said unconvincingly unseen lightning cracked ive been through worse she spoke rapidly being in the vault was worse being alone was worse alone vinnie said puzzled but nows our chance tod said chance balenger asked what do you mean hes down in the basement we can use one of these staircases to get to the ground floor i hate to agree with this creep vinnie said but hes right weve got seven staircases to choose from ronnie can be in only one at a time but which staircase cora asked you said you couldnt find an exit down there and he saidtod indicated balengerthere must be secret doors which staircase cora repeated the one we already used is too obvious or maybe its so obvious ronnie wont think of it tod said im not going down that one vinnie pointed toward the trapdoor where balenger had thrown the metal box all ronnie needs to do is press a remote detonator and that sound what is it amanda said just the storm its bugging my nerves too something else from in there amanda pointed toward the bedroom i hear it too cora turned not the bedroom the exercise room balenger said the elevator tod blurted lights zigzagging they ran toward the medical room where they stared through the doorway into the exercise room despite the pounding of the rain balenger heard the whir of cables and gears the whir got louder behind the closed door the elevator rose if ronnies in the elevator he cant stop us from going down the stairs tod said vinnie scowled at the closed door how do we know hes in there hes gotta be somebodys gotta be in there to run the controls but what if the elevator works like a dumbwaiter balenger asked what if carlisle arranged for outside controls so his meals could be sent up without a waiter intruding on him well if that jerkoff isnt in the elevator who is or what is im not sure i want to hang around and find out vinnie said the elevator stopped below them although the rain persisted the absence of the whir made the room seem tensely quiet then the whir began again the elevator rising must be on a separate electrical circuit cora murmured when it gets here shoot the door tod urged its wood the bullets will i dont shoot what i cant see balenger told him there might be a policeman behind that door you want to open it and find out the group stared at the door concentrating on the stillness behind it then the stillness changed to the rattle of the interior gate being pushed aside shoot tod yelled you in the elevator balenger aimed identify yourself pussy give me that gun tod grabbed for it but balenger whacked the barrel against his forehead knocking him to the floor balenger whirled and realigned his aim as something thumped against the door he motioned everyone into the medical room then he pushed the weights from the door and took cover behind the treadmill the door budged outward he tensed his finger on the trigger as the door opened slightly revealing a portion of what seemed to be an empty compartment tod groaned on the floor the door opened farther balenger saw motion tods flashlight remained in his hand gleaming across the floor it revealed rats scurrying from the elevator three eight a dozen some with open sores others with no ears or two tails or only one eye squealing in the lights from the headlamps some leapt under the stationary bike or onto the treadmill veering when they saw balenger following others that scrambled into the other rooms cora screamed but not because of the rats a figure stumbled from the elevator balenger almost fired but suddenly recognized the bloody jeans and windbreaker the muscular torso bent forward in pain the blood so much blood a wooden spike sticking into the figures chest rick cora ran to him wait balenger said but his warning was too late rick tripped over tods squirming body lurched into cora and knocked both of them to the floor coras hard hat clattered away balenger rushed to the empty compartment aiming he shouldered the door all the way open as his headlamp dispelled the shadows he studied the ceiling but didnt see a trapdoor through which ronnie could have squeezed up and hidden himself he now realized that the compartment wasnt totally empty though on the floor in a corner mocking him were the five bottles of urine that had been abandoned on the fourth level vinnie use the weights to keep this door and the gate from closing as long as theyre open the elevator cant go down balenger turned toward cora and rick rick was on top of her gasping from pain she struggled to get free balenger turned rick over and saw that the fall had rammed the spike deeper into his chest ricks lung made a whistling sound his front teeth were broken away his lower left arm projected at a right angle to his side jesus cora said rick she wiped his bloodsmeared forehead baby vinnie hurried to prop a weight against the elevator door cora stroked ricks face his eyes were unfocused his chest heaved continuing to whistle balenger looked over his shoulder toward the medical room help me get him on the exam table together he amanda and cora lifted him rick moaned cora pressed his shoulders down to keep him from rolling off the table amanda propped the flashlight on the counter well need more light ill get the candles from vinnies knapsack balenger used his knife to cut open ricks windbreaker sweater and shirt as amanda and vinnie lit candles the increased illumination showed an alarming amount of blood streaming from ricks chest the spikes all the way through balenger said hang on baby cora told rick stroking his brow hang on but rick didnt seem to hear if i take out the spike he might hemorrhage worse than he is now but if i dont ricks groan communicated his agony cant we at least help him with the pain cora begged the morphine no itll kill him balenger said surely just a little morphine depresses heart rate and blood pressure balenger felt ricks wrist i can hardly find a pulse as it is pull the spike out use duct tape to stop the bleeding the way you did with the professor balenger couldnt think of an alternative see if theres rubbing alcohol in that cabinet vinnie yanked open the glass door wait balenger said but never mind balenger said ricks lung stopped wheezing his chest became still no cora said frantic she stared into ricks eyes searching for a sign of consciousness she opened his mouth and breathed into it in horror she stopped when the air whistled past the spike in his chest twice she sobbed oh baby oh jesus twice weeping uncontrollably she held ricks head against her chest twice amanda put an arm around her thunder rumbled in its aftermath they heard the crackle of static balenger frowned toward his equipment belt and then toward vinnies more static what the vinnie stared down it came from the remaining two walkietalkies balengers mind swirled with a sense that he shifted deeper into madness he raised his unit to his mouth and pressed the transmit button you took a walkietalkie from one of the men you killed balenger said as youll learn im resourceful the voice was smooth calm neutral in the tenor range its pronunciation precise with a hint of an elitist accent it made amanda jerk a hand to her mouth your friend didnt drop all the way to the lobby i found him in a pile of wreckage two levels down he actually had the strength to help me put him in the elevator remarkable how is he progressing he isnt balenger said into the walkietalkie ah the voice said static youre violating my home the voice said its not as if you had any no trespassing signs around the place the only good thing is if we hadnt come in we never would have been able to rescue amanda cora raised her tearstreaked face from ricks body amanda has no need of being rescued the voice said i treat her with the greatest respect many women would envy her except for being molested i never touched her that way ever for the first time the voice contained a hint of emotion if she told you i did she lied balenger frowned he remembered several puzzled questions vinnie had tried to ask her was ronnie telling the truth what about your other girlfriends balenger asked into the walkietalkie what are their names iris alice vivian abruptly something about the list troubled him the names something about the names but so much was happening he didnt have time to figure out what bothered him ive been honored with an abundance of female companionship is that one of them dead in the downstairs corridor static dreading the answer balenger forced himself to ask what didyou do with my wife static if you surrender i promise you wont feel pain the voice said abruptly cora grabbed the walkietalkie furious she yelled into it you prick i promise you something pacing angrily in front of the medicine cabinet she shouted when i get my hands on you ill the floor exploded balenger lurched back wood disintegrated at coras feet as a shotgun roared from below blood sprayed from coras abdomen another roar slammed her against the medicine cabinet shattering glass a third blast a fourth more wood erupting from the floor buckshot tearing cora open she dropped to her knees agonized surprise contorting her face she toppled to the gaping floor her blood spreading dripping through the holes a candle fell with her but her blood extinguished it the startling moment lengthened as the smell of burnt gunpowder drifted up through the holes balengers reflexes took control he tugged amanda and vinnie to the outside wall his frenzied heartbeat making him lightheaded hes on the balcony below us he whispered cora shouted so loud he heard where she was from below through the holes in the floor balenger heard a shotgun being reloaded coras headlamp lay on the floor he stretched to reach it then gave it to amanda he raised a finger to his lips urging her and vinnie to be silent he motioned for them to follow him into the bedroom his muscles contracted anticipating more shotgun blasts through the floor he reached the bedroom his headlamp crisscrossing the darkness something else was wrong tod where was the last balenger remembered tod was groaning on the floor holding his head where balenger struck him with the pistol now balenger turned and scanned with his headlamp tod was gone as balenger looked at vinnie to warn him the longing on vinnies face made him pause staring toward coras body vinnie was devastated tears streaming down his cheeks the woman he loved gone forever vinnies anguish intensified balengers own grief to lose the person you loved he understood all too sharply the hell vinnie suffered balenger tugged vinnies sleeve urging him to move for her part amanda seemed to have passed through an emotional frenzy incapable of anything except a desperation to survive she followed balengers lead as they crept through the surveillance room and into the library theyd been forced to abandon the flashlight that amanda set on the counter next to the examination table now all they had were three headlamps the lights converged on the librarys trapdoor which to balengers surprise was open tod must have hurried down the staircase while ronnie was distracted balenger realized a further thought gave him hopemaybe tod can be a distraction for us maybe hell make enough noise to lead ronnie away balenger locked the trapdoor and moved softly into the kitchen he drew his pistol and aimed toward the trapdoor there vinnie lifted it but the only thing their headlamps revealed was another empty staircase balenger descended first he had to move slowly probing the air with his pistol to test for razor wire they crept downward constantly turning the revolving flash of headlamps was dizzying the stairwell amplified the noise from the storm approaching the fifth level balenger heard water streaming then realized that the sound didnt come from the rain outside but from something in the stairwell his headlamp reflected off a torrent rushing along a hidden corridor a flash of lightning revealed a huge hole in the roof the water on the upper levels channeling into it the crash of water cascading down the stairwell reminded balenger of a cistern being filled at once his headlamp showed an object floating along the corridor a corpse amanda gasped when she saw it a desiccated woman dressed holding a purse blond diane balenger wondered in dismay but before he had a chance to see more the stream carried the corpse into the stairwell and it disappeared into the roaring darkness we cant get out this way balenger realized for all he knew ronnie was on the opposite side of the wall about to blast a hole with his shotgun he motioned for amanda and vinnie to retreat to the penthouse they didnt need encouragement and he followed them as they scrambled through the hatch in shadows breathing hoarsely they sank to the kitchens floor well try another staircase amanda murmured maybe vinnie said without conviction he raised his head slowly or maybe we dont need to do a thing what do you mean balenger asked in confusion the professor left a note with a colleague when the professor doesnt call him by nine this morning the colleagues supposed to open the note and tell the police where to send help they were so close to the outside wall that the pounding of the rain cloaked their muted voices no balenger said bob didnt leave a note but when bob got fired he stopped trusting people in his department he assumed the colleague would open the note and show it to the dean to get brownie points bob was afraid wed all get arrested vinnie tried another plan how about this the salvagers come on monday theyll rescue us all we need to do is wait for a day ronnie can arrange plenty of surprises if we give him that much time i told you before if were passive well lose then what are we going to do static crackled from the walkietalkies hes trying to get me to talk balenger spoke softly hes hoping hell hear my voice and have something to shoot at that could work the other way around amanda murmured if you hear him talking you can shoot at his voice balenger debated tell me more about this bastard was he lying when he never touched me amanda shuddered he always treated me with terrifying politeness i had the sense that something was building in him that he struggled against it the last time i saw him when he brought me the nightgown he stopped being polite he yelled he threw things he called me a bitch and a whore it was like he hated me because he felt aroused from the walkietalkie more static taunted balenger he shut off vinnies unit then lowered the volume on his own put it to his lips and pressed the transmit button keeping his voice down i dont understand why you use different names ronnie why do you call yourself walter static is your last name really harrigan balenger didnt dare remain in one spot too long he shifted into the dining room again he whispered into the walkietalkie ronnie whats your last name no answer whats your last carlisle the voice said amanda and vinnie crouched trying to determine where the voice was below them thats not true balenger whispered carlisle didnt have children hes my father continuing to move balenger eased into the exercise room where weights propped open the elevators door no balenger said hes not your father he acted like one thats not the same thing sometimes its all there is what about you balenger asked did you act like a good son balenger shut off his headlamp before shifting into the candlelit medical room amanda and vinnie did the same otherwise their lights would show through the holes in the floor the sight of the two bodies made him feel cold youre moving cautiously the voice said but the candles react to the air you displace through the holes i see them flicker abruptly balenger realized that ronnie stood directly below him he barely had a chance to step back before a shotgun blast tore through the part of the floor where hed been balenger aimed toward the fresh hole about to shoot only to decide ronnie wanted him to do that to waste ammunition on a phantom target did you disarm the explosives up there the voice said from the walkietalkie i assume a former ranger has the ability to do that balenger forced himself to stay quiet you wonder how i know your background the voice asked its not just because i heard you talking to the others the first time you came to my office and questioned me i knew you were trouble when you showed up the next time i had a stack of information about you a shame about that gulf war syndrome at least you had someone to take care of you your wife made clear how devoted she was the reference to diane struck balenger like a punch in the stomach his emotion bent him forward at once rage took the place of pain and loss he aimed toward where he thought the voice was below him with all his heart he wanted to shoot no he warned himself not till youre sure dont let him goad you into making mistakes desperation crept over him our lights he thought we shut them off so ronnie cant see them through the holes in the floor but we cant get out of here without using them and he has nightvision goggles reluctantly he understood what needed to be done what he didnt want to do drawing amanda and vinnie to another room he kept his voice low you need to distract him for me vinnie have you ever fired a gun no hold it with both hands like this balenger curled vinnies right fingers around the grip then he curved the left fingers over the opposite side the tips overlapping aim along the top of the barrel keep your fingers tight on the grip theres a kick when you shoot you dont want to get startled and drop the gun when i shoot go back to the medical room count to fifty then turn on your walkietalkie increase its volume set it on the floor and back away my voice will distract him when he shoots shoot back you wont hit him but we dont care about that just make sure he doesnt hit you but what about im going to try to get the other nightvision goggles vinnie nodded but balenger couldnt tell if it was in hope or despair amanda lock the hatch behind me balenger spoke with desperate softness dont open it unless you hear two taps then three then one can you remember that two three one ill remember vinnie fifty seconds after your first shot throw something on the floor of the exercise room make sure youre a distance away try to make him shoot again then shoot back and move to another room keep distracting him but dont use more than one shot each time we need the ammunition can you do this dont have a choice if i can get those nightvision goggles well have a lot of choices balenger hoped he sounded convincing far from the holes in the medical rooms floor they could safely switch on their headlamps balenger moved quietly through the kitchen the library and the surveillance room finally coming to the bedroom he stared at the locked trapdoor in theory the door to danatas suite remained barricaded so ronnie couldnt get in and shoot at anyone coming down the staircase in theory balenger took the pistol from vinnie then motioned for amanda to unlock and open the trapdoor he aimed as his headlamp pierced the darkness of the stairwell no one breathing slightly easier he gave the gun back start counting to fifty he climbed into the stairwell and motioned for amanda to close it as he heard her lock the hatch over his head he had the terrible sense of descending into hell the coppery odor of the professors blood filled the exposed passageway and danatas living room balenger counted the seconds just as vinnie did three four five guided by only one source of light feeling the darkness crowd him balenger crept lower the furniture remained piled in front of the door giving him slight encouragement he unholstered the hammer from his utility belt and descended from the sixth level toward the fifth and its secret corridor waving the hammer in front of him testing for razor wire he listened for water streaming into the stairwell but didnt hear it the roofs in this section of the hotel evidently remaining intact he aimed his headlamp along the darkness of the fifth corridor something seemed to be in there something seated motionless that filled him with suspicion but he didnt have time to investigate he kept counting eighteen nineteen twenty the air felt colder as he reached the fourth level and went lower static crackled from his walkietalkie ronnie taunting him again no doubt ronnie hoped to hear a response and use it as a target but balenger was too far away now he kept counting twentyfive twentysix he pressed the pulse button on his walkietalkie ronnie would hear a similar buzz of static balenger knew so youre still alive the voice said although balengers walkietalkie was at minimum volume the stairwells echo amplified the words i wondered if id hit you the light from his headlamp turning dizzily on the spiral staircase balenger reached the third level and continued to wave the hammer into the shadows before him static balenger pressed the transmit button and put the walkietalkie directly against his mouth cupping a hand around his lips working to shut out the stairwells echo carlisle had agoraphobia i kept asking myself why a man terrified of the outdoors would leave the hotel and shoot himself on the beach fortyseven fortyeight it didnt make sense but now i understand something else terrified him more balenger was certain the count was past fifty vinnie for gods sake do what i told you i didnt hurt him the voice said you werent a good son your voice sounds different balenger imagined vinnie following directions turning up the volume on his walkietalkie and setting it on the floor he imagined ronnie peering up toward balengers suddenly amplified voice abruptly he heard a shotgun blast from his walkietalkie he listened fiercely for the distant sound of a handgun firing in response but thunder rumbled through the hotel vibrating through the stairwell and he heard nothing else not even static from his walkietalkie breath froze in his chest as his hammer probed the air and felt resistance he knelt saw blood on the stairs and scanned his headlamp there it wasthe tautly strung wire the dark blood on it made it almost indistinguishable from the shadows he sank onto his back and squirmed under the wire straightening he heard another burst of static from his walkietalkie but he ignored it and waved the hammer in front of him searching for more wire while descending toward the darkness at the bottom of the stairs now he allowed himself to consider a thought hed been avoiding what if ronnie took more than the walkietalkie what if he also took the nightvision goggles so that no one else could use them then we dont have many options left he thought hell we might not have any leave a part of his mind told him while vinnie distracts ronnie try to find a way out abandon them not exactly find a way out and go for help there isnt a way out the only way to end this is to kill him even if i could get out what would i do on foot in the middle of the night in a thunderstorm a deserted part of the city itd take me forever to reach the police station vinnie and amanda could be dead by then this is your chance bullshit i wont leave them he reached the bottom where the limited space made the smell of death even more pronounced his single beam of light revealed two corpses mack and jd surrounded by blood their throats slit their legs almost severed balenger saw footprints in the blood ronnie had evidently approached them finished them with a knife and taken the walkietalkie the footprints seemed to come and go through a wall presumably it had one of the secret doors balenger was sure existed although how the door could be opened he didnt know he crouched studying the gloomenshrouded bodies each corpse did indeed wear nightvision goggles he reached then remembered boobytrapped corpses in iraq and paused taking a closer look at the bodies something was stuck under macks left side jd too had something under him not obvious not unless youd been seasoned in the hell of iraq and you knew not to trust anything at any time explosives of some sort the pressure of the bodies armed the detonators if balenger moved the bodies the triggers would be released and the bombs would explode he shifted around to their heads knelt in blood and reached under macks skull guiding his fingers toward the strap on macks goggles do it gently he warned himself static buzzed from his walkietalkie balenger eased the strap over macks skull the shaved head providing no resistance he lifted the goggles from macks sightless eyes and attached them to his equipment belt then he took a breath leaning toward jd and the strap on his goggles in the distance he thought he heard a shotgun blast he removed jds goggles and put them on he shut off his headlamp in place of the shadows that fought his headlamp he now saw a green twilight that made everything faintly visible his breathlessness and the sound of the storm created the feeling he was underwater with increased vision he saw a long dark object the crowbar he picked it up he whirled toward the stairs desperate to hurry back to the penthouse but he hesitated and faced the narrow corridor despite his apprehension he entered it the enhanced light that the goggles provided made it possible to see all the way to the end all the way to what tod had described finding the corpse of a fully clothed woman seated against the back wall shrunken like a mummy despite the green of the goggles it was obvious she had blond hair she held a purse in her lap and seemed to be waiting patiently to go on a journey balenger hated to imagine the terror she must have endured her oldstyle clothes told him that she wasnt diane but that knowledge didnt console him he now took for granted that his beloved wife was dead and yet he longed to be with her even if she was lifeless amid a sea of green he stooped and tried to determine how the woman had died no signs of violence wrong he thought focusing on her neck the larynx and windpipe projected inward the bones broken shed been strangled he felt paralyzed until static from the walkietalkie jabbed him into motion about to hurry back to amanda and vinnie he nevertheless set down the crowbar and reached for the corpses purse its fabric was grimy and dustcovered he set down the walkietalkie using both hands now to open the purse and take out a wallet there was a drivers license inside a shudder swept through him when he saw the name on it the name told him almost everything need to get back his thoughts were frenzied need to look in vinnies knapsack he shoved the license in a windbreaker pocket then grabbed the crowbar and the walkietalkie as thunder rumbled he raced toward the staircase watch out for the razor wire poking with the crowbar he found it he squirmed under and rushed higher his arm ached from the crowbars weight as he thrust it up and down ahead of him in case ronnie had managed to follow him and rig another trap he thought he heard a distant shotgun blast and then a pistol third level fourth at the fifth he halted again unable to restrain himself from peering into the secret corridor he remembered thinking hed seen an object propped against a wall in there now his nightvision goggles revealed that he was right another corpse of a woman blond fully clothed this time in slacks a turtleneck and a blazer no balenger thought the clothes were familiar to him no he stumbled toward her when a rat appeared on her shoulder he swung the crowbar smashing it against a wall overcome with emotion he sank to his knees the woman wasnt as shrunken as the corpse on the bottom level her eyes were gone chunks had been chewed from her but the face was nonetheless impossible not to recognize diane grief cramped his chest it took away his breath tears burned like acid on his cheeks wracked with sobs he raised a hand caressing her leathery face her blond hair hung below her shoulders longer than she preferred itbecause it had continued growing after her death her expression was a grimace of terror like the corpse on the bottom level her neck bones were cracked inward from having been strangled his diane his wonderful diane he knelt worshiping her mourning her diane eleven years together she never gave up on him never tired of taking care of him after he came back sick from his first time in iraq he had tried to make it up to her tried to make her realize how much he loved her kind selfless diane beautiful diane with holes chewed in her face a gunshot brought him back to the moment continuing to sob he opened her purse took out her wallet and put it in his windbreaker he kissed her parched forehead picked up the crowbar and the walkietalkie and stalked up the stairs fury made him want to rush but that would be playing ronnies game letting the son of a bitch manipulate him into making mistakes im coming for you ronnie he inwardly shouted ready with the crowbar he emerged into the sixthfloor passageway and studied the wreckage of danatas living room the furniture still barricaded the entrance he climbed to the trapdoor beyond it he heard a commotion hurried footsteps a gunshot frenzied he knocked twice three times once no response what if they think im ronnie what if they shoot through the trapdoor as he knocked again he heard the lock being freed the trapdoor was lifted a headlamp blazed toward his face stressing the sensor in his goggles creating a flare that made him temporarily blind the headlamp jerked away allowing his night vision to return he hurried up and locked the trapdoor behind him the smell of burnt gunpowder was everywhere vinnie stood in the doorway to the surveillance room aiming toward two jagged holes in the floor he saw balenger and retreated to him i did what you said i counted to fifty then i turned up the volume on my walkietalkie and set it on the floor he blew it apart how many rounds did you fire balenger took the pistol three i hope you dont think i wasted you did your job you distracted him nine rounds left well need to make them last hes been shooting at random through the floors he cant get into danatas living room and shoot at us from there were safe for a moment give me your knapsack balenger raised the walkietalkie to his lips hey asshole guess what static i asked you a question jerkoff what am i supposed to guess are the vulgarities necessary when it comes to you absolutely i found my wife you piece of shit static you strangled her you strangled them all balenger took the knapsack from vinnie and pulled the police report from the compartment in back he reached into his pocket for the drivers license from the corpse on the bottom level candlelight gourmet dinners balenger said into the walkietalkie soothing classical music literary reading sessions foreign movies with subtitles all very proper and formal and intellectual need to keep it intellectual cant let emotions get in the way emotions make you weak emotions make you lose control he studied the name on the drivers license iris mckenzie when amanda listed the names of ronnies girlfriends something had nagged at him now he knew what it was iris he flipped through the pages in the police report found it he said to the walkietalkie iris mckenzie age thirtythree residence baltimore maryland occupation advertising copywriter hair blond sound familiar you bastard she ought to if im right she was your first balenger scanned the report which an old man had written with painstaking neatness in august of iris took a train from baltimore to new york on business coming back she decided to spend the weekend in asbury park at the famous paragon hotel nobody told her asbury park wasnt the jewel it used to be or that the paragon hotel was a nightmare she arrived on friday one night in this spooky old pile was enough for her she checked out the next morning to go to the train station nobody saw her again except me i saw her ronnie shes sitting downstairs in a corridor with her purse in her lap still waiting for her train its going to be a long time coming his mouth dry his chest aching balenger needed to pause he felt as if his surging emotions could cause his veins to explode he raised the walkietalkie amanda says you treated her with terrifying politeness apart from locking her in the vault of course but what the hell nobodys perfect right then you showed up with a sheer nightgown for her to wear what happened ronnie did you decide the courtship was finally over you fed her you entertained her you proved what a prince of a guy you were now you wanted something for your efforts youre a man of the world after all you know how the games played but all of a sudden you got angry you called her a whore did your sexual needs make you feel weak and resentful i bet youd soon have hit her then youd have hated yourself for letting your weakness and needs get the better of you maybe you hated yourself for wanting her and hated her for being a woman you wanted or heres an opposite possibility i like this one better maybe you hated yourself because you believed you ought to want her but you didnt maybe you didnt feel any sexual interest at all and that really bothered you you were comfortable cooking gourmet meals reading proust and watching subtitled movies but when it came to the manwoman stuff you were numb whats wrong with me you wondered gotta do something about that so you made her put on a nightgown that ought to give you a charge but it didnt and now you hated her because she didnt make you feel like a man you knew where this was going the same way it went with the others you couldnt make yourself screw them so you strangled them to hide your shame and your failure maybe the next woman would make you feel like a man next time there was always next time right unseen lightning cracked amanda and vinnie watched balenger listening in horror so now youre a pop psychologist in addition to being a failed soldier and a mediocre policeman the voice asked detective i was a detective and i guess all that research you did about me didnt tell you the crimes i investigated or maybe you made yourself ignore that because you didnt want to think about your problem sex crimes ronnie i investigated sex crimes i can see into your head pal and its a sewer ronnie that name too kept nagging at balenger balenger said into the walkietalkie theres a photograph of you and carlisle it has a date on the back july a month later iris mckenzie disappeared by the end of the year carlisle closed the hotel dismissed the staff and lived here alone or maybe he wasnt alone ronnie ronnie why does that name balenger flipped through the police file page after page remembering something searching for it ronnie then he found the page and the name stared up at him it made him shudder ronald whitaker what the voice asked ronnie ronald the fourth of july ronald whitaker shut up the voice said thunder rumbled youre ronald whitaker shut up shut up amid the din of the rain balenger heard pounding from below not from the trapdoor farther down aiming he unlocked and opened the trapdoor his goggles revealed the curved greentinted stairs shut up shut up ronnie yelled as the fierce pounding continued balenger eased down the stairs and peered through the demolished wall into danatas ravaged living room the pounding came from the barricaded door powerful enough to jostle the furniture stacked against it your mother died balenger said into the walkietalkie your father molested you ill make you hurt so much youll beg me to kill you ronnie shouted from outside the door balenger entered danatas living room and aimed toward the door keeping his voice low trying to make ronnie think he was still in the penthouse he continued speaking into the walkietalkie then your father thought hed earn a few dollars out of you so he brought you here to the paragon hotel for the fourth of july and he rented you to another pervert i wont listen the guy tried to bribe you with a baseball a glove and a bat i cant imagine how unspeakable it was afterward your father came back to the room with the money he was drunk he fell asleep you bashed his head twentytwo times with the bat ronnie in your place id have hit him fifty times a hundred i cant tell you how sorry i feel for that little boy im enraged when i think about what was done to him my heart breaks for the childhood he lost rain lashed against the building thunder shook the walls but i hate everything he became ronnie my names walter harrigan balenger fired toward the voice once twice at the doors middle his bullets plowed through the wood immediately he shifted position an instant before part of the wall roared open from two shotgun blasts pellets spraying toward the noise from his gun one of the pellets caught balengers arm ignoring the pain he fired to the right and left of the holes in the wall he veered toward the stairwell as two more holes roared through the wall from the darkness beyond the holes he heard ronnie reloading the shotgun damn it i let him trick me he got me to waste ammunition only five rounds left static crackled from his walkietalkie ronnies aiming toward the sound balenger realized as the walkietalkie again crackled he charged up the stairs two roars sent pellets clanging off the metal steps below him the holes dont show the light from your headlamp the voice said from balengers walkietalkie now i understand while your friends distracted me you went down the stairwell to the bodies you got their nightvision goggles balenger braced himself at the trapdoors opening ronnie couldnt get a shot at him there i found the explosives you planted under the bodies balenger said into the walkietalkie well theres one you didnt find the voice said a rumble shook the building for a moment balenger thought it was another strong burst of thunder but as the walls trembled it was obvious that the reverberation came from inside he had to grip the edge of the trapdoors opening to steady himself he felt a shock wave slam his ears above him amanda yelled over here the surveillance room balenger surged up through the hatch he ran to the surveillance room and opened its trapdoor smoke made him cough as it cleared the goggles showed him that the staircase had been blown apart three floors down the twisted steel remnants vibrated swaying far below there were flames balenger raised the walkietalkie if youre talking about the metal box you strapped to amanda we did find it i threw it down the surveillance rooms staircase a fires trying to get started down there tomorrow i planned to burn this place to the ground anyhow the coins are worthless to me the abrupt change of topic made balenger uneasy the coins a fortune but i couldnt use them to pay the taxes on this place the voice said bitterly i went to different coin dealers in different cities never more than a couple of coins at a time never the priceless ones but you need to sell a lot of sevenhundreddollar coins to try to pay fifty thousand dollars in property taxes one day in philadelphia a dealer id never met looked at what i offered and said so youre the guy with all the double eagles the other dealers are talking about you and that was the last coin i dared try to sell why is he talking so much balenger wondered hes stalling for time whats he up to abruptly balenger recalled what hed said to ronnie seconds earlier ithrew it down the surveillance rooms staircase a fires trying to get started down there jesus i told him where i am balenger charged from the open trapdoor lunging toward the bedroom something exploded behind him but there wasnt any shrapnel what the blast sent was a flash of heat that filled the surveillance room the detonator next to the trapdoor balenger realized ronnie triggered it by remote control smoke blossomed amanda and vinnie rushed ahead of him but vinnies direction made it clear that he didnt understand what caused the small blast vinnie get away from in the bedroom vinnie stopped and turned the trapdoor balenger shouted get away from stunned vinnie glanced down at where hed stopped the trapdoor the detonator the blast was small but deafening it sent a flash up vinnies legs his jeans burst into flames screaming he fell to the floor swatting at his pants balenger grabbed the bedspread and flailed at vinnies legs desperately smothering the fire vinnies screams continued in rapid succession detonators exploded throughout the penthouse balenger saw their flashes saw flames in the surveillance room and the medical room a fire extinguisher amanda yelled the kitchen she ran through the surveillance room dodging the fire balenger grabbed a decorative pitcher from a bureau and hurried into the bathroom he twisted a knob on the sink but no water came out the electricitys off the pump isnt working he remembered he scooped water from the toilet bowl ran into the medical room and dumped the pitcher onto the flames a shotgun blast tore another hole in the floor but by then balenger was racing back to the bathroom he yanked off the toilettank lid and scooped water this time he didnt enter the medical room but stopped at its entrance hurling the water onto the flames the fire hissed and shrank the toilet tank again he scooped out all the water he could get and ran to the medical room now when he threw the water the flames went out no more water how am i going to he heard the spray of a fire extinguisher amanda attacking the blaze in another room but she wasnt in the dining room where flames rose also water need to find more water he stared at the open elevator in the exercise room ignoring the risk of a shotgun blast he raced to the elevator and scooped up the five urine bottles that ronnie had tauntingly returned to them wrong move you son of a bitch balenger thought tossing urine onto the flames the ammonia stench made him gag he dumped more urine the fire sizzled a third bottle a fourth drenched by piss the fire retreated the fifth bottle put it out another shotgun blast tore through the floor running balenger felt a chunk of wood sting his face he found amanda in the library where she frantically worked the extinguisher putting out a blaze she hurried to the surveillance room spewed a white cloud onto the flames there and put them out also but an instant later the cloud stopped the extinguisher empty the floor erupted from another blast but by then balenger tugged amanda into the bedroom they crouched next to vinnie against the outside wall theoretically it was the safest spotabove danatas living room the door of which remained barricaded smoke drifted around them vinnies charred jeans were stuck to him the flesh blackened leaking fluid thirddegree burns balenger had seen plenty of them in iraq hurts vinnie said balenger knew that vinnie was going to hurt a lot worse when his nerves recovered from the shock theyd received soon he would be in agony hurts despite the green of balengers nightvision goggles vinnies face was ashen i know balenger said can you walk only one way to find out wincing vinnie motioned for balenger to pull him up but vinnies legs were swollen his knees refused to bend weight on them made him gasp balenger feared hed pass out okay not a good idea balenger eased him back to the floor amanda he was surprised to see that she still held the empty fire extinguisher go quietly to the surveillance room and throw the extinguisher as far as possible into the library if you can but wait until im at the door to the medical room what are you going to help with the pain balenger went to the right toward the medical room its candles glowed dimly surrounded by smoke he nodded to amanda who hurled the fire extinguisher in the opposite direction toward the library as soon as he heard it crash onto the floor distracting ronnie balenger shifted into the medical room and reached through the broken glass door of the cabinet he grabbed a syringe and the vial of morphine then darted back into the bedroom an instant before pellets exploded from the floor he knelt beside vinnie im giving you only enough to dull the pain not put you out vinnie nodded biting his lip just hurry and do it balenger exposed vinnies left wrist and gave him the injection vinnies face remained rigid with pain slowly it relaxed yes the smoke hovered its thicker amanda coughed i thought all the flames were out not down there balenger pointed toward the open trapdoor in the surveillance room he stepped warily toward it three levels below the flames were stronger the only thing he could think to do was shut the trapdoor and lock it surprising him amanda rushed in with towels shed soaked in the remaining water in the toilet tank she pressed them over the edges of the trapdoor sealing off the smoke with the electricity off and the heating system no longer engaged the penthouse had rapidly cooled amanda hugged herself glancing down at her bare feet and the nightgown that gave little protection to her legs balenger said maybe i can do something about that at the door to the medical room he stared at coras body im sorry he thought he gripped coras hands and pulled there were so many holes in the floor ronnie would surely hear he worried but he needed to keep pulling he eased coras body into the bedroom here he said taking off coras shoes and socks coras feet had the terrible coldness of death you and she are about the same size these ought to fit you amanda gazed at what he offered madness became normalcy she took the shoes and socks but not the pants they were soaked with blood i wont put on the pants balenger understood even desperation had its limits the walkietalkie crackled balenger thought hit back you cant let him think hes winning he pressed the transmit button why blondes ronnie no answer was your mother a blonde no answer are you trying to replace your mother is that why your girlfriends dont put bounce in you you piece of shit the voice said got you balenger thought what were you saying earlier about vulgarity no answer iris mckenzie disappeared in balenger said your fourth of july of horrors happened in eight years earlier whats the connection a tingle swept through him hours ago cora had asked what would happen to someone whod been through what ronald whitaker had suffered balenger had answered that the boy would have spent eight years in a juvenile facility receiving psychiatric counseling until he was you were twentyone balenger said into the walkietalkie that photograph of you and carlisleit was taken just after you were released what happened did carlisle show an interest in you did he send you letters while you were being treated did he phone you did he finally behave like a human being and feel sorry for you did he ask you to come and stay here maybe he arranged for a psychiatrist to help you face the hell of your past after all how could you move on if the past kept its hook in you thats why he stays a respectful distance from you in the photograph he knows how sensitive you are about men touching you or maybe carlisle never stopped being a twisted sob he was never a part of life he only watched it maybe he brought you here so he could see how the rest of the story turned out and you showed him didnt you ronnie you showed him the rest of the story dont talk about him like that carlisle was a monster no you dont know anything about my father hes not your father maybe he sort of adopted you but he wasnt your father although he was almost as sick as your real father was my real father the voice said with disgust no real father would have treated me like that but no real son would have treated carlisle the way you did balenger said he suspected what you were doing but he couldnt prove it right he was twisted but not as twisted as you so he closed the hotel to take away your hunting territory he hoped youd stop and hey he wasnt sure to begin with right as far as he was concerned closing the hotel was just a precaution hedging his doubts what did you do gradually make him a prisoner in this hellhole did you threaten to cut him the thing he most feared did you force him to sign documents that put you in charge of the trust when the riots occurred did you make it seem that he ordered the metal shutters and doors installed that way you could keep tighter control on him at the same time you hid your secrets but somewhere along the line he discovered what youd been doingnot just once but for years isnt that what happened ronnie he found the corpses of some of your girlfriends he managed the strength to break out of here something frightened him more than a cut that could make him bleed to death more than the paralyzing open beach he forced himself to run toward something scared him so much he killed himself you ronnie a lot of questions the voice said you destroyed two fathersthe one you hated and the one you wanted questions that dont have answers balenger peered into the surveillance room wisps of smoke squeezed their way past the towels around the trapdoor ive bought enough time he thought the morphine should be working by now he crouched next to vinnie hows the pain better floaty good because we need to get you on your feet vinnies eyes widened no choice balenger said we cant stay here the fire will get to us if he doesnt which trapdoor balenger thought if we use the staircase in danatas suite ronnie will see us through the holes in the wall hell shoot the staircase from the surveillance room was in flames the one in the kitchen was flooded balenger took for granted that the elevator was a death trap as soon as ronnie heard its whir hed shoot through the door and kill everyone in the compartment or else hed shut off the electricity to it trap his quarry in the shaft and let the fire take care of them balenger crept to the library when he raised its trapdoor he heard water the equivalent of another cistern being filled he shut the trapdoor locked it and eased through the kitchen into the dining room opening the trapdoor there he exhaled when he didnt hear water he moved back to the bedroom vinnies charred legs were more bloated leaking more fluid just go along for the ride vinnie amanda and i will do the heavy lifting balenger looked at her ready always amanda said her spirit reminded him so much of dianes that for a moment in the smoke haze he thought he was actually looking at his wife he shook his head to clear it youre hurt she said pointing toward his right arm balenger was surprised to see that his windbreaker sleeve had blood on it shotgun pellet i think and your left cheek he touched it and felt blood flying wood splinter maybe here he unstrapped the spare nightvision goggles from his belt youll need these as she put them on he told vinnie itll get dark now in pain vinnie nodded just do what you need to balenger switched off the lamps on amandas and vinnies hard hats he prayed vinnie had enough strength to keep from panicking in the darkness that would come when they took him from the candlelight while amanda adjusted to the green glow of her goggles balenger put on the knapsack he holstered his pistol and shoved the crowbar under his utility belt amanda took vinnies left arm balenger his right when they lifted vinnie groaned lean on us balenger whispered dont try to walk let us carry you but the moment they started balenger knew it wasnt going to workvinnies shoes scraped along the floor they paused maybe if he puts his arms around our necks amanda murmured if he helps to lift we can support him with our arms around his back and our other hands under his thighs they tried it raising vinnies hips so that he was now in a kind of chair formed by their hands his knees bent painfully inching ahead they reached the trapdoor in the dining room and set vinnie down balenger aimed as amanda unlocked and opened the hatch his goggles detected only a greentinted stairwell the only sound was the rain outside he studied the opening it wasnt large enough for two people so he descended the stairs until his head was below the trapdoor amanda went to vinnies shoulders and pushed him legsfirst toward the opening the pain made vinnie hiss but otherwise he had the resolve to keep silent balenger gripped vinnies belt and pulled him into the staircase trying to be gentle aware of what vinnie suffered the stench of scorched flesh made him gag he set vinnies hips on the steps and waited for amanda to enter the stairwell then he turned his back to vinnie and felt amanda place vinnies arms around his neck clutching them balenger stood and bent forward so that vinnies torso was over his back the injured legs dangling behind him about to descend balenger suddenly thought no were doing this wrong squeeze past me he whispered to amanda his voice was almost inaudible but it made him cringe as if he were shouting wave the hammer in front of you check for wire her goggles hiding whatever apprehension was in her eyes she took the hammer from his belt and edged past him vinnie tensed from the pain as they moved in a downward circle balenger became aware of their hoarse breathing too loud ronniell hear us his stomach hardened he had to balance himself carefully lest vinnies weight topple him forward ahead amanda stopped they were almost at a corridor on the sixth level and balenger stared down past her shoulder her hammer tapped on something razor wire balenger saw it tremble he leaned back and set vinnie on the stairs momentarily grateful to be free of the weight lie on your back he whispered to amanda squirm under it then ill slide vinnie down the steps without hesitation she proceeded then turned and this time did hesitate when she understood that shed be reaching for vinnies charred legs but the hesitation lasted only for an instant readying herself she waited as balenger eased vinnie under the wire but vinnies body thumped on the stairs to balenger it seemed that the excruciating sound came from a loudspeaker he shoved his hands under vinnie to cushion the impact vinnie couldnt see theobstacle and didnt know why it was necessary to slide him but balenger gave him credit vinnie didnt resist he followed orders then vinnie was through and it was balengers turn to go under the wire seconds later he rose beyond it put vinnies arms around his neck and stooped forward once more with vinnies weight on his back amanda continued downward using the hammer to check for more wire suddenly the stairs wavered bolts popped from the wall the staircase pulling loose from its moorings balenger swayed as the bolts clanged onto the lower stairs he grabbed the unsteady railing the stairs were a huge bobbing coil anchored at the top but not at the sides banging against the walls vinnies legs hit the railing he screamed amplified by the stairwell the noise seemed to fill the hotel ronnie couldnt fail to hear it balenger pulled the crowbar from his belt turned and swung toward the razor wire he hit it with all his strength the wire so taut that it snapped from the impact upstairs he shouted to amanda now pellets blasted through the wall more bolts popped the staircase wobbling sweat dripping from his face balenger groped for the trapdoors opening grateful to touch something that was solidly anchored he scurried up and yanked vinnie through trying to ignore his screams he stopped in the kitchen hoping for safety against the outside wall the trapdoor banged shut and amanda was suddenly next to him well try another stairwell amanda said hoping hardly any left amanda sank wearily her hips on the floor her back against the wall he has a good chance of finding us balenger slid down next to her sounding as exhausted as she did probably has traps in them yes amanda said probably she looked down at vinnie whose pain had caused him to pass out any other ideas not at the moment me neither in the surveillance room smoke drifted past the wet towels that sealed the edges of the trapdoor but there must be something amanda said i wont give up yes just like diane balenger thought thats right we wont give up static from the walkietalkie still alive the voice asked balenger pressed the transmit button and squeezed his elbow against his holstered pistol trying to draw reassurance from it waiting for you waiting for the fire the voice said waiting will get us killed balenger thought we need to do something were not going to let ourselves die here he was conscious of the rain lashing against the metal shutter above him something theres got to be something amanda stared up toward the shutter with a chill of hope balenger realized the thought that came to her slowly they stood and examined the shutter like the others in the hotel it had rollers that rested on a horizontal bar above the window in theory a sideways sliding motion was the only thing necessary to open it at the bottom a lock secured it but unlike the shutters downstairs the rollers on this one were rustfree as with everything else in the penthouse ronnie kept the shutters scrupulously clean balenger shoved the end of the crowbar under the lock he started to apply leverage then worried that ronnie might hear ill distract him he whispered to amanda putting her hands on the crowbar he eased into the dining room and pressed the transmit button on the walkietalkie walter harrigan ronald whitaker ronnie did your mother call you ronnie is that why you want your girlfriends to call you that so theyll be like your mother youre guaranteeing more pain for yourself balenger looked into the kitchen where amanda tugged furiously at the crowbar walter harrigan youre ronald whitaker and yet youre of course balenger felt a thrill of understanding when you left the juvenile facility did you change your name is that what happened with a new name you wouldnt be stalked by your past no one would connect you with that fourth of july no one would know you killed your father no one would know he abused you balenger watched amanda the locks plate seemed about to separate from the wall was that it ronnie was it carlisles idea to change your name was that another way he helped you oh he helped all right the voice said he couldnt stop helping or making excuses even when he suspected what you were doing he still made excuses for you didnt he he didnt really believe what you were capable of why would amanda strained against the crowbar as the locks plate pulled from the wall balenger returned to the kitchen and grabbed the plate before it could strike the floor why would he make excuses for you ronnie balenger felt sick as the answer occurred to him he watched through the wall he saw your father he saw the pervert your father took money from come in and after a lifetime of watching carlisle finally got disgusted with being a watcher he could have done something to stop it but he was a god who observed without intervening in this hell he created but when he saw you bash in your fathers brains he finally felt more than curiosity maybe because he was alone so much as a child he identified with you he felt guilty he wished he could have stopped what happened the only thing left was to try to make amends he spoiled you and then one night he discovered the consequences tonight youll discover consequences i see smoke down here the voice said balenger put the walkietalkie into his knapsack he and amanda pushed at the shutter he was surprised how smoothly the rollers shifted along their rail am the window gaped like the others in the hotel it was broken part of the hotels disguise to make it appear oppressively deserted out of the howling darkness wind and rain struck balengers face he and amanda took urgent breaths filling their nostrils throats and lungs lightning flashed illuminating the beach seven levels below balenger raised the window frame to avoid being cut by the shards in it ill find a spot to anchor the rope he told amanda close the shutter as soon as im out if ronnie smells the fresh air hell know what were doing he climbed through the window rain lashed him in greentinted darkness he eased down to the roof the wind gusted at him imaginary hands shoving moisture pelted his face entering his mouth it tasted bitter a mixture of sweat dirt and blood from his cheeks the rain on his goggles made it difficult to see he wiped their lenses flinched from a nearby lightning strike and moved cautiously forward the roof felt spongy he shifted to the right breathing slightly easier when the area under him became solid again at the roofs edge he crouched to prevent the wind from pushing him over for a moment he allowed himself to hope but then he peered down and despair swept through him the center of the roof below him was collapsed water streaming into it lightning revealed the lower levels they were damaged from years of punishing weather and lack of maintenance surfaces were peeled back flapping in the wind holes were evident even from a distance balenger opened his mouth to breathe wind filled his throat no he thought no lightning struck the beach the rain strengthened intensifying the chill of his drenched clothes but that was nothing compared to the chill that invaded his spirit he looked for a place to secure the rope that was in his knapsack a ventilation pipe he approached it his goggles revealing rust when he pushed a shoe against it the pipe held he pushed with greater force the pipe continued to hold wiping rain from his goggles he headed back to the shutter another spongy section of roof threatened to collapse he skirted it took three steps and abruptly his left shoe broke the surface he froze supporting his weight on his other foot slowly he pulled the shoe free testing he continued across the roof when he reached to slide the shutter open it startled him seeming to move on its own amandas arms came into view helping him through the window dripping shivering he squirmed into the kitchen and closed the shutter after the fresh air the penthouses atmosphere of smoke pain and death was overwhelming his goggles couldnt hide how depressed he felt whats wrong amanda asked the three of us cant do it cant two of us lifting vinniethe roof wont hold our weight if you go separately you might make it but if i carry vinnie ill he and i will go through the roof we might never stop dropping till we reach the ground floor but leave vinnie whispered in pain balenger was surprised that vinnie was conscious holding you back vinnies murmur was distorted with agony leave me get help no i wont leave you balenger took off the knapsack and removed the rope amanda you weigh the least theres a ventilation pipe i tested it itll hold you loop the rope around it slide down the wall pull the rope down to you find another anchor and keep climbing down amandas face tensed in concentration how far to the ground seven levels slide down the rope its called rappeling right yes its not as easy as you make it sound even if i manage to reach the bottom what happens next where do i find help theres nobody in this area youll need to go to the police station ill give you directions how far a mile the smoke made amanda cough in this storm as weak as i am from being in that vault with my legs protected only by this nightgown ill collapse from hypothermia before i get there you go but youre the strongest ill stay with vinnie he studied her blond hair determined lovely features so much like diane the ideaabruptly seemed futile by the time i bring help it might be too late he said then what are we going to do balenger listened to the rain against the shutter maybe theres only one chance she watched him trying to control her desperation i need to go after him balenger said yes the cold made amandas lips pale an apron hung next to the sink he wrapped it around her unprotected legs something made her frown toward a corner when he looked in that direction he saw a rat other rats stated in from the dining room theyre attracted to the smell of vinnies legs amanda said more rats appeared at the door to the library one had a single eye balenger went to the bedroom and took an object from coras jacket when he returned he showed amanda what it was the water pistol vinegar he squirted a rat it darted away she took the pistol static came from the walkietalkie the smokes thicker down here ronnies voice said then maybe you should leave the building balenger replied he turned off the walkietalkie and put it into his knapsack he shoved the crowbar in also facing amanda he promised ill come back as soon as i can but he didnt move couldnt turn away from her each felt the same impulse they put their arms around each other balenger tried to draw strength from her possibly the last friendly person he would ever see his chest swelling with emotion he slid the shutter open the rain pelted him just before he eased onto the roof he peered back into the kitchen and saw amanda sink to the floor where she cradled vinnies head on her lap the greentinted rats formed a semicircle at the edge of the room she aimed the water pistol he settled his weight on the roof and closed the shutter the wind threatened to suck air from his lungs as he worked his way toward the ventilation pipe with each step he feared that his foot would again break the surface drenched he studied rainswept puddles deciding that the roof would be weakest where water collected but the next spongy section he encountered was in a raised area that turned out to be a blister he stepped back and veered around it a crack of lightning struck the tip of the pyramid it reminded him of an artillery shell exploding despite his urge to run he forced himself to be cautious rain obscured the pipe he looped the rope over it and pulled again testing designed for mountain climbing the rope had a standard length of feet reduced now to because it was doubled although thin and lightweight it was exceptionally strong its polyester sheath protecting a core of silk fibers earlier rick had questioned him about his familiarity with heights and rope needing an innocent explanation balenger had responded that he was a rock climber in truth he knew about heights and rope because of his ranger training he knotted the rope about four feet from its tips the knot would warn him when he was almost at the end he dropped the doubled rope off the roof straddling it he pulled it up behind him over his right hip he looped it across his chest over his left shoulder and down his back making sure the rope was cushioned by his jacket and wouldnt cut into his neck he used his left hand to grip the forward part of the rope while his right gripped the section behind and below him the arrangement allowed his body to act as a brake somewhere somehow hed lost his gloves as a consequence he risked rope burns on his hands straining to be optimistic he told himself that the gloves would have been slippery in the rain that under the circumstances exposed skin was safer right be positive look on the bright side in greentinted darkness it keeps getting worse he thought yet his emotions puzzled him the gulf war syndrome from his tour of duty in desert storm was suddenly so distant a memory that it seemed not to have happened the posttraumatic stress disorder from his nearbeheading no longer weighed on him after the hell of the previous six hours after so many deaths after discovering the corpse of his beloved wife a grim rage overtook him it was so expansive and powerful that it left no room for fear vinnie depended on him the woman who resembled his wife depended on him they mattered punishing ronnie that mattered he tested the rope one final time then stepped backward off the roof swaying in chaos he eased the rope through his right hand behind him while his left hand gripped the forward section the rope slid around his body with his shoes pushing against the wall he walked horizontally backward and downward approaching the crater in the patio below the rope jerked had the pipe bent friction burning his cold fingers he eased more rope through his right hand the rope jerked again dont think about it keep going keep thinking about amanda and vinnie through rainstreaked goggles he saw that the surviving edge of the patio was just below him a moment later he set down on it holding the rope around him so he wouldnt drop if the remainder of the patio gave way he was braced against a closed rusted shutter on the sixth level there was no way inside to reenter the hotel to get to ronnie he needed to descend farther into the crater of a room on the fifth level his soaked clothes weighing on him he walked to the edge of the crater and leaned back settling into it without a wall to brace his feet against he grimaced from the strain of lowering himself the rope biting into his hip chest and shoulder now the moisture falling around him was thicker not only rain but also water accumulating on the roof it poured over him below he saw a canopied bed a bureau a victorian table the basic arrangement hed found in most of the other rooms the middle of the floor was another crater water crashing farther down he kicked his legs the motion started a pendulum effect that he increased by kicking several more times swinging he neared the remainder of the floor across from him kicked again and suddenly his breath was taken away as he dropped the pipes breaking he thought he jerked to a stop the rope constricted his chest still breathless he exhaled through his mouth and inhaled through his nostrils trying for a calming rhythm staring up he saw that the reason the rope had dropped was that it had dug into the craters edge and broken away a portion of the roof six feet of ceiling had crumbled that was how far he had fallen now he hung below the hole dangling into a fourthlevel room he tried to pull himself up to lift his legs over the edge but the rim of this crater now began to disintegrate as the floor gave way he sank lower dangling farther into the fourthlevel room water fell past him then a chair it brushed past his jacket sleeve jesus the whole ceilings collapsing the furnitures going to the table plummeted past him the bureau tilted toward the widening hole the bed slid in his direction staring down he saw that the door to the fourthlevel room was open nearly all the floor was gone the entire contents having cascaded hitting subsequent floors and crashing through at once balenger understood that this was the room from which hed rescued vinnie after vinnie dropped more of the craters rim collapsed the rope dropped him another two feet with a woosh the bureau hurtled past the bed slid nearer he worked down along the rope at the same time he swung his body his right hand touched the knot that warned him he was near the ropes end as he swung again the pressure of the rope made that section of the ceiling give way the bed plunged toward him his pendulums arc sped him toward the open door his fingers clawed snagging the jamb he tightened his grip on the door frame the bed swooped past him the rope held him prisoner tugging him backward into the chasm while he fought to pull himself around the doorjamb the bed crashed far below his right hand released the rope and joined his left hand clinging to the side of the open door he pulled himself farther through although soft the balconys floor held he took another step another unwrapping the rope from his hip and shoulder he freed the knot and tugged one end trying to pull it down it snagged on something worried that his effort would stress the weak floor he took a step farther back then tugged again the rope refused to budge the noise balenger warned himself ronnie cant possibly fail to hear it abandoning the rope balenger drew his pistol but as he aimed along the greentinted balcony he became aware of a roar inside the hotel it came from the storms vibrations the sound of the room collapsing was merely part of the larger rumble it was nothing that ronnie would have thought suspicious balenger surveyed the hotels hollow core rain from the broken skylight formed a veil nonetheless he was able to see toward the opposite balcony flames emerged from the fifthfloor wall over there while smoke wafted from the sixth amanda vinnie he shifted down the corridor that led to the emergency stairs the noise of the storm muted any sounds he made climbing the stairs at the fifth level he crept to the balcony hoping to glimpse ronnie above no sign of him something dangled onto balengers head roots the tree that grew through the ceiling hours earlier it had seemed strange now compared to everything that had happened it felt normal he returned to the emergency stairs and went higher the door was open he left the stairs and inched along a short corridor across from him the smoldering balcony seemed deserted the flames would soon reach the penthouse despite his increasing urgency he forced himself to go slowly to make sure he didnt get careless at the end of the corridor he peered onto the balcony still no sign of ronnie except for danatas suite every door was open ronnie could be in any of the rooms listening for sounds above him to the left was the tree in front of it smoke drifted from a doorway ronnie wasnt listening for sounds above him balenger realized he was starting another fire movement separated the smoke as a figure backed from the room balenger tightened his finger on the trigger a tall man in a suit wore nightvision goggles and held a pump shotgun ronnie balenger raged at the memory of his futile conversations with the man two years earlier and that was the last time you saw her yes when she left my office at noon but somehow the monster looked different not as thin as balenger remembered him or when hed appeared on the surveillance monitor a while ago as ronnie turned in his direction balenger shot twice hitting him in the chest the reports coincided with thunder ronnie jolting back before balenger could shoot a third time ronnies backward momentum lurched him into the tree wood cracked that part of the balcony weakened by roots collapsed arms flailing branches snapping ronnie and the tree plummeted through the hole balenger hurried to it now he realized why ronnie wasnt as thin as he ought to be he wore a bulletresistant vest balenger aimed down through the hole determined to get a head shot but the only target was an arm as ronnie frantically rolled away balenger had only three rounds left he couldnt risk wasting a bullet he knew that by the time he charged down the emergency stairs to the fifth level ronnie would be impossible to find too many rooms too many other emergency stairs too many secret doors balenger acted before he realized what he was doing jumping through the hole dropping to the balcony below since it hadnt collapsed from ronnies impact he believed it would hold him he landed bending his knees to absorb the shock tucking and rolling the way hed been taught in jump school avoiding the tree he rose to a crouch and searched for a target but his unsteady footing alarmed him the balcony wavered five doors away he saw ronnie aim his shotgun as the balcony swayed throwing balenger to his knees it jerked ronnie offbalance also the shotgun roared pellets whistling over balengers head before ronnie could pump another shell into the chamber balenger charged they collided crashing to the floor and at once balenger felt his stomach rise the impact of their combined weights making the balcony drop a section tilted crashing down onto the next level it formed a slide onto which balenger and ronnie tumbled over each other hitting the bottom the impact made that balcony waver ronnies hands found balengers throat he remembered amandas insistence on how strong ronnie was ronnies hands were certainly strong expertly squeezing balengers windpipe but after all the monster had years of practice the balcony vibrated or perhaps balengers mind was swaying as his greentinted vision turned gray from the effect of strangulation he tried to shoot but the only angle available to him was toward ronnies chest toward his bulletresistant vest balenger pulled the trigger although the vest blocked the bullet it couldnt muffle the shock of the impact as if struck by a sledge hammer ronnie fell back balenger dove for the solid floor of a hallway an instant later the remainder of the upper balcony collapsed onto this one ronnie screamed amid rubble as the balcony fell away struck the next one and caused a chain reaction the rest of the balconies crashing to the lobby splashing into the water from the solid footing of the hallway balenger gaped down at the wreckage dust rose only to be flattened by the rain pouring from the open skylight amanda vinnie he holstered his gun and raced for the emergency stairs one level another coughing from the smoke he emerged onto the sixth floor and tried to figure how to get to the penthouse the door to danatas suite was barricaded were there secret doors in any of the other rooms was that how ronnie got into the stairwells and rigged the traps where were the doors choosing a room away from the new fire ronnie had set balenger hurried in the bureau caught his attention it would be easy to hide a door behind there he yanked the bureau down but all he found was an apparently solid wall he took the crowbar from his knapsack and whacked it against the wall he struck again and again his frenzy mounting his desperation making him wail the hole got larger revealing a gap between twobyfours a hidden corridor he walloped as hard as he could widening the space one more fierce blow and he could squeeze through he put the crowbar in his knapsack and entered the corridor at once he saw the dangling spiral staircase its moorings pulled from the wall my god im under the penthouse dining room amanda vinnie and i tried to come down these stairs they have hardly any support he put his weight on the stairs they wobbled he eased upward trying to move smoothly to keep the staircase steady again it wobbled please he thought he stepped higher gripping the curved banister he felt as if he were on the unsteady deck of a wavetossed sailboat unable to get enough air into his lungs he reached the trapdoor and pounded twice three times once the trapdoor opened amanda looking at him in relief theres a second fire i know balenger crawled from the staircase the pressure of his shoes pushing him away from the stairs was enough to send them crashing down the penthouse was filling with smoke as they rushed to vinnie in the kitchen amanda said i was afraid id have to open the shutter and put vinnie outside then join him at least wed have been able to breathe even if we got hypothermia or the damned building collapsed help me get him to the bedroom well take him down to danatas suite ronnie what about i dont know maybe hes dead maybe i hope cant be sure they put vinnies arms over their shoulders and dragged him toward the bedroom no longer caring if they made noise they set him down at the bedrooms trapdoor then amanda unlocked and lifted the hatch while balenger aimed into it only two rounds left he thought cant waste them but all he saw was greentinted smoke the moment he entered the staircase he hesitated wait a second he took a step upward and grasped the block of plastic explosive hed set aside when disarming the bomb what can you do with that amanda asked dont know you said it was useless without a detonator it is he stuffed the explosive into his knapsack just below the opening he waited with his back turned amanda slid vinnie onto him he carried vinnie down to danatas living room and again set him on the floor with effort he and amanda tugged the heavy tables and chairs from the door he aimed as amanda opened it flames rose on the other side of the hotels core they also spread from a room on this side it was dark for so long i thought id give anything if i could see vinnie was appalled by what he faced now i wish i couldnt help me get him on my back balenger told amanda vinnie hang on to the straps on the knapsack can you do that my legs are messed up but theres nothing wrong with my hands they worked their way into a corridor and reached the entrance to the emergency stairs again balenger aimed again there wasnt a target bent forward with vinnie he climbed down as quickly as he could without losing his balance fifth level fourth third i hear water amanda said so many roofs to collect it so many holes the place is flooding balenger told her second level first they were submerged kneedeep as they tugged a door open the water chilled them but not as much as what they saw the chaos of the lobby now balenger understood why furniture piled up tangled against columns and doors the force of the water falling from the upper levels was dismaying the din overwhelming any object that wasnt anchored got swept away how do we get out the voice startled balenger almost making him pull the trigger it belonged to a man struggling through the current toward them the figure wore goggles he had bulging pockets that weighed him down tattoos covered his face i tried the tunnel door tod shouted the bastard really did weld it shut i tried every other door and shutter i could find were trapped well use the crowbar well try to wedge a door open the instant balenger stepped into the current it almost knocked him over twenty feet to his right a waterfall cascaded this whole damned place is about to come down tod said get rid of the coins if you fall theyll hold you under the water then id better not fall balenger saw a chair rush by carrying a rat he dodged the chair only to stagger from vinnies weight amanda grabbed him holding him up they waded past a pillar where rats teemed on a jumble of furniture what happened to him tod said his legs got burned ronnie blew the detonators id love to shove a detonator down his throat if i ever get my hands on tod gaped in shock whats the matter a body just floated past a woman the woman i saw in the corridor blond hair disappeared in the current balenger was sickened by the thought that it could be any of the other corpses that ronnie hid in the building or maybe its diane he thought objects spattered the water the roar in the lobby was sufficiently loud that balenger realized only belatedly that a shotgun had gone off behind him fighting the current he reached a pillar taking cover behind the furniture caught against it amanda here behind you wheres tod there she pointed toward a neighboring pillar balenger gave vinnie to amanda drew his pistol and peered around the furniture jammed against the pillar the wreckage of the main staircase faced him piled next to it was the twisted debris of the balconies that had collapsed providing a warren of places in which ronnie could hide leaning as far out as he dared balenger thought he saw movement beneath a tangle of railings only two rounds left he thought need to be sure as the water kept rising he shifted back behind the furniture and the pillar pellets tore a chunk from a table next to him hiding he didnt see the muzzle flash eager for a better sense of ronnies location balenger took the walkietalkie from his knapsack the rain will eventually put out the fire he said into it you cant possibly destroy all the evidence he turned the walkietalkie to a minimum volume and strained to listen for ronnies voice across the way but the roar of the waterfall made it difficult to distinguish any other sound useless to balenger ronnies voice came from the walkietalkie the fire and the rain will destroy fingerprints the rest of the evidence cant be linked to me no one except you knows i come here the police will think intruders did this balenger cocked his head focusing on ronnies voice he was almost certain that it came from the right from a pocket in the tangle of railings get him to say more ronnie puzzled him by readily talking its just as well the citys forcing me to go the floods were never this destructive when a storm came it used to be all i needed to do was purge the swimming pool then the water from the storm would fill it again the overflow drains would handle the rest yes definitely from that tangle of railings balenger thought but why is he talking so much is he trying to bait me again is he shifting his position hoping ill waste another shot do you know the word exponential the voice asked balenger decided he had to answer to encourage ronnie to keep talking he spoke into the walkietalkie in the military i understood it to mean something like a rapidly increasing series of attacks immediately he again reduced the volume something like that the voice said across the way from the same place on the right among the wreckage if i dont shoot will he decide im out of ammunition balenger wondered will he take the risk of coming for me can i bait him thats what happened to this hotel exponential attacks the voice said by the way you sound cold balenger did indeed feel cold shivering in the frigid water youllsoon have muscle cramps you wont be able to defend yourself youve got the same problem no the voice said im high and dry hey ronnie tod yelled from the neighboring pillar surprising balenger ill make a deal with you what possible deal could you make i cant hear you tod yelled i dont have a walkietalkie good make ronnie shout balenger thought help me be certain where he is you dont have anything to bargain with ronnie said now the voice seemed to come from a different location again the chaos of noises in the lobby made it difficult for balenger to judge where ronnie hid sure i do ill help you get the others if i do that will you let me go tod yelled you dont need to be afraid of me im afraid of no one im not a threat all i want is to get out of here i dont have a reason to go to the cops not with these coins ah yes the coins balengers legs were numb he wondered if hed be able to move when the time came if i help you get them do we have a deal tod asked help is always welcome but do we have a damned deal i can always use a friend what the hell is tod up to balenger wondered he watched tod pull something from the water a long railing that floated by get ready tod shouted here they come in dismay balenger watched tod poke the railing at the tangle of furniture he amanda and vinnie hid behind a table shifted a chair moved tod poked harder as the wreckage was about to drift away and expose him balenger didnt see any choice except to use one of his last two bullets on tod he aimed in response tod let go of the railing and splashed through the water taking cover behind a section of stairs jammed against the pillar abruptly something leapt from the wreckage and made him scream it struck his head wrapping around his face claws raking his cheeks and neck white with three hind legs the cat as blood spurted from his neck tod stumbled blindly in the water weighed by the coins desperate to pull the animal from his face he staggered from the pillar wailing his chest erupted from a shotgun blast the coins in his pockets provided so much resistance that instead of jerking backward tod sank to his knees he toppled sideways his face disappearing in the swirl the cat surfaced balenger heard wood scraping the chair tod had pushed broke free the table came with it releasing other debris all of it swept around the pillar balenger holstered his gun when he turned to help amanda keep a grip on vinnie he lost his footing something banged into his legs he went under holding his breath he struggled to the surface and managed a glimpse of amanda and vinnie as the current took all three of them he thought he heard a shotgun then the water shoved him under thrusting him through the lobby he had the sense of cascading down stairs of streaming along a corridor of speeding through parted doors he grabbed for something anything to stop him but all his fingers clutched was a chunk of wood fighting to the surface again he saw amanda and vinnie ahead of him he sucked in air and saw a blur of tiled walls the swimming pool area the current tugged him through an open door he slammed against a gigantic metal storage tank the utility room he strained to breathe amanda here the flood was above his waist shivering violently he swam toward her vinnie wheres facedown vinnie floated away balenger and amanda grabbed him bracing his head above water vinnie coughed around them the surface was covered by panicked rats squealing to reach pipes and claw their way up the white cat struggled past lightcolored objects surged by and balenger realized he was seeing hair the blond hair on ronnies victims something in his mind seemed to tilt he feared he had gone insane need to get out or well drown amandas voice quavered balenger couldnt bring himself to tell her that even if they managed to fight their way back up to the lobby their chilled muscles would render them helpless in the water unable to prevent ronnie from shooting them for a dismaying instant amandas lovely cheeks and blond hair made him think he was looking at diane what did you call me he took her arm and worked to guide her and vinnie toward the swimming pool but he managed only one step before the relentless current pushed them back against the metal tank cold so cold balengers hands felt stiff the water rose to his sternum finally found her cant let her die damn it how do we get out if that bastard hadnt welded the door shut letting the current pull him from the tank he waded toward the door the welds he thought maybe theyre not strong maybe i can use the crowbar to break them with all this water pushing against the door tons of it even if the door wasnt welded shut i could never get it open welds something jogged his memory something important that he couldnt quite identify something balenger remembered that when ronnie appeared on the surveillance monitor when he motioned toward the pipe hed welded across the door there was a welders tank to the left of the door now balenger waded in that direction praying that ronnie hadnt moved the tank he groped in the water but couldnt find it he groped lower his awkward fingers brushing curved metal he almost shouted with hope as he straightened but there was a lot he had to do before hope was justified the water was almost above the pipe across the door there was a gap behind the pipe he pulled the crowbar from his knapsack and jammed the sharp end into the gap he braced the crowbar vertically its hook at the top of the door again he groped in the water groaning from the weight he lifted the tank and used its straps to attach it to the crowbar suspending it above the water he took the plastic explosive from the knapsack and wedged it between the tank and the door he yanked the roll of duct tape from his knapsack and secured the tanks rodso the nozzle was pointed at the middle of thetank next he taped the lever on the rods handle in the open position gas escaped when he clicked the tanks igniter the torch flamed burning into the tank the water pushed at him as he fought to return to amanda and vinnie he was reminded of nightmares in which he struggled to hurry somewhere but his legs were trapped seeing the reflection of the torch behind him he pressed his shoes against the floor and urged his legs forward through the deepening water breathing furiously he rounded the storage tank the force of the water pressed amanda and vinnie against it close your eyes cover your ears he shouted amanda didnt hesitate vinnie can you hear me close your eyes cover your ears stupefied by his pain the morphine and the cold vinnie pressed his hands against his ears balenger did the same the water was at his chest the torch he thought how long will it take to burn into the tank one two three four it should have exploded by now seven eight nine did the tank fall into the water did the water rise high enough to put out the torch thirteen fourteen the world became loud and bright even with his eyes closed and his hands over his ears balenger felt deafened and blinded a force lifted him at the same time it seemed to suck the life from him weightless he couldnt breathe he dropped pressure squeezing him up and down right and left these suddenly no longer had meaning as chaos propelled him he struck something gasped inhaled water and continued speeding forward im in the tunnel he realized the door blew open the waters flooding into the chaos spun and tossed him banging against a wall he inhaled more water and found that his face was above the surface the greentinted roof of the tunnel sped over him rats surrounded him two were on his chest he saw a swiftly approaching corner his shoes rammed into it the flood twisted him propelling him down the continuation of the tunnel underwater again he banged against a wall and strained not to breathe at once the feeling of weightlessness returned he arced into a wide space arms flying an impact jolted him he rolled stopping on his back and struggled to clear his lungs as water sprayed behind him rats scrambled over him boards somehow boards were above him he lay on wet sand a broken rusted grate was next to him my god he realized the force of the water rammed the screen off a drain tunnel it threw me onto the beach im under the boardwalk clang clang the wind carried the noise of the sheet metal flapping in the abandoned condominium balenger recalled the unease hed felt when he heard it tolling seven hours earlier clang rain came through cracks in the boardwalk falling on his face he groped for his gun which remained in his holster but the darkness was no longer green his nightvision goggles had been torn away and yet he could see a little lightning the flames in the upper stories of the hotel balenger forced himself to sit up diane vinnie he searched among the debris more rats scurried away the fivelegged cat lay motionless its neck at an unnatural angle a shape was sprawled near water spewing from the tunnel balenger dug his hands and knees into the sand crawling toward it only to stop in horror when he realized it was a mummified corpse again something in his mind seemed to tilt like ball bearings shifting weight to his left he saw two other sprawled shapes one of them was blonde fearful that this too was a corpse he approached the shape moved he increased speed reaching it turning it diane no the shape whispered next to her vinnie lay unmoving balenger checked his mouth to make sure nothing blocked it he turned him onto his stomach pressing his back trying to push water from his lungs vinnie coughed expelling fluid balenger kept pressing diane we cant stay balenger said but im not ronnie will come we need to get out of here balenger tugged vinnie to his feet help me diane as lightning flashed she and balenger held vinnie between them they did their best to hurry but vinnies shoes kept dragging in the sand balenger stumbled and dropped to one knee he gathered the strength to stand ten steps later all three of them fell exhausted balenger looked around ronniell soon be here need to hide we need to that trough in the sand ahead diane do you see it no response rain poured through holes in the boardwalk help me drag vinnie balenger said with the last of their energy they pulled him into the trough lie down next to him balenger said but ill cover you the beachll seem flat maybe he wont see you our tracks the rains washing sand into them hiding them what about you ill make him follow me in a different direction diane im not diane i love you i wish i were diane she kissed his cheek he made her lie in the trough then covered her and vinnie with sand just enough to hide them a fake grave to prevent a real one he left their faces exposed cold she said ill lead him away count to three hundred balenger said then try to find help if it isnt safe for you to crawl out by then i failed and itll never be safe diane was lucky to have you was i dont understand youve still got me he turned somehow mustering the resolve to go back the way he had cometoward the drain tunnel the debris the rats the mummified bodies the rain was indeed shifting sand into the footprints he summoned all his will and stepped onto the beach walking toward the violent waves lightning cracked but he no longer flinched a few yards from the surf he turned and faced the boardwalk beyond it flames burst from the paragons upper stories the fire and the storm struggled with each other in this deserted area at this late hour with the storm hiding the fire from the rest of the city it would take time for firefighters and police to be alerted and arrive balenger couldnt depend on anyone for help to the right lightning silhouetted the skeleton of the abandoned condominium he heard the clang of the sheet metal he unholstered his gun and stuck it behind his belt at his spine then he spread his arms making himself as visible as he could his aggressive posture said everything come for me ronnie see if you can take me thunder rumbled as ronnie appeared at the top of the boardwalk flames silhouetted him making it seem that he stepped from hell he stood at the collapsed rail staring down toward the surf his nightvision goggles were like hatches over his soul making him look monstrous slowly steadily he came down the stairs his shotgun in his hands the thunder reminded balenger of a giants steps murderous resolve made tall thin fiftysevenyearold ronnie assume a titans stature the darkness of his kevlar vest was emblematic of the terrible power he exuded he strode with the weight of robbed innocence and a stolen childhood of a lifetime of pain and anger of terror and death as he neared balenger his blank face communicated an emptiness that could never be filled im sorry for what was done to you ronnie balenger knew that he couldnt be heard in the storm he wanted to keep ronnie coming nearer to make ronnie curious about what he yelled i hate you but im sorry for that little boy ronnie kept approaching relentless implacable an executioner is this where carlisle died balenger shouted rain pelting him ronnie was probably still too far away to hear that didnt matter he wanted ronnie to see his lips moving to wonder what he was saying to keep approaching come closer balenger thought most gunfights occurred within five yards even then adrenaline unsteadied the shooters hands and often made them miss balengers hands were shaking and numb from the cold he couldnt possibly hope to shoot ronnie from any distance in contrast ronnies shotgun could finish him at forty yards closer is this where the old man blew his brains out after he realized the extent of what you did he became more terrified of you than he was of going outside he escaped from the hotel did he find your shotgun did he take it with him he hoped to protect himself on the beach but as he stood here shaking as he saw you coming in the rain he realized he was damned so he shot himself silhouetted by lightning ronnie narrowed the distance between them the shotgun in your hand is that the one carlisle used to blow his brains out thirty yards away ronnie stopped no i need you closer is this where it happened is this where he did it the father you always wanted s this where you scared him into killing himself thunder overwhelmed his words a flash of lightning paralyzed ronnie for a moment then he stepped nearer wanting to hear what balenger said what a wonderful son you were balenger shouted he gave you a chance for a new life and you paid him back by filling his life with terror twenty yards away ronnie stopped again evidently he was now close enough to have heard sister carrie he shouted balenger was startled by the incongruity of the statement what dreisers novel when your friend talked about it he said almost everything that matters our bodies and our surroundings doom us he forgot to say that the past dooms us not always not if you fight it but that hellhole of a building sure can trick us into believing that lightning again paralyzed ronnie whats wrong with him balenger wondered why isnt he coming closer the goggles balenger realized when the lightning flashes the goggles need a moment to adjust the lightning causes a flare that temporarily blinds him ronnie lifted the shotgun to his shoulder as lightning cracked again blinding ronnie balenger pulled his gun from behind his back and charged ronnie came out of his paralysis and shifted his aim balenger dove to the sand shooting upward ronnies shotgun blast hit behind him balenger fired toward ronnies face then his pistol clicked on empty its slide back no more ammunition did i hit him balenger rolled a blast struck next to him pellets hitting his calf he came to his feet hobbling trying to lead ronnie away from the boardwalk a groan behind him made him turn lightning showed ronnie sinking to his knees his shoulder was bloody where one of balengers shots had hit him above the kevlar vest a raging figure stood behind him swinging a twobyfour diane swinging shrieking the shotgun went off blasting into the sand as diane swung the board like a baseball bat the flames in the hotel showed a chunk of bloody hair flying into the rain in a windbreaker with only a nightgown covering her legs both garments clinging to her soaked she swung the board again whacking the rear of ronnies skull so hard that he dropped forward onto the beach she stood over him hitting hitting stopping only when the board snapped then she cursed and plunged the sharp end into his back ronnie shuddered and lay still amanda stood over him sobbing balenger hobbled toward her is he dead she asked right now hes entering hell they clung to each other trying not to fall he put a lot of others through it now its his turn she said because of something that wasnt his fault a fourth of july weekend a lifetime ago balenger was sickened clang the wind whipped the flap of sheet metal clang it tolled for ronnie for his victims for the paragon hotel clang balenger watched the flames in the upper stories diane he said im not diane he stared at her he touched her cheek i know he said finally believing it god how i wish you were ready to die to save me i lost diane once i couldnt bear to lose her twice if i couldnt save you and vinnie i didnt want to live you havent lost me sorrow made him feel choked wed better go we need to help vinnie they stumbled through the dark rain toward the boardwalk when they reached the hollow in the beach vinnie was unconscious they lifted him from the sand do i hear amanda turned sirens out of breath they staggered with vinnie following the boardwalk toward the sound balengers legs didnt seem a part of him but he kept struggling forward just as amanda did he looked at her how he wished she was diane or at least that he could believe she was diane delirious he must have said that out loud because amanda turned to him keep remembering im not her but you havent lost me they reached stairs to the boardwalk avoiding broken planks they ascended wearily sinking to their knees then continuing upward the light of the flames grew balenger felt a warm wind from the fire then the wind was hot although balenger couldnt stop shivering the sirens wailed to a halt firemen jumped from a truck policemen scrambled from cruisers the top of the hotels pyramid caved in sparks flew consumed by fire the sixth level collapsed there go the gold coins balenger thought he remembered the double eagle in his pocket the words on it in god we trust policemen ran to them one of them shouting what happened to you as balenger slumped to the ground he heard the clang clang clang of the tolling sheet metal another section of the building collapsed but hell had many levels so did the past what happened to us he murmured he could barely force the words out the paragon hotel authors note an obsession with the past as every author knows the most frequent question were asked is where do you get your ideas creepers although i wasnt familiar with that term until recently my fascination with the concept has gripped me for most of my life when i was nine my family lived in a cramped apartment above a restaurant that catered to drinkers from the areas numerous bars this was in a city called kitchener in southern ontario in canada i often heard drunks fighting in the alley beneath my bedroom window there was plenty of fighting in the apartment as well although my mother and my stepfather never came to blows their arguments made me so afraid that many nights i stuffed pillows under my bedding to make it look as if i slept there while i lay awake under the bed i often escaped that apartment and wandered the streets where i learned the secrets of every alley and parking lot within ten blocks i also learned the secrets of abandoned buildings in retrospect im amazed that i didnt run into fatal trouble in some of those buildings but i was a street kid a survivor and the worst that happened to me was a cat bite on a wrist and a nail through a foot both of which caused blood poisoning those abandoned buildingsa house a factory and an apartment complexfascinated me the smashed windows the moldy wallpaper the peeling paint the musty smell of the past lured me back repeatedly the most interesting building was the apartment complex because although deserted it wasnt empty tenants had abandoned tables chairs dishes pots lamps and sofas most were in such poor shape that it was obvious why the objects hadnt been taken nonetheless combined with magazines and newspapers left behind the tables and chairs and dishes created the illusion that people still lived thereghostly remnants of the life that once flourished in the building i felt this more than i understood it treading cautiously up creaky staircases stepping around fallen plaster and holes in floors peering into decaying rooms i gazed in wonder at discoveries i made pigeons roosted on cupboards mice nested in sofas fungus grew on walls weeds sprouted on watery windowsills some of the yellowed newspapers and magazines dated back to when i was born but no discovery meant more to me than a record album i found on a cracked linoleum floor next to a threelegged table that lay on its side eventually i learned that it was called an album because prior to the s phonograph records were made from thick easily breakable shellac had only one song on each side and were stored in paper sleeves within binders that resembled photograph albums at the time of my discovery discs of this sort which played at rpm had been superseded by thin longplaying vinyl discs that were far more sturdy had as many as eight songs on each side and played at rpm id never seen an album when i opened its cover i felt an awe that was only slightly reduced by the scrape of broken shellac two of the discs were shattered but the majority four as i recall remained intact clutching this treasure i hurried home our radio had a record player attached to it i switched its dial to rpm a common feature in those days and put on one of the discs i played the song repeatedly today i can still hear the scratchy tune ive never forgotten its title those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine an internet search tells me that the song was written in by irving kahal willie raskin and sammy fain melodic and rhythmic it was an instant hit recorded frequently over the years but at the time i knew nothing of that nor did i understand the emotions of the lyrics which described the loneliness of a young man whose friends are all getting married what captivated me was that scratchy sound it came palpably from the past and served as a time tunnel through which my imagination could travel back to other years i visualized the vocal group in unfamiliar clothes surrounded by unfamiliar objects singing outoffashion music in a setting that was always fuzzy and in blackandwhite regrettably i dont recall the groups name so much for immortality since then ive obeyed a compulsion to investigate many other abandoned buildings not to mention tunnels and storm drains although i never again found anything so memorable as that phonograph album i assumed that my traumatic childhood accounted for my fascination with crumbling deserted structures and that i was alone in my obsession with links to the past but i now realize that there are many like me they call themselves urban explorers urban adventurers and urban speleologists their nickname is creepers if you type urban explorer into yahoo youll find an astonishing internet contacts type that name into google and youll find an even more astonishing contacts its a reasonable assumption that each of these links isnt represented by just one lonely explorer after all nobodys going to put together a site if heshe doesnt have a sense of community those hundreds of thousands of contacts are groups and logic suggests that for every one that publicizes itself there are many others that prefer to be hidden those who wish to remain anonymous have a good reason bear in mind urban exploration is illegal it involves the invasion of private property plus its so unsafe it can be deadly the authorities tend to insist on jail terms andor serious fines to discourage it as a consequence many of these websites emphasize that explorers should get permission from property owners and that they should always follow safety precautions and never do anything against the law those warnings sound socially responsible but my assumption is that for many urban explorers part of the appeal is the risk and thrill of doing whats forbidden its significant that their slang term for entering a deserted building borrows from the covertops military expression for invading hostile territory infiltration as the website indicates the objective is places youre not supposed to go creepers are mostly between the ages of eighteen and thirty intelligent well educated with an interest in history and architecture often employed in professions related to computer technology they share a worldwide interest with groups in japan singapore germany poland greece italy france spain holland england canada the united states and several other countries australian groups are fascinated with the maze of storm drains under sydney and melbourne european groups favor abandoned military installations from the world wars us groups are drawn to classic department stores and hotels abandoned when social decay led to an exodus from cities like buffalo and detroit in russia creepers are obsessed with moscows oncesecret multilevel subway system intended for evacuating cold war officials during a nuclear attack deserted hospitals asylums theaters and stadiums every country offers plenty of opportunities for urban exploring see mark morans essay greetings from abandoned asbury park nj at one of the first urban explorers was a frenchman who in became lost during an expedition into the paris catacombs it took eleven years for his body to be discovered as a character in creepers indicates walt whitman was another early urban explorer the author of leaves of grass worked as a reporter for the brooklyn standard where he wrote about the atlantic avenue tunnel touted as the first subway tunnel anywhere when built in it was discontinued a mere seventeen years later before it was sealed whitman trekked through it dark as the grave cold damp and silent he wrote how beautiful look earth and heaven again as we emerge from the gloom it might not be unprofitable now and then to send us mortals the dissatisfied ones at least and thats a large proportion into some tunnel of several days journey wed perhaps grumble less afterward at gods handiwork but whitman didnt get the point of urban exploration he saw the tunnel in negative terms for a true devotee however the cold damp silent darkness of a tunnel or an abandoned apartment complex or a deserted factory is exactly the goal the spooky attraction of the eerie past i suspect thats what a much later explorer felt in when he uncovered that same atlantic avenue tunnel years after it was barricaded and forgotten a major modern instance of urban exploration occurred recently in the paris catacombs those catacombs are part of a mile tunnel system beneath paris the consequence of quarry work that over many centuries provided building materials for the city in the s some of the tunnels were used to store thousands of corpses when parisian cemeteries exhausted their space in september of a french police team on a training exercise found a fully equipped movie theater among the bones seats had been carved into the rock a small adjoining cave functioned as a bar and restaurant with whiskey bottles on display along with professional electrical and telephone systems another major example occurred in moscow in october of when chechen rebels seized control of a theater after the military surrounded the building a russian urban explorer guided soldiers inside through a forgotten tunnel some of this is adventuring in a basic sense but i think that there are also psychological implications as i note in creepers our world is so fraught with elevated threat levels that it makes a lot of sense to retreat to the past old buildings can be a refuge drawing us back to what we imagine were simple and less stressful times in my youth the deserted apartment complex provided an escape from the turmoil of my family i was a time traveler finding sanctuary in a past that appealed to my imagination and in which there were never any arguments in my youth as an adult i now have a different perspective one with deeper less comfortable implications to me old buildings have become like old photographs they remind me how swiftly time passes the past they evoke draws attention to my ultimate future they are an opportunity for reflection i recently had the chance to visit the high school i attended more than forty years ago a part of it had burned to the ground most of the remainder has been boarded shut for a decade when i entered a hazard team was checking for asbestos lead paint and mold prior to the schools renovation its amazing what years of disuse can do especially when broken windows allow rain and snow to intrude in disturbingly silent hallways the hardwood floors were buckled plaster drooped from the ceilings paint strips hung from the walls but in my memory everything was clean and well maintained i envisioned students and teachers filling the noisy corridors the trouble is many of those students and teachers have long since died in the midst of decay my imagination conjured youth and the promise of hope gone just as the school would soon be gone i wonder if deserted buildings are vessels to which children bring a sense of wonder and adults bring their unacknowledged fears when i obeyed the compulsion to visit that wreck of a school was i unintentionally confronting my own mortality but my visit had a safety that urban exploration doesnt infiltrating forbidden sites investigating the decay of the past creepers flirt with danger any moment a floor might give way a wall topple or a stairway collapse creepers challenge the past to do its worst with each successful expedition they emerge victorious from another confrontation with age and decay for a handful of hours they live intensely obsessed with the past perhaps they hope to postpone their inevitable future or perhaps they feel reassured that the past lingers palpably into the present and that something about their past might linger after theyre gone when my fifteenyearold son matthew was dying from bone cancer his most plaintive statement was but no one will remember me memento mon maybe thats what urban exploration is all about is an obsession with the past another way of hoping that something about us will linger that years from now someone will explore where we lived and feel our lingering presence that phonograph album i found the distant hiss i listened to just as someone listened to that same platter decades earlier those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine its a song about time which is basically what all stories come down to in the lyric a young man says hes got a lonesome feeling but as i think back to that apartment complex and the deserted rooms i wandered through the abandoned sofas chairs lamps and potsi didnt
