the dilapidated office mr owen looked up from his reckoning bananas at eighty reis the quintal seems a little excessive mr ribeiro he said slowly mopping his brow the humidity was formidable the dull heat like a suffocating blanket but the purser of a frigate of his majestys navy had his standards and he sweltered in coat and breeches shrugging the fat portuguese trader leaned back in his chair you think i sell you green ones not go rot best in mozambique tugging at his clammy neckcloth and dismissively eyeing the hand of halfripe fruit brought for his inspection owen looked pained my captain wishes only to serve his worthy crew with a mort of sweetness in their diet but if the price is beyond my allowance then i help i can find th red banana very creamy very cheap and for you no no mr ribeiro the crew would think it sharp practice were you to vary your price to accommodate a larger order say five quintals and payment in silver reals then nicholas renzi sitting to one side of the table fanned himself with a palm leaf the negotiations dragged on and his attention wandered the doorway was jammed with wideeyed children fearful but entranced by this visitation from the outer world beyond in the harsh sunlight was the noisy ebb and flow of an african market town the world of war with napoleon bonaparte might have been in another universe but it was precisely why he was here hove to off the river mouth and enjoying the fresh oceanic breezes was hms laurore a thirtytwogun frigate whose captain was his closest friend thomas kydd as his confidential secretary renzi had an unquestioned right to come and go on ships business in these last weeks he had often landed with the purser but not to lend his presence for business negotiations to secure fresh foodstuffs he had every sympathy for the dry welshman who as a man of independent business aboard ship had to balance his costs at supplying stores and necessaries with fairness at the point of issue yet leave himself with sufficient profit to weather financial storms in the absence of an agentvictualler this meant making a deal with often unscrupulous local merchants that might well be repudiated later by an officious admiralty functionary in faraway london the purser probably suspected but had never enquired the real reason why renzi so often accompanied him if there was one thing a scouting frigate needed from the shore even more than fresh victuals it was information with an infinite number of directions to sail off in even the tiniest whisper was better than nothing and renzi had personally witnessed the effectiveness of admiral lord nelsons network of merchant intelligence in the mediterranean before trafalgar overseen it was rumoured by his own secretary the current mission for laurore was an important one only a few months before the british had taken cape town the dutch settlement at the tip of africa at the cape of good hope to secure the allimportant route to india with slender military resources it lay vulnerable to a vengeful counterattack by the french specifically by admiral marechal who was known to be at sea with a battle squadron greatly outnumbering the few ships of the royal navy on station there laurores orders were to follow the coast around the south of the continent and up the indian ocean side stopping vessels seeking word as far north as lourenco marques there had been not even a rumour but kydd had pressed on if only to prove the french absent from the area he knew that on the other side of madagascar the french had strong island bases in a direct line from india which could well be sheltering a battle group leda the larger fellow frigate to laurore was sent to look into these so laurore had sailed on into the mozambique channel past hundreds of miles of the frightful remoteness of the dark continent to the foetid flatness of quelimane an ancient arab slave market but now a lonely outpost of the portuguese empire itself dating from the daring voyage of vasco da gama in the s five quintal ribeiro came back with a frown we just quit o three cargo for zanzibar not so many left cost me more to find idly renzi looked out at a grove of densely clustered scrub palms nearby to his surprise he made out arrays of the unmistakable yellow curves of magnificently sized fruit more than enough surely er may we not avail ourselves of those fine bananas yonder or are they spoken for perhaps he enquired the other two men turned to him with surprise do allow i should conduct my business without your valued assistance mr renzi owen said huffily those are not bananas rather plantains which every soul knows may only be suffered to be eaten after cooking he turned back to ribeiro and stiffly concluded arrangements for a delivery of three quintals of standard bananas as renzi rose with the purser he offered casually then your trade prospers mr ribeiro the man looked up guardedly as is always the chance o luck in these days why you ask oh just that mr napoleon is stirring up trouble in these parts has your business suffered at the hands of the french at all they dont trouble as we ribeiro replied then you havent heard his ships of war are at sea he seeks bases for his privateers territory to add to france should he decide on quelimane well as you have no friends er no friends those who will rid you of him should you tell them in time you havent seen any french ships big ones i mean to say renzi added um no not b me perhaps have had word of such it was a last try so far north and failing any intelligence laurore must now cease her search and put about for cape town with nothing to report no renzi shrugged and turned to go wait ribeiro hauled himself to his feet snorting with the effort i not seen but the fishers they on the sea they will know he went to the doorway and called over a wizened man on the other side of the street after a brief exchange in some african dialect ribeiro beamed he say yes ver big one two day ago up th coast renzi snapped to full alert just one where was it going he remember pebane way t the north curious onlookers joined them and another seamed individual broke in with excited jabber he say he saw as well four day ago but swear it were off t the south renzi frowned how much reliance should he place on these fishermen a lone ship and was it truly a big one how many masts did it have he asked both were insistent that it was threemasted and squarerigged on each this therefore was not a local trader nor yet a privateer or even an armed schooner for it was shiprigged in exactly the same way as a frigate or shipoftheline was it one of marechals scouting frigates ranging ahead of the deadly squadron his heart quickened but kydd would need to know details north or south where was it headed if he offered money to the wider community for information they would say anything they thought would please him but he did have something up his sleeve oh mr owen he said to the purser do send for my seabag if you will one of the boats crew redfaced with exertion in the heat hurried up with a mysterious carryall surrounded by a noisy crowd of screeching children and their elders renzi took it bowing politely to the young seaman who taken aback awkwardly bowed in return and for good measure touched his forelock looking significantly at ribeiro renzi opened it and peered inside the hubbub died to an expectant hush as others flocked to join the throng after a pause he straightened in satisfaction then pointedly laced it shut mr ribeiro he announced importantly our good king george is concerned at the hard life of the fishermen of quelimane he directs me to distribute these small gifts as a token of his esteem but only to the worthy fisherfolk themselves the faces around him looked doubtful but after his words had been translated several grinning weatherbeaten men pushed themselves to the front renzi regarded them solemnly then dipped into the bag and drew out the red uniform coat of a private of the royal marines a collective gasp went up as it was presented to the oldest fisherman who drew it on reverently he twirled about in his finery to universal admiration and renzi hid a grin at the sight of the patched and worn castoff that had been routinely consigned to the boatswains ragchest more treasures were handed out a pair of seamens white duck trousers with frayed bottoms a sailors jacket with two brass buttons still on it half a dozen holed stockings renzi allowed that he would be obliged if he could hear from any who had seen the big ship and stood back to let the noise and jollity overflow as things were tried on exchanged bartered one man detached from the rest and passed along his observation then more came forward renzi carefully entered their words into his notebook until in all he had eleven firm reports such mens lives depended on knowing where they were so he now had the time and position of each sighting individually plotting them on the chart would give a clear picture of the track pleased with himself he politely withdrew leaving them to their bounty well done nicholas kydd said happily wielding his dividers on the east africa chart i do hope mr oakley is not too discommoded by our making free with his ragchest look here i think i have it renzi leaned over the neatly encircled dots marched from the south regularly until near pabane in the north the last two made an irregular hook hes come from around madagascar to spy out the channel and here in the north hes turned about and is starting to head back we have a chance dear chap youre omitting one thing oh these are past reports this latest being yesterday by now the fellow is well on not so see on this track the speed made between points is trifling hes spending his time casting about conducting a good search while our fisherfolk have to land their catch smartly and lose no time in returning nicholas ill wager should we rest here well see him topsails over say early tomorrow kendall the sailing master and a man of few words nodded in agreement and a reluctant smile surfaced sir theres th question o yes if hes a frigate his first duty is to report to his admiral not offer battle with a chance o damage so hell bear away as soon as he sights us and well not discover his squadron rendezvous were to calm his fears in some way i believe and lure him on there was no way kydd could alter his ship into a lesser breed or make it appear impotent and with no handy island to conceal themselves i shall think on it mr kendall he said and began pacing up and down nothing came of it so he went out on deck it was pleasant under the quarterdeck awning now permanently rigged and by his order all officers had doffed coat and waistcoat and now felt the breeze gratefully through loose shirts sir acknowledged curzon the officerofthewatch touching his hat a conclusion at all mayhap well sight a scout tomorrow we stay off and on this coast hell come from the north if he does aye aye sir kydd looked about the bright seascape then at the distant palmfringed shore it would not do to dignify these remote outposts with a visit by a full postcaptain royal navy so he had never once set foot on this africa with its steaming tropical forests and all the mystery of an unknown continent so different from the south perhaps one day scuse me sir an anxious voice broke into his thoughts it was searle one of the volunteers of the first class brought on board in those dark months before trafalgar less than a year before kydd realised with surprise the young lad was all but unrecognisable as the pale terrified schoolboy who had presented himself resolutely determined to be an admiral one day now he was inches taller lithe and brown with confidence yet still a degree of modesty about him here was his next midshipman in his inattention kydd had nearly tripped over the bight of a circle of longsplicing that the lad was working on he picked up the piece and squinted down its length why that is a caution to the focslemen themselves id swear on the gratings a blankfaced seaman sat crosslegged a wash of warmth came at the sight of doud lined and tattooed the picture of a deepsea mariner long ago it had been this man who had made it possible for him a raw landman to climb the rigging to the maintop in the old royal billy at spithead later he had ventured out on the mainyard to the topsail yard and then suddenly he had it this thinking about masts and yards sails a frigate would rightly shy from another if the mission was more important but if it came across easy meat a contemptible little sloop perhaps then it could make to capture it or even ignore it either way it could be enticed closer until the fastsailing laurore had a chance of closing with it mr oakley he hailed striding back to the quarterdeck i have a pretty problem in the article of rigging and id be obliged if youd attend on me it took some explaining but it brought a broad grin to the redheaded boatswain who stumped off forward bawling for his men it was hard work but by the ringing of eight bells at the beginning of the dogwatches it was done and over supper and grog the seamen had something daring to talk about the morning dawned clear and bright the weather perfect for kydds plans a gentle warm breeze a flat calm seascape and crystal visibility to the northern horizon it was time to prepare strike all sail if y please he said canvas vanished from every yard and was furled above in a tight harbour stow laurore slowed and then idly drifted stream the seaanchor he ordered a canvas triangle on a line was lowered over the transom the frigate felt its gentle tug as the pressure of the southsetting mozambique current took charge laurores bows swinging obediently to face into it to the north it was time for the finale rig false sails mr oakley kydd demanded from half a hundred blocks came the squealing of sheaves as quite another suit of sails fell from the yards brace around y sluggards but this was not to catch the wind at the most effective angle it was the opposite each yard was trimmed edge on to the slight breeze the sails hanging shivering and impotent any with the slightest acquaintance of a fullrigged ship would have been mightily puzzled to see laurore now an ingenious system of tackles and beckets allowed her to set topsails where the lower course would be topgallants from the topsail yards and royals above in effect setting the frigates sail plan down by one tier this gave her the appearance of a small indiaman trying a dash inside madagascar instead of the more direct route on the far side men looked up in wonder at their lilliputian fit of sails and overside at their total lack of motion kydd gave a halfsmile this was not normally the way a fullblooded frigate faced the enemy there was not long to wait within an hour there was an excited hail from the masthead to the north square sail long minutes later another cry confirmed it as a threemaster unable to restrain himself kydd leaped for the shrouds and joined the lookout in the bare foretopgallant masthead he fumbled for his pocket telescope and steadied it on the far distant blob of white there unmistakably was a fullrigged ship and he waited impatiently for its hull to lift above the horizon eventually to his intense satisfaction kydd saw a single line of gunports along the length of the ship no merchantman this a frigate on the loose without a shadow of a doubt he snapped his glass shut and with a tigerish grin at the lookout swung down to the deck again its him well soon see if weve gulled the looby laurore lay barely lifting with the slight sea with no way on only the idle rattle and bang of gear aloft intruded on the senses it was not kydds plan to engage in battle his priority was to rely on laurores proven speed to keep with the ship until he was led to the squadron there might well be additional frigates waiting to trap him between two fires but this was a chance he had to take hes seen us an alterin towards the lookouts hail was gleeful the frenchman was hopefully seeing an indiaman unhappily becalmed as so often in these seas one vessel could be in useful breezes while another lying off only a few miles could be hopelessly adrift the seaanchor was doing its work with laurores bow end on towards the frigate her warlike details would remain hidden for a while longer by now the ship steadily heading their way could be sighted from the deck when should kydd throw off his disguise it couldnt last for ever but just as soon as he did so his quarry would instantly shy off or not it might be a heavy frigate eighteenpounders against laurores twelves determined to crush him to preserve the secret of his squadron in the offing post your men mr oakley kydd ordered quietly there was no way he could clear for action until the rats nest of improvised sails and rigging had been dismantled and that had better be quick damn hes been spooked spluttered gilbey the first lieutenant shading his eyes against the fierce glare of sunlight on the sea kydd balled his fists in frustration the masts were separating to show the frigate turning away get us round he roared a second seaanchor was hurled over the opposite sternquarters and hauled on sharply the bows being bodily rotated to maintain laurores bowsprit on the other ship but things were happening so slowly a few minutes later kendall caught kydds eye sir i do not think hes running doesnt he desire to keep atween us and the land an at the same time catch a land breeze kydd nodded he thinks to prevent our escape to the shallows inshore not bad but he doesnt know who we are or he wouldnt dare the ship was in plain view now heeling more to the fluky northeasterly seeking to take a commanding situation closer to the land how much longer could he a warning slap of impatient canvas above answered the question but kydd was becoming uneasy something about the french ship was odd be buggered oakley burst out suddenly thats no mongseer frigate its some sort o shipsloop one o them corvettes so keyed up had they been to expect a frigate that at a distance they had taken the corvette a shiprigged sloop much favoured by the french as one in appearance it was near to a miniature frigate with a single gundeck all the sail plan and rigging identical but much smaller and of course to humble fisherfolk such a ship would appear enormous now the tables were now well and truly turned the corvettes helm was put hard over get us under sail now roared kydd the crazy ragtag rigging was cast off false sails cascading over the deck in a chaotic jumble to be frantically scooped clear while the topmen raced out on the yards to loose their real canvas the shock of recognition could almost be felt over the distance and in minutes the corvette slewed sharply and set off inshore in an attempt to shake off the bigger ship in the shallows move yselves kydd bellowed up into the tops he had no wish at all to try conclusions among the maze of shoals offshore for the corvette was now heading towards the land under a press of sail that suggested confidence born of sound local knowledge youre going after him he hadnt noticed renzi come up from below of course this is your foxy marechal properly keeps his frigates with his squadron and sends out squiddy shipsloops or similar cant be better we can always outsail and outgun the villain im to take him and ive a notion this captain has a tale to tell that seems a reasonable supposition old fellow and if you get those men off the yard bawled kydd in exasperation the corvette was now well in with the land nearly lost against the contrasting vegetation and sandhills until the men were off the spar the yard could not be braced round to catch the wind but the furl had been as tight as possible to escape detection and two sailors were still scrabbling to cast off gaskets they finished and crabbed frantically along the footrope inward to the top brace up roundly kydd roared instantly and the men threw themselves into it with a will jerking the yard around to catch the wind but the last one off the yard missed his hold and fell backwards with a shriek cut off when he bounced off the bellying lower sail and into the sea man oooverboooaaard kydd hesitated only for a moment then blurted the orders to heave to and lower a boat his features were thunderous where away he called to the after lookout obediently the man pointed it was his duty to keep his eyes fixed on the unfortunate in the water until the boat came up with him the gig in the stern davits was swung out to serve as the ships lifeboat and it kissed the water smartly stroking strongly away at the lookouts direction and soon found the topman who lay gasping as they hauled him over the gunwale the boat lost no time in making it back where is that damned villain kydd spluttered vainly casting about looking for their quarry the lookouts ahoy hows the frenchy bear there was no answer he realised they had glanced away to check the progress of their shipmates rescue and neglected their duty he had now lost sight of the chase ill see those scowbunking beggars afore me tomorrow mr gilbey he threw at his first lieutenant angrily had the corvette gone north or south choose the wrong one and he would lose this precious chance of at least establishing that marechal was at large in the indian ocean and at best gaining a notion of the squadrons rendezvous position back to the north that would mean a run near closehauled in this slight wind and as well against the current to the south would give a handsome quartering breeze and going with the current but was this what the other captain wished him to conclude bear away t the south if you please kydd decided this was something laurore did well a slight wind on the quarter there were few that could stay with her in those conditions and if the frenchman had headed to the south he would quickly overhaul it and on the other hand if it was not sighted within a few hours he could be certain that it was off to the north then any contest between one out with the ocean breezes and the other anxiously dodging the shallows would be a foregone conclusion their only chart was a single smallscale one painstakingly copied from the portuguese of nearly a century before sketchily detailing the littoral with precious few depth soundings and the mudbanks would surely have shifted in the years since then closing with the coast as near as they dared they could be sure however that the brightness of the chase sails could be seen against the darker shore the land slid past a dense variegation in dark green with occasional palms and small hills in otherwise unrelieved flatness after three hours there had been no sighting hes gone north bout ship mr curzon kydd ordered it was late afternoon they had to press on to overhaul the corvette before night fell giving it cover to escape bowlines to the bridle mr curzon kydd said crisply ordering the edge of the big driving sails drawn out forward for maximum speed laurore stretched out nobly for the horizon to the north her wake creaming rulerstraight astern and lookouts doubled aloft an hour two more and still there was no sign perplexed kydd and the sailing master did their calculations with an essentially onshore wind there was no possibility that their quarry could have made a break directly to seaward while they were away in the south and even if they had made off as close to the wind as they could their furthest on was still firmly within the circle of visibility of laurores masthead it was a mystery hes gone t ground gilbey growled aye but where there was no response i rather think up a river renzi suggested in a shiprigged vessel gilbey said scornfully even a mongseer corvette draws moren the depth o water of any african river ive seen then are you not aware that under our lee is the great zambezi river which for prodigious size is matched only by your congo nobody but a main fool would take a ship up among all th crocodiles an such gilbey replied but stood back as the master brought up the chart and they saw that indeed the river entered the sea close by but with an awkward twist like the nile it ended in a delta of many mouths four at least youre right nicholas kydd agreed but up a river if hes there hes trapped but then how to get at him sure t be boats against broadsides gilbey muttered right said kydd briskly ignoring him which mouths it to be gentlemen four well take em one at a time kydd did not add that quite apart from the time it would need there was the possibility that their prey could go inland and around then scuttle out of one of the other mouths they being near to forty miles apart it would be impossible to tell from which he would emerge we start with the first un the chinde river it says here he said tapping the chart so close in it was an easy fix when the first zambezi mouth was sighted discoloured water could be seen more than five miles out and across their path was the white of breaking seas on a monstrous bar a mile across and extending directly out to sea for three just one branch of a giant african river endlessly disgorging into the ocean from the vast and mysterious interior im not taking her in kydd told renzi moor offshore send in a boat go myself i believe reconnoitre what were up against he added casually inviting renzi along too he left unspoken that it was also a chance to satisfy his curiosity and see the wonders of tropical africa the odds were against the corvette lying hidden in the very first river mouth they visited kydds barge was of modest draught and not designed for fighting but they were not expecting any with his coxswain poulden at the tiller renzi in the sternsheets with him four hands ready for the oars and doud in the eyes of the boat with a hand lead they pushed off under sail they passed along in the lee of the bar a channel of some depth quickly became evident which they used to follow into the estuary a twomilewide sprawl of constantly sliding greygreen water they then left behind the ceaseless hurry of the seas waves and cool breezes for the lowering heat and humidity the echoing quiet and rich stink of the dark continent the sailors looked about fascinated on either bank was the uniform low tangle of mangroves from which a miasma of decay drifted out as uncountable numbers of birds beat their way into the air at their intrusion bursts of harsh sounds from hidden creatures came on the air and insects swarmed annoyingly doud urgently hailed aft ware rocks ahead were three or four bare brown humps but as they watched one disappeared and others turned to offer gaping mouths hippos renzi said and others turned to watch exclaiming excitedly eyes in the boat kydd growled the ageold call to boat discipline seemed out of keeping on a frigates barge in an african river and a sense of unreality crept in naval service had taken him to many exotic places in the world but this promised to be the strangest where the estuary narrowed the mangroves gave way to low grassy banks and open woodland at the waters edge were four of the largest crocodiles kydd had ever seen basking in the lateafternoon sun the boat glided past them in silence every man thinking of the consequences of pitching overboard somewhere far upstream the wet season was sending down vast quantities of water swelling the river and bringing brown silt tearing clumps of earth from the bank and with it masses of vegetation occasionally even floating islands of light woodland the river took a sharp left turn kydd straining for any sign of the french ship he didnt need douds patient soundings to know that there was more than enough water for even a shipsloop or a frigate kydd dismissed the thought quickly there would be sufficient depth but these sharp bends were beyond a squarerigger to negotiate if the corvette was up one of these river mouths it would be because it had been towed up by its boats against the current out of the question with laurore keep to the outer side o the bends kydd told poulden itll be deepest there obediently the tiller went over but as they neared the opposite bank a welltrodden open area came into view with a family of elephants drinking and splashing they looked up in surprise indignant one made to rush at them but stopped and lifted its trunk trumpeting angrily a screeching bird flapped overhead the loop opened up but only to reveal another bend winding out of sight the evening was drawing in bringing with it clouds of midges the warm breathy breeze was dropping much less and it would be out oars and a hard pull by now they were near a dozen miles inland and no sign of any frenchman it was time to return thats enough poulden were going back kydd said twisting to see what renzi was pointing at is that not or am i suntouched a piece of floating debris caught on the bank at the sharpest point of the bend had a regular shape that seemed to owe nothing to nature take us near kydd ordered as they drew closer his interest quickened brail up he snapped when the boat lost way he motioned it into the muddy bank where it softly nudged in next to the halfburied object haul it in doud he called the seaman wiggled it free of the mud and pulled inboard a stout round object familiar to any seaman the provision cask was passed down the boat to kydd burned into the staves was the barely decipherable legend marie galante and underneath roman numerals then rochefort with a date ha hes here an just broached his supper kydd grunted smelling the interior disdainfully not only had they the name of the corvette but rochefort was the port from which marechal had sailed bear off and haul out back up the river under way once more the feeling of unreality increased evening was setting in livid orange inland under a long violet cloudline with shadows advancing yet here they were closing with the enemy they swept around the lefthand bend and still another lay ahead to the right then sharp black in the evening sky above the growth of the intervening bend they saw the upperworks of a fullrigged ship easy kydd snapped down sail out oars now poulden take us close in then i want you to quant us around slowly so i can take a peek without disturbing em at their supper using an upturned oar the barge was poled along nosing slowly around until kydd leaning over the bow suddenly hissed avast keep us there the bend opened into a lengthy reach nearly a halfmile long and at its further end was their chase kydd fumbled for his spyglass and trained it on the vessel he looked intently to see how it was defended the cunning beggar he murmured with reluctant admiration as hes made himself as snug as a duck in a ditch the ship was securely moored by bow and stern to the side of the bank at the far end of the reach where her captain could have maximum warning of a cuttingout attack by boats this also gave an excellent field of fire for with the guns levered around it would be an impossibly bloody affair if they approached in boats to storm it kydd lifted the glass again and carefully quartered the riverbank alongside the ship men were slashing down the vegetation to create an open space covered by their opposite broadside an assault by land would be just as murderous that left an attack after dark but a captain so canny would have a boat out to row night guard illuminations would follow any intrusion and the result would be the same he lowered the glass and slid it shut he couldnt ask his men to take on such odds even with the stakes of intelligence to be won the marie galante was perfectly safe they could stay for as long as patience held out for water and a supply of meat were on hand and it would need only occasional boat trips to tell them when laurore had given up and sailed away it was galling but it had to be accepted the frenchman had prevailed there was now no other course than to sail back to cape town bearing the tantalising news that marechal appeared to be at large but where or when and with what force was anybodys guess return he told poulden and made his way back to the sternsheets with renzi his coxswain waited for a sizeable mat of vegetation to be carried past by the current before poling out then told his crew to hoist sail the boat curved around carefully avoiding the relic of torn riverbank that had come down from far up the mysterious zambezi kydds thoughts however were on what he could do to retrieve something from the situation at least they didnt have to search up the remaining three mouths and a preposterous idea entered his mind that teased him with its possibilities he twisted round to glance back whence theyd come yes it could work if poulden lay us alongside the floating greenery if y please the coxswain gave him a puzzled glance but did as requested close to it was a substantial piece of densely matted vegetation grass of quite another kind from that growing on nearby banks tall thick and wreathed with tangling creepers on one side there were even young saplings and a sprawling bush seize on kydd called to the bowman who gingerly felt with his boathook the boat swung closer with the current and kydd stepped on to the little island taking care to keep a hold on the boats gunwale it gave a little under his weight and he dared to stand upright something near his foot hissed and slithered rapidly away while a large clumsy bird with a fleshy beak burst out of the bush cawing kydd trod further into the thick undergrowth it felt surprisingly substantial and he called to two of the seamen to join him one caught an ankle and fell prostrate with a frightened oath the island swayed a little but seemed not to object they had a chance after dinner kydd called a council of war aboard laurore gentlemen the corvette rightly assumes our only means of attack is by boat and hes taking every precaution to defend against it in the main hes lying at the head of a straight passage of the river and knows hes a line of sight that will warn him in plenty of time of an assault of a certainty he has his guns trained downriver to slaughter any in attacking boats in quick bold pencil strokes he sketched out the situation on a sheet of paper he paused and looked up we will be going in however troubled glances were exchanged but not from the direction he expects well be coming from upstream ah curzon said instantly how are we first going to get our boats past him even under cover of dark well be we dont sir the boats will be advancing upstream but not until weve boarded him i i dont follow you sir kydd explained about the floating islands six boarders concealed in one to signal down the reach when theyre in sight so well know which island theyre aboard this tells the boats to come into view and begin their attack drawing the attention of the french entirely to what theyve been expecting when abreast the bowsprit of the corvette the island will be brought alongside and our men will swarm aboard from nowhere to spread alarm and confusion at this point from concealed positions inland lieutenant clinton will order his marines to open a hot fire which will dismay the defenders they not knowing his force or what they face caught between three lines of attack hell be in a sad moil and thats when we strike home questions after several minutes digesting the details of this unconventional cuttingout action curzon broke the silence just the one sir any signal hoisted on the er island will necessarily be seen by even the most dimwitted o the french how then are we to preserve our surprise renzi came in the ancients got there before us of course gentlemen you will recollect that at thermopylae news of the advance of the persian host under xerxes was relayed across the plains to king leonidas of sparta by be s kind as t spare us your history mr renzi weve a war to figure gilbeys sarcasm brought a frown from kydd do fill and stand on renzi old chap were all listening by polished shields flashing in the sunlight i rather thought a mirror in our case he added just so kydd said with satisfaction renzi had on more than one occasion retrieved a situation by recourse to his classical education taking care to shield it from being spied by the corvette naturally um er mr bowden he acknowledged the third lieutenant this floating island sir if its to be brought alongside the frenchy er how does it steer as we might say a boat grapnel the corvette is moored on the inside of the bend the grapnel is cast overside when still out of sight and paid out until we are near abreast hauling taut on the line will cause the island to swing into the bank there was a ripple of approval it was shaping up itll in course be mself commanding on the island gilbey pronounced as first lieutenant your duty is the main attack not the diversion kydd said shortly i shall take care of that what will be our force in its entirety pray curzon asked every boat that swims all the royals with our idlers as their loaders and all volunteers mark you you shall be second to mr gilbey and mr bowden will taste command of a frigate for the first time bowden jerked upright sir i must protest this is you object to a frigate command at your age sir fie on you kydd chuckled no younker i need to know laurore is in safe hands while were away can you think of a better oh and you shall have mr renzi for company he added firmly thisll do kydd muttered quietly poulden brought the barge to the riverbank safely lower down the river from the corvette and the island party sprang ashore gunners mate stirk who would not be denied his place boatswain oakley who had sworn that only himself could be relied upon with the grapnel boatswains mate cumby who had demanded by right to be at his side pearse the rawboned masters mate with a yen to have something to boast of when he returned home and wong hay chee former circus strongman and inseparable friend of stirk nearby the launch and both cutters began setting the royal marines ashore with their number twos the idlers those such as the sailmakers crew and stewards who did not stand a watch at sea but could be relied on for the mechanical task of reloading muskets there was a threequarter moon riding high and kydd cursed under his breath the assembling men were in plain view and even if they were doing their best to stay quiet the clink and leather slap of equipment seemed so loud in the night air ltenant clinton he whispered hoarsely to the royal marines officer do you prove your mens weapons if any fires accidentally ill personally slit his gizzard and after that ill courtmartial the villain is that clear of all things a musket shot would be best calculated to arouse the enemy instantly clinton smiled and offered him a bag that clicked as he passed it over ive taken precautions sir these are their flints without which their muskets will not fire mollified kydd nodded a mile or so downstream from the corvette they would travel in a straight line over the kneebend in the river to arrive at a point upstream and out of sight from the french on the way leaving the marines to take position the boats would retire and wait until full daylight before coming up then all would depend on the island party they set out the low undulating land was mainly open scrub with thicker areas of bushes the moonlight was not enough to locate the corvette but kydd had a small pocket compass that allowed him to set a course to intersect the river above the vessel and led off in that direction at night the african bush was a petrifying experience every little sound seemed loaded with menace and although there were more than fifty men with kydd they were strung out behind his imagination conjured up all manner of dangers if a lion sprang out on him or one of those beasts with a horn on its nose if it took a rage against him at the head of the column then well before the others could keep closed up he snarled at the marines behind him drawing his cutlass to slash at an inoffensive bush then keeping it out at point he had left his fighting sword aboard ship in the bloody hacking of a boarding its fine qualities would not be essential and if it was lost in a swamp somewhere he would never forgive himself sir clinton pointed into the silvery distance on the left the upper spars of the marie galante were visible about a mile away very good kydd said stopping you know your orders keep the men at a distance until daybreak then close up to your positions when you hear firing begin yes sir its of the first importance that you are not seen before i understand sir the young officer said stiffly of course you do farewell and good luck kydd strode ahead with nervous energy they reached the river unexpectedly its glittering expanse suddenly in view down he hissed the others in his little group lowered themselves gingerly to the ground its earthy odour pungent while kydd checked forward on his left was the tight bend that according to his reckoning opened to the long reach and the french corvette bent double he skirted some bushes but before he reached the end he froze a playful night breeze had brought with it a wafting hint of tobacco smoke and by its pungency not the honest virginian issued aboard laurore parting the bush infinitely slowly he swallowed not more than a dozen yards away two sentries stood in the moonlight the occasional glow of their pipes startlingly red they were conversing with each other in low tones their muskets slung over their shoulders kydd withdrew with the utmost care the sentinels posted upstream spoke of a thoroughly professional opponent were there more at the far end of the reach this would make it near impossible for the boats to assemble unseen but doing so would draw all attention downstream as he wanted sentries he whispered to his party when he reached them well go a little further upstream another hundred yards brought them to the next curve of the river and a convenient slope to the water it would do er how about them crocodiles sir pearse asked edgily quite out of character for the brash youth on the quarterdeck take no mind o them kydd said confidently theyre all asleep they were coldblooded so it stood to reason didnt it they settled in the bushes to wait for the night to end then the moon vanished and blackness enfolded them continuous rustles and scurries came from all directions from not far away they heard a bloodfreezing roar and the piercing death squeal of some animal being taken and as they crouched together every man sensed a massive presence out in the darkness close moving filled with dread they gripped their puny weapons a cutlass against one of renzis hippos whatever it was there was no betraying sound and it wasnt until long minutes had passed that they realised it had moved on at last the first rosy lightening of the sky spread from the east and with tropical swiftness it was day a precautionary look around gave no reason for alarm the river was wreathed with rising mist shot through with the luminous pearly light of morning insects darting about prettily kydd got to his feet mr oakley youve the grapnel aye sir then lets find ourselves an island they went to the waters edge the boatswain testing his swing and kydd watching upstream but none of the right size hove into view any number of pieces of floating debris appeared out of the mist but none to match the stout pad kydd had tested only the day before with impatience giving way to anxiety kydd continued to watch for their island the light grew and strengthened they couldnt delay much longer when a rather lopsided but more substantial piece emerged from the white haze clearly clumped about a central strong sapling he ordered there mr oakley well try him it was more than thirty yards away but oakleys cast was unerring and soon it was pulled into the bank get aboard stirk see if you like it obediently the gunners mate waded out to where it was nudging the shallows and hauled himself on it swayed but seemed to hold firm as stirk cast about in the tall grass itll fadge sir i shouldnt wonder he finally called back the harsh grass looked an excellent hiding place right all aboard kydd said briskly ensuring that their weapons were passed first to stirk cutlasses a brace of pistols apiece pitifully little to stand against a broadside of guns yoho an its all ataunt in the tight little pollywobble clowned pearse once he was safely on stow it y idiot grunted stirk helping the barrelshaped wong to clamber aboard ill be forrard kydd said mr oakley at the stern with the grapnel the rest of you hunker down amidships the characterless mass of undergrowth was hardly a ship but order had to be brought to an utterly unseamanlike situation and it seemed to be accepted without question by the crew cast off oakley released his hold on the bank and the island floated free another cast of the grapnel enabled him to haul out to midstream and they were on their way kydd took a last look about to make sure all was concealed and with his shaving mirror to hand oakley aft with the grapnel watching him expectantly they drifted languorously up to the last bend concentrating furiously on the tightening ripples kydd judged the moment right and nodded to oakley who let the grapnel plunge to the riverbed while he paid out the line kydd lay full length among the richsmelling vegetation carefully parting the grasses to see ahead behind him there was muffled conversation and nervous laughter which was brought to a sudden stop by the boatswains sharp growl in company with scattered other oddments of flotsam the island slowly cleared the bend and not two hundred yards ahead lay their target a fleeting panic washed over kydd a lump of floating grass going head to head with a corvette of the french navy he fought the feeling down and took up the mirror glancing up at the low sun to get the angle just right and shielding it carefully he gave the signal three times three would they respond the corvette seemed utterly unconcerned a few men idly standing on the bank a wisp of smoke issuing from the galley funnel forward the colours not yet hoisted his gaze flicked back to the end of the reach no boats apprehension gripped him had they not seen the signal or was it that they had been intercepted the island was inexorably being carried down past the moored vessel should he go ahead with the boarding or cravenly stay hidden and drift on to safety then it would the distant thump of a swivel gun sounded and there gloriously was gilbeys launch closely followed by curzons cutter and then the others spreading out across the river to make a broad approach the frantic baying of a trumpet sounded aboard the corvette with harsh urging shouts men boiled up from below scattering to take position at the guns now the islands languid drift was maddeningly slow it would take for ever to reach marie galante which lay with its elegant bowsprit towards them but was still some way off however kydd did see not a single flash of faces looking back it was working entirely to plan gilbey had a quartermile of relative safety before the guns of the corvette levered around to bear aft as far as they could were in a position to open fire he used the time well pausing to get off a good aimed shot from his bowmounted eighteenpounder carronade the other boats did likewise and the corvette suffered two hits both of which brought shrieks and cries the boats pulling like madmen were not far from the point of no return where the guns could smash in their deadly grapeshot and canister feverishly kydd willed on their own ungainly craft only fifty yards or so but sir it was stirk pulling at his ankle sir the barkys sinkin kydds attention jerked back to their island and he twisted round to see one edge of the island was drooping bright water among the grass clear that side and keep the damned pistols dry he hissed he took his own out and laid them on a tussock a minute later an entire slab tore away and slowly sank leaving what remained noticeably lower in the water the zambezi lapped inches from kydds nose and he felt the coolness of water seeping under his body there was now every reason to suppose it could tip to one side or even break up throwing them all to the crocodiles should he tell oakley to pull into the bank now or kydds mind snapped to a ferocious icy calm if the island sank that was something he could do nothing about but if it remained afloat there was work to do stand by the grapnel he said levelly the order was relayed by stirk behind him only yards away the corvette loomed larger and larger but not a soul was visible all out of sight at the guns on the maindeck where should he bring in his crazy craft the bowsprit reared up from a neat beakhead revealing a small halfdeck within it and a dainty figurehead at its apex perfect they would come in under the shadow of the bow swing up on the stout boomkin over the headrails to the halfdeck pass up the weapons then appear on the focsle deck above the guns there was a sudden lurch and a muffled cry and the island rotated as it rid itself of another clump the crackle and sputter of musketry above meant that the boats were close the guns would very shortly be opening fire to cause slaughter in those who had so gamely trusted him he must not fail after all this the bowsprit was nearing haul taut he gasped at last the effect was almost instant and kydd craned round the boatswain had turns around the sapling and was controlling it in just the same way as a hawser around capstan whelps his fierce grin a joy to see the island wallowed and swayed but obediently crabbed sidewise in the current coming closer and closer and then incredibly they were under the trim bow and among the martingale and bobstays kydd thrust up for the boomkin and walked his feet over the carved headrails and rolled on to the halfdeck gratings with the tumult above there was little need for quiet pass up the weapons he hissed leaning down to grab them stirk heaved himself up to the opposite side to do likewise the men scrambled up thankfully and their near waterlogged craft was abandoned to drift away a quick muster showed all present seconds counted now and kydd hauled himself up and over the fiferail on to the focsle deck in a flash he took in the scene the sweep aft of the open deck below with its guns manned and at the far end the raised quarterdeck muskets over the taffrail pouring in fire at the boats figures standing apart who had to be officers and all with their attention fixed on their attackers he took in other things too the neat order about the ship that spoke of care and professionalism the shininess of the ropes from aloft that betrayed their long service at sea and the fact that the guns were manned on one side only the crew was shorthanded probably for the same reason stirk appeared beside him then the others in each hand boarding pistols and a cutlass to the side with a lopsided grin kydd acknowledged the absurdity of reaching an enemy deck in a boarding and having the luxury of a steadying deep breath before the fight ready gentlemen savage growls answered and stalking to the after edge of the deck he howled king george and the billy roarer then plunged down to the maindeck making for the nearest gun the crew wheeled round gaping he levelled one pistol and shot the guncaptain who dropped instantly the other he fired directly at a large seaman who had reared up snarling the man fell back and dropped to his knees clutching his face with both hands blood running through his fingers two of the crew fled but another two stood irresolute kydd flung a heavy pistol at the head of one which sent him spinning down to be jolted violently by a hurtling body from behind pistols banged about him men were shrieking but other guncrews were recovering and making a rush for them kydd wrestled his cutlass free and got inside a redfaced gunner whirling a ramrod neatly spitting him yanking the blade out as the man fell he was in time to parry a maniacal swing from a boarding axe and in return opened the mans face in a spurting line of blood he felt a savage blow to his side and whipped around to see a small catlike seaman raise an iron guncrow for a second strike but he fell as if poleaxed when pearse yelling like a banshee brought his cutlass down with a violent slash and without stopping ran on into the mad whirl of fighting kydd found himself in combat with a darkcomplexioned arab wielding a curved blade with two hands the man making almost a ballet of his twisting and slashing unnerving kydd then his opponent tripped forward and impaled himself on his blade kydd swivelled around and saw oakleys body on the deck the red hair unmistakable blood issuing under him from some wound above him the boatswains mate was roaring in helpless anger as he swung and clashed with two murderous assailants on the other side of the deck kydd caught sight of pearse going down under a crowd of maddened gunners a terrible bulllike roar came from behind him it was wong armed with nothing but a capstan bar insanely whirling it about his head as he lumbered into the fray the heavy timber crushing wounding breaking and bringing the rush to a halt it was magnificent but couldnt last then from inland an invisible army opened fire on the enemy end of the deck dropping men the savage whip of bullets creating disorder and panic volley after volley came and any frenchman who could do so swung in dismay to face the onslaught it was enough cheering wildly the boats made it inside the arc of guns and seamen were swarming aboard to fall on the defenders it was over very quickly frenchmen threw down their weapons and stood sullenly panting and nursing his bruised side kydd stood to survey the carnage then strode aft well done mr gilbey he said shaking his first lieutenants hand see to our men forward will you qui est le capitaine kydd demanded of the group of disconsolate officers he lies wounded below one replied sulkily then know that as of this moment your ship is in the possession of his britannic majesty kydds heart was still pounding from the heat of combat one of the officers offered his sword he brushed it aside the honours of war must wait for another time be so good as to muster your men aft it was the welltried routine of taking over a captured ship but with a twist very conveniently he could empty the vessel of the enemy to assemble them under guard on the open ground of the riverbank while he sent curzon and a party of men to perform the usual rapid search below decks the second lieutenant reported that marie galante was essentially undamaged and ready for sea no mean prize gilbey returned from forward im truly sorry t say mr pearse is no more and mr oakley has been skelped which is t say hes taken a whiffler to the head but ive a notion hell live he added hastily very good secure the ship i want a talk with the captain kydd found the commander in a cot below in the sickbay his intelligent brown eyes reflecting a sea of pain his lower body was soaked in blood from a brokenoff splinter dark and vicious protruding from eviscerated flesh in his lower thigh kydd felt for the man hed been unlucky enough to be caught by the carronade fire at the very outset of the engagement and the surgeon had not yet seen to him mes felicitations le capitaine he gasped a boat from upstream masterly together with your overwhelming army of course we stood no chance he was an older man greying early no doubt with the strain of keeping the seas for long months in fearful conditions his gaze almost pleaded for understanding your dispositions were most intelligent sir as gave us much difficulty kydd would not be the one to disillusion him on the details and went on im quite certain admiral marechal will be the first to honour you for your gallant defence under such odds instantly the wounded mans expression stiffened the pain kept ruthlessly at bay you are no doubt from a frigate captain kydd caught himself the question was both astute and pointed this officer had foreseen the possibility that laurore might well be a scout from a powerful british squadron looking to bring marechal to battle and would welcome any indication of his whereabouts he would get nothing from this defeated captain more wounded men were being brought down and at the appearance of the surly french surgeon kydd made his excuses and left curzon was entertaining the other officers in their own quarters the second lieutenant who spoke fluent french was attempting to bring off a risque story concerning piccadilly and a lady of the town but it was being received in an icy silence by the two frenchmen at kydds interrogative glance he shook his head mutely he had the vessel but it was not yielding the information he craved frustrated kydd moved on to the captains cabin the master looked up from the working chart he had found nary a thing sir he said swivelling it round so kydd could see no squadron line of rendezvous which could mean just as easily that there wasnt one as that it was being kept private an while m french is nothing s special i didnt see a mention in his log kydd scanned the neat writing noting the regular scientific observations that this captain was in the habit of making but nowhere was there mention of the innumerable signals and irritations of life under the eye of an admiral on the other hand it would be in keeping with the french character to separate the two one being confidential so short of bringing pressure to bear on the french seamen he returned to the upper deck and saw them being herded into a square guarded by marines and seamen out in the open it was remarkable how many it took to man a ship and conversely how such a large number could fit within the confines of a ship and then he had an idea collas he called to one of the carpenters mates on a hasty survey with legge the carpenter the man loped aft youre relieved of work go down and report to mr clinton that youve orders from me to guard the noisiest prisoners sir collas said bewildered youre a guernseyman know the french channel islanders lived within sight of the french coast and even if their own patois had diverged considerably they had a trading relationship of centuries standing aye sir i want you to listen carefully for any mention of their admiral marechal anything at all that bears on where he is now be sure to let em think youre a regulargoing jack tar as is ignorant of the french lingo but keep your ears at full stretch the minute you hear something let me know understood aye aye sir collas replied knuckling his forehead kydds mind then turned to the task of getting marie galante downriver to the open sea there was only one way for a squarerigger boats it was too much to expect the french to man the oars and besides it would cost too many men in the guarding fortunately few would be necessary where they were at present in the open space ashore then there were the technical requirements any seaman knew that it was much harder to bring a vessel downriver for motion was deceptive moving at speed relative to the shore might well mean that the ship brought along by the current was barely moving relative to the water itself and therefore the rudder could not bite the ultimate indignity was to lose control and end broadside to the river stuck immovably bow and stern in a swiftflowing and massive river such as this the consequences could be serious three boats ahead one on the stern he decided her cable on the bitts and out through the hawse then the three tows from one bridle this would ensure all towing effort would be from one position rather than from several points on the structure which might fight each other the boat astern was there to correct any yawing all depended on the boats pulling hard and keeping it going only by moving through the water would the rudder be effective all except the wounded were landed and every man jack available was put to the oars kydd himself cast off the last line tethering marie galante to the bank after she had been swung around and headed downstream the men stretched out like heroes this was not simply their duty but the much more rewarding task of preserving their prize the long reach was useful in getting the feel of the craft under tow and standing next to poulden at the wheel kydd felt increasing confidence the first bend arrived taking a wide and careful sweep the boats hauled ahead manfully and they were around the next came almost immediately pull you lubbers roared gilbey from the focsle put y backs into it kydd looked over the side a noticeable ripple was forming a bowwave they were making way through the water and therefore under control taking the deeper outer curve they were well on their way poulden nodded as marie galante was obediently nudged into a deeper channel just another bend the corvette emerging to the open sea with english colours would be a sight indeed from laurore heave out lay into it gilbeys voice cracked with the effort at this last bend before the estuary and the bar it was crucial to keep way on through the single deep cleft channel through to the blessed depths of the indian ocean kydd watched in satisfaction on return to laurore he would personally see that the men at the oars spliced the mainbrace an extra grog ration even if here it was stellenbosch wine rather than rum there was a sudden thud that was more felt through the deck than heard seconds later there were baffled shouts from forward and gilbey turned to bawl disbelievingly the tows parted it was impossible kydd pounded up to see this was why a bridle was in place at the end of the thick anchor cable if any one boattow parted the rest would be preserved it could only imply that the massive anchor cable itself had given way at the focsle he looked ahead the boats were at all angles men retrieving oars where they had lost them when the heavy tension had suddenly released sending them headlong into the bottom of the boat he looked down over the cathead to the hawse expecting to see the catenary of the big cable curve away into the water but it had vanished kydd then realised it could mean just one thing that it had parted inside the hawse after it had left the riding bitts where it was belayed but this had no meaning bellowing an order to poulden to keep his heading he flew down the focsle ladder to the deck below then wheeling round he ran to the riding bitts where things became all too clear sprawled on deck under the frayed strands of the cable was the bloodsoaked body of the captain a fireaxe flung nearby in great pain the man must have crawled up from the sickbay and severed the cable bringing about the destruction of his own ship with a crushing sense of finality kydd ran aft and up the ladder to the quarterdeck not answering th helm sir poulden said in his hands the wheel was spinning uselessly they were now drifting there was far too little time to rouse out another cable and all it needed was for a counterflaw in the current at one end of the ship and there it was her head fell off and she began a slewing across the river that got rapidly faster with the softest of sensations her bow caught in the muddy bank the colossal mass of water from upcountry began taking the ship broadside an irresistible force which sent the other end immovably into the opposite bank instantly the water piled up on the upstream side in an unstoppable flood the deck canted over and racking timber groans from deep within sounded as death throes gilbey came aft raving impotently at the situation kydd cut him short all boats alongside get the wounded out then see what movables we can take he gave a wintry smile and dont delay weve not got long chapter kydd squinted down the deck to where the focsle party in streaming oilskins were preparing the bower anchor for their mooring a wet and perilous exercise in the filthy weather from the northwest another ponderous roll of thunder echoed back from table mountain and ahead ships jibbed nervously under the bluster of autumn wind and grey fretful seas from the focsle curzons arm shot up and kydd acknowledged they were ready to take their place and let slip the anchor past the throng of merchant shipping among the naval squadron at the outer part of the table bay anchorage and the captain of laurores first duty was to pay his respects to commodore popham the senior naval officer cape colony although he had lost the corvette he had returned with something much more precious you have the deck mr curzon im going below to shift rig before i report it was a straightforward moor in the open roadstead and gilbey was on hand but his second lieutenant glowed at the trust it was a bucketing bruising pull to diadem the flagship even in the launch that kydd had called upon in place of his slighterbuilt barge walls of rain sluiced across and despite boatcloak and oilskins he was soaked and chilled when he finally stepped into the commodores cabin popham regarded him without enthusiasm saying testily kydd do contrive to drip somewhere else wont you my apologies sir he said handing his cocked hat to a servant i do have news that im sanguine will interest you oh popham said coldly kydd outlined his voyage succinctly ending with his chase and capture of marie galante and her later loss by stranding cant be helped i suppose popham said with feeling it was well known that in his career at sea he had never been lucky in prize money butchers bill we lost a masters mate with two wounded in the boarding and one killed and three hurt in the boats by musketry sir the french suffered eight dead and eleven wounded including their captain who bled to death after his deed hmm a small price for us im bound to say you have prisoners i have all the officers and skilled hands in laurore and i beg you will give instructions that will see a transport call at quelimane where i landed the common matelots for want of accommodation the next indiabound supply vessel will answer i should think now i dont suppose this corvette was with marechal at all popham asked hopefully kydd savoured the moment no sir most definitely not oh youve questioned the officers of course i did but the intelligence i have for you came from quite another source yes what is that pray there was an impatient edge to his tone so kydd went on quickly i arranged for a channel islander to be in the guard over the prisoners he overheard em say something thatll surely gratify it seemed they were bemoaning the fate that sees them in chains in cape town while marechal and his squadron must be halfway home to rochefort by now ah so excellent news this could mean their charts have no workings on it to suggest a fleet operation their logs make no mention of a rendezvous and their last port o call was reunion confronted with it their first lieutenant admitted it was so that they were merely out on a cruise of depredation against our commerce capital then we may take it that marechal has abandoned his venture and is returning the last squadron of threat to cape town is gone this is splendid news captain splendid he seemed to brighten by the minute my dear fellow im forgetting my manners may i offer you a restorative negus perhaps the prospect of a piping hot toddy was compelling and kydd accepted gratefully he could understand the relief popham must be feeling rather than the negative news from his scouting frigates that the french were not to be found in this area or that here was a positive indication that the menace was now safely on its way out of cape waters i really feel this news is worthy of celebration youll stay and sup with me kydd it was an odd dinner for with the blow from the south atlantic kicking up respectablesized rollers there was no possibility of boats coming out from the shore the company was restricted to themselves with diadems first lieutenant davis and a bemused passenger one scholes doctor of theology whose store of amusing anecdotes petered out in the strongly masculine naval company sir do tell of your cutting out o this frenchy corvette ill wager its to be my dinnertable yarn for years t come davis said his voice tinged in equal measure with admiration and envy while the darkness of evening fell outside and the bluster of the northwesterly rattled the oldfashioned sternwindows of the sixtyfour kydd told of the adventure a modest straight account with full acknowledgement to those who had contributed a capital operation indeed popham declared in the best traditions and so forth i for one am honoured to drink your health sir glowing kydd accepted the compliment and nodded graciously when scholes observed i too must add my measure of amazement at your remarkable courage to go forward on your enterprise in the stark knowledge of africas perils and hazards kydd flinched at the memory of the sinking island and that night in the african bush but popham was in no doubt ah yes doctor but for the greater prize our good captain is never to be dismayed by the wonders of nature is that not so kydd the talk fell away and the dinner ended quietly davis made his excuses and left and scholes found it necessary to retire to attend to his work leaving them alone to do justice to the fine cognac i do believe this to be our first chance to take our ease together kydd popham said after they had settled in the armchairs by the sternlights sir youve done well for yourself since we first met i see er yes sir mere commander of a brigsloop to postcaptain of a frigate come come thats no mean achievement could it in any wise be connected with your stout action off ushant um i think more that lord nelson was in sore need of frigates kydd said uncomfortably that nelson himself had called for him when a captured frigate had become available was something hed clutch to his heart for ever but now did not seem the right time to mention it popham chuckled youre too damn modest for your own good you know that kydd youll never get ahead without you make a commotion about it yes sir leaning forward to top up kydds glass popham then sat back and looked at him quizzically do loosen old chap i may be commodore for the nonce but this of course is but a temporary post while subduing cape town ill be reverting back once their lordships deem our task is done and then ill be the same as you postcaptain even if the senior it was singular but it was true they were of equal substantive rank and in terms of shore protocol at least would then be accorded an equal deference do you remember not so long ago that little affair with the american fulton and his submersible we worked together on it and you frowned on his submarine boat kydd said i was right was i not it has to be said should you want to know what happened to the fellow popham said idly twirling his glass his torpedoes yes we made some gestures towards boulogne but with paltry result boney himself had the hide to say we were breaking the windows of the good citizens of boulogne with guineas then we made a heroic effort and put on a show for pitt and the admiralty off deal tethered an innocent little brig what was her name dorothea thats it and sent in the torpedoes he guffawed at the recollection you should have seen the looks on their faces kydd not a jot of warning and the brigs exploded to fragments st vincent turned quite grey and pitt felt ill a terrific demonstration so so nothing just a fortnight later you and our nel clear the seas of the french fleet so whats the use o these toys when theres no more invasion to be feared they paid him off and sent him packing back to the united states pity a strange cove but i liked him kydd said well well hear no more of his plunging boats i believe weve a war to fight and only the finest seamanship and gunnery will win that you were at trafalgar then popham asked somewhat defensively in a small way of things o course i have to say your telegraphic signals were well received by the fleet kydd said and then more strongly especially after nelson made use of em to entertain us before the engagement england expects that quite so i did hear of it a shadow passed across his features kydd had been present at both the nile and trafalgar the defining battles of the age but through ill luck popham had never seen a grand fleet action and now here we are he concluded softly im sorry sir i meant to say that were safe here in cape colony are we not but lacking the one thing that a naval officer craves above all else a chance for distinction just so were both in like state youve a fine start to your career but unless something happens youll moulder away your best years here at the cape and i well shall we say that unless i can distinguish myself while i still have my mighty fleet then i shall join you in sliding from the consciousness of their lordships will we not soon be recalled why so were doing a sterling job holding the cape for king george why disturb it well put down the occasional privateer or even a loose frigate but nothing to stand against the exploits of others who are adding to our empire by the month that gave kydd pause it made disturbing sense yet were at a strategic position here sir whos to say the french may wish soon to dispute these seas in force they wont now m friend their squadrons are scattered defeated and gone home the channel fleet blockade will take care of their sorties in the future no were to remain at rest foreseeably i fear is there nothing im giving it some high thought popham replied mysteriously as may yet yield a possibility he stared out into the wild darkness with a strange expression then resumed briskly meanwhile do stand down your ship for a week or two youve deserved it well share a dinner on another occasion quite set me aback nicholas kydd laughed shaking out his wet clothing here we have the commodore confiding hes bored to me a junior frigate captain a prickly gullion in the past as i remember you dont suppose hes a reason for it he added awkwardly noticing renzi wore an odd hunted look his friend brightened a little the reigning flag officer id rather think hes more pleased at your success that rids him of a pressing anxiety well whatever hes given us leave to stand down for a brace of weeks do you fancy a time of it ashore er not at this time tom kydd was not to be dissuaded only a short while before his friend had been the colonial secretary of cape colony with hopes of tenure before being unexpectedly replaced by a civilservice appointee sent out from england now he was staying aboard unable to face the imagined stares of the townsfolk i have to say itll be quite necessary im afraid dear chap im resolved this ship is to be fumigated and sweetened while she lies idle and no man may stay on board with the urgency of the situation there had been little opportunity since leaving england the previous year for attending to the needs of his ship and she had now been through a tropic summer and besides kydd had ideas about her appearance ill be staying at my club for the duration the africa on the heerengracht he said with relish capital roast game wines a supernaculum id be honoured to have you as my guest dear fellow thats civil in you right enough on a point of some delicacy renzi murmured would it be impertinent of me to enquire in what manner youll introduce me kydd snorted why this is a gentlemens club should i introduce you as my friend then that is all that need be said old trout then perhaps i will accept your kind offer the news of a fumigation was well received by laurores company with its prospect of enforced shore leave and even more so when it became known that a contractor would be engaged for the unpleasant business next day the bad weather seemed to have blown itself out and almost apologetically the sun began spreading its warmth and good feeling about the anchorage laurore went to two anchors and secured fore and aft in preparation for the fumigation early in the afternoon a towed lighter approached and gleefully the ships company made ready for their liberty capn kydd sir a large dutchman said raising his shapeless hat as he came over the bulwark piet geens are ye prepared atall we are kydd was used to the routine with his long service in the navy geens walked back and shouted something down to the men in the lighter and returned well wem ready to start kapitein in high spirits the libertymen were sent on their way leaving laurore echoing and empty the only ones left aboard being kydd a small party of men on deck to assist and keep an eye on proceedings and renzi a rowguard provided by diadem slowly circled as the dutchman and kydd went below to spy out the task whats your method mr geens kydd asked why the only one as truly answers mijnheer an recommended by yr transport board itself for th use of india troopships in short fumes o vitriol kills rats n mice weevil an cockroach all that creeps an crawls ends the same this was the deepest form of fumigation possible but the ship had to be sealed for greatest effect the platform timbers above the hold had been removed and the mens belongings taken to the upper deck gear was becketed back out of the way gratings covered with tarpaulins and hatchways closed with laced canvas flaps ver good kapitein we begin in twentyfour hours you have yr ship back sweet as a nut an alarming number of casks and sacks were piled on deck curious kydd went across and peered into one it was filled with crude yellow cakes thats yr common flowers o sulphur geens said and this kydd held up a sack of dirty white crystals is best nitre sulphur dont burn s well we give it nitre one part to every eight o the yellow cake then we get plenty o them vitriolic acid fumes want t see er no ill leave it all to you mr geens kydd said carry on please tin pans were charged with a small coil of quickmatch in the coarseground mixture and distributed below men with pails of mud moved about completing the seal and shortly afterwards the first acrid whiffs could be detected time we werent here nicholas the africa club welcomed kydd warmly word of the little action in east africa had got about and in a darkpolished room ornamented with game trophies and shields with crossed assegais those waiting for a full accounting of it had assembled have t hand it to ye kydd twas a grand stroke the redfaced and moustachioed ivory trader ditler chortled beckoning him to an adjacent leather chair a peg o whisky for y tale others drew up their chairs companionably but kydd remained standing and this is my particular friend nicholas renzi he said pointedly of course he is soothed the cocoa planter richardson as will have a whisky too eh renzi hey thank you no renzi said politely although anything out of stellenbosch would gratify if it does not inconvenience if any knew him as other than captain kydds friend it could not be detected in their expressions kydd found himself in the seat of honour in the centre and awaited his libation despite what popham had said a lengthy stay in cape waters had its compensations he had to admit who would have thought in those impossibly remote days in the musty guildford wig shop that he would later find himself in a splendid goldlaced uniform in these exotic surroundings thank you cuthbert he said accepting his whisky a single malt he was pleased to note after his experience with the highlanders at blaauwberg nothing less would serve cradling the drink he found himself further reflecting on his conversation with popham ahem ah yes marie galante kydd was not a born storyteller and in his own ears the account sounded matteroffact and predestined hed omitted his doubts and worries as theyd gone into action the need to rise above his own fears and terror of the unknown to order men into those same hazards yet the simple telling was received with something like reverence and he ended the tale pinkfaced good god man y sit there so cool an tell us you spent your night on the riverbank never heard o such blazin courage ditlers admiration was clear er what well the crocs fr one oh surely y know they stalk abroad at night wanting t devour sleeping prey they snap their jaws shut on ye theres no hope for it all over he threw up his arms in an expressive gesture and yr hippos too kydd came the gravelly tones of the whitehaired suntouched baker theys on land an it being their river should y get atween them an it why at four ton coming at ye faster than y can run he shook his head speechless not forgetting its lion country richardson brought in with relish raising his glass to kydd go around in hunting bands at night they do take a terrible lot o kaffirs poor devils kydd remembered the massive presence theyd sensed passing by in the inky darkness and shivered ditler put in strongly and y talked on sailing a floatin island downriver b glory and yere a mile an a half braver than i he said in awestruck tones the watersnakes baker wondered not merely was the reply i was thinking more o your frightsome bull shark o the zambezi as is not content wi whats in the sea but must range miles up into the river even into freshwater kydd swallowed right up t the shallows o the headwaters nasty vicious brutes cn take a man out of a canoe even he declared not t be beat in the article of killing even the crocs do step lightly around em and kydd decided to change the subject thank you mr ditler and ill bear em in mind the next time we move on the enemy you gentlemen have ventured up the coast id welcome a steer on whats to be found in those parts after what i saw there the talk brightened into trade prospects at the fringe of the arab world barely touched by events outside then came wellpolished stories of the white man in africa as warm and entertaining as the yarns to be heard over any wardroom dinner at sea content kydd winked at renzi then settled back and let the talk wash over him its done capn geens said importantly holding out the requisite papers to sign ill see below first if i may kydd replied and set off purposefully the gunports and gratings had been open all morning but there was still a sour biting odour about the ship they went down to the maindeck where the pungency caught him at the back of the throat making him gag there a half a dozen men with sacks were scooping up a carpet of vermin some of which still writhed and contorted dead cockroaches grubs and other insects all driven by the fumes from their hiding places to expire in the open on the messdeck around the dark cavity of the hold rat carcasses lay in horrifying abundance while laurore had seen first trafalgar and then blaauwberg these were the hidden passengers who had been lurking in the nether regions oblivious to events and with only the ships precious sea provisions in mind geens used wooden tongs to lift up a still feebly moving rat for kydds inspection see does for em all in the end gaspin for air comes out but its no good hes blind o course vitriolic acid eats out his eyes the plaguey villain he sniffed dropping the rat into the sack kydd felt dutybound to stay aboard as the men reluctantly made their way back to their ship suffering with them until the vessel was habitable again he had split the ships company in two to share the duties and the first on board were set to sweeten the vessel from stem to stern a mighty scrubbing with vinegar and lime the deckhead beams liberally anointed with a powerful concoction of geens own devising the cable tiers were lime whitewashed and twice two feet of seawater was let in to flood the bilges the reeking water then pumped over the side until it ran clear after their heroic efforts this party happily made its way ashore to its favoured waterfront punchhouse to wash away the taste with cape brandy while the other watch came on board for the even more taxing job of painting ship boatswain oakley his head bandaged and in pain took charge preparation was thorough wood painstakingly scraped back before the paint was carefully mixed the pigment oil and litharge was poured into an old fishkettle in proportions to his satisfaction and on an upperdeck charcoal fire the mixture was boiled then strained through a breadbag to be laid on warm kydd had his firm views on appearance it was to stay the nelson chequer a smart black hull with a warlike band of yellow along the line of guns the gunports menacing regular squares in black lower masts below the tops were well varnished above the tops they were painted black as were the yards with white tips at their extremities to aid in working aloft in the dark then there was the detailing scarlet inner bulwarks before the guns a stout mixture of varnish and tar on the binnacle and belfry and here and there a dash of white the flutings of the headrails and cheeks saw dark blue to set off the carved scrollwork and their oldfashioned lion and crown figurehead claimed a handsome gilding of goldleaf kydd himself found the necessary wherewithal to ensure the ornamentation shone around the quartergalleries and sternlights the men set to with a will to brighten their living quarters it was amazing how much a frigates belowthewaterline messdeck could be lightened by a lime whitewash on the bulkheads and ships side the petty officers prettified their own messes each separated by canvas screens decorated lavishly with mermaids and sea battles their crockery messtraps stowed neatly in vertical side lockers in a frigate there was no need to clear for action on a deck with no guns kydd found time to relax in his great cabin the floorcloth renewed and the furniture sweetsmelling from the lavenderoilimpregnated beeswax that tysoe his valet had applied to overcome the odour of fumigation the boys had been industrious in their cleaning and priddying and at renzis suggestion kydds intricate showcase secretaire had been picked out in gilt around its french polish and green leather the gunroom had come together in noble style to enrich their own sea home in place of the utilitarian service barrel slung from the forward bulkhead from which commensal wine was drawn there was now a beautifully polished elliptical cask made for the purpose and bearing a silver plate with the gunroom hms laurore cape colony engraved in bold flourishes an elegant locker had been contrived around the rudder trunking which now served to conceal the gunrooms stock of dogeared newspapers and magazines gilbey and curzons time ashore had not been wasted a pair of remarkably animated watercolours of table mountain and the cape of good hope now adorned their quarters laurore came alive again the rhythm of a comfortable harbour routine set in of hands to turn to part of ship in the forenoon and liberty ashore in the afternoon kydd saw a fierce pride in his ship in due course there would be hardfought regattas and other competitive outlets but for now all could revel in as trim and saucy a frigate as any that swam youve um not received anything from cecilia at all renzi asked offhandedly twiddling his quill as kydd opened a packet of ships mail from england renzis plans to invite kydds sister cecilia to visit him in cape town and offer his hand in marriage had been dashed when his position as acting colonial secretary had not been ratified previously he had written her a letter pouring out his most tender admiration and love for her but delayed sending it until things were fully settled when the blow came hed torn the letter up cecilia had known of his tendre for her for some time but the latest communication shed had from him was a stiff letter of release hed sent before trafalgar citing his lack of prospects who knew what her feelings towards him were now kydd pushed his papers to one side no nicholas and you shall be the first to know of it should i get a letter from her he said impatiently this cape enterprise being in the nature of a secret expedition i can well see it will have any letter chasing all over the ocean till it catches up with us which it will in course yes no doubt you are correct renzi said with a troubled look kydd sighed you know you now stand in a fair way of losing the woman what do you mean theres every prospect that having conquered and held the place the admiralty will see fit to keep us here indefinitely we doing such a sterling job renzis expression turned bleak he had sworn to kydd he would go down on his knees and seek cecilias hand the same day that they reached the shores of england that time now distant would she still be free id suggest you write to her this hour m friend believe me ive tried but then id think it wise to consider your position old horse a halfsmile appeared kydd knew the signs and waited for his friend to speak dear brother in logic as i see it there are three alternatives the one that she is already taken by another which at the moment i cannot know the second that she is not but will nevertheless decline my suit and the third that that she will listen favourably to that which i shall propose after a moments reflection he said so it seems my course is clear no dilemma no equivocation or foolish agonising oh on the one i am helpless to alter the dictates of fortune likewise the second neither requiring either action or decision as to the third this must presuppose i should prepare for the day now in the absence of intelligence to the contrary each condition bears an equal probability of being the outcome the odds of one in three i accept those odds but you see it makes no difference in the event of the first two no prior intervention will affect matters while for the third it will therefore irrespective i am obliged to assume the last that i am to marry well done old trout kydd applauded therefore for both your sakes write to her now theres a mail to close tomorrow on bombay castle its impossible i cannot trust that i could write without betraying my true feelings and i abhor pity therefore i ask a boon that you write to her as a brother and enquire of her personal circumstances kydd frowned then nodded reluctantly meanwhile in this far region there is one and one only contribution to my future with cecilia left open to me kydd waited it would come out logically as it always did renzi took a deep breath looked skyward then slammed both fists on the table and choked that novel im going to write my novel for cecilias sake to see renzi so taken with emotion shook kydd er why to be sure i know youll do it nicholas he said with concern it was clear his friends so recent cruel fall from fortune and prospects for marriage had affected him more than he had revealed renzi took control then said evenly i shall dedicate my heart and soul to portrait of an adventurer tom never doubt it for one minute yes nicholas writing a novel had been kydds idea a suggestion to which until now kydd had never given much more thought but he knew that it was probably the only thing renzi could do that had any promise for the future the public seemed to crave such works and renzi had had a number of adventures around the world that might inspire such a book but most importantly it would keep his friend occupied until they returned and he could resolve matters with kydds sister damme whatever it takes out of me this is the only thing i can positively do for the both of us renzi said defiantly i quite understand mfriend not forgetting mark you what i said about cecilia kydd smiled a natural philosopher turned writer of novels of course she should never hear of it he clapped his hand on the desk and gave a mock frown so what do you know of novels ever ah not much i confess ive yet to read one my father railing against them so vehemently ive taken some first steps however which persuade me that it may not be as plainsailing a task as first id conceived youll do it nicholas never fear i enquired in our worthy gunroom if there was by chance a reader of novels who might lend me a volume but it seems there was not yet mysteriously by evening a pair lay on my cot such noble fellows he fumbled in his pocket and drew out two wellused pocket editions and passed them across curious kydd opened one the castle on the rhine or the fatal warning was its title and lower down it went on breathlessly to declare that it was the harrowing tale of the fate of reginald de vere who dared pierce the deathly walls of a deserted castle in pursuit of a ghostly love um youve experience of ghosts at all nicholas kydd asked doubtfully we have an ancestral phantom but ive never met it renzi said apologetically and never a spirit of the ghostly sort that is have i seen at sea kydd turned to the second book then this other one quentin dandy being an account of the peregrinations of a scoundrel and his dreadful end in five volumes but this is the third only damn it it must serve i fear we need all the research matter we can lay hands on we my dear fellow you dont imagine i shall exclude my most particular friend from this literary adventure surely but im a sea officer fit only to write a log or beg favour of my admiral nicholas what do i know of romance and plotting tom dear fellow you have a crucial role one suited only to a clear and strong mind as will not be swayed by fashion and sorcery in fine dear friend you shall be my audience oh to make critical remarks review your meaning and similar er yes then shall i be telling the truth or will i be losing a friend kydd asked slyly ive yet to write a word renzi said stiffly theres a mort of work before then gravely the commodore paced slowly along the assembled divisions asking a question here commending an appearance there kydd followed laurore was at her best and he could vouch for her fighting spirit some senior officers insisted on a faultless appearance others fell back on pedantry in the matter of ceremonials but he knew popham prized intelligence and audacity above all else and who on this station had shown more than laurore concluding his tour popham stood genially on the quarterdeck and addressed kydd loudly a splendid turnout captain and as fine a kings ship as any ive seen you shall have my order that the mainbrace be spliced this afternoon thank you sir kydd replied courteously that is if youre able to satisfy me in one last particular sir popham wheeled about and strode purposefully to the spotless after end of the quarterdeck beyond the mizzenmast i desire you should make to diadem the following signal saxton the signals masters mate hastily took out his notebook report the christian name of the captain of your maintop that would be quite impossible to send with the current admiralty signal book telegraph muttered saxton instantly to his petty officer who lost no time in having the telegraph code flag bent on while saxton composed the signal it drew an approving nod from the commodore when christian was not found in the book and saxton muttered um that is fore forward bows and then name will do he rapidly found the numbers the hoist soared up to be answered with a spelledout reply from all three masts of diadem cholmondeley saxton reported woodenfaced very good popham said graciously you may stand down your ships company captain when this had been done kydd asked politely and may i offer you refreshments sir once in kydds great cabin hats and swords were put off and popham eased himself into one of the armchairs by the sternlights stretching luxuriously and loosening his neckcloth a thoroughly goodspirited ship kydd count yourself blessed youre her commander tysoe arrived with glasses on a tray to laurore popham toasted long may you reign in her he put down his glass adding as you wont always serve in such a thoroughbred enjoy her while you can old fellow for the time will come when youll know only the lumbering tedium of a shipotheline i will you may be sure of it kydd said with feeling then realised too late that this must apply to popham himself at the moment which is to say of course and you and she will grow old together on this station kydd paused popham must be restless if he was bringing this up again theres a chance well be superseded and sent home surely i rather think not a pair of old sixtyfours and a couple of frigates is a small enough levy on our fleet why go to the bother and expense of exchanging ships over such a distance perhaps so kydd said i suppose we must rest content it is our purpose and duty is it not unexpectedly popham sighed youre in the right of it old fellow we shouldnt complain he stared moodily out of the pretty windows at the vast whitespecked ocean expanse even when i know for want of communication a priceless opportunity for strategic intervention is slipping by sir well in this mornings mail i received word from my friend miranda that he is beginning an enterprise of the utmost significance he saw kydds mystification and explained a gentleman of mixed spanish ancestry known to me since the year ninetyeight went to france to learn to be a revolutionary for he ardently desires to rid the spanish colonies in the south of america of their masters the french being lukewarm in the matter he then secretly approached the foreign office and he was disappointed in his hopes and came to see me with his intentions as a newly elected member of parliament i took an interest his proposal possessing certain compelling advantages to the crown his plan was to raise widespread rebellion in south america while the attention of the spanish and french was on the invasion of great britain the benefits to us i need hardly point out an immediate cessation of the treasure fleet filling boneys coffers would provide an intolerable distraction to spain caught between two fires as will probably see it sue for peace and of course an immeasurable increase in trade opportunities once the continent is thrown open to englands merchants he had kydds complete attention strategy and chance were coinciding for truly global stakes popham continued at some length i argued mirandas case in a secret memorandum to billy pitt who took it seriously and even told the admiralty to work up an expedition to assist this was about the time of fultons torpedoes so if i appeared a little distracted at the time i do apologise not as ever i noticed kydd replied carefully then villeneuve sailed and the trafalgar campaign began we were stripped of ships and unable to sail and when we did well it was to the more direct goal cape town and successful here we remain so no expedition unhappily no and do be discreet in what you say old fellow the spanish suspect there is some villainy afoot but cant fathom from where kydd nodded but surely with both the spanish and french driven from the seas and not to be counted on to interfere now is the best time to move quite so miranda popham shook his head a shameful thing i must own despairing that we will ever get another expedition together he is proceeding on his own his letter coldly informs me that he is shortly to descend on caracas the chief town in the north of the continent there to raise the flag of revolution and independence for all the peoples of south america and we do nothing the plan called for us to move simultaneously against the viceroyalty of the river plate in the south montevideo or wherever but this is hard to take kydd growled such a blow as will ring out around the world does not whitehall see this have you had any kind of word popham gave a tired smile pitt was not well when we sailed on this cape venture conceivably hes distracted by the news of austerlitz we dont know that kydd had only recently heard of it a land battle in some benighted place to the east where bonaparte had crushed the armies of both the austrian and russian emperors in a titanic battle most opinion had it that the third coalition an alliance including austria prussia england russia and sweden was as good as destroyed popham downed the rest of his wine if there are any designs to move against the river plate we should be the first to know of it we are the closest and the forces we employed on this expedition can only be said to be in idleness but youve had no word popham shook his head the next afternoon kydd insisted renzi dine at his club and they went ashore together as they left the old jetty for the noisome waterfront renzi stopped er theres someone id rather not meet he muttered and turned about wha at the end of the lane a distinguishedlooking man was directing others in some sort of inventory then kydd recognised him its only your old fiscal ryneveld he chided knowing however that while renzi had been colonial secretary this man had been his immediate subordinate now he was at an impossibly lofty eminence in government you cant avoid him for ever nicholas he said and hailed the man mr fiscal ahoy ryneveld came hurrying over why the jonkheer renzi he said with disarming warmth since leaving your position youve been so engaged in your studies youve been neglecting your friends sir renzi gave a stiff bow i stand accused and can only plead guilty schildknaap ryneveld well thats a matter that can easily be remedied let me see as it happens my wife barbetjie whom you know of course is taking the girls up to the top of table mountain for an artistic expedition while the weather allows should you feel inclined you two gentlemen would be very welcome to partake of our little picnic and perhaps to instruct them in their daubing thats very kind in you kydd said quickly wed be honoured to attend splendid er your ethnical work is proceeding satisfactorily mr renzi i cannot conceive how you might concentrate with all the martial excitement about your ears it er progresses well sir and and the government of cape colony your distinguished new secretary ah me ryneveld said with a sigh those heroic days when together we snatched order from the chaos that threatened im afraid these are long past mr renzi now its work more fitting for the administrator and accountant with secretary barnard still unwell from his long voyage they walked on in silence for a space passing a wellweathered wijnhuis they heard a manly bass booming out a jolly ballad aan de kaap hoord en wilt verstaan daar de meisjes dagelyks verkeeren al in het huys de blaauwe haan daar wyze dagelyks converzeren ah renzi said politely a folk song of the colony no doubt hallowed by age do share with me what they are singing about sir you are right ryneveld said drily this is from the early days of our settlement sung by returning sailors of the dutch east india company but the words are not for ears such as yours jonkheer renzi kydd hid a smile nonetheless mr renzi im sure is interested in its ethnical er origins mr ryneveld are you sure why yes renzi said then it goes at the cape one hears youll understand there maidens daily do play court at the house of the blue cock the rhyme and rhythm were quite lost in translation but the sentiment was clear you wish me to continue sir please the unknown rich bass rolled on een frische roemer kaapsche wyn zai hem die geld heeft smaaklyk zijn zo proeft men reeds op deersten stond de vruchten van de kaapschen grond and ill translate freely this last touching as it does on our mariners delight in finding himself once more in cape town a cool rummer of cape wine is zest indeed for he with money to taste from that first moment the fruits of the good cape earth thank you sir most informative renzi said cheerfully now convinced there was no longer any need to hide his face when ashore and where shall we meet for your diverting expedition pray he added they were fortunate the autumn weather was kind and a warm sun beamed down on the little party marvelling at the precipitous edge of table mountain and the spectacular panorama sprawled in meticulous miniature detail below they were not alone other small groups were there taking advantage of the benevolent conditions and cheery greetings were exchanged by all who had made the vertiginous final ascent it had been carriages to the lower slopes of the giant mountain followed by a panting scramble up past a waterfall shaded by myrtle then had come an arduous zigzag for some hours in the warm sunshine until in the very shadow of the final vertical shafting of the vast monolith a cool chasm had opened this was the platteklip gorge their pass to the summit and pausing to drink at a crystal spring they emerged at last at the top there were no trees only some wistfully beautiful tiny flowers and heath with moss and lichen and for the rest a bare grey rulerstraight flatness stretching away for what seemed miles one of natures truly impressive vistas exclaiming at the sight the girls claimed their vantagepoints and the party joined in a tasty repast of cold meats and cape wine after the picnic had been cleared away kydd found a spot and set up his easel renzi on his right the breeze fluttered at the paper which he clipped down firmly after he had industriously sharpened his best cumberland pencil he set to like most naval officers he had learned to take the likeness of a coastline and he had found he was in possession of an artistic talent looking out now at a prospect worthy of the greatest artists he felt inspired he was on the rim of the world and in the bluemisty distance could see the rumpled pair of mountains at the far end of the curve of coast that was blaauwberg where not so very long ago two armies had vied for dominion of the cape nearer many ships were anchored offshore cape town was clearly prospering by the opening of trade with the world with a surge of pride he picked out laurore among the bigger naval vessels in their more northerly anchorage yards meticulously square a perfect toy at this distance as he sketched in the outlines in deft strokes he pondered over what popham had confided there was sense in what he had said about their situation being out of sight out of mind he had seen it once before as a new officer on the quiet north america station in halifax nova scotia there he had met men who had been in ships that had been sent out at the beginning of the war and were still there with no foreseeable prospect of either engaging in some momentous fleet action or returning home he had welcomed the relative tranquillity for the space it gave him to learn his profession but it was a different matter here now he was a young captain at the outset of his career if he failed to make his mark soon others would overtake him gaining the plum promotions the more powerful frigates and be the ones to go on with the great admirals to who knew what glorious actions and there was another element to be considered he was now a very eligible bachelor by most standards and it was on the cards that he would fall in love and want to marry while he had command of a farranging frigate it was essential to make the going in amassing prizemoney now for as popham could testify there was little to be had in the larger ships while he still had a respectable sum from his privateering days it was not enough to buy and run a country estate then again bonaparte had triumphed on land but how long could a war be relied on to last now that the tyrant was locked up in europe with nowhere to go peacetime would see an instant freezing of promotions and certainly no opportunity for fattening the purse if there was a time to become active it was now the outline of his scene was complete he hooked up the box of watercolours to the base of the easel and sighed it was not in his power to summon the french to a desperate battle with few casualties and the unfortunate loss of the corvette the recent action on the zambezi would hardly raise eyebrows if only whitehall had seen fit for a grand assault against spanish south america the british had proved their amphibious skills at blaauwberg and such a mission could well be a repeat of that suddenly restless he glanced sideways at the girls gossiping blithely as they worked on their landscapes seized by an odd feeling he dabbed in a fearsome oxeye the dreadful storm portent he had seen off east africa before a particularly violent tempest it was colourful and vivid but didnt fit the scene he realised hed spoiled the painting laid down his brush in vexation and decided to take a stroll kydd had worked fast and the others in the party hadnt yet exchanged their pencils for brushes over to the right he noticed a darkhaired rather shabby figure rapidly executing his landscape unusually for a watercolour he was using a fullsized maulstick and worked with quick economic movements kydd wandered over and stood behind him clearly this was no amateur his field easel was well used and he was building his scene over a luminous cerulean wash that gave a shimmering quality to the foreground elements which gained animation as a result a lively piece kydd offered leaning closer the man a young intense individual with suntouched iberian features turned nodded brusquely and returned to his work kydd looked closer at the landscape realising hed seen the style before that was it the gunroom had bought two of his paintings you paint professionally then kydd asked hooking his maulstick in a little finger the man felt in his waistcoat drew out a card and handed it over then resumed his rapid brushstrokes with unsettling concentration the card read vicente serrano painter in oils watercolour and gouache portraits and landscapes to the discerning by arrangement buitengracht street youre spanish then kydd asked puzzled this time he got full attention no sir serrano spat i am not a porteno of buenos aires which is in south america he glared at kydd then resumed his work oh i didnt wish to pry mr serrano its just that the gunroom in my ship is an admirer of your work theres now two pieces hanging there to ornament their messplace there was a pause and a flashed glance back so sorry i leave buenos aires because the spanish they come for me when i speak what they don like i cannot return now i paint the picture for my bread por favor senor he recharged his brush and continued on the landscape kydd went back to his easel and began another view this time it was with a calm greyblue wash like the one he had just seen and he wanted to make a good job of it perhaps he would send it home to his mother stretching he looked across at renzi who had gone to one of the girls and was leaning over her in conversation he was by no means as accomplished as kydd proficient but with a light style that lacked individuality should he go over and set them both straight on the finer points he got up but when he looked again he was astonished to see the girl blush deeply glance around and then go with renzi out of sight over the edge of the broad top of the mountain renzi near betrothed to his sister scandalised he considered whether to follow but realised that whatever he did would be misunderstood so he waited awkwardly at the girls easel ignoring flashed glances from the others after an age the two appeared again when the girl saw kydd her eyes widened and her hand flew guiltily to her mouth um er this is miss felicity renzi said awkwardly captain kydd of laurore my dear at a loss kydd merely bowed and looked at renzi oh er miss felicity wishes my opinion of her veduta what is your taking at all it was a fine intricate and painstaking work with not an ounce of life in it however kydd mumbled something anodyne then added in a significant tone and i would be obliged for your opinion on mine nicholas at his easel kydd turned on renzi sir might i make so bold as to enquire renzi cut him off in a private way of things miss felicity was of some assistance to me he said bitingly in the article of what a lady might see in a novel in peril of her reputation she made free of her feelings in the matter shall we join the others popham laid down his pointer and looked at his captains apologetically so thats the situation this month gentlemen more of the same the sixtyfours to remain here the frigates to cruise occasionally im sorry not to have more entertainment but as you can see the french have not been obliging in this byng of belliqueuxs bass rumble came in it has to be said though that life on this station does have its compensations he had reason to be satisfied he had been comfortably in command of the ageing sixtyfour for five years now and his wife had recently arrived to join him as had downmans in diadem with the pretty wife of ledas honyman there was now a close social grouping of the married men with family be that as it may we have our duty which takes precedence over all else popham said coldly well im for a mort of play at the tables tonight frederick there was an affable response to byngs query and the captains made their way out but something tugged at kydd and he delayed popham was collecting up his papers and kydd saw the sagging shoulders the slow movements and felt a sudden stab of sympathy he said impulsively er sir theres a french singer at my club much cried up should you wish it we could spend a pleasant enough evening there the commodore looked up his face lined and careworn and broke into a soft smile why so thoughtful in you kydd i shall take you up on the offer i believe he looked down saying quietly and its dasher to my friends as i hope youll account me the evening turned out as agreeable as promised and the two found themselves by the log fire each with a fine brandy elsewhere the noisy conviviality continued but they sat in companionable silence staring into the flames at last popham spoke pay no mind to me today kydd im prey to the blue devils at times im unhappily possessed of a mind thats ceaselessly conjuring up quantities of stratagems and devices that have no hope ever of seeing light of day it is a disappointment no doubt that mrs popham is not joining you kydd said gently presumably she would be the one to tame his restless spirit if anyone could elizabeth does not take kindly to foreign climes and we have a clutch of daughters whose education would suffer if they were parted from their school it was known that popham had a wife and family but they had never followed him and he was left like so many other naval officers neither bachelor nor married man some had taken the easy way out but he had always remained faithful kydd shifted uncomfortably aware he was talking to the one who had surveyed in the red sea conceived of the sea fencibles had devised the nearinvisible catamaran torpedo launchers and a radical new signal system used by nelson himself originated the secret miranda memorandum and was no less than a full fellow of the royal society what possible diversions were to be found in cape colony for this fecund brain in my lower moments i feel driven to strike my flag and return to england away from this exile he took a deep pull of his brandy that would be the end of my sea service of course but aghast kydd tried to find something to say in brotherly sympathy but could think of nothing that did not sound weak and at other times i damn the eyes of the sluggards in london who couldnt see a strategical opportunity if it bit them in the ankle for two pins id sail against montevideo with what i have rather than wait for their interminable approval until its too late kydd caught a betraying flash of the eyes and with a tightening of the stomach realised what it meant he was being sounded out the commodore was up to something and needed to know where he stood a wash of apprehension was quickly replaced by a surge of understanding and loyalty popham was driven by his own need for action but it was in direct accord with his higher duty to his country and the more basic requirement they both shared to achieve something of distinction did he really mean it as well you might dasher kydd said warmly it would try the patience of a saint he allowed some moments to pass then added casually and a move against the dons in south america could well knock them out of the war im persuaded you are it would discommode them to a degree that much is certain and the treasure there id rather it were in english hands than boneys dont you think the eyes were now steadily on kydd and he returned the gaze confidently nothing had been said that was either the truth or what he truly felt i do but then all this is to no purpose theres nothing can be done without there is approval from whitehall um popham said his gaze not wavering this must be so but purely out of curiosity if i were to be so rash as to make a motion against south america would you follow old chap so that was it a strike against montevideo his mind raced the question of course was hypothetical if popham ordered it kydd must obey what was really being asked was would he join with a whole heart in the enterprise or hang back with carping objections as some might do in the absence of formal orders from above if popham really contemplated the move he must tread very carefully indeed for if it was later disallowed by the admiralty then from this point on anything kydd did that smacked of collusion was meat for a courtmartial there was one overriding objection to any talk of a preemptive assault and kydd knew it had to be brought up immediately well i have to say it dasher its a bold enough stroke but wouldnt this leave you open to the charge of quitting your station without leave it was axiomatic to faraway admiralty planning that the strength and whereabouts of its assets around the world were reliably known in the grand chess game that was central to political strategy and an admiral who was absent from his post was a dangerous liability almost as soon as he had spoken kydd found an answer to his own question then again id have to confess before you that i followed nelson when he left his mediterranean station to chase villeneuve across the atlantic and where would we all be if his courage to leave had failed him then just so said popham imperceptibly relaxing would that all my captains were of such stout heart kydd made play of fixing on the light of the fire through his brandy but then all this is idle talk the navy might desire it but the army must achieve it how would they be persuaded this is true enough but if youd heard the talk after mess dinner in the castle enough times as i have youd not be in doubt they poor wights are in far worse case than we at least weve the passing prospect of a privateer or cruiser to look forward to theyve nothing but idleness each and every day and pray for any kind of alarum that might test their mettle to dangle a chance before them to share in such an adventure why wed be trampled underfoot by eager military not desiring to be overlooked kydd joined in the comradely chuckle but knew the discussion was becoming pointed um yes but at the same time if ever wed think to make a descent it must take an expedition of size of cost where would i should think that question easily answered if our doughty governor himself of some record as a military strategist should be taken by the idea then he has the power and resources to mount such a one as to equipment surely that which served in an opposed landing in blaauwberg would serve us in an identical campaign elsewhere there was no question but that popham was seriously considering a fullscale move against spanish south america and all that that implied the only question now was where kydd himself stood with him or against him chapter he what gasped renzi choking on his breakfast you seriously mean to tell me kydd nodded this cannot be hes implying that theres going to be an assault on spanish america with if he strips cape colony of its entire sea defences a pair of old sixtyfours two or three frigates and a brigsloop ha either you misheard our noble commander or im compelled to believe this southern moon must have powers to induce lunacy beyond the ordinary kydd paused in the cold light of day it did seem more of a dream than a possibility but then he returned strongly think of it nicholas not only will it tear away their main source of income from the spanish but we deny bonaparte his tribute and means to wage war and with such a market opened up to us our factories and merchantsll swell in riches past all counting its its a chance that for the sake of england cant be missed recovering renzi said with an irritating air tom have you any conception how vast is the continent of south america how many leagues of mountains and deserts hills of silver towns and cities ill grant its a worthy aspiration but conquest he broke off in snorts of laughter nettled kydd waited for him to subside you dont know the whole of it nicholas hes in confidential communication with a cove called miranda whos said south america is ripe and ready for rebellion and he does know about things billy pitt himself asked him personally to write a secret memorandum on the subject thats as may be it doesnt take anything away from the utter harebrained idiocy of it all even supposing he gets an expedition from england prodigious enough in size to land an army what then he wins a first battle and where will he go next when it takes a year to march to the other side how does he prevail upon the spanish to wait for him there kydd reddened so this is how you treat commanders of spirit and enterprise at least pophams not falling asleep on a quiet station hes looking to find ways to annoy the enemy in the best way he can and if hes considering ways for an assault i for one honour him for it he snapped then helped himself to the last of the precious english marmalade in silence humph leave us trust hell come to his senses now ive had some thoughts about portrait if youd be so kind as to hear these out well if you think theyre important ive a busy day nicholas renzi pushed his plate to one side then this what do you think is the best measure of the scale of the task that awaits ive no idea the simple exercise of multiplying the words on a page by the number of pages in a book gives the result of no less than one hundred thousand words he went on in awe scratching away at say a brisk two or three words a second why itll be months continuous for me just to cast it in words very well to first things first nicholas what shall be the meat of your piece that is to say youve shown me two books which are novels and each is different from the other yours will be like mr john murray a most estimable publisher whom i consulted before i seem to remember did mention that the female fancy is not to be neglected and that a travel work would answer should i combine the two it may well prove fruitful and shall it be a biography it will be built upon the events of my life to be sure but good heavens none must suspect it nicholas youre aware a novel is a work of fiction you may write what you will providing it satisfies ah there you have it what will please a reader an extensive treatment of the customs and economy of the local polity as observed on my travels or is it to be a detailed account of events whether uplifting or tragic kydd sighed id be happy with a rousing good tale of your wenching in venice with your poetic friend on that grand tour you never want to talk about renzi coloured that is never a subject worthy of literary endeavour as well you know recollect brother this has to be fit for a gentlewomans eyes then id say that youre at a stand old chap until you know what your readers desire your words are all puff and vapour ill think on it renzi muttered with a hurt expression an apologetic knock on the door announced the mateofthewatch with a note sent from the commodore sir his boats still alongside he added brief and polite the message had obviously been written in haste if you can spare the time theres someone id wish you to meet kydd folded the note and put it into his waistcoat well talk novels again later nicholas there was no indication of the rank of the person and kydd compromised by omitting his sword this was not like popham he was generally considerate to his subordinates in the matter of timing it must be a matter of importance the commodore was waiting for him at the rail of diadem beside a chubby figure with a florid face dressed in comfortable merchant seamans rig this is captain waine kydd hes master of the trader elizabeth yonder popham indicated a plainfeatured brig at the edge of the anchorage the man touched his oldfashioned tricorne respectfully capn he said carefully with a slight american accent captain waine has some interesting things to tell us kydd shall we go to my cabin dismissing the sentry popham offered wine then turned to kydd this gentleman has been talking to me about his recent experiences in the viceroyalty of the river plate which i thought youd wish to hear my pleasure admiral waine responded among the things hes imparted is that at the moment there are no spanish ships of war in the whole river plate none theyve left to sail north to contest a rumoured landing at caracas he winked at kydd and went on smoothly and it seems the inhabitants are restless and bitter concerning the state of trade obtaining there the spanish being at war with england have been sorely affected their relations with their colonies all but severed by our blockade aint none been seen this twomonth and what is worse to the situation is that commerce with any other nation is forbidden under the direst penalties its true theres a species of smuggling of contraband into the main metropolitan centres but none may legally trade without leave from the viceroy from viceroy sobremonte hisself waine picked up a newspaper which he identified as the telegrafo mercantil of buenos aires and waved it at kydd there its at lessn a couple o months old he spread it out a blunt forefinger running down the columns of type to find a passage there in spanish it meant nothing to kydd but waine translated a porteno man o property an standing in the city kydd remembered this was how the painter on table mountain had described himself gets mad at the viceroy sayin the citys going t ruin over trade being cut off and demands he goes over t free trade he jabbed at the text in several spots where the words libre comercio were prominent didnt do him no good though hes slammed in chokey fr his cheek and you say theres unrest against spanish rule popham asked innocently unrest why id say a stronger wordn that them as is born there theys called criollos and no matter how high n mighty they has to bow down to any as comes from spain an takes all the top positions in trade an goverment no mind how low theys been born in the home country no sir unrest is too kind a word can you tell us anything of the military what forces do the spanish have waine winked slyly tapping his nose why youre not thinkin to do mischief there while theres no menowar doing the guardin b any chance popham assumed an appalled look leaving kydd to ask awkwardly i was more concerned with how the spanish might put down any pother at all well reglars at montevideo an a whole lot o militia in buenos aires a sorry bunch an nothin to worry on er ill not detain you further captain popham said taking his empty glass i know youve cargo to clear my thanks for your information and we may well talk again after waine had left popham sat down his brow furrowing you heard that from one who has nothing to gain by concealing the truth this sharpens the urgency considerably with renzis words and sarcasm still ringing in his ears kydd asked dasher you cant really be thinking to invade south america popham looked up with a lopsided smile invade of course not but heres a thought the dons have left an open door to seaward while they deal with miranda in the north and the population is simmering with revolt should a british squadron appear offering liberation from the oppressors and at the same time throwing open the entire port at last to free trade which is precisely what we did with such success here in cape town then wouldnt you as a south american feel just a little bit inclined to side with us id think so but the size o the continent how can we no no not an invasion we havent the resources and that was never in my thinking while we can we seize montevideo and neutralise the spanish military the people rise up and we ride in triumph into the capital by the time spain hears of it for them its too late theyve lost their seat of power in the south and miranda is raising the standard of revolt in the north a mighty empire of three centuries standing brought down by us it was nothing short of mindshattering to go from humble overlooked naval squadron to empire toppling there had to be a reason why not er well need an army of quite some size id warrant kydd said trying to keep his voice steady as can be transported in what vessels we have to command the guns and horses o course he was flailing about now trying to find solid ground under his feet leave that to me popham said with a seraphic smile as soon as our mr waine can give me details on their barracks and forces well know how to proceed im sanguine a regiment of highlanders is worth three of the spanish and guns do remember that theres been no threat to south america since the days of francis drake and never to the river plate even a brace of our paltry field guns will send em packing the first time they smell powder you really are going after the spanish kydd said in awe this was a breathtaking display of moral courage not only in the conceiving but the firm selfreliance in initiating and planning the entire matter i am should i be satisfied in the odds and what we have to face them that is kydd looked at him for a long moment then dasher you have m full support is there anything i can do why thank you i suppose there is old fellow this is no small matter id be obliged to you if we could get our heads together in the planning with so many strands coinciding in our favour at this time theres not a moment to lose say at four renzi arrived late for breakfast tousled and blearyeyed why you wicked dog youve been up carousing half the night your jest is illtimed brother in truth ive been wrestling with chapters and endings and things and nothing will answer that would satisfy how can a character be a feckless rake yet take our sympathy at one and the same time its just not logically possible he said bitterly he flopped into a chair picked up a new local newspaper the cape town gazette and distractedly leafed through it himself in a taking over laurore i shouldnt have thought it he murmured when kydd said he was going to the flagship shortly oh just an enquiry kydd said casually with renzis attitude to popham he could see no reason that his friend should know of what was afoot until it was at a more mature stage of planning then youll have time for a small discussion of portrait brother renzi said hopefully closing the newspaper not now nicholas kydd said absently looking for his leather dispatch case he found it and tested its lock with his fob key i have to er keep mr popham abreast o things i find renzis eyebrows lifted at the sight of the dispatch case normally used for the transfer of confidential materials but he refrained from comment right to the first how do we proceed from here popham said briskly pulling out papers and looking encouragingly at kydd ive questioned our american friend at some length and have discovered that for us things are looking better and better it seems that not only are there few and poor military but their equipment and fortifications are in dolorous order im content that what we are possessed of here will be sufficient to achieve the goal he passed across some lists i dont have to remind you i consider this discussion and materials in perfect confidence between us surprise is everything of course no one shall know until we have our full dispositions in the matter you have my word not even that secretary chap of yours whats his name again kydd paused its renzi youve never really taken to him have you dasher well no popham said straightening his cuff a little too much of the dark side about him as one might say hes the air of a fox too cunning by half im actually intrigued as to why you have the fellow about you all the time weve known each other for years id trust him with my life kydd said steadily quite but not with planning confidences as you wish kydd said but if i might make just one observation dasher fire away shall it be you who commands the expedition your experience in the military line is it will be in the character of a joint venture naval and military as was the case with cape town youre not expecting general baird to leave his governorship here to take command of a south american army sir david no not at all but i have a special mission for you my friend the honour of coopting our future generalincommand i i dont understand you youre in the right of it im a military tyro no acquaintance to speak of in the planning of an army action weve need of a field officer to advise to render assistance in the promoting of the operation and so forth it would appear selfaggrandising if it were i who approached the man it were better that you broach the possibilities dont you think very well whom do you have in mind theres only one id feel has both reason and desire for the position beresford just so an ambitious brigadier general twice thwarted of glory in cape town at saldanha and with janssenss hasty surrender and destined to rot unless he can find himself some other adventure tall and commanding beresfords figure was always prominent in social events at the castle he still basked in the reputation he had won in a forced march across the desert with baird from the red sea to the nile which had resulted in the defeat of the french army abandoned by napoleon and in which the unknown sloop commander kydd had played his small part was this sufficient grounds to strike up an acquaintance with the general become comradely enough to impart confidences of such giddy import he felt a jet of nervousness at the thought for social manoeuvring did not come easily to him ill um see what i can do he said cautiously no need to make an immediate approach popham said pleasantly as the initial objective has first to succeed being i think it proper that my captains should be made acquainted with what we plan at the outset we carry them with us and our approach to sir david will be that much the easier particularly since by your golden words his colleague general beresford will stand persuaded of the necessity of a descent at this time kydd was beginning to feel out of his depth but he also knew that in a postcaptain such skills were requisite if he was going to progress in his profession theyll need some convincing he said as heartily as he could evidence of our military resources as will have them satisfied in every particular of the enterprise exactly so to work these papers list our assets and an appreciation of what we face across the atlantic you shall be a captain and i shall rehearse on you what will be presented then i beg you will say whether or no you are decided well im ready for you dasher popham leaned forward this is no triviality ill have you know my dear kydd he said gravely if you are not agreeable in any wise for any reason i shall not proceed that is the whole venture to be called off abandoned i will not risk mens lives unless there is good prospect of success you understand it was unfair he was being put in a position where his word would be enough to destroy a daring and farsighted stroke against the enemy or to send men to their deaths but then again wasnt popham being scrupulous in his planning getting a second opinion such that if it went against him the world would never hear of it again i do be certain youll hear from me should i feel to the contrary stout fellow then shall we begin popham had pleaded ignorance of military affairs but if this was the case it didnt show to kydd perhaps it was his experience of the cape town expedition or even the previous red sea joint operation but he certainly seemed perfectly at home dealing with forage for horses biscuits and rum for the troops and secondrun stores for the followup as well as the joint administrative structures to be set up numbers were demonstrably inferior but kydd had seen the highlanders in action and when popham produced his trump card he found it hard not to applaud it was to formalise what had worked so well at blaauwberg that the invading ships would each contribute a proportion of their seamen and marines to form a sea battalion that would increase their effectives by a considerable margin considering we have only to make a show against the spanish and the natives will flock to our banners it should suffice popham said i hope youve something more interesting for us than last time old bean complained donnelly of narcissus ive an important appointment ashore an she wont wait popham ignored the gibe from the senior frigate captain and waited for the meeting to settle at the other end of the elegant table in the flagships great cabin sat kydd studiously blankfaced along with the men commanding the other ships of consequence in all the totality of the rated vessels in his fleet ive called you here for one purpose only that is to seek your advice this brought immediate attention for not only was popham not given to asking what to do but in a flagofficer it was unprecedented whatever we can do sir downman said loyally the others kept a wary silence then it is in this matter glancing at each man individually his manner confiding persuasive and convincing he spoke slowly ive recently had an extraordinary intelligence that reveals the spanish have left their province at the river plate completely unguarded sailing as they have done to quell unrest in the north of the country and leaving contemptible forces only to guard montevideo understanding that the french squadrons are now no longer threatening that trafalgar has robbed the spanish of any means to contest us at sea and that we still retain most of the same fleet that succeeded so nobly here at cape town then how absurd would it be to consider a sudden descent on the viceroyalty to achieve a famous victory one that could well knock the spanish out of the war there was a stupefied silence then a sudden eruption of astonished talk gentlemen gentlemen one at a time please like a kindly vicar smiling benevolently on his flock he allowed the excitement to subside then calmly said captain donnelly this is madness he spluttered are you proposing an invasion of south america to attack no sir i am not proposing anything im merely asking your advice your views if you will and never an invasion if anything conceivably the suggestion of some species of move against montevideo perhaps to hold it for a space until reinforcements arrive you see there is an opportunity a rare conjunction of conditions that make it feasible to consider the detaching of the spanish colonies simply by encouraging rebellion among the indigenes as you may apprehend they will never hold their possessions against revolt from within while attacked from without i see byng said in dawning realisation this is by way of a gesture against the spanish giving heart to the natives to throw off the yoke and so forth i like it a lot gained for little risked and what precisely will this adventure secure to the advantage of the crown donnelly sniffed if this has any chance of being set afoot that should be known to us in advance dont be an ass richard byng said scornfully think it to be a hundred a thousand times bigger than cape colony under our enlightened rule we show free trade encourage the market and there we go a river of gold from selling our manufactures into the place and another from trading er whatever they grow to the rest of the world he blinked sure to be something or other so were to acquire another continent for our empire we lost the last american one by grievously underestimating the costs of such and foisting them on the colonists who then loudly objected and threw us out donnelly said contemptuously downman came in quickly as youve no imagination richard arent you overlooking one thing the spanish have been shipping out millions in silver every year since they made conquest i dare to say that in our hands it will see the administration well served in the article of costs and o course at this moment that silver goes into boneys coffers to pay for his war kydd said enthusiastically we have a chance to put an end to it there were slow nods around the table as the implications of both sank in popham resumed supposing us to be interested ive drawn up some simple lists as will show the relative military strengths which im obliged to observe do favour us in the details he passed them around it says here but four guns against an army let me be clearer popham said patiently any descent will obviously be in the nature of a complete surprise although the enemy has numbers these are untrained native militia whove never seen a single day of action do you truly believe them capable of standing against our formidable highland troops no i thought not the guns are there merely to provide a whiff of smoke at the right time he smiled grimly and again this is a limited objective only the reduction of a single stronghold until reinforcements arrive with undisputed command of the seas do you doubt our forces can be supplied he allowed an air of weariness to show then said for a little enterprise much is to be gained which must result with such a bold stroke in honour and distinction to those involved in our quiet little station i would have thought the prospect of such would be enough to set the blood astir is there none of spirit here willing to take the dons by the ears and at the same time earn notice before the world dammit im for it byng burst out bettern lying eternally at anchor all winter and me kydd said forcefully id think it no less than our duty to annoy the enemy in any way we can contrive and ive not heard a better hold hard mr fireeater kydd donnelly said impatiently were not voting in some councilofwar were giving our views and what i need to hear is the position of their lordships in the matter they giving the order and providing the expedition its not for us to come up with some wild plan and expect them to fall in with it well thats easily answered popham said a confident smile playing a year or two ago after my investigation of the patriot miranda and secret memorandum to the prime minister himself plans were set in train to implement an assault on montevideo but then the trafalgar campaign took precedence therefore this may be seen simply as the resumption of an existing expedition a resumption donnelly said exasperated then why the devil are we confabulating about it at all we follow orders as received ah its not quite so simple our conquest of the cape was rapid and complete taking days only and no doubt fresh orders for our deploying are being drafted as soon as they may however time and tide wait for no man and so forth and so it is in our case the whole river plate is open while their forces are called away and additionally the french squadrons have been destroyed or have retired to regroup and at this season in the south there is little mischief to be expected locally this is a precious opportunity that may not recur for a long time pardon me for being so slow in stays said donnelly barely hiding his incredulity but isnt this saying youve intentions of sailing without orders mounting your own expedition starting your own war why its its pophams easy manner fell away his eyes suddenly steely i have your views sir and i say we cant wait do you propose remaining in idleness while the opportunities pass us by until such time as orders can reach us from six thousand miles away i do not im minded to reconstitute the cape town expedition as the montevideo expedition and on sailing to send word directly to mr pitt that the previous plan is now going forward i shall request that the agreed reinforcements do meet us in the river plate by which time im utterly confident we shall have made a first foothold on the continent there were surprised but approving murmurs around the table bold decisive moves were wanted in this war which was on a global scale like no other honyman had not yet spoken but now pronounced and billy pitt will see his chance and send out an army its a capital idea dasher liberators of south america ha the world will hear of us then byng chuckled im not doubting itll mean parades in london kneeling before his nibs in the palace a medal or two suddenly the prospect became not impossible show us those figures again honyman said animated ive a notion we should do it kydd caught the sudden gleam in pophams eyes the magic word we had now been been uttered discussion became general popham played it very carefully allowing suggestions to take root following objections and taking notes the sentiment of the meeting was rapidly moving towards an urging of popham to take action with a fullblooded acclamation of the possibilities within the hour he had what he wanted very well popham declared expansively i shall take our conclusions to the governor and im sanguine hell approve an immediate call to arms ill suspend this meeting in the trust that the next shall be in the nature of a fullscale planning for our spanish surprise as they rose he called down the table er mr kydd if youd be so good as to remain ill need some assistance in the readying of a presentation to sir david and as youre junior present it was neatly done kydds regular presence at the flagship would not now be remarked on as the last captain filed out of the cabin popham turned and with an audible sigh collapsed into his armchair by the window such a hard beat to windward he murmured youd think it a forlorn hope im contemplating donnelly has the spirit id expect in a town beadle and some of the others still i do believe theyre with me dont you they are as so they should if general beresford shows willing hell make sure baird comes in so i suppose i must possess myself in patience until youve made your play have you any idea how youll do it renzi old fellow are you not well kydd said in surprise seeing him crouched by the sternlights there was no movement and kydd crossed to him in concern are you all right nicholas there was a muffled groan i just cant get started renzi mouthed he heaved himself up and into a chair tom he croaked it doesnt fadge nothing works its coming out too too wooden if you catch my meaning you mean your novel renzi gave him a withering stare and what else pray kydd sat down that is your hero is not as who should say a satisfying enough cove no not just that renzi said wearily its that well youd never understand as ive not the headpiece of an author kydd said tartly look m friend youre going to have to face it it may be may be what renzi said with unease at kydds tailing off it could be that you have to be born to the craft the same as prime seamen brought up in it from a younker it could be that authors have it inside them all the while awaiting release and you all this time at it and no headway kydd said sadly i dont think so nicholas renzi said nothing but his frustration was pitiful to see kydd softened look why dont you think again its about a wellborn chap who has all these adventures isnt that you why dont you write about yourself directly if youd care to o course no no i cant do it to write is to expose yourself to the world to let everyone see into your well all of you i could never allow that he pulled out a crumpled sheet just listen to this though i walked into the salon the duchess looked at me and i had to think of something to say but i couldnt how can you get a novel from that well im not the one to ask it but have you thought about curzon he mingles with the nobs possibly knows an author renzi bristled no one is to find out what im writing no of course not im sorry to say im at a loss nicholas you might have to admit thank you tom youve made your point well i have to go theres divisions at eleven renzi shifted uncomfortably in his chair kydds talk of authors being born to it was a worrying bar if anyone could be such why wasnt the world filled with authors it was not a pleasant conclusion hed worked damned hard and he was no further forward than he had been at the beginning the plot was logically perfect the heros name and character replete with fascinating and subtle classical nuance the factual material impeccable why then did it read so heavily so so dull to the eyes it was lacking something he was no stranger to words but they were simply not playing out as he so ardently wished they would was kydd right in suggesting he write about himself no putting aside the embarrassment of exposing his inner self before the public this was to be a work of fiction and his own experiences had no right to appear wearily he got up and went down to his cabin to put the days work in order the balledup paper the scribbled sheets the endless crossedout notes he just didnt have the heart he sat down and let his eyes roam over the tightly packed bookshelf above his tiny desk they were the work of authors of course the blessed the favoured the felicitous would he never join their august band as ever his eye softened at the row of poetry volumes the tight crafting of precise and numinous meaning from shining words had always given him satisfaction and comfort and he reached for the first and oldest from the time of francis drake a work by sir philip sidney that turbulent and gifted elizabethan he opened it at random and the words leaped out at him thus great with childe to speak and helplesse in my throwes biting my trewand pen beating myselfe for spite fool said my muse to me looke in thy heart and write he blinked and held his breath a rising feeling of giddiness overwhelmed him for that was exactly the problem and the solution in a heightened state of mind he felt a supernatural thrill that down the centuries this man was speaking to him giving of himself to deliver a fellow scribe from the thrall of stasis his mind cleared he had treated the whole thing too logically too much in the abstract was it possible to look into a mans heart from a distance to generate sympathy at arms length no but the solution was there as well he must look into his own heart and write about what caused pain to him gave joy and grief stirred his deepest emotions caused his darker detestable self to reign and he could do it for it would be a release he could at last speak of those years of blind youthful extravagance and meaningless existence which had ended with the epiphany in venice that had sent him back to confront the moral imperative which had changed his life utterly yes hed do it and he could see how both passionately and as a detached observer simply tell the tale from the outside knowing the inside he snatched a sheet and his hand flew over the paper in his regimental dress the pipe major looked both barbaric and splendid in the massed candlelight as he passed slowly between the tables no allowance was made for the modest enclosed space of the castle of good hopes banqueting hall and the volume of sound was visceral kydd revelled in it however for there was nothing like this sensenumbing martial wail to be found in a manowars wardroom with the utmost dignity the piper concluded his processing at the head of the table next to the mess president general sir david baird and duty done stared fixedly ahead the moment hung in a heady whisky fragrance the gold and scarlet of regimentals in rows interspersed here and there with the rich dark blue and gold of the navy as both services joined in the tribal ritual of the loyal toast baird rose solemnly with a massed scraping of chairs every officer got to his feet likewise his glass charged with a golden glow held before him gentlemen the king the king murmured half a hundred men some with an added god bless him it produced a powerful sense of union with the country that had given them birth now on the other side of the world but to which each and every one was bound by this common tie of allegiance with a rustle and occasional clink of ceremonial accoutrements the assembly resumed their seats and conversations continued in a lively hum your jolly good health sir it was the adjutant of the rd sitting down from kydd and the more senior officers and to yours sir kydd called in return raising his glass he enjoyed attending army mess dinners with their different ways and effortless banter not to mention the fine victuals to be had in a garrison town and of course their wellfound cellar tonight was no exception a regimental occasion with the st as hosts and the rest of the military as guests in a splendid affair but for kydd there was a purpose and he prepared to make his move next to him was the redfaced and happy lieutenant colonel geoffrey mcdonald lord of the isles and further towards the head of the table the firebrand colonel pack held forth but for kydd there was only one of notice that night the brigadier general and secondincommand of the cape colony military william carr beresford sat some places up the dinner was over the toasts made and cloths drawn and amiable converse became general now was the time a right noble dinner general beresford sir he called genially ive not had better this age i declare beresford had a reputation for stiffness a liking for the forms but he turned politely to kydd and replied the victor of the zambezi does us honour in the attending captain as it happens ive just sent for a bottle of malmsey of the old sort would you care to join me as was usual at this time a number of officers had taken the opportunity to perform what the navy delicately alluded to as easing springs and by their absence the hardier remaining were able to choose a more convenient seating kydd left his and after a polite bow to sir david took the chair opposite beresford this is most civil in you sir he said as his glass was filled ive quite forgotten the taste of such after so long on this station after murmured appreciations it was established that the distinguished captain in the royal navy by the same name was indeed beresfords brother john who had been active and enterprising in the war against the french in the caribbean and had as who might say been fortunate indeed in the matter of prizes and notice kydd confided that his own family was quite undistinguished living as they did in the country near guildford and changed the subject not so much out of concern that his humble origins would be discovered but more in the knowledge that this was the eldest son of the marquess of waterford but one who had not succeeded to the title for he was acknowledged illegitimate beresford was surprised by and professed delight to learn of kydds role in the abercromby action in egypt and unbending at last detailed his own legendary dash across the desert to take the french in the rear illustrating the route with cruet marshes and a decanter range of mountains not forgetting a perilous defile between two forks that left no doubt as to the hazards bravely faced after another mutual toast kydd set down his glass with a sigh i do confess it im taken with the entertainments commanded by your most celebrated st regiment i do wish it were in my power to conjure a like in return but my ship trim and graceful as she is cannot possibly stand with a castle in the article of convenience in entertaining he allowed his head to drop then he looked up again brightly i have an idea yes its possible my duty as captain must surely be to make certain those rascals of a crew do not wither in idleness while long at anchor ive a mind to put to sea and exercise em sir how would you welcome a days cruise in a saucy frigate whose sailors are set to every task in sea life before you racing up the rigging bringing in sail high aloft a few rounds with the great guns boatwork sir i can promise entertainments and edification a landlubber may never be witness to in a lifetime oh er i would not want to put those splendid fellows to overmuch trouble captain nonsense you shall be my guest and see how the navy conducts its manoeuvres and be damned to their feelings shall you wish to see a flogging with the cat o nine tails at all kydd asked innocently no no that will not be necessary the spectacle of a grand ship working its sails and er things will be diversion enough thats most kind in you sir and i mean to take you up on the offer splendid kydd exclaimed and im sure your staff might be accommodated if they can bear to be escorted by midshipmen shall we say on thursday then my first lieutenant will call upon you at two bells of the forenoon as we do call nine o clock all in hand sir gilbey said touching his hat to kydd on the quarterdeck stand fast that th officers cook is in a fret that he cant find artichokes an hes heard the general is partial to em never mind im sure hell manage take away my barge and coxswain and be sure to warn the boats crew to feather and dont wet the general there was widespread anticipation at the news that there would be a highranking redcoat general aboard to experience for himself how the navy did things even the gunroom found time to priddy their abode with the most tasteful decoration to be found and after kydd had indicated that the general would be visiting the messdecks to see the sailors at home an astonishing level of industry had produced quaint and intricately wrought ropework ornamentation to adorn the messtrap racks and table corners on deck every conceivable ropes end that could be spied from the quarterdeck had been inspected and if not pointed a seaman was set to the painstaking task of working it thus fashioning a pleasing taper to the end of the rope and finishing with a lengthy whipping guns were treated with a mixture of lamp black and copperas then polished well with a linseedoil woollen cloth the result being favourably compared to ebony kydd knew however that this was a fighting general and personally ensured that every fire channel between pan and vent was clear and bright there had been cases when zealous blacking had resulted in a perfect appearance but a blocked touchhole had rendered the gun useless in action decks had a snowy lustre where holystone and bear had been plied with salt water and on all sides if a touch of colour might bring a fitment to more pleasing prominence paint was produced and the more artistic seamen set to wielding a brush the visit was a perfect excuse to break the monotony of harbour service and to build on the pristine condition of the recently cleansed ship to produce a state of perfection not normally possible for the rest of the commission they would have a standard by which to judge themselves boat approaching called the mateofthewatch importantly sideparty growled curzon a line of whitegloved midshipmen and lieutenants assembled at the sidesteps by the hances each with a grave expression kydd taking position at the inboard end the barge curved about and hooked on at the mainchains with a showy display of seamanship hidden from view it was not possible to see what was keeping the general and the boatswain continued to lick the mouthpiece of his call nervously finally kydd peered over the side and saw a redfaced general awkwardly trying to fasten his swordbelt and fending off pouldens wellmeaning assistance ashore army officers scorned the loosefitting naval arrangement for a tight soldierly fit but this was quite impossible to wear in boats as the general was now finding kydd jerked back and rearranged the sideparty placing the boatswains mate and a brawny seaman by the ships side see the general doesnt kiss our deck compree he hissed at last the generals plumed hat and solemn face appeared as he mounted the sidesteps twisting his highly polished boots awkwardly over the bulwark and catching sight of the ceremonial line he made to raise his hat and the inevitable happened his sword caught behind him and he toppled forward in a flash the two seamen had him firmly by the arms while his cocked hat was caught by a quickthinking midshipman who clapped it back on his head before scurrying to his place in the line while general beresford recovered his composure the boatswains call pealed out and he advanced down the line of blankfaced sidesmen to be greeted by laurores captain who of course had not seen anything of the generals discomfiture youre most welcome aboard sir might i present my officers in the captains cabin a restorative taste of navalissue rum had beresford in good humour and ready for his day shall we venture on to the upper deck there youll see our sturdy tars at as hard work as ever youll see them kydd invited the capstan situated in laurore between the mainmast and the wheel was already pinned and swifted grinning at being under such an august eye the seamen and marines spat on their hands and clutched the bar upwards to their chests in readiness carry on mr curzon kydd ordered a fife and drum struck up a jaunty tune and the men stretched out with a will beresford was shown the cable ranged along the maindeck below coming in dripping hauled from forward by the messenger line before it fed down into the cable tiers amidships it tautened and the pace slowed men strained and heaved until the boatswain with his foot on the cable coming in the hawse roared anchors aweigh ah then i have to inform you sir that the anchor is won clear and this ship is now legally at sea lay out and loose the waiting topmen raced out on the yards and sail magically blossomed braces were manned and with a graceful sway of acknowledgement to neptune the frigate took up on the larboard tack the familiar swash and creak of a ship under way growing in volume as beresford found his sea legs on the slightly canting deck kydd was soon explaining to his intelligent and attentive guest the relative forces between the sails and their resulting course through the sea the strains to be expected aloft and the options for trimming course norwest mr curzon beresford then took in the work on deck necessary to bring the canvas aloft to a proper accommodation to this new direction and the helmsmans interplay between binnacle compass and set of the sails that ensured the course was maintained he and kydd paced the deck together speaking of the functions of lines and spars blocks and tackles until kydd ordered the ship closehauled by the wind as close as she could lie the different motion was immediately apparent much as a horse changes gait when moving from a canter to a gallop with seas taken on the bow resulting in a spirited pitching and spray carrying aft in exhilarating bursts kydds intention though was to show the limitation of a squarerigger that she could come up no closer than six points to the winds eye they made fine speed and when the land was sunk all but the far distant bluegrey flat rectangle of table mountain the frigate shortened sail and took up a more sedate pace for the next show the great guns at drill to kydd a fine sailing ship was a thing of majesty but what decided battles were the guns and every man aboard laurore knew his views the starboard and windward side twelvepounder main armament was manned and cleared away fobwatches significantly flourished and guncaptains with dark expressions mustered their crews beresford took a keen interest in the guns while they were the lightest frigate main armament in the navy they were twice the calibre of the largest field gun his army possessed and quite different a more compact carriage than horsedrawn artillery they were on trucks small wooden wheels and were tethered to the ships side by thick breeching ropes with tackles each side to run them out when all guncrews were closed up kydd went to a guncaptain and told him to show the general his equipment slung powder horn and a pouch with spare flints cartridge pricker quill tubes and the rest each gun number was told to prove his gear worm rammer sponge and crow a powder monkey proudly holding out his saltbox for carrying the charge slow time mr gilbey his first lieutenant clapped on his hat fire gun has fired he roared the exercise had begun tackle falls were eased and the guns rumbled back down the canted deck the guncrew got to work sponge and rammer invisible wad and shot the guncaptain showily bruising his priming and slamming the gunlock down before the gun was run out once more then it was quick time the fearful musclebulging round of heaving the gun in and out in a synchronised choreography four men furiously serving their iron beast each side nimbly sharing the limited seven feet of space between each gun with an adjacent crew after ten minutes of frantic activity kydd called a halt well have three rounds apiece from numbers three and five guns mr gilbey and to make it interesting well stream a mark the float was found and on its mast a red flag was fixed its nine feet square looking enormous on the frigates deck a trifle large wouldnt you think beresford murmured kydd gave a tight smile but said nothing as it was heaved over the side sliding rapidly astern while laurore went about to clear the range the guns were loaded grey cartridge and ironblack shot quill tube inserted and gunlock cocked at three hundred yards the jaunty bobbing of the flag was in clear view on the greygreen sea but kydd took beresford to the first gun do see if you feel the gun is rightly pointed if you will sir gingerly the general bent to look theres no sights he said astonished only a bare barrel looked out into the broad expanse of sea how do you lay the weapon kydd pointed out the quoin under the breech for elevation and the handspike to lever the gun bodily from side to side the guncaptain must lay the gun to his own satisfaction obligingly the man did so with hand signals to his crew there sir once more beresford bent down squinted along the barrel to the muzzle then rose ruefully as i fail to even see your target captain it was a common mistake for firsttime gunners the trick was to locate the target first and draw the muzzle to it rather than the other way round after explanations beresford picked up on the flag now a tiny thing set against the sighting along the gun barrel which unreasonably reared and fell each side randomly with the pitch and heave of the seas do say sir when you as guncaptain will fire your piece beresford wouldnt be drawn its quite impossible the damn thing wont stay still kydd hid a smile unlike the rockstill conditions on land the sea was a moving live thing that altered everything from the footing of the gunners to the eventual flight of the ball stand by guncrews over here sir if you please they stood back at a respectful distance but before gilbey could give the orders beresford called out imperiously and its five guineas to one mr kydd that not a one shall strike within fifty yards the guncrews turned to look back incredulously kydd keeping a straight face nodded in agreement carry on mr gilbey number three gun fire when you bear the guncaptain crouched staring along the barrel giving large then smaller signals the gunlanyard in his hand until he went rigid for a few seconds then in one fluid motion he jerked on the lanyard swivelled to one side and arched his body as the gun with a brutal slam of sound and momentarily hidden in smoke hurtled back in recoil the smoke cleared quickly in the brisk breeze and after a second or two a white plume arose gracefully not twenty yards to one side and fair for elevation if that were another frigate hed be looking to a hit atwixt wind and water kydd commented smugly number five eager to do better the guncaptain took his time and was rewarded with a strike in line but beyond beresford had the grace to look rueful your guinea is safe sir these gunners are in the character of magicians i believe kydd relented and explained how it was done a field gun in the army was fired with portfire and linstock bringing a glowing match to the touchhole a practice that was long gone in the navy aboard ship a gun was fired with a gunlock a larger version of that to be found on a musket and the lag between yanking the lanyard and the gun going off was a manageable small fraction of a second and kydd like others who were gunnerywise made a practice of rating only top seamen guncaptain those who had long experience on the helm who could read a sea anticipate their ships behaviour in any conditions this made all the difference when it came to judging the exact moment to fire during the roll of the ship when the muzzle of the gun swept down over the target he would leave it to another time to make the point that most gunnery was conducted at the range of a cricket pitch when in the blood and chaos only the fastest and steadiest guncrews would be left standing good practice indeed beresford acknowledged when the three rounds had been expended while they had not blown the target out of the water all that was wanted had been achieved that in the invisible profile of an enemy ship around the float every shot would have told sir stand down the people for dinner gilbey asked respectfully kydd nodded gear was secured and the welcome blast of up spirits was piped by the boatswains mate a happy line of messmen was soon lining up by the tub in the waist where the grog was mixed in the open air under the strict supervision of the masteratarms and the mateofthewatch the general wanted to visit the messdecks during their noon meal kydd knew it would be an eyeopening experience for him army otherranks were in truth the lowest forms of humanity from ignorant farmhands and factory workers down to thieves and murderers their training little more than musket drill and marching aboard ship there was no room for these untrained masses the skills and teamwork in bringing in madly flogging sails on the yardarm or serving the great guns in a noquarter fighting match were vital and essential as well daily life at sea within the confines of a manowar had its own demands the committing to test courage on a daily basis put side by side with the human need to relate to ones shipmates brought out character and strength in the relationships that shaped them these men were individuals formed in a crucible of ordeals ranging from personal combat to the howling menace of a gale and over time they drew together in a mutual interdependence and regard that was at the very core of what it was to be a member of the company of a fine ship the general with his hat under his arm and therefore deemed invisible passed between the tables hearing yarns and ditties laughter and concerns feeling the temper of a prime frigate at her best afterwards he visited the galley with its large purposebuilt brodie stove the cook in his kingdom ruled his mates and skinkers with an iron fist lordly checking the metal tallies on the nets of fresh meat doled out from the huge copper vats to the messcooks and quick to see that the slush rising on the seething surface was diligently skimmed for his later profitable disposal of course changes would come after only days into a sea voyage away from a friendly harbour source of fresh victuals no more fresh meat but salt beef and pork from the cask bread replaced by the hard tack that the navy insisted go under the same name and in place of greens preserved stuff such as sauerkraut and trundlers dried peas in the afternoon those offwatch went to their accustomed leisure on the focsle while the watchondeck took grave glee in exercising their sea skills stropping a block invisibly joining two ropes with a longsplice or rattling down the shrouds on the leeward side intricate knots were worked thick canvas was sewn with palm and needle and impossibly complex tackles and purchases were devised to move an inoffensive messtub the general took in that these were but a small part of what an able seaman was expected to do for his ship four bells sir gilbey reported very well make it so this was a signal for the last act hands t take stations fr lowering the launch at sea was stowed on the upperdeck waist the pinnace nested inside to ensure its ton weight safely afloat was no trivial feat demanding the rigging of heavy tackles from the foreyard and mainyard connected together with stay tackles and masthead topburtons to ease the weight the entire operation from rest on the chocks to a lively boat in the sea alongside was conducted in silence the only sound the harsh piercing of the boatswains call it was a telling illustration of the skills and training necessary for even the most straightforward of tasks at sea by contrast the gig on davits over laurores quarter descended to the water in a squeal of sheaves the boats crew making light of scrambling along the driver boom to the jacobs ladder at its end to tumble handily into it beresfords attention was drawn back to the launch which was stroking away to the frigates beam and he was startled at the lighthearted cry from the maintop lookout deck ahooooy i spy pirates pirates on the stbd beam the launch had rounded to and boated oars but up the stumpy mast rose the dread banner of the skull and crossbones from their hidden positions in the bottom of the boat a dozen pirates appeared fearsome in red bandannas and eye patches they screeched curses and brandished cutlasses then the launch was joined by the gig and the two manning their oars swept round and headed straight for laurore repel boarders mr gilbey kydd ordered crisply the first lieutenant wore a sour expression at the sight of the men disporting themselves but he had his orders stand t your fore he snarled the pirates came on in fine style swarming up the sides and spilling on to the deck in a tidal wave of action the brave defenders did what they could but were hard pressed and fell back hewing and slashing pistols banging casualties mounted on all sides until with a dreadful roar that startled even kydd the aweinspiring figure of stirk appeared at the main hatchway bringing a wave of reinforcements for an attack from behind it was quickly over the last pirates alive preferring a watery grave overside to the wrath of the kings men well done well done beresford laughed his majestys jolly tars triumph again but kydd had not finished as the panting men stood down he called over a pikeman on guard he ordered obediently the man stood firmly legs astride the butt of the long pike wedged on deck in the ball of his foot its forged iron tip questing outward at eye level for the first over the bulwark sir you see here a formidable weapon awaiting a boarder but it has a fatal flaw he took a cutlass from another and made to strike at the pikeman who instantly responded the deadly point turning unwavering on kydds eyes in a flash kydd had dropped to one knee in the classic fencing pose for a lunge but with his cutlass diagonally above his head then his blade swung up with a clash on the pike preventing it lowering and at the same time he rose forcing the blade along the pike in a lethal slither inside the mans defences this man is now at my mercy which does not exist in a boarding beresford acknowledged with a slow nod pistols one shot only kydd replied shortly into the face then its aught but a club knives worse than useless tomahawks he remembered some boarders had carried these never carried by defenders as not for fighting their use is to cut away defensive ropery when rigged then far better to stop em boarding in the first place canister or grape from carronades the marines and such with muskets seen to be waiting and swivels on the breastrail or in the tops in harbour theres boarding nettings spread from below the gunports which can stop even the most vicious assault weve naught to fear except in close battle with a larger oh so your little show is nothing but a confection no sir it has a purpose kydd waited until he had full attention then went on quietly in all my professional life at sea ive only been boarded by the enemy once yet ive taken my men to the enemy three four five times this is the reality that the royal navy is more active enterprising and resolute than the enemy i ask you general now to reverse the situation here and consider that each time you read of a valiant boarding or cuttingout we are the attackers who must overcome any or all of these defences which the enemy can be relied on to throw out he had the attention he wanted therefore sir think on the quality of the men that i have the honour to command that i lead in perfect confidence that none will shrink that all will follow me whatever the day brings beresford stood for a moment pursing his lips and watching laurores men cheerfully disperse captain kydd ive never before given you an order but im minded to should it be in my power to issue it sir and forgive if the form is wanting do you splice the mainbrace the gunroom dinner went off to the greatest satisfaction kydd yielded his customary position at the head of the table when guest of the wardroom to beresford who was unanimously voted mr vice by an awed mess laurore under easy sail daintily dipped and heaved the gimballed lights setting uniforms aglitter and casting constantly moving shadows the feeling so beguilingly that of a living being that for the thousandth time kydd wondered at how shore folk could be content with the inert deadness of the land after the cloth was drawn mr vice was prompted for the loyal toast restrained from rising in the army way and suffused with good humour did the honours most graciously talk then became general with anecdotes of service in all the seas of the world coming out renzi gently teased for his performance the previous year as a russian to seize enemy documents set the gunroom in a roar with his tale of a lieutenant kydd furiously signalling to an invading fleet in minorca with a pair of red undergarments lieutenant bowden added to the glee by detailing the forlorn state of kydds first command in malta when they had nevertheless formally commissioned hm brigsloop teazer with only themselves as both crew and witness beresford responded with reminiscences of his adventures as a young captain at the fraught siege of toulon in the first year of the war when the royalist insurgency had been destroyed singlehanded by the actions of an equally young french captain of artillery one napoleon bonaparte a most agreeable evening concluded with the appearance of a midshipman to report the lights of cape town in sight a cognac in my cabin general while these gentlemen go about their duties kydd suggested this was what the entire day had been leading up to uninterrupted access to the one who was seen as most likely to take the bait as military commander of the expedition and he was the chief conspirator tysoe served their drinks and silently withdrew kydd summoned his wits this sly politicking was foreign to his nature but he knew it would not be the last occasion he would need to deploy it beresford raised his glass i dont mind telling you kydd im impressed in my twenty years in the army ive learned to be a judge of men and you have the best i honour and envy you for it thank you general kydd said flattered then seeing his chance added as theyll no doubt be needed only too soon oh said beresford with a puzzled frown the expedition sir kydd glanced up with a guarded expression what expedition kydd looked hastily over his shoulder at the door then leaned forward sir the one that has us all abuzz you know to the river plate river plate i know nothing of this allowing a touch of anxiety to show kydd said id be grieved to hear its not been taken up sir an expedition to the spanish americas ive never heard of it there was however a telling gleam of interest in beresfords eyes oh i do apologise id thought it dependable you would have heard it from sir david or the commodore it being a matter at the highest level no sir i have not pray tell who did you get this from kydd replied in some embarrassment well its in the nature of a common rumour among the naval commanders commodore popham letting slip once that he was privy to mr pitts designs on montevideo and as how it was such a pity to let the opportunity go now that conditions are favourable he briefly outlined the audacious plan with its breathtaking consequences ending and it would seem only reasonable that the governor having higher duties must require one other to lead the army ashore if it seems that another has been chosen then i do apologise again for making mention of the subject the fuse had been lit times not on our side kydd popham said with a sigh when kydd reported every hour we delay a move the more likely it is the spanish will return to their station recollect friend waine has been some weeks on the voyage here and miranda will be deeply engaged in his invading but not for ever id have thought you better advised to speak directly instead of spending days on your little circus kydd flushed beresford is now trusting in the navy and he has much to think on id feel it the surer course dasher well see if theres no movement on this in the next three days im going to a flustered officeroftheday appeared at the door from the castle sir he said proffering a slip of paper and needing immediate reply popham read and a broad grin appeared why by this it seems youve done splendidly old chap he handed it to kydd it was a personal note scrawled by baird himself and the fellows raving something about a descent on the spanish americas he says you know all about it and so id be most obliged if youd tell me dasher no reply popham told the waiting officer captain kydd and i will attend on the governor this hour baird was waiting with illconcealed impatience well dasher why am i always the last to hear of high things in my own kingdom a conspiracy what as its in the nature of wry talk is all david baird looked suspiciously at kydd am i to be told why hes here of his own concern only sir he wishes to hear from you directly why the river plate enterprise is quite impossible at this time and wont be denied damn it dasher baird exploded all this tomfoolery talk about the americas wont someone tell me what its all about i am probably in fault for the whole thing but its nothing to speak of david simply said mr pitt commissioned a scheme by me for laying the spanish by the tail in their own colonies which was interrupted by trafalgar now as it happens it seems conditions are unusually opportune to resume the enterprise and officers of spirit in my command are clamouring to be let loose on it popham outlined his dealings with miranda the development of plans to provoke an uprising against the spanish with its consequences for the wider war and quite incidentally the probable fame of any who would be concerned in the shattering of centuries of empire and now this fellow waine sails in direct from buenos aires with the news that the viceroyalty is clear quite clear of any defending warships leaving it wide open to any descent of ours captain kydd here is of the opinion that with the retirement of all the french marauding squadrons there is a shining opportunity to execute the plan if only we move instantly baird looked at kydd keenly and where do you hope an army of invasion might be found at this instant young feller popham came in smoothly it needs but a comparable force to that which we employed to reduce cape town david for its purpose is only to hold a strong point such as montevideo until reinforcements and garrison troops arrive then if thats so why isnt this plan being put in train demanded baird loudly be damned when the stakes are so high why not man popham shook his head ruefully it not being the province of a sailorman im reluctant to judge but the situation as i see it is that without orders we are at a loss london has hardly had time to receive the glad news of blaauwberg let alone conjure plans for wider gains and theyre hardly in a position to know the strategics of what is happening on the other side of the world so theyll not be in haste to complete our orders baird threw him a piercing glance then began pacing about the room what youre telling me is that if you received orders to do so youd sail against the spanish with pleasure to resume what was planned and prepared by whitehall before just so bairds pace accelerated and furrows of concentration deepened on his brow suddenly he stopped wheeled around and confronted popham im governor and ruling panjandrum in these parts if i get together a picked army a few guns and a supply train would you then sail i could be held culpable of quitting my station popham replied carefully as not having admiralty orders this is something youll have to square with them later baird retorted ive no authority in that line as well you know and ive my own worries detaching forces when so pinched and justifying all the expenditures well id do my part david yes of course you will dasher wed be in this together dear fellow but think what a noise about the world wed make im sanguine their lordships will overlook the details when this great stroke be known after all were but anticipating orders is all so you think give me your plans well work something out together and be damned to the rules seize the hour popham murmured time and tide chapter renzi tucked into the lamb silently kydd was getting used to it the faraway look the air of distraction the sudden scribbling in a pocket notebook it was not the renzi he knew gone was the languid observer the courteous gentleman in his place a man oblivious to the world nicholas kydd began carefully the masteratarms is complaining that he sees light in your cabin in the silent hours contrary to ships standing orders and must beg you put it out time and again oh er yes pray understand dear fellow that the muse is not to be commanded by mere mortals there are times when you put him in a hard situation he not being of a mind to make a charge against you but he has his duty by me and the other officers if yes yes very well ill try to remember he bolted some bread and made to rise do stay nicholas and tell me how its all going this writing o yours with a sigh renzi took his seat again theres not much to say ive reached the point where il giramondo has left home for hes fatally taken by jenny a pretty milkmaid il giramondo my hero if youll remember renzi said acidly i rather think i should be getting back to work this talking is to no end he stood abruptly outside the voices of passing seamen at their work came to them i bin t montywidayo cuffin rare time there be good t see them spanish biddies again renzi froze aye but wes having t fight afore we gets t see em this time the voices faded renzi turned on kydd youre making that attempt at south america and it needs a common sailor to tell me well i was going to brief the officers later he said weakly but jack tar already seems to have it from somewhere renzi sat down slowly do you mean that at this very moment theres an expedition afoot to raid the spanish americas to make a landing in the river plate yes and am i right in thinking that the projector is commodore popham as being the only one of spirit and dash who puts attacking the enemy before all else renzi bit his lip what does baird think of this his voice was steeledged in course hes persuaded that the conditions are right for the assault and is providing troops and supplies for the expedition good god renzi said slowly hes going to do it kydd frowned nicholas i dont want to say it but this is really none of your business you go back to your writing im sanguine well be sailing within a week theres nothing more to discuss yes there is renzi said intensely depend upon it this is a military expedition my friend and in case youve overlooked it you have no part in it and therefore have no cause to fret kydd said irritably you cant see it but the mans a popinjay a slippery toad and a damned cunning fellow hold your tongue sir kydd barked this is our commander youre referring to anyone else theyd be in bilboes this instant for those words they are not only my words renzi came back i could add others but i will not youll keep your opinions to yourself or ill swear ill have you removed from this vessel as is your prerogative but ill not keep silent at this mountebanks contumacious sentry kydd roared the marine posted at his outer door entered quickly sir renzi his face pale and set looked at kydd i think it better for us both should you allow me a little time to explain myself he said quietly wait outside kydd snapped at the sentry he turned to renzi ten minutes and damme youd better find good reasons or for reasons not unconnected to the duty of politesse in a gentleman belay that catblash i want an explanation o your conduct sir until now ive refrained from mentioning certain facts not necessarily to the credit of your commodore which are understand that i tell you with the utmost reluctance it not being the act of a gentleman to delate upon another still less in an atmosphere of blind loyalty this had better be good kydd said dangerously then this is the substance while you were closely engaged with him on the americans submarine boat i had occasion to visit count rumford in london both he and fulton being american both being fellows of the royal society i pressed the count as to pophams character and he laid before me this that in fashionable society he presents as a moneygetter a restless man of insinuating manners and too sharp by half an excess of cleverality as i remember the term this is worthless society gossip and jabberknowl youll need to do better than this sir i did not accept this alone i determined to investigate for myself and confirmed that unhappily there were good reasons for this view a hydrographer of the first rank inventor of the first telegraphic signal code and other matters how do you believe hed be received at the admiralty honoured for it o course i found the first lord st vincent in utter loathing of the man the same with his secretary why it seems that by personal manipulations he went from being a lieutenant on half pay through to commander and then to full postcaptain without once commanding a naval vessel let alone a shipoftheline in battle be damned to it thats because he was too busy with his inventions and things i heard he was the only man who could persuade the russians to come in with us in flanders knew tsar paul himself no mystery there and manipulations how can he he has himself elected to a rotten borough in the tory cause so he has the ear of the highest pitt himself this hes used on many occasions the most favourable description ive heard of him is incurably plausible in his schemes are you aware that hes deep in litigation with the admiralty court in respect of a personal venture a ship whose master was none other than himself trading under the tuscan flag illegally with bengal he was caught by a british frigate trying to land smuggled goods in ostend and his etrusco seized as a prize of war any naval officer on half pay may with admiralty permission trade to his own account kydd said hotly renzi smiled thinly his first and only command before his present romney was caught in a monsoon and needed repairs instead of consigning this to the naval dockyard at calcutta he mysteriously had it completed at a minor commercial yard in bombay so on his return a committee of inquiry in chatham found that hed overstated the real costs by many thousands proceedings against him are even now under way and youll find theres every kind of pamphlet in public circulation that accuses him of other defalcations and defects of moral character that would make you stare jealousy and ive never heard any o this before why should i believe it now renzi went on you might this hour determine the truth of it all merely by interrogating curzon closely his family is tolerably well placed to know the matter hes not ive spoken to him sharply in private that this is not a matter for public debate in the gunroom which hes honoured since kydd glowered but said nothing dear fellow renzi said why do you think i should risk our friendship by this talk you tell me nicholas why for the sake of your future the man is in debt to his eyebrows no prize money for him of course and no prospects of it on this remote station he sees the immense fortunes won by captains whove seized the spanish treasure ships and has a cunning idea why not make a descent on the source of the wealth itself in effect to sack the river plate and carry off the silver youre out of your mind i dont think so why the haste to move on the spaniards unless its to preserve a position of commanding authority that will ensure his direction of events and ultimately the greater share in the plunder any proper expedition from england will of course displace him as commander and no doubt change its object entirely and you tell me all this for my sake kydd snorted guesswork and envy why should i i cannot stand by and watch you destroy your career when the world believes that youve put yourself in league with such a one cant you see the expedition will end in disaster and a vengeful government will want to find villains to put to the stake and youll be up there with him hes quitting station without leave thats a certain courtmartial for a start let alone kydd cut him short yes yes i hear what youre saying for gods sake its its only my regard for you brother that makes me speak in this way so im to be beholden to you for your concern renzi remained silent as familiar shipboard sounds slowly asserted a degree of calm on the charged atmosphere kydd finally spoke again ive much to think on i believe he stared blankly out of the stern windows then his expression softened i spoke hastily and out of order to my friend and im truly sorry for it nicholas he rose went to the side cabinet and found glasses poured a generous measure into each and handed one to renzi thank you for your candour but theres one thing you must accept in me whatever you think his motives a higher purpose is being served i still honour him for his vision of seeing the spanish humbled and his majestys arms glorious and while he leads i will think it my duty to follow in hazard of your reputation if so be it renzi nodded gravely very well then although i must beg to differ in my views i shall say no more handsomely y bastards the boatswains ire was directed to the party swaying aboard stores who had good reason for their impatience hazing from the first lieutenant and their knowledge that at last laurore would be at sea on her native element once more and their penniless liberty would be transformed into an active sea life kydd watched the loading for some moments preparation for the expedition had raced ahead and cape town seethed with rumours but with the navy as one behind popham and with the military in high feather at the expectation of a strategic masterstroke there was no stopping the momentum but what if he forced the thought away but it kept returning what if he and all the others had been gulled into supporting a private dash for plunder what if he was unwittingly being used in adding his name to a scheme to give it credibility and renzis prediction of disaster success was based on one central belief that the inhabitants were so disaffected by spanish rule that at the appearance of the expedition they could be relied on to rise in rebellion and together they would prevail a dangerously simple presumption and the only word they had to back it was that of pophams shadowy miranda and waine the american trader were they sailing to catastrophe the more he considered the possibility the more uneasy he became how a world away from the south american continent would it be possible to gauge the mood of that population it had to be a risk that a thought came to him the artist up on table mountain what was his name serrano yes he was some sort of recent exile from the region and no doubt he could tell him the truth of how the people felt im stepping ashore for a space mr gilbey call away my barge if you will in the autumn greyness there was no likelihood that the artist would be up table mountain but he had the mans card vicente serrano at buitengracht not a smart address he seemed to remember it was the area at the edge of the old part of the town the artists place of work was a shop with a powerful odour of pigment and oils dust and canvas and a diverting array of finished works around the walls mr serrano he appeared from behind an easel wiping a brush el capitan he greeted kydd when he had recognised him my honour can i do you service sir ive a need for ornament in my cabin mr serrano i was thinking of say table mountain from another view from blaauwberg strand perhaps a capital sight indeed would thees be in nature of commission sir or th ready found serranos deepset dark eyes were unsettling in their intensity why if you have something ready of this size perhaps kydd indicated a modest landscape the artist crossed the room and selected a painting kydd noted the short stabbing strokes that contrasted with extravagant sweeps across the scene to arresting effect er yes this will do what is your price in rixdollars it was little enough um do you enjoy to live in cape town mr serrano you coming from so far ees home to me now he wrapped the painting drawing the string around it and cutting it off and here we are both in the southern hemisphere it must be autumn as well in montevideo is it so cool and windy there the same he answered without further comment your painting kydd tried another tack you said before that the spanish are making trouble for you does this mean you will never return to south america his gaze piercing serrano replied slowly not never one day yes do you mean to say that if the spanish are overthrown in some way you will be able to return how they be overthrown by we no es posible tell me are there many as you who would take joy should the spanish be replaced by others many many an unspeakable herd from all the town all the country will give praise for thees old young everone if theys porteno they want any give to them they bless for ever and ever then it will not take much to start a rebellion to throw out the spanish im thinking but kydd saw that serrano had retreated into himself he turned to go just catching as he left a ferocious whisper one day one day these peegs will taste the peoples justice only then we be free kydd walked slowly back to the boat there was no doubting the passion of the man it seemed it would take little to spark a revolt and in a town the size of montevideo or buenos aires even a small proportion supporting a rebellion would start something near impossible to stop but there was still the question of pophams motives was it credible that he was manipulating others for his own venal cupidity in effect employing his majestys armed forces for personal gain to make a grab at the fabulous source of the spanish silver before retiring with fame and wealth all kydds dealings with the man to date made him rebel at the thought and as well why was popham taking such trouble to attend to the securing of a strong foothold and the opening of trading links this didnt sound like the action of a freebooter on a quick raid yet renzi had painted a very different picture one of a man who took chances was comfortable at the boundaries of moral conduct and dangerously plausible popham was intelligent and clever to a degree were these merely tales told by lesser men against the gifted no there was no going back he would be loyal and supporting to the commodore until and unless he saw with his own eyes that popham was unworthy of such resolved in his decision he came aboard laurore and energetically set about completing preparations when the expedition sailed the sulky autumn wind had settled to a low hard blow keen and cold and directly from out of the west it kicked up white caps that rode and seethed on a long swell that had made taking aboard lastminute stores and water a wearying and dangerous effort kydds experience in the region told him that there was every likelihood it would get worse before it got better there had been no question of riding it out until it improved apart from the risk of losing their opportunity every hour they lay at anchor the troops would be consuming vital provisions and water these would be needed in the thousands of extra miles occasioned by the northerly arc that their course demanded to fall in with the big driving winds of the open ocean shorten sail when two miles to windd kydd ordered feeling the lengthening restlessness of the deep atlantic coming in detailed off as shepherd to keep a wary eye open he took in the magnificent panorama under leaden skies of the audacious little force setting out on its voyage to destiny there were the two sixtyfours the flagship diadem with raisonable and then the fiftygun diomede recently joined in line and forming the core of the fleet with the cockleshell encounter gunbrig falling in astern the transports sailed loosely on either side only five compared to the many that had accompanied the cape town expedition but aboard were the doughty highlanders of the st regiment who had made such a name for themselves at blaauwberg the frigate leda was hulldown out to sea on distant watch and narcissus was manoeuvring to take up the rear when the fleet had properly formed up their own station would be to range far ahead and fall back the instant any enemy were sighted it was a magnificent undertaking or insanity a tiny force to set against the vastness of a whole continent smaller by far even than the one that had so narrowly seized the cape but the circumstances were very different kydd reminded himself here they would be welcomed as liberators the catalyst that would set montevideo aflame with rebellion and end spanish rule for ever that they had left before formal orders had been received was of concern of course but once word of their bold stroke reached pitt the prime minister who had steered england successfully through the worst that bonaparte could do and who had originally agreed to the expedition then it would be quickly made up with the admiralty this was precisely what the exercise of seapower was all about kydds heart lifted sheet in were off to war mr kendall laurore responded with a will and as the others came round ponderously to their course of northwest by north he went below to deal with the inevitable paperwork that the purser had laid out for him during the morning the wind had hardened and backed more to the south the sure sign of a blow in these parts after his customary turn around the decks at dawn kydd stopped to peer out at the distant sails of the fleet all were down to topsails and making heavy weather of it tiny bursts of white appearing continually and the ships spread well apart he felt a pricking of sympathy at what the soldiers must be enduring packed below and then remembered they themselves had fortyfive redcoats and a dour lieutenant squeezed on to their single messdeck but there was nothing he could do they would all have to live with it he went to his cabin for breakfast renzi was at the stern windows braced in a chair and reading the last newspaper obtained in cape town he looked up and offered buenos dias senor er i didnt quite catch that nicholas oh um como es el clima vamos a tomar el desayuno youre vexing me with your classical lingo you dog not at all im learning the castilian of cervantes and mendoza that noble language of far hesperia as i said renzi sighed it is the spanish dear fellow which you will have cause to require before long id hazard i suppose so the prisoners of course or worse kydd lifted his chin defiantly if youre not to be warm in the cause then id thank you kindly to keep your opinions to yourself he caught himself and then asked er but why renzi adopted a pained expression in all conscience theres little enough i can offer to my friend at this time before kydd could reply he added and then again the acquiring of another romance language is always to be applauded this brought a grin from kydd i thank you for the thought m friend it could be damned useful at the capitulation er yes so now you are safely to sea on this crusade shall you wish to know the latter adventures of il giramondo i rather fancy im in a flow of sorts and am quite exercised to know if others do see it as i why er im rather pressed at the moment old chap i will when i can never fear the day wore on the unremitting wind bringing a dirgelike drone in the rigging and reefs in the topsails with an uncomfortable corkscrew sea on the quarter demanding rolling tackles to the yards and an eye to nearby handholds a pall of blackness lay out to the southwest with startlingly vivid white rain squalls hanging before it as it drifted towards them prudent measures were put in train to meet the unpleasantness for although kydd was confident that they had won their offing there was no sense in taking risks sail was shortened in conformity with the blow which was now flat and hard its whistling moan rising in pitch as spindrift torn from wavecrests filled the air with the tang of salt kydd glanced across at the flagship diadem was a wet ship a fluke of design seeing her bows buried in the rollers for much of the time then reluctantly rising to shed the seas each side like a waterfall working headsails in her would be dangerous it was not for nothing that sailors often called the bowsprit the widowmaker there was no signal from the commodore however no order to lieto or scud popham was anxious to avoid loss of time and the little fleet kept on course the winds nearly abeam in a way this was merciful for while they were still under sail the force of the blast was dampening the roll but things could change quickly and not only for the worse it was just as conceivable that they might be crabbing across the worst of the gale to emerge to calmer conditions the other side lifelines kydd ordered before leaving the deck to curzon it was a customary atlantic gale of this time of the year but the knowledge didnt lessen the hours of moving from hand to hand the musclebunching brace against the deep heaving and the endless vigilance against a violent squall coming out of the blackness of night or a wild wave rearing up to smash surge aboard and snatch the lives of any whose attention had grown careless morning brought a seascape of white long combers spray lazily curling from their crests the air alive with driven spume and the near horizon a broad blur of white but it was becoming clear the bluster was easing as the forenoon wore on the horizon moved out and from the mist a lightgrey phantom hardened another ship one of the transports gamely heading on course with them it became possible to allow their soldier passengers on deck solitary figures dragging themselves to the ships side draped hopelessly as they cast their accounts at the court of king neptune soon joined by others they were tended with rough kindness by the watchondeck but by nightfall there were substantial numbers needing to be shooed below there was always the cheerful time after every storm when the galley fire could safely be lit and the first hot victuals issued ravenous after days of hard tack and cheese the seamen wolfed theirs their captain no less appreciative as his was served after the men had eaten rousin good scran kydd mumbled to renzi never thought id lust after a hand o mutton so his friend dabbed his mouth with his napkin the very pinnacle of the art he murmured in satisfaction as it a tentative knock broke in it was the masteratarms his usually impassive features creased in bafflement sir wes got a bit of a puzzler see theres a man bin found as we dont know who e is like youre not being clear master why when th watch went below an took them who was seasick t put em in their hammick theres one who couldnt say where he slings it he bein sick like we got no sense outa him we asks about an no one pipes up t claim him wheres he now on the uppers still wont let go an get his swede down so i left him wi the bosuns mate sir you did right to inform me ask the officerofthewatch to look into it and report if you please gilbey was down in minutes an i stand well flammed sir its our artist cove the one in cape town we commissioned our ornament pictures off serrano when hes of a condition to talk bring him here kydd guessed their destination was an open secret and assumed that serrano had wanted to be at the scene of action when the hated spanish were humbled he had gone about it intelligently insinuating himself aboard then insisting he was of the other when questioned by either a sailor or the military it had only gone wrong when he had been laid low by seasickness or was he a spy ready to slip ashore the moment they arrived to ingratiate himself with the spanish it didnt seem likely though not with the depth of feeling kydd had personally heard the weather eased and a wan sun had given heart to the sufferers when the artist was brought before kydd in the coach shooing out the midshipmen at their workings their estimates of the ships position by calculations he demanded now then sir your actions are both foolish and unlawful ive to decide whats to be done with you what have you got to say serrano was in rumpled soiled clothes his eyes empty and slack kydd felt there was little prospect of getting much out of him inevitably it meant that he must be held prisoner fastened with leg irons in the bilboes outside the gunroom like a common malefactor until things were resolved but there was a defiant stirring his eyes trying to focus while he croaked this is heestory i be there i see my home free libertad para el pueblo the words trailed off weakly but there was stubbornness and pleading in the ravaged expression i understand mr serrano and you have my sympathy but this is a ship of war and may bear no civilian passengers my proper course is to keep you confined until we touch at st helena and then land you in custody no i mus be there meester kydd you must understand sir kydd softened there is a way if you shall enlist to serve under english colours i can promise youll be there i my family they are patricios sir i cannot then er may i not be your interpreter your man of trust as will talk with los espanoles can treat wi the patriots what they want kydd could see times when delicacies of conduct would be needed in dealing with proud revolutionaries and the like and serrano would presumably know them and sir while the ship guns do roar an your army storms the citadels as witness i will paint for you such a scene as your granchildren will for ever admire why that would be well appreciated mr serrano let me see you shall be assistant to mr renzi who is my secretary to perform such duties as he bids you to do this would place him in kydds personal retinue rather than on the books of the navy and therefore answerable to him alone it would also keep him under eye you will berth in steerage and mess with the gunroom your wages will um be decided he went on more sternly do mark what i say mr serrano by so doing you place yourself under ships discipline to obey all lawful commands of myself and my officers do you so agree kydd took a muffled groan as an assent and shortly told a curious renzi you may use him how you will old trout but hes mine when we raise the river plate soon renzis assistant was another being taken in hand by the gunroom steward he had been instructed in the art of slinging a hammock and his little bundle of possessions had been safely stowed in renzis cabin his appearance at table provoked goodnatured curiosity but he kept to himself saying little remaining polite but watchful for renzi his presence was gratifying at any time he chose he had on hand a spanish tutor and linguist sparring partner who was both interesting and challenging to the intellect of a noteworthy family it seemed he had been a student in philosophy and letters at the national university in buenos aires and having been less than discreet in his writings had been imprisoned twice before his expulsion in the simmering atmosphere of discontent the spanish had been merciless and he had fled for his life having been caught up in a hotheaded street rising you are not acquainted with the sainted locke then mi compadre for the sake of your soul you will cast in the purest castilian the paragraphs i will mark out in his an essay concerning human understanding si maestro lo hare con encantado chapter st helena lifted above the horizon a rumpled grey shape set against deep blue seas with eager white horses as far as the eye could see a vast azure heaven was populated with gambolling fluffy clouds the warmth of the sun grateful to the skin after their time of testing the ships of the fleet had found one another and now proceeded in proper formation however of the five transports there were now only four somewhere out in the howling chaos ocean had disappeared it was possible that she would suddenly appear but the frigates quartering far out after the storm to gather in the scattered band had seen no sign of her and three days had passed there was the outside chance that she was already at st helena the appointed rendezvous and waiting for them but kydd doubted the lumbering merchantman could have overhauled them all the probability was that at some time during the night she had not proved equal to the stress of tempest her shattered wreck had finally yielded and sunk taking with her to a watery grave not only captain and crew but several hundred officers and soldiers a significant part of the expedition kydd grieved at their fate an improbable dot in the immensity of ocean st helena was at the near geographic centre of the south atlantic north to south east to west it could be no further from land to which the majestic height of the rollers close to the coast attested as they rounded the last point the haven of james bay opened up and telescopes were quickly searching but ocean was not there popham was not about to waste time even as anchors plunged a precautionary single flag whipped up diadems mainmast head the blue square pierced with white which was the blue peter the signal for prepare to sail within twentyfour hours soon afterwards all captains was hung out it was the order for them to join popham in going ashore to meet the governor but there would be no solemn gun salutes this governor had been appointed privately by the east india company to rule over this vital rendezvous for the india convoys and therefore was not entitled to such the soaring crags and cloudwreathed peaks were all of two thousand feet in altitude and the narrow valley that led up to plantation house was steep and spectacular requiring the services of a government calesa governor patton was waiting for them on the front lawn of his residence under the myrtles and mimosa welcome gentlemen whatever your occasion he had met most of the captains before during the cape campaign and clearly suspected something was afoot whitegloved footmen circulated with wine in the sun and pleasant oceanic breezes most of the captains found they had a yarn or two to tell of recent stormy experiences all too soon the sky greyed a rain squall threatening and the group was ushered inside to a reception room popham was in striking form in the finery of a flag officer attended by his lieutenant and with an air of serene authority patton approached him tell me commodore would it be altogether too presumptuous of me to ask your mission i rather thought the french squadrons had been scattered or is this some new adventure popham smiled then confided as it promises to be the greatest stroke this age robert not for the ear of the common herd of course but this little armada is on its way to set south america ablaze good god said patton faintly indeed it seems the natives are ripe for rebellion and since trafalgar the spanish being powerless to defend their interests our fleet is able to sail in the character of liberator why that would mean yes detach their empire and source of wealth and the spanish must treat for peace despite any bluster bonaparte may put up trade thats where the real excitement is be damned to their colonial laws this would open the whole of the continent to us and thats to be reckoned in the millions tens of millions the least of it damme but this is bloodstirring stuff beresford joined the group in the red and gold regimentals of a general a splendid match for popham patton asked him a military challenge of sorts id think it william the dons have all those irregulars and must keep a sizeable garrison in montevideo our information is that these are not as formidable as rumoured beresford began cautiously however its vital we secure a quick and visible victory to encourage the rising or were lost and with few enough men popham came back quickly and to all involved a capital opportunity for distinction id believe especially one thats set fair to make fortunes i do envy you fellows patton said with feeling its to be a grand occasion im persuaded but is the east india company not to be invited to a change of empires its too bad really too bad there was goodnatured laughter then popham rubbed his chin thoughtfully ah as to that robert it does cross my mind that in the recent storm we somehow mislaid ocean transport which leaves us short of artillery and er it would not be without precedent for john company to lend support to his majestys arms when requested a trifle of field pieces amounting to say a hundred men in all and there you would have your invitation patton immediately cooled youre seriously asking that i authorise a detaching of our st helena garrison with their guns for service with you only a suggestion robert and simply for the term of the initial showing before the spanish naturally your outgoings would be compensated by the crown and other fees ill leave with the fiscals but this would certainly ensure your appearance in the annals of the expedition then pray what do your orders say precisely concerning an involvement of the company patton challenged i can most definitely assure you that i have no orders whatsoever forbidding your assistance popham replied earnestly and when i last spoke with mr pitt on the matter he was most insistent that all local resources be employed mr pitt patton said impressed youve discussed this entire expedition is merely the resuming of a venture planned and agreed upon by myself and his majestys government lately interrupted by trafalgar oh well i can see be that as it may robert most would see it to your advantage to be first to plant a mercantile interest in the new lands to secure a preferential trading position before the city hears of our coup quite so um it would seem a reasonable request you are making m friend and considering an early success is much to be desired by us both then perhaps the artillery detachment might profitably be accompanied by perhaps two or three hundred of our infantry you could make use of them thats handsome in you dear fellow and im sanguine well be able to exercise em for you in the field their transport well see theyre well taken care of robert never fear beaming the commodore turned to the circle of his officers gentlemen the gods of war are smiling upon us we sail just as soon as your green stuff and water are complete youll want to return to your ships no liberty for the hands of course and not a moment to be lost in the general stir he called captain kydd if youd kindly wait on me details of the st helena reinforcements to be dealt with the other captains taking the hint quickly made to leave ill wish you well of your mission sir patton said warmly shaking pophams hand then lifting his arm in salute as enterprising a piece of work as ever ive heard thank you robert popham said and made for the door but stopped at a small marble side table where some newspapers were neatly piled oh papers from home new arrived havent had time to read em do help yourself old chap popham reached for one then paused without looking round he hurriedly stuffed it into his waistcoat er youll have my earliest word of course goodbye they joined the others in a waiting calesa which ground off down the steep road cheerful conversations started up but kydd was disturbed to see pophams set face and to note his unusual quiet at the seafront the captains took boat for their commands but kydd was ushered into diadems barge popham still serious and thoughtful kydd kept his silence until they were alone in the great cabin then said a good days work if i might remark it but ocean is mislaid never mind ocean weve more pressing concerns damn it this was not like popham hardly believing his ears kydd blurted lost at sea three hundred souls how can you possibly i said forget it theres a pretty moil we must deal with right at this time forget it how in gods name can you oceans safe popham snapped irritably i told audley to take her direct to the river plate now lets safe you knew all the time what better can you think of to prise troops from patton a trick a ploy popham sighed dear fellow weve secured four hundred more troops in the assault nearly a third of our force dont you think it worth the harmless subterfuge the higher cause is our expedition and for that im prepared to use anything that presents itself as a means wouldnt you kydd was unable to reply there was no illegality no moral issue at stake but was this the action of a noble commander im sure you would if youd given it thought now down to more serious business much more serious and i dont mind confessing that the services of a friend would be of infinite value to me at this time kydd stiffened awkwardly still unsure a friend as will hear me and test my words popham pressed his features tight with worry kydd made up his mind and replied stoutly as i can help dasher popham hesitated then brought out the newspaper pitts dead he said simply kydd reeled this was the prime minister whod been at the helm of state since the very first day of the war when kydd had still been a perruquier of guildford the man whod scorned the slaughter of the french revolution while spain and most of europe had allied against him and until now had been locked in a lethal struggle with napoleon bonaparte who stood astride his conquests like a colossus theres a new government grenville popham added kydd remembered dimly that he was a statesman of the whig party implying an administration radically different from pitts tory government then he understood pophams expedition was a resumption of a plan agreed with pitt and his ministers especially the first lord of the admiralty melville and then barham these now being out of office he could count on no supporters in high places and conceivably there would be those who might see it in their political interest to oppose any pittinspired operation of all times to choose to leave this world popham said bitterly well have to turn back of course popham looked up sharply that is not in my thinking the grenville government might act differently about the strategics dasher we must wait for new orders id have thought you of stronger mettle kydd he forced a smile i didnt mean it to come out like that but you must agree that nothing has changed not a single iota the spanish are occupied in the north their navy is reeling in defeat after trafalgar we still have surprise and our armada is gathered and ready if we turn back now all this is wasted any new orders will only confirm the preparations but we will have lost our moment kydd was torn all that popham had said was true but where did their higher duty really lie a change of political alignment to be allowed to destroy a daring initiative that could alter the entire direction of the war or the prudent awaiting of instructions before proceeding any further damn it here was a man who was willing to risk everything for the sake of his countrys future for what its worth dasher this is what i feel as a patriot and an englishman i can think of no greater cause before me at this moment than south america but as a professional naval officer i find that were sailing a mort close to the wind at peril of disobedience to the wishes of their lordships as a man why with all there is to be gained id a hundred times be hanged for doing something as doing nothing at all bravo my friend popham cried the worry melting away as id hoped youd say its my decision and its to go forward with the enterprise kydd grinned and well see those politicking trimmers in parliament change tack at the run once they see what weve achieved for em damn them all for a parcel o rogues theyll see their way clear to consolidating us once weve done the initial hard work of course now theres much weve to do the chief of which is to find berths for our reinforcements there was not a prayer of cramming any more men into their ships but it would be doubly ironic if they and their guns had to be left behind for lack of room its by way of a puzzler dasher kydd said cautiously yes but im leaving it entirely to you old chap im bound up for the next few hours in working up dispatches as will persuade the admiralty that its to be their first duty to get those consolidating reinforcements to us as soon as they may it has to go off before we sail kydd gave a rueful grin so its my own good self who must conjure a way to get four hundred more men to montevideo it seems as you can and by the way well keep it to ourselves mr pitts untimely demise morale of course from the officers as well i would think so four hundred men close to double the number of a frigates entire complement and their guns and impedimenta it simply couldnt be done the ships had already been loaded to safe limits and with every conceivable space taken up they would be hard pressed to fight in such crowded conditions if confronted by an enemy no there was only one possible course to find another ship there were no naval vessels available but a coopted merchant ship if any could be found would demand hire as a transport to compensate for lack of a commercial cargo which would necessarily be at considerable cost as there was an empty return voyage to include and where was the ready cash to come from and what would they do with her existing cargo there was no question of the crown taking over a merchantman for the task while the law looked on impassively as ships were stripped of their crews by a press gang if a ship itself were taken it would be deemed nothing less than an act of piracy in fact in these matters there was an entire board of transport department of the admiralty to deal with the intricate details that the board was hopelessly distant was no excuse it was one of those unwritten naval laws at the end of everything and even to the end of time there was always to be a due accounting no ship no precious troops in despair kydd looked about the james bay roadstead there was shipping aplenty but only one of size what were the chances that it was going to south america or could be persuaded to render a loyal service to its country there was only one way to find out and time was crucial in the boat out there were only himself and the purser owen with curzon as a countersignatory if they achieved a miracle as to kydds exact authority to incur expenditure whether as ships captain or proxy for the commodore the purser was hard put to establish a clear line and had wrung his hands in dismay without the requisite form or written order from above there was no source of credit against which to issue a note kydd noticed that the ship was high in the water then spotted a lighter leaving from the opposite side transshipping cargo was that a good or bad sign but she was a sturdy shiprigged vessel that would not need nursing in the ocean crossing go about her stern he ordered he saw that justina was of british registry a considerable advantage the three boarded amidships by the woodenrunged pilot ladder the hold was open displaying a nearly empty cavern and they were quickly confronted by a suspicious individual with a deeply lined face hardiman master he growled conscious of eyes on them and the need for privacy kydd introduced himself in a friendly manner adding not the press sir but id be obliged for five minutes of your time if you would the master gave him a piercing look then grunted and took them aft to his cabin could i ask where youre bound kydd began cape town for orders not so profitable therefore captain ive a proposition to make to you as will be to your advantage nothing could be learned from the mans stony expression so he pressed on we have need to ship a parcel of soldiers to south america and were wondering if you not possible m papers say were cleared for cape town and be sure thats where were going a cash profit on a straightforward voyage im surprised you refuse even to hear me south america youre off t some war or other no not even if youll render a great service to your country sir hardiman gave a cynical grunt then got to his feet abruptly ill see you off kydd felt a rising anger be so good as to ask your supercargo to join us captain he said with a touch of steel his single voyage as master in the merchant service had taught him many useful wrinkles a supercargo was there to look after the interests of the freighting party against that of the ship he wont please the master gave him a foul look but leaned out of the door and bellowed orders to send for a mr maycock after some delay a flustered little man came in thisn wants t talk with ye hardiman said coldly ah mr maycock captain kydd sorry to have interrupted you but i have a proposition for your principals should i offer you a cargo this very day for a quick voyage to the river plate as will be a bareboat charter party would you be willing to talk if it was taken up the master would most surely find himself overruled there was an unmistakable gleam of interest cargo soldiers is all a transport of sorts we must move very quickly on this mr maycock ah with a return voyage empty id think a sum of let me see kydd had only one card to play and he gave it all he had before we discuss rates theres a little proposal im authorised to make this was not quite true for he had only just thought of it but he knew popham would back him i can say to you in confidence that we are on an expedition to montevideo to join with rebels in overthrowing spanish rule in the viceroyalty which we have every confidence will be achieved rapidly if you feel able to assist us then the leader of the expedition states that when the port of buenos aires is thrown open to free trade this ship will be given the status of preferred vessel this means that with the merchants there starved of export all other shipping present must nonetheless first wait for you to take your pick of any cargo you desire bound for anywhere to your best profit it was irregular if not downright illegal but was within pophams power to carry out simply by forewarning justina of dates and times ahead of any declaration the pickings to be had would be princely vastly outweighing any considerations of delay in reporting to cape town for orders he was rewarded with a quick intake of breath i understand you captain we accept your offer he rose offering his hand kydd took it suppressing a surge of elation the act was revealing maycock was not expecting anything written down that could later be used against either of them be damned to it an you cant do that mister hardiman snapped triumphantly justinas voyage insurance is t cape town only kydd hadnt thought of this it was no trivial point the value of a wellfound merchantman this size must amount to something like his annual salary for fifty years or more even if the premium could be renegotiated it would certainly not cover an act of war maycock looked at him pointedly and waited very well shell sail uninsured maycock kept a polite silence youll have my note of hand to say youll be reimbursed for her loss if the worst happens kydd said there was no help for it the risk was all his the navy would never agree to what he was proposing and if the vessel was wrecked or captured they would wash their hands of him he ignored curzons look of appalled bewilderment and hoped his winning smile was convincing excellent we have an arrangement an officer of the st helenas infantry will be aboard directly to supervise your fitting for troop accommodation good day gentlemen the expedition sailed in two days with kydd worried popham had approved of his move but had carefully ignored the mention of personal risk the estuary of the river plate was notorious for shoals and reefs and when they sailed justina was not with them she was still frantically being outfitted and stored and would follow when she could easy prey to anything hostile spanish or french popham had not felt able to deplete his main force to offer escort and the thought of the vulnerable merchantman thrashing along alone in their wake was hard for kydd to bear despite his nature he grew surly and snappish swearing when oakleys bawling out of the afterguard on the open deck above broke into his dark thoughts the next land raised would be the enemy coast and the climax of the expedition when they would be entirely alone and their bestlaid dispositions would be tested to the full would they be good enough their knowledge of the viceroyalty was sketchy at best the charts commercial ones of a previous age and by no means to the technical standard he was used to furthermore details of the military deployments to be faced were based on rumour only when he and popham had prepared the operation orders he had been dismayed by the generalisations and assumptions they had been compelled to employ to cover for lack of intelligence before blaauwberg they had been equipped by ships that had regularly touched at the cape with vital knowledge of the terrain and enemy strongholds here the spanish had kept away all but their own ships and smugglers who were not about to make free with their information and with barely a quarter of the troops and a handful of guns in the cold light of day it was beginning to seem more an illconceived impertinence than a decisive military assault his disquiet about the entire conception and its implementation was growing laurore with her relatively shallow draught would no doubt be the one ordered to conduct an early reconnaissance and he felt the responsibility keenly poor charts and hostile waters were by no means unknown to the navy feats of seamanship were performed regularly by the heroes on blockade off the french coast with never a complaint he recalled captain hurd an officer like himself from before the mast in a humble sloop in fearful conditions he had conducted a secret hydrographic survey of brest under the very noses of the enemy he couldnt let the navy down besides which if im intruding ill come back later brother he hadnt noticed renzi hovering no no m friend youve every right well i kydd looked up and saw that renzi was carrying a sheaf of papers youre sore pressed i know but you did say youd take a look do give me your opinion of its worth as a regulargoing reader in course im now half done you know i did say that but i have m worries nicholas as are taking attention it might not be a fair judgement is all he finished lamely renzis face fell and kydd held out his hand let me have em and ill tell you when ive read through things arent going so well for you just your usual mullygrubs afore an action nothing to worry on he had not told renzi about pitts death and his increasing unease that they were sailing without admiralty orders by now the gunroom would be agog with the tale from curzon of how their captain had cozened passage for the reinforcements and there would be considerable speculation as to why it had been necessary to go to such lengths renzi hesitated as though he was about to say something then left quietly kydd put down the sheaf of paper damn it all to blazes this was the final act of what should be an historic occasion and it was turning into a nightmare and if anything happened to justina most surely hed be ruined financially would he then be expected still to play his full part mind full of worry he picked up renzis manuscript anything was better than being left alone with his thoughts the paper was well used crossingsout and tiny insertions everywhere but in renzis strong educated hand it was easy to read he focused on the first page remembering with a sigh the awkward delivery the first time he had read it he determined however to persevere for at least an hour within minutes he was gripped it was so different the first scene was not the fathers study it was the milking shed and without any elaborate setting out the action opened quickly with the hero jeremy tiptoeing into the dark playfully whispering for jenny the milkmaid who finally emerged pouting from the shadows it went on from there in startling detail until the closing act of the chapter when the doors were flung wide and they were discovered it was extraordinary the flow was quite different as well instead of a modest firstperson telling it was now a confident invisible observer drily chronicling the vigorous adventurings of a young man learning about life kydd read on the succeeding chapter in which jeremy was rusticated to a country academy was unexpectedly pathetic and noble by turns renzis device of standing outside the character yet at the same time in intimate connection with thoughts and desires nothing short of masterly kydd found himself a whisky then settled back in anticipation the passage of young jeremys staunch defence of a younger in the face of bullying by a master had all the hallmarks of renzi himself but his ultimate expulsion for whoring in town was not or was it just how much was this his friend and how much fiction sir it was the first lieutenant leaning through the door er yes the masteratarms reports all lights out an were full an bye on the larboard tack course sousouwest commodore in sight kydd realised that hed not been up to take his accustomed turn about the upper deck before retiring which must be puzzling the watchondeck oh er thank you mr gilbey he said pleasantly and um goodnight to you he turned back to the tale spellbound the wasted years following spent in idleness at the grand family estate under the eye of his noble and irascible father were set out in unaffected detail the growing emotional crisis resulting from their differences was temporarily resolved by his unexpected friendship with a certain otherworldly young man a poet whose wild and romantic leanings seemed to give so much point to existence the writing darkened though as it went on to describe how they set off together on a tour of the continent vowing to live life to its fullest the first scenes of debauchery and carnal excess were forthright and clear kydd could hardly believe what he was reading still flowing as it did in the strong hand he knew so well bemused then astounded kydd read on until with a pang he realised that what he had of the manuscript had come to an end he considered going to renzi and waking him up but of course he couldnt instead he leaned back in admiration either this would be the wonder of the season or it would be howled off the streets for its wickedness he chortled hearing the marine sentry outside the door stir uneasily before a spanking northeast trade wind the little armada made good speed across the south atlantic the weather remaining kind if steadily dropping in temperature into the southern late autumn the continental influence far to starboard was of a quite different quality from africa at the same latitude at five hundred miles off leda and laurore were detached to range on ahead kydd complied unhappily for justina had still not hauled into sight his mind shied from the implication and took refuge in his duty the satisfaction of shaking out sail and quitting the slow progress of the rest of the force they crisscrossed the sullen grey wastes for days without incident until they reached the parallel of the great estuary at which their instructions were to make rendezvous with narcissus sent on before to reconnoitre shaping course due west the pair ran down the latitude of the river plate until astonishingly even at seventyfive miles to seaward discolouring of the monotonous greygreen seas became noticeable strengthening until the entire character of the sea was changed by nightfall they were within the loom of the land but prudently lay to until morning for there was every possibility that narcissus would have news of the return of the spanish warships at first light they resumed their course and when a rumpled greyblue rising on the starboard bow announced their landfall on south america with it was the distant pale blur of sails narcissus on her beat across the wide estuary mouth the three ships lay together in the crossswell and exchanged news the captain of narcissus blared out from his speaking trumpet that to his knowledge the spanish navy had not yet returned that all was quiet but that navigation in the estuary was the very devil due to its uncertain and shifting shoals mudbanks and terrifying squalls kydd hailed back that the fleet was on its way and that all was well while honyman in leda wanted to know if ocean had been sighted narcissus then spread sail for the open sea to find the commodore she was replaced on station by leda while kydd with the shallowest draught was dispatched to penetrate deeper into the river plate to make sure of the reconnaissance it was a fearful task at nearly miles across at the mouth to a mile or two at its inner end hundreds of miles away every rutter pilot and guide they could muster was unanimous in its warnings the chief peril was the shallow and treacherous trending of the river which made impossible any approach into the estuary by a seagoing vessel unless by the deeper channels which wove among the notoriously shifting hardpacked banks it was said a thousand ships had laid their bones in this bleak place the other threat was the weather the southern bank of the river plate was in effect the edge of the endless flat plains of the pampas across which the wind could blast without check the notorious pampero could become so strong as to kick up a sea potent enough to stop the river in its flow one from the southeast was sufficient incredibly even to reverse the tide and a hard blow coming from the northwest could virtually dry out the estuary kydd and the master pored over the charts the funnelshaped estuary had on the north side the outlying port of maldonado with montevideo fifty miles further in at the true entry to the river plate the river narrowed there from sixty miles to thirty at which point the past portuguese settlement of colonia lay opposite buenos aires twenty miles further on it ended abruptly in a maze of marshes the south side had except for the capital no settlements of note and was very lowlying with cloying mudflats that stretched for miles and in the river there were two main sandbanks the long ortiz bank in the middle and the sinuous length of the chico closer inshore towards buenos aires beyond there was nothing but unnavigable shallows in hostile waters without local knowledge or a pilot they stood in as grave danger as anywhere kydd had known before their stowaway serrano was apologetic he knew nothing of the sea so their track was entirely their own decision we stand towards montevideo then keep in with the north kydd finally decided narcissus a heavy frigate with a draught to match had been unable to look into this port the most likely to harbour defending spanish menowar it was an essential first step of course for this was the designated assault point for the expedition with maldonado safely out of sight well to the northward laurore set her prow to the west with doubled lookouts the lowering grey skies were menacing and the captain and ships company were sombre as they headed in it was hard to believe they were sailing up a river for there was no land in sight and none expected it was as if they were in the open ocean but for the shorter waveshape and tainted sea the master studied intently his remarks a printed booklet produced by a merchant captain of half a century before that persuasively gave sailing instructions for safe entry into the port of montevideo bear west b north until we raise the isle o flores kendall intoned laurore progressed under cautious sail a shout came from one of the seamen looking over the side the water had now turned a repellent mudbrown solid and impenetrable the great effluvium of a continental river leadsmen kydd snapped a monotonous chant began from the forechains no bottom wi this line it would be a wet and cold job but it would last for as long as they were within the estuary then they reached soundings by the mark fifteen so far from land and only ninety feet barely half an hour later it was by the deep twelve and then eight shoaling fast they must be reaching the vast extrusion of sediment extending seaward at six fathoms kydd put another man in the opposite forechain to call out of sequence with the first laaand hooo kydd could not see it from the deck then came the hail that it was a long rambling island isla de flores montevideo was just fifteen miles further on the island no nearern three mile sir they bore away and almost immediately anxious shouts came from the leadsmen ive five fathom b the mark five it was incredible but with no land in sight they had less than twelve feet of water under their keel any rise or knoll in the invisible seabed and they would touch heave us to mr kendall kydd ordered and turned to the boatswain i want three boats in the water ahead with a hand lead in each spread in a line across their bows they would give indication of the best passage says here sir if you brings up mud youre in the channel black sand and yeve strayed either side now the leadsmen would be looking to the base of their leads smeared with tallow to bring up an indication of the nature of the sea bottom it was agonisingly slow work the fitful wind fluttered the sides of the sails it had been mercifully constant until now but if it veered from its southwesterly direction they would be headed and the reconnaissance would be over after a little more than an hour the mainland of south america was raised at the masthead punta brava at the outer point of the bay of montevideo when the land could be seen from the quarterdeck it was flat and uninteresting scrub occasional sand dunes and then the last point before the bay would they see a telltale forest of masts a swarm of angry gunboats emerging the water shallowed further and kydd kept the frigate well offshore as they made the final low headland and the bay opened up instantly telescopes trained and searched and there was no fleet at anchor they were still five miles or more off so kydd swung into the shrouds and mounted to the tops taking out his pocket telescope he could see deep within the bay nothing hidden from this vantagepoint on the right he saw the untidy low sprawl of a large town which must be montevideo and on the left of the bay a conical hill about four hundred feet high no doubt the mountain that could be seen from across the bay and gave the city its name there were vessels within but not one that answered the description of a manowar in a rush of relief kydd descended nothing he told the group on the quarterdeck where now sir kendall enquired anxiously they had news that would gladden popham but would he be satisfied with just that there had to be deeper channels perhaps dredged that would allow large vessels to enter but these would be known only to pilots and local captains at the same time this would imply that other channels were available that led deeper into the river plate it was his duty therefore to attempt further penetration we stand on with the boats still leading they hardened in and closehauled stood away before they had made more than a few miles the wind failed kydd was too much the seaman not to know that this was usually the precursor of a shift in direction and there was only one action that could be contemplated get the boats in were going back but in the time it took to heave to hoist aboard their boats and put about everything had changed in these strange climes it seemed it was not to be a simple change of wind direction from the southwest spread a wide glistening white fluffiness a seafog it reached and enveloped them in a clammy embrace until they were swallowed in its soundless immensity laurore glided on in the eerie whiteness the only thing to be heard the subdued chuckle of water at her forefoot and the mournful chant of the leadsmen if this were an english channel peasouper they would be surrounded by a bedlam of horns gongs and drumbeats kydd remembered it would be reasonably safe to return to the open sea simply by reversing the plot of compass courses the wind conveniently on the beam but he wouldnt feel secure until from the tops came an agitated breathy hail deck hoooo kydd looked up sail jus a pistol shot t looard i see topsls of a schooner silence fore n aft kydd ordered savagely in a low voice this could only be the enemy at that size never a threat but if they could question the crew where headed he threw to the lookout cross our bows their priceless advantage was that in a foreandaftrigged vessel like a schooner there could be no lookout positions aloft but their own high up had been able to see the betraying upper sails of the ship above the fogbank get men below on my order just open all gunports to larboard kydd hissed at curzon gently rippling along there was ample time to prepare m compliments to mr renzi and would he step up here judging his moment well precisely as the grey shape of the other craft materialised out of the fog he swung laurore parallel and roared out the order for the gunports to open while trumpets blared and marine drummers beat out a terrifying tattoo in the schooner it must have been the stuff of nightmares a towering enemy frigate appearing like magic out of the mists apparently about to blast them to splinters the hapless vessel was grappled and boarded before even her colours had been jerked down in terrified surrender nicholas kydd said gratified that renzis coming on deck had coincided with the sudden commotion of the appearance and taking of an enemy would you kindly accompany mr gilbey aboard and invite the captain to join us when renzi returned it was not merely with a spanish captain but a distinctly unamused gentleman of imperious manner and fine dress sir i have the honour to present his excellency the governor of truxillo bows were exchanged but the smouldering dark eyes barely concealed thunder and the desire for vengeance kydd nodded to renzi it was impressive the suavity his friend was managing with his newfound spanish i shall look forward to entertaining his excellency in my cabin shortly as soon as we have concluded our business here the schooner was a fine one trimlined and well appointed her crew standing disconsolately along the deck an aviso if so this was an official vessel and quite likely to be charged with dispatches the speed of her capture meant almost certainly that these were still aboard gilbey could be trusted to intercept any attempt to get rid of them the governor was surly and abrupt and nothing could be learned from courtly questioning except that their presence had been utterly unexpected no matter the commodore would follow through with his own interrogation the small crew was another matter when under way once more the schooner under prize crew and demurely in the frigates wake he had her company examined one by one renzi came up to see kydd in his cabin i think youll find one man an interesting fellow he said mysteriously ive had serrano concealed nearby and he swears hes an englishman the man was under guard in the gunroom a large somewhat florid individual in the plain dress of a warrant officer of sorts this is crujido sir and what is his rank cual es su rango senor there was a flow of mumbled spanish in reply hes being evasive about it sir tell him that unless hes more truthful hell be sent back to cape town in irons as a suspected deserter the nervous start he gave before it was translated was all the evidence kydd needed so we understand each other aye captain jed russell it is an i been here since before the frenchies started emigrated a new life i has now then youve sworn allegiance to the spanish crown had to o course and now were at war with the spanish with you kydd said mildly what do you say to that there was a reluctant silence then what do ye here if i cn ask it kydd gave the man a shrewd look im thinking yere here to do a mischief agin the spaniards in montevideo are ye a fleet kydd said nothing letting russell make the running aye well if ye are then theres many o these here wholl relish em being humbled what say i give help whatll ye do for me give help whats your situation sir a satisfied smile emerged why an im a senior pilot for the rio de la plata under the viceroyalty is all kydd couldnt suppress an answering grin then mr russell you shall be satisfied in all particulars should you choose service with us is there anything else youd be wanting there is and what is that pray its been all o these fifteen years an ive never tasted a right true drop if ye can see yr way clear what do you mean the mans indisposed popham snapped i want him here its imperative i get answers and this instant kydd sighed that is to say hes been taken with barrel fever it being the first grog hes faced this age i thought it necessary if we have to use him for gods sake are the spanish going to dasher the substance of what he told me is this and its the first direct intelligence weve had damn it he says the people would look kindly on being made free as we know and as of this moment its a prime time to attack theyve no idea were here or why there are no spanish menowar as theyre all in the north still engaged with miranda in montevideo the fortress is manned but by a smallish number of regulars and a sad parcel o militia who wont stand against real troops such as ours in particular in a few days itll be the feast of corpus christi in which all will join in drunken riot for a week a fine time to move against em thats more like it popham grunted in much satisfaction oh and he says theres a considerable treasure in buenos aires waiting for want of escort to spain is there by heaven popham said slowly his eyes widening theres more i have a man aboard a native of these parts with strong sympathy towards a rebellion he stowed away to be in at the kill so i signed him on as translator if he can make his number with the rebels ashore yes yes see what you can do popham said distracted i need to think kydd took his leave and returned to laurore in high spirits when he had emerged from the fog to rendezvous with the fleet off maldonado hed seen the unmistakable outlines of justina primly at anchor in the middle of the little group her voyage and contract now fulfilled and beyond her the welcome sight of ocean at last come to join renzi stood forward in conversation with serrano who was looking fixedly at the maldonado shore so this is your south america vicente renzi murmured seeing the rapt expression on his spanish friends face si is very beautiful no the distant shoreline dry flat and a study in ochrous brown looked anything but inviting most attractive renzi agreed hastily are you looking forward to setting foot on shore when the spanish have left not ever before and then ah the first it to be mi carino the girl who wait i finish my study we are married maybe business the silver it will finish the pampas our true riches i think the how you say skin of cow these the whole world always want our meats grain with libre comercio we sell all profit will stay wi us we be rich just so m friend as soon as youre independent serrano looked pensive then asked abruptly you english why youre helping wi us its to our advantage should the spanish lose their colonies he looked sideways at renzis set face with a slight smile why quiet youre not agreeable wi this renzi hesitated then admitted the governance of a country is its own business even in war i cannot see we have any right to interfere in its sovereign affairs if the people rise against their rulers then that is for them and only them to resolve your chief not think like that he will attack soon as i understand it good i will paint a grand battle your soldiers with ours fighting to beat the spanish a magnifico drama like as senor shakespeare write er possibly do enjoy this prospect my friend i must return to my writing i find ah mr serrano kydd said rising in welcome as the artist was escorted into his day cabin there is a matter i wish to discuss at your service captain i will not hide it from you an assault on montevideo will begin shortly our commodore is desirous that all who wish to throw off the spanish yoke may join with us to share in the glory of this occasion of history serrano breathed his face glowing er yes to enable this to happen it will be necessary to join forces to talk together of where we shall strike first where supplies are to be found yes sir so we must speak with the leaders of the um movement for freedom los patriotas the patriots captain do you know them these i know an hold close to my heart sir very well we would be much obliged should you go and inform them that the british leader desires a parley serranos eyes shone is dangerous but for freedom i do it kydd remembered that the man was wanted by the authorities and hesitated not if it places you in hazard at all i want to landing at puerto del ingles captain at darkness it seemed only fair to send for renzi at this point nicholas your friend is assisting us by contacting the rebel band shall you want to supervise his arrangements at all vicente renzi said with concern mi amigo you are only to find the leader of the band and bring him to us theres no need to play the temerario in this the young painter was so intense so bound up with his place in the destiny of his country would he like wordsworth be caught up in the roaring chaos of a nation in revolt and then be disillusioned with its price in blood and terror is my duty nicholas i playing my part the exaltation had passed and there was now seriousness and resolve but not so easy los patriotas they are many but many leaders also they quarrel fight each other i will tell them for the sake of freedom they must join in one then would you wish it that we go together in renzis past he had seen his share of naivety and treachery and feared for his young friend no es posible here is no place for the english gentleman the country is raw and wicked the people as untamed animals no is my duty my glory then i honour you for it vicente so puerto del ingles where is it at all ah maldonado to the west twenty miles is where you english take on shore your smuggled goods to trade a lagoon of seven mile protect and it have a pretty beach captain kydd wishes to make contact as quickly as possible you should be prepared to land in the darkness tonight are you ready a knapsack of rations and a canteen of water was all he would accept together with a stout boatcloak and scarf insisting he go entirely unarmed it was renzi who quietly pointed out that any documentation of authenticity provided by the commodore would be a death sentence if he was taken up by the authorities in the evening laurore ghosted into the bay a boat was put in the water with renzi and serrano as passengers and they warily made for the point at the northern end of the beach passing inshore fishermen in their curious flat boats ignoring them as they worked in the gathering gloom the boat doused sail and under oars hissed into the sand serrano stood in the boat and hesitated staring into the anonymous countryside with its wafting odour of dryness and cattle if youd rather wait renzi offered he shook his head made his way clumsily down the boat and dropped on to the beach remembering to turn and lift a hand in farewell vaya con dios mi amigo called renzi in a low voice he watched the man trudge up the beach and into the thickets chapter flag sir all captains it was calloway now holding a temporary warrant from the commodore as masters mate after the death of pearse with a vacancy on the quarterdeck for a midshipman the earnest searle had been elevated seeming young and vulnerable in the inherited uniform that hung about him thank you said kydd the summons was expected at this critical point popham had decided on a proper councilofwar which had full legal standing no mere gathering of opinion but the coming to a course of action that they would all agree upon then if there was a calamity no one could claim they had known it all along and not been heard diadems great cabin was soon packed at one end of the table athwart was the commodore at the other beresford general officer in command of land forces the naval captains were along one side the army on the other thank you for your attendance gentlemen popham opened with a broad smile this councilofwar now begins one of his lieutenants sat to his right taking note of the proceedings a subaltern next to general beresford doing the same prospects for our success remain excellent im happy to say the strength of the enemy is as we heard before and there appears no reinforcement contemplated should we make our stroke with boldness and speed we shall be able to avoid a protracted campaign beresford coughed discreetly that is all very well sir but may we be told where such information has come from do you have sources of intelligence among the dons that can be trusted to reveal all to us popham looked pained sir as in most expeditions of my experience the usual fishermen merchants and others are well capable of providing a picture of their circumstances which taken in the round can establish the situation better even than a lone spy or traitor they have nothing to gain by giving false information which will be discovered later and everything to gain when it is over and we are in power the general harrumphed but offered no further question im interested to know how your revolt is to be managed rumbled honyman are they to play in our show when will we know theyre of a mind to rise up and such ive an envoy passed ashore to speak with the chief of the rebels and another courtesy of captain kydd their task is to bring them to a meeting with ourselves with the object of coordinating our attack with their rising their instructions are to proceed with the utmost celerity have you communication from them i expect it hourly general so no word yet after three days we cannot delay matters for them beresford came in sharply and further its my opinion that no reliance whatsoever be placed on the services of irregular troops whatever their dedication are they to be under my express command if not then they cannot appear in my order of battle neither do we expect to see them there sir popham replied smoothly any accession to strength from these irregulars is to be welcomed but not relied upon our expectation is that any revolt will be more in the character of a general and spontaneous uprising in the population as a whole following the example of our assault which will go on to overwhelm the spanish forces hmph glowered beresford let us now consider the reduction of the montevideo fortress weve little enough in the way of siege engines and such and you admitted before did you not that this is the chief stronghold for the entire river plate he looked about him significantly im not saying weve no chance of success merely that our planning has to be meticulous therefore this is what i propose we land well to the east marching rapidly for a hooked advance from the interior instead of popham held up his hand thank you general before we discuss these details i wish to advise that in the light of recent intelligence ive been looking at quite another strategy as it offers itself recent intelligence the general growled should we not be told of this all will become clear in a moment sir popham said patiently the intelligence comes from an unimpeachable source the chief pilot of the viceroyalty lately taken he may be considered the first major figure coming over to us hes laid before me the defensive situation of the spanish and this is that all their regular troops have been moved to montevideo on the assumption that that city will be our objective any fool knows this he further specifies that as a consequence the city of buenos aires is defenceless a paltry militia battalion only are you seriously suggesting it crosses my mind that as this is the chief city and seat of power its loss will at a blow paralyse the spanish and give heart to the people in their rising this is a foolish notion that flies in the face of military science to leave an enemy position of strength in the rear of ones advance is of the first rank of idiocy and i cannot countenance such an act umm not only this general but you may not be aware that in the city treasury lie untold millions in silver that cannot be freighted to spain for want of ships there was an immediate stir of interest purely out of curiosity dear fellow but should this be confiscated for the navy will it be put forward as in the nature of er prize money captain byng asked there is precedent george i rather feel that droits of the crown will not be asserted in this case popham murmured another voice came in ah then shall we get back to the matter in hand beresford broke in heavily montevideo will not easily be taken by storm with the forces i have to command therefore we will general i have shown how a successful assault on the spanish might be contemplated should we not consider this before going into operational details of any one stratagem beresford looked at him in amazement you really desire us to make a direct assault on the capital with less than a thousand and a half under arms ridiculous a city of what thirty or forty thousand a central fortress and an unknown number of defenders under the command of the viceroy himself preposterous popham leaned forward and spoke forcefully its effectively an open city for weve heard that it is drained of their best troops who have gone to montevideo as well its the last thing the spanish expect a rapid and direct move on their capital and youve not considered the effect on the population of a confident and wellconducted thrust against their military recollect sir there has in history never yet been a fullscale field engagement on the soil of south america consequently their troops must be accounted quite untried and will certainly flee when confronted by soldiers of the quality of your highlanders a single bold stroke straight to the heart of the spanish i confess i do like it sir thank you captain honyman popham said modestly and shifted his gaze to the captain of laurore the talk of silver had disturbed kydd renzis words about venal motives still echoed in his ears but the attraction of a daring thrust straight for the centre over a methodical reduction in the usual way was undeniable i er agree kydd said adding particularly as we havent the resources for a lengthy engagement quite barked beresford i would have thought it elementary that we first take montevideo if we can before embarking on any other adventure few resources yes popham said with equal energy then how much better it would be to use these in going straight for buenos aires and leave montevideo to wither alone colonel pack was the first to speak up from the army side damn me if there isnt some sense in what he says sir if were to be short o men throw em at the main objective and be buggered to hanging back waiting beresford winced and looked about for support seeing none he stiffened for the record of proceedings i want it known that my counsel is to take montevideo and defending same to send dispatches to england advising reinforcement for a later assault on buenos aires kydd knew this was a course popham would never take the initiative would be lost and command would be passed to an admiralty nominee who would succeed to the honour of taking the city let alone the certainty of losing the opportunity while the spanish warships were absent popham gave a curt nod thank you sir your position is abundantly clear however also for the record id be interested to know of the officers here how many would consider a direct assault on buenos aires preferable to a more circumspect approach looks were exchanged around the table and hands went up hesitantly besides kydd all the navy captains save donnelly of narcissus indicated support with pack leading more than half of the army i see popham kept his tone level then it appears this councilofwar has a majority agreement on the way forward for the operation gentlemen theres much to be covered in preparing for this assault and i propose that it be accomplished by forming two planning groups one naval for landing and support and one army for operations ashore i shall head the naval might i ask general beresford to head the army renzi was neither in the gunroom nor his cabin kydd hid his irritation and went on deck looking for him he couldnt set messengers to finding him because a captains summons would be relayed in the strongest terms which was not what he wanted with his friend in the mood he had been under these past days after several blank looks at his enquiries he remembered that when the vessel was at anchor renzi sometimes secured solitude that prize above all things in a small ship in one favoured place kydd made his way forward and swung up into the foreratlines climbing up and over the futtock shrouds into the foretop renzi was there his back to the mast and with a book he looked up coldly do i inconvenience at all kydd sat next to him with all sails in no men aloft and lookouts absent it felt strangely bare and deserted the maze of rigging thrumming softly in the quiet with the faroff sad keening of a seabird carrying across the water youre not at your scribbling then no er it would oblige if you could favour me with your presence at this time if that is your order time presses nicholas we make our move on the spaniards very shortly but theres a mort o planning to be done first this is not work for the captains clerk and id appreciate it if id hoped to have escaped an embroilment in this absurdity kydds voice hardened and could i remind you that youre aboard this ship courtesy of a position which carries duties if youre not of a mind very well i shall come if such is necessary damn it nicholas kydd burst out what more have you got against the man since you ask it renzi replied coolly i shall point out to you how this whole business must look to the world here we have a flagofficer who quits his station for the other side of the ocean and for what not only is it for the fantastical notion of invading a continent but now it appears he has persuaded his command that they abandon the reduction of the enemys fortress stronghold for an attack on the seat of the viceroyalty itself why well in the meantime he has learned of a kings ransom in silver in the citys vaults and this is not the way it is nicholas kydd said thickly and unworthy of you therefore most would be hard pressed to find a real difference between this and drakes raids on the spanish main two centuries past no strategics but gain and plunder youve the opening of trade and do spare me the recitation old fellow ive said ill come renzi said wearily and got up shall we get on with it the first draft of planning brought back from popham was a sobering document shifting the objective had brought with it some near insuperable problems the worst of which was russells emphatic statement confirmed by boat that the depth of water was such that not only were the sixtyfours unable to penetrate much further into the river plate but neither were the frigates this was a severe blow for it meant that their landing far up the river would go in without heavy gunfire support of any kind the boats at the mercy of any artillery brought to bear from the shore as well as being under the merciless lash of musketry as they tried to group on the landing beach with no chance to reply actual forces defending were unknown the viceroy could be counted on to garrison a battalion or two but what if a much larger militia force had been mobilised perhaps an army in the interior was on forced march to the coast even as they delayed their own force was frighteningly slight eight hundred or so officers and men of the st and a handful of light dragoons together with the reinforcements from st helena bringing the total to something over a thousand all told against a city of so many tens of thousands if you are determined upon it then theres only one rational course renzi pronounced what pray suspend your immediate ambitions and wait patiently for reinforcements kydd gave a grim smile theres another oh our ships are obliged to lie at anchor idle if we make levy of every marine and seaman who can carry a musket well have half as many troops again remember the sea battalion at blaauwberg and weve a mighty ally thatll count for a whole army im intrigued to know what surprise no one will believe we really intend to fall on buenos aires with what few we have true indeed renzi agreed fervently we tide up in one of these damn fogs and set ashore as close as we can to the city then go straight in ive heard theres a pitiful harbour there and now i know why but well be coming ashore south o the city and the good lord have mercy on us all murmured renzi damn it all nicholas kydd blazed if ye cant think of else to say clew up yr jawing tackle an stand mumchance fr once renzi started at the return of kydds focsle lingo he shuffled awkwardly at the sudden realisation of the depth of his friends feelings my apologies if theres aught kydd subsided but growled then whats to do with your painting friend a general rising an natives flocking to our colours would be prime at this time id believe renzis face shadowed theres been no signal from puerto del ingles these five days im sanguine vicente will be doing what he can so it has to be assumed theres to be no immediate action on the part of the rebels whether this is due to him not being able to find or communicate with the leaders or that he hasnt been able to secure their agreement to meet us ive no idea or hes been taken by the spanish before hes spoken with em er just so the next morning kydd arrived back from consultations on the flagship with a wry grin hes already thought of my idea about landing seamen and takes my bringing it to him as a mark of enthusiasm be damned to it and im therefore made chief of the marine battalion my earnest felicitations brother ive two days to bring em up to snuff so lets begin an order on all captains for a return of men trained in muskets the ships company set to stitching up some sort of red coat for each one well have let me see a field mark on the left arm of a stripe o white cloth no harm in taking precautions then we have to know what theyll need in their knapsacks and such he snorted but this is all lobsterback territory im to send for our ltenant o marines i believe clinton heard kydd out gravely and promised to bring his recommendations within the hour now weve only to find seats for a thousand and a half men in craft as will swim among the shoals and more for the running in of stores and ammunition renzi added and the field guns agreed kydd and weve horses to get landed so lets be moving on it its a miracle i agree mr gilbey kydd said waiting for the boat to take him to encounter the little craft that was to have the honour of leading the expedition in its thrust into the heart of the enemy holloweyed and weary beyond feeling he surveyed the scatter of humble vessels that was now the invasion fleet small transports captured coasters the largest ships boats anything that could carry men was now crowded with soldiery on time and ready to sail and praise be one of the cold fogs had rolled in right on cue this was the chance they needed to slip past montevideo and achieve some measure of surprise but at the cost of all landmarks obliterated as they closed with their objective among the fearful shallows and reefs it would take seamanship of the highest order to get through without casualty youll take care of her for me kydd said to gilbey as encounters boat approached sir i will his first lieutenant replied gravely an good fortune in what must come kydd shook his hand before he was piped over the side twisting around he took a last sight of laurore her trim beauty wrenched at him for he had no illusions about what lay ahead service ashore had been inevitable after his experiences with the army particularly in the recent capture of cape town with these same soldiers but a premonition lay on him one that welled up with memories of his time as a young seaman involved in a royalist rising in brittany those many years ago when all hopes had dissolved into chaos and blood he tried to shake off the ghosts and looked back again at his lovely frigate those divinely inspired lines the rightness of the curves and proud elegance of the lofty spars and there was renzis white face at the open stern window his arm lifted in a sad farewell unaccountably a lump formed in his throat and he turned resolutely forward encounter was a gunbrig one of the plain stout workhorses of the navy that this little inshore gunboat had been expected without hesitation to cross oceans with the fleet was yet another reason why bonaparte could never prevail against such a navy but were they now expecting too much of timber and sinew daring and resolve where were the limits he shook off the morbid thoughts as he heaved himself over the modest bulwarks to see godwin the youthful lieutenantincommand waiting for him welcome aboard sir its said as where captain kydd is theres always sport to be had he added kydd couldnt help an answering grin laurore will have to bide her time ive a fancy encounter is to have all the entertainment to herself er my cabin for refreshments sir no time kydd said briskly and i desire you hang out the preparative as soon as you may the breeze was light but steady the fogbank a dank impenetrable screen of dull white there was nothing to be gained in waiting longer the proceed mr godwin kydd ordered three boats closed with encounter their task to sound ahead a white or red warning flag would fly from each a rowguard of pinnaces armed with swivels accompanied them a pitiful defence if the spanish had hidden sea forces further in kydd glanced back at the ghostly grey of the anchored sixtyfours they looked so insubstantial but he knew popham was watching their little expedition leave to be quickly swallowed up by the fog with the entire fate of the expedition in their hands an indistinct but elaborate signal hoist was up in the flagship there was nothing that could be done now so without a doubt it was a deeply meant farewell their anchor won and the soldiers crowded on deck trying to keep to one side the little ship got under way the enterprise had begun his heart beat a little faster as he glanced back at the rest following the broadbeamed melantho was a reassuring bulk a light in her bows steady to confirm that her own next astern was safely in sight and then came triton the transport containing general beresford and elements of the st with their two guns there was little kydd could do to occupy himself he was aboard in the leading ship under sufferance to make decisions should there be trouble and to be among the first to land while godwin was amiable and attentive he had his responsibilities the quarterdeck was ludicrously small with no room for pacing about and before long kydd found himself picking his way forward through the redcoats on deck initially they stiffened as he approached but soon kydd was able to pass among them without fuss overhearing the ageold military banter of fighting men about to go into battle he made his way back down the other side to find a chair waiting for him on the quarterdeck time passed at a speed of something like three knots it would take several days to cover the hundred and thirty miles to their landing zone painstaking work with the hand lead in the boats was needed to establish a safe channel and russells muddled directions were confusing somehow he had found more drink and now surly or riotous by turns he was under personal guard by a relay of midshipmen they had agonised over the conflicting charts and finally settled on punta quilmes a dozen or so miles south of the city the furthest point where the depth of water was anything like adequate but first there was the fraught passage to negotiate between the notorious ortiz and chico banks the fog held as they left montevideo invisibly to starboard the muddy water gurgling overloud in the pale closeness their ceaseless motion ever onward into the anonymous reaches of the languid river when the darkness closed in there was no option but to anchor rations and grog were distributed to the troops the officers shared the stuffy confines of godwins cabin for their evening meal humorously making light of their conditions but as soon as he could kydd made his way back to the upper deck the soldiers lay all about drawing their blankets around them theyll see far worse in the field believe me a subaltern confided a few days there and theyll be yearning for a nice comfortable plank to sleep on godwin had offered kydd his cabin but at his insistence they had compromised on a hammock aloft and alow in the old way and he tumbled into the mick comfortably like the foremast jack he had been so long ago he slept little the sounds of the ship the anonymous creaks rumbles and distant slithers as it swung with the current were foreign and his thoughts were chaotic and anxious it felt quite different from the nervous exhilaration before the cape town landings he could not throw off the feeling of foreboding that was clamping in on him the morning dawned with a thinning fog and visibility out to nearly half a mile as soon as the boats could be seen reliably they were under way once more and as the day progressed the fog finally dissolved to reveal a grey desolation of empty sea they had made it past montevideo the secret of their departure still safe and kydds spirits rose towards evening they were near the tail of the twin banks allegedly buoyed but russell had warned that mudscouring would continually shift their moorings and they could not be relied on a few distant sails were sighted flat fishing craft that ignored them and always the drab greybrown water sliding monotonously past as kydd deliberated about anchoring for the night melantho slewed and stopped nearly bringing ocean into collision with her the forced delaying of the fleet settled the question but had the vessel touched on mud or an outlier of the hardpacked sand of the chico bank in the last of the light it was established that it had been mud there would be no damage but freeing the deepladen transport from the thick glutinous ooze would not be easy her crew would have a hard night of it lightening ship and hauling off but kydds mind was on the next day in a matter of hours they would be in sight of the enemy given the generals strong opposition to their alteration of plans would he be looking for an excuse to call it off kydd knew if that happened he would be caught up in the inevitable bitterness to follow he must take care to do nothing that could be flourished at a later courtmartial full of dark thoughts he finally drifted off he awoke early to a cold and cheerless day rain threatening a serious matter if they had to land with damp muskets in the teeth of heavy fire kydd felt unable to finish his breakfast they got under way as soon as possible and before midday a low monotonously flat coastline was raised to larboard it continued on as scattered buildings came into sight and then from the masthead a hail the city itself after signalling the fleet to heave to kydd joined the lookout and took out his pocket glass at this moment the entire expedition was in his hands if he overlooked any threat failed to see an enemy column mistook a distant feature and then set the assault in motion he quartered the terrain with care cursing at the thrum and judder of the rigging as he braced on it but could see nothing remotely like a threat the closer shore was low and featureless open scrub and flat heath as far as he could tell while further to the right there was a modest river set about with thickets of small trees and with a slight rise on the far side and some miles beyond at the limit of vision he saw the spires and domes of a city buenos aires after taking one last sweep of the nearest coastline he returned to the deck i see nothing of the enemy he told the expectant faces it seemed astonishing but the spanish were simply not there he boarded encounters tiny jollyboat and was taken to triton to report to the general beresford greeted him impatiently well now and what can you tell us sir significantly he was wearing his sword and officers began hurrying up to hear the conversation at deck level only an anonymous low coastline was in sight from the masthead i could see no sign of the enemy kydd said carefully nothing beresford said incredulously no camp no lines being thrown up troops on column of march the terrain is flat and open sir i should have seen them he spoke firmly therefore i counsel the landing takes place ah were some two miles south of punta quilmes with the city a dozen miles north kydd did not add that this was only if the river they had sighted was indeed the ria chuelo the featureless landscape and sketchy maps made an exact fix impossible beresford beamed at his officers i rather think dame fortune is smiling upon us today by jove the actual landing had demanded meticulous planning the order of the troops first ashore and their support required pinpoint timing with the men in different ships around the fleet coming together the few horses and guns essential to be landed with them marshalled at the same time before all moved in together because of the hours this would take before they could meet the enemy in a protected formation a dawn assault was expected then we move at first light sir a dragoon officer enquired no offence to our gracious hosts but the sooner were on dry land the better id like it beresford said grimly and while weve an unopposed descent im to dispense with the order of assault he paused for effect gentlemen we go in today now just get the men ashore and form em up well take it on from there a wash of relief swept over kydd despite his worst imaginings for some reason they were to be granted a landing without fire from the shore beresford was a general who was not afraid to take decisions but how long were they to be given before the spanish woke up to what was happening ill get it under way then sir the dragoon officer responded smartly it would not take long to send boats around the waiting fleet to order the transports to get their men landed as soon as they had kitted up kydd would take the first boat heading inshore back in encounter he watched the sudden surge in activity in the ships following the dispatch boats visit they were positioned some three to four miles safely to seaward of the mud shallows the boats had far to pull but even the smallest ships could get no nearer in safety in these treacherous waters the sky overhead was louring and dull grey the darkruffled sea fretful and alien washed by a feverpitch of anxiety kydd watched as the assault boats began assembling among them diadems launch take me to it he demanded quickly the jollyboat pulled over strongly and kydd was heaved into the crowded launch after a disgruntled infantryman had to be exchanged out of it to make room sir the lieutenant in charge of the boat looked at a loss never mind me kydd snapped get this boat under way the men at the oars heaved and grunted the boat was jammed with soldiers crammed along the centreline wedged under thwarts and hunched together in the sternsheets nursing their muskets carefully they gazed on the silent shore other boats fell in astern and the first wave was on its way kydd was distracted by the passing thought that he was seeing history unfolding but it was quickly overtaken with worries for the present should he set up a signalling station when they were ashore no there werent any trained naval signalmen in these hired transports to receive and decipher the messages and in any case to what purpose these werent warships with covering gunfire support to manoeuvre or superior commanders to advise once established ashore the only communications from the army would be by boat to encounter and then the long haul out to the anchored shipsoftheline and the commodore effectively therefore he was the naval commander on the spot and carried every responsibility for operations afloat other anxieties crowded in but he beat them back with the thought that everything had gone well so far there was no opposition and when all were landed he could hand over the whole to general beresford in fact he the boat suddenly lurched and stopped dead in the water sending men down in a tangle kydd glared over the side at the roiling discolour there was no escaping the fact that quite simply they had insufficient depth to make it in they were left on the mud a quartermile short of the tideline was fate returning to deal them a cynical counterblow containing his anger at the unfairness kydd knew that to retreat would cost them their precious surprise he grabbed the gunwale and jumped into the sea feeling the soft embrace of the mud he steadied himself the sea was above his groin but this was the only way they could go forward toss yr oars he snapped obediently the rowers smacked down on the looms of their oars bringing them vertical and allowing kydd to wade along outside the boat the mud tugged and resisted sending him staggering but he gradually made progress to beyond its bow all out he bellowed with muttered comments the soldiers followed him into the water splashing and cursing port your weapon y fool he rasped at one who had allowed his musket to dip into the water the others raised their firearms above their heads as they stumbled along soon there was a line of men behind kydd in the long squelch and wrench that was now their strike ashore other boats followed suit and the foreshore became filled with redcoats straggling in muscles burning kydd heaved himself forwards again and again the coastline ahead seemed so far gradually it took on detail and character flat scrub and occasional hardgreen treeclumps alternating with bare gaps in the low skyline nearer with the waterlevel below the knees it became a faster splashing progress a hoarse cry from a soldier behind caught his attention the man was pointing away to the right at the edge of the sea a young boy in a rough cloak was gaping at them someone waved the boys hand flew to his mouth and he ran off yelling reaching the tideline kydd squelched up the stinking mudpacked foreshore to a sparse grass clearing he passed through the scrub to the more open plain beyond nothing not even a flock of sheep or whatever passed for stock animals here they had made it they had achieved a landing they were standing on the mainland of south america turning quickly he strode back to the soldiers stumbling ashore and beckoned a sergeant who panted up unfurled and raised a standard men started to move towards the banner an officer arrived shedding muddy water with a grimace kydd gave a broad smile the day is ours sir do form up if y please lieutenant the man barked orders to another sergeant who bawled incomprehensibly up and down the shoreline answering calls came from elsewhere and before long recognisable groups were coalescing and kydd feeling oddly unwanted stepped out of the way a piper began a stirring wail with several drums rattling out in accompaniment screams of orders echoed the springy turf muffling the stamp of boots after an hour or so laurores lieutenant of marines clinton strode purposefully towards him throwing a magnificent salute he announced marine battalion ready for inspection sah twirling and stamping faultlessly under the eyes of the army he led off smartly to where the lines of kydds marine brigade were drawn up their impromptu uniform was a pleasing mix of blue or red jacket white trousers and gaiters and surmounted by an ingenious black cap and feathers they shouldered arms and came to the present like veterans kydd started to inspect them gravely accompanied by clinton with drawn sword but was interrupted by a horseman who dashed up and saluted respects capn kydd and the general requests your attendance an outstretched arm indicated the direction to take but kydd first concluded his ceremony with all proper salutes before he left he drew clinton aside your first duty is to their weapons we may have warm work before long and ill not be caught unprepared their rations and stores will follow directly he stamped off aware that there were precious few horses and none to spare for sailors ashore beresford and a knot of officers cantered towards him ahoy there is it not captain the general hailed him with a salute he was obviously pleased by the day so far sir just to make claim of my new colonel of the marine brigade how are your numbers um over four hundred of foot three hundred and fifty marines and near a hundred seamen he wondered briefly whether a battalion was bigger than a brigade and settled on the generals term marine brigade mustered and ready sir yes i saw em a stout body o men i shall call them my royal blues i believe aye aye sir so from commander of a fleet he was now a colonel of footsoldiers as will be used where and when the circumstance dictates so they would not find a place in the line kydd saluted then tried to wheel about in military fashion and march off with dignity clinton had the men on the foreshore unloading stores from the boats and piling them where directed by a distracted army quartermaster in one place the st helena artillerymen were assembling their fieldpieces sixpounders and a pair of howitzers later no doubt the royal blues would be asked to tail on and haul these guns kydd found himself once more getting in the way and rued the fate that had him playing the soldier the afternoon wore on then a rustle of expectation spread the enemy had at last been sighted ahead kydd made his way through the encampment to an open area where the general was looking north intently ah mr kydd you understand old fellow that you should stay by me until i send you away on a service he said yes sir an aide dismounted expertly and handed him his reins sir you have use of my mount until er we have need of it gratefully kydd heaved himself aboard there you may see them the villains beresford said dramatically and pointed across to a slight rise about two miles ahead spreading out along the skyline was a vast horde many on horseback the wan glitter of steel clearly visible sir theyre in front of a village of sorts called reduction it says here an officer with a map offered beresford ignored him and said crisply ill have a forward line of highlanders thrown out ahead the sixpounders if theyre ready but i have m doubts theyll attack this day he pursed his lips well be waiting for em in the morning see the men are well fed as night fell the last of the stores and horses were brought ashore miraculously in good order and the expeditionary force was complete kydds apprehensions returned it couldnt be possible not against a city a continent the odds were ridiculous he needed to hear again just how few they were going into battle with whats our count now he asked a nearby officer the major consulted his notebook let me see theres eight hundred of the st disembarked and with your marine brigade of four hundred and fifty that puts us at a bit over the thousand add in the odds and sods of the st helenas infantry and artillery and were at something like sixteen hundred officers and men and thats not forgetting our good general and his field staff of seven guns why here we have four sixpounders in all our heavy artillery he said with a sniff and not to mention a pair of small howitzers with the st helena volunteers as to horses at last count three go to the generals staff the rest to dispatches and artillery no moren a dozen in all id say little more than a thousand and a half to go up against in the distance a twinkling of fires started among the enemy until more and more were strung out along the rise during the night light rain drifted down a cold dispiriting and endless misery with few tents most soldiers hunched under their capes and huddled together to endure kydd shared an improvised tent with the major but the ground became sodden and icy wet insinuated itself from under his blanket until he awoke shivering the morning broke with leaden skies and a piercing wind from across the plains but beresford was in no mood to linger as soon as it was light trumpets sounded and after a hasty breakfast camp was struck mercifully the rain was holding off and kydd joined the small group around the general all of them drooping with wet and odorous with the smell of damp uniform and horses good morning gentlemen beresford said briskly i should think about three thousand of the beggars weve sighted eight guns among em positioned on top of the rise he gave his first orders which were for a defensive line with a sixpounder on the flanks and the howitzers in the centre it was the highlanders who would take the brunt of the attack but close behind them the marine brigade was ready to move to where the battle was hottest together a thousand men were a mass spread out over a battlefield they were pitifully few and when the guns of the enemy opened up and the opposing infantry began to march down the rise against them in a flourish of tinny trumpet calls it seemed certain the whole adventure could finish that morning kydd felt for the reassurance of his sword and glanced about there was anything but concern on the faces of the officers and the men were settled in two ranks the first kneeling and looking steadily ahead in disciplined silence the officers wore a look of professional interest and beresford had out his glass calmly scanning the advance by this time the spanish guns on the hilltop were hard at work their concussion a continuous roll but to no effect the tearing whistle of their shot went well overhead the gunners were apparently so raw they hadnt allowed for their superior height of eye theyre coming on well but a motley crew im persuaded beresford murmured i do believe they need livening up sound the advance if you please and well go and meet em a volley of drumming was answered by the rising wail of pipes and the entire line stepped off together in a steady tramp the going was not easy the scrubby plain populated with bushes and tussocks but the seasoned men paced on stolidly saving their strength for the hill ahead which would inevitably have to be stormed on either side their own guns spoke in sharp cracks but with little result at this range then quite without warning the line faltered and milled in confusion what the hells wrong with those men snapped beresford shifting his glass from the enemy and training it on the floundering troops they had run into a quagmire and the advance came to a complete halt on the other side of the marsh the spanish drew up in ranks and began a murderous fire with their muskets while on the heights the guns were finding their range a wellsprung trap and the first line of defence beresford bit his lip then swung around to kydd get your men on a brace of guns and find your way around the marsh to take em in the flank aye aye sir kydd saluted wheeled his horse around sharply and galloped off to his men clinton he snapped send a couple o men out to find a way around this bog the rest to the traces an haul a pair o guns after crisply dispatching sergeant dodds and his corporal clinton gave kydd a lopsided smile and how did i know wed be called on this way behind him the hauling manropes were already ranged for service well done mr clinton kydd said and as quick as you may back with beresford kydd found the officers watching a display of spanish horsemanship that had them bemused and affronted by turns from the crest of the hill riders in colourful and flamboyant dress were furiously pounding down to the edge of the marsh skidding to a halt and showily dismounting only to turn and make unmistakable gestures before racing away at this the highland soldiers plunged into the morass after them furiously staggering in the black mudholes and stagnant pits defying the musketry fire some spun and dropped but there was no stopping them and when at last the crack and thump of fieldpieces announced the arrival of their manhauled guns out on the flank the enemys fire began to fall away the first kilted soldiers stumbled out of the other side of the swamp and without waiting for others roared their defiance and made straight for the spanish this show of raw bravery unnerved the enemy they turned and fled back up the hill a coloursergeant rallied his highlanders at the base of the rise and with a fearsome battlecry they stormed up the hill in line the ineffective artillery at the summit fell silent a few figures could be seen moving and then there were none at all theyve abandoned their guns the villainous crew beresford said in delight general advance he urged his horse forward into the marsh it stumbled and splashed through followed by his little group of staff he rode to the top of the rise most of the guns were in fact still there six brass cannon with their impedimenta even the mules that drew them remained nervously tethered nearby still loaded cried one of the st helena gunners well why do you wait give em a salute the guns were swung round and to loud cheers crashed out after the fleeing figures the terrain now lay in a gentle slope forward towards a distant line of trees clearly the sinuous course of a river thats the ria chuelo i dare say theyre to make a stand on the other bank mused beresford seeing the retreat converge on the crossing point a wide bridge he snapped his glass shut lets give em no rest form line of advance as an aside he muttered would that i had horses a squadron or two of cavalry would make it a fine rout the troops stepped off again heading for the bridge pipers to the fore and despite their torn and mudsoaked appearance kydd felt a surge of pride in their resolute marching but as they approached the river smoke spiralled up from the bridge and well before they reached it the structure was ablaze on the opposite bank enemy troops were spreading out the second line of defence brought to a reluctant standstill there was nothing for it but to bivouac for the night while the camp was put in hasty preparation beresford summoned kydd sir it would infinitely oblige me if it was appalling work but the royal blues saw it as a point of honour to get the expeditions guns across the impassable mire with muscles tempered by years of heaving on ropes they turned their skills to another kind of hauling they were well into their agony in the darkness when without warning there was a livid flash and an earsplitting explosion sending every man into an instinctive crouch they looked round fearfully for a gigantic piece of ordnance arrayed against them another even louder crash burst on them then the rain came cold murderous and in unbelievable torrents the sticky mud began to soften and fast rivulets started everywhere soaked numbed to the bone and blinded by the ferocity of the deluge the men turned back to their work now made near impossible by the slippery grip of mud and rain for hours they laboured but when a freezing dawn broke there were guns at the waters edge facing the spanish they were safe but their way forward was irretrievably blocked by the ria chuelo it was one of the seamen who found a way sir theres some o them flat fishin boats in a puddle dock yonder if ye cn keep the spaniards heads down for un well swim across an fetch em for a bridge kydd could hardly believe it in order to retrieve their situation the man and his mates were volunteering to plunge into the icy water and swim the fortyodd yards under fire to them how many he snapped four on us very well lets have your names at the very least the commodore would get to know who had saved the expedition beresford lost no time in accepting range the guns opposite and give fire continuously if you please when the bombardment started the spanish slipped back out of sight seeing little point in enduring the near pointblank fire the seamen stripped off and shivering slipped into the turbid and fastflowing river they struck out with frenzied strokes every soul on the british side willing them on until they reached the boats a boatswains mate with a heaving line stood ready then as coolly as he would on the deck of a ship he made his cast and the line sailed across to be seized by the men who quickly hauled in on a heavier rope one by one the boats were cut free and pulled across each was lashed nose to tail to another until there was a continuous line of them and then mirabile dictu they had their bridge under covering fire from the guns the highlanders stormed across quickly establishing themselves under the bank where the spanish could not aim at them without exposing themselves more and more poured over and when they were ready they flung themselves up and into the body of the enemy they had broken through from where kydd was he could see the panic and consternation of the enemy who scattered under the threat of the steadily advancing scots and disappeared into the distance once across the river he saw a thrilling sight not more than three or four miles in front of them were the steeples towers and dense mass of buildings that was buenos aires it was past believing could it be then reason asserted itself the viceroy the marquis of sobremonte would now without doubt bring all his forces to a climactic confrontation with the invaders and all would be decided that morning but there was no army massing ahead no sudden opening of an artillery barrage only an ominous silence under low grey skies the wind piercing their damp bodies they marched on nearer and nearer a road firmed leading into the suburbs and making the going much easier and on either side there were curious flatroofed houses faces at the windows surely flag o truce sir six mounted soldiers under a white flag were winding their way towards them halt the advance beresford ordered lets hear what theyve got to say for themselves the men were in splendid uniform with gold sash and silver spurs but there was an air of controlled ferocity about them stepping his mount forward the generals spanishspeaking aide heard them out sir he said to beresford in a perfectly even voice gesturing towards the most richly dressed this is the virrey diputado quintana he desires a parley concerning capitulation damn it beresford hissed his or ours he is empowered to give up the entire city of buenos aires sir there was a shocked pause then beresford came back haughtily tell em ill only discuss that with viceroy sobremonte himself the men exchanged quick looks their gaze dropping his dark features contorted with shame quintana muttered something and looked away sir the viceroy has fled the capital and is unavailable a breathless sense of unreality stole over kydd that they had thought to seize buenos aires with a mere handful of soldiers was incredible but that they were now conquerors of the whole spanish empire in the south with those same few was beyond belief ah then er my terms are these the honours of war to these stout defenders the protection of the people and their property and the foreseeable continuation of their justice and er municipal authority this was the same as offered to the inhabitants of cape town kydd remembered sir they ask two hours for deliberation not granted in half an hour my advance must resume and i cannot be held responsible for what my enraged highlanders will do in the event of resistance by the city the deputation withdrew but when they returned quintana agreed and stiffly offered his sword beresford accepted it and in accordance with his own terms graciously returned it we shall enter the city in three hours gentlemen it had happened pophams audacious plan to bypass montevideo had succeeded and at exactly the time specified the british south american expedition marched off to take possession in the event it was the best show that could be made thin rain was beginning to fall again and apart from some pipers and drummers there was no military band the soldiers were ordered to march well spaced in open order and stepping short to give an impression of greater numbers kydd riding with the staff gave the honour of leading the royal blues to clinton who went pink with pleasure there would be much in his next letter home no doubt they swung along in that same sense of unreality the houses on either side were now filled with curious onlookers but kydd could see no hatred simply a mix of foreignlooking people looking more confused than hostile soldiers grinned at girls on latticed balconies who were waving and smiling some even throwing blossoms as the men marched past the city proper was no sprawling provincial backwater it was laid out in regular rectangular blocks of substantial buildings the largest of which were finished in white along fine avenues they passed a noble twinspired church and frowning public edifices until at last they reached a vast square facing the river there was a domed cathedral spacious colonnaded buildings and at one end a long arcade with a central arch the parade marched through the sound of the pipes and drums echoing dramatically until they emerged before a massive square fort the red and yellow colours of spain prominent on its flagstaff on all sides and from every passage and doorway hundreds upon hundreds watched silent and fascinated the parade came to a halt hoarse shouts from sergeant majors made a show of dressing off and stamping to attention and then it was the final act beresford dismounted paced evenly to the disconsolate group at the gates of the fort and answered their salutes smartly kydd could not hear what was said but it was clear what was happening after some polite exchanges and bows an object was handed over which he guessed must be the keys the gates were flung open and a small body of soldiers marched out taking the keys an aide and two soldiers entered the fort nobody moved for some minutes and then abruptly the flag of spain jerked down in its place the union flag of great britain soared up in a breathless hush a low murmur spread around the square but in the distance came the rumble of guns it was encounter acknowledging the yielding of the city of buenos aires to his britannic majesty it had happened inside the fort it was bedlam while a distracted beresford stood at a desk snapping orders to his harassed staff a constant stream of messengers arrived continually interrupting with urgent news he thrust scribbled orders at his aide which hastily relayed brought on distant shouts and commotion as they were put into effect other officers impatiently waited their turn for clarification and detail every man still mudspattered and dishevelled direct from the field of battle kydd kept apart knowing that there was little he could do until the situation cleared there was of course the tantalising prospect that as his role ashore had been concluded surely there was nothing to prevent him returning to the comfort and order of his ship his pulse quickened at the thought but he took in the scene as the future of buenos aires was decided it was a titanic task nothing less than the securing of a great city new conquered in the near term armed parties of reconnaissance would be sent forth urgently seeking out pockets of resistance while at the same time a nucleus of rule had to be established to centralise decisions and orders then there were the troops who must be fed and sheltered lines of supply established at first with the fleet and later locally and after that then it would be necessary to make public announcement of intentions how the new masters of buenos aires would rule what the position of the former great and good would be in any ruling council and above all how the price of victory would be exacted in taxation with a staff in single figures and few able to speak spanish it was going to be a herculean task to perform in just a very few days but it had been done before so recently at cape town they had achieved their triumph in a very short time was this why there was no uprising of the disaffected it would be of incalculable value to be able to install a rebel government keen to preserve their standing against a spanish countermove but so far none had made communication and therefore in the sturdy tradition of the british military they would make shift for themselves seeing his chance he moved across to beresford sir im truly sorry to intrude but would you not say my character as a colonel of foot is now at an end when the general looked up it was with a smile ah yes you sailors are notoriously restless if kept from your element overlong i do thank you for your service sir and bid you to be gone but if youve no objection ill retain your brigade until things become more certain you have a lieutenant who youll be well served by lieutenant clinton sir kydd said exulting inwardly a new disturbance sounded outside the crash of boots and muskets it could only be the arrival of an officer of rank it was commodore popham who strode beaming into the room his spotless uniform a picture of splendour against the mired soldiers he acknowledged kydds presence but went straight to beresford my word william and what a stroke the din subsided a little out of respect for him the conqueror of buenos aires three days and you have the city youre much to be congratulated you devil beresford regarded him stonily the rabble i faced in the field was not an adversary worth the name sir you prevailed saw them off in fine style thats all that matters and id say gives us heart for the future yes to be sure now theres much to occupy me commodore beresford said meaningfully of course not the least of which must be the safe custody of so much treasure so much to what do you refer sir why here in the fort you must know its the holding point for the cargo of the spanish treasure fleet before it ships across to spain i had heard something well surely you sir there are other matters touching on our survival that would seem to have more claim on my time if we are to i can only think that such a vast sum unguarded will quickly be a focus for every species of adventurer to the hazard of our security it would seem to me prudent at least to make an account of its amount and situation beresfords lips thinned this is not an army lieutenant intervened hastily er gentlemen may i interrupt as having but this hour returned from making inventory of the armoury and similar in this fort i can say with certainty that there is no bullion or specie held in this building beyond a trivial amount the room fell silent all turning to the young officer he continued nervously you see viceroy sobremonte in fleeing into the country took care to remove the treasure to take with him some thirty tons of silver at the least i was told you mean theres nothing in the strongroom at all er some four hundred piastres for the payment of troops is all sir popham turned pale then then we must go after this damned viceroy william if were to we do nothing of the sort sir what will the world think that were here on a mission of depredation and plunder no sir i wont have it we must popham blurted lets send after him with a troop of fastriding dragoons or some such theyll soon come up with the wretch that weight of silver in oxcarts will slow i will not sir and in case you need reminding i hold a commission from governor baird that honours me with the title of lieutenant governor of this city all such orders will emanate from me alone popham took control of himself and replied evenly then sir i would beg you consider the consequences in london pray keep silent sir beresford barked i find your display at this time of difficulty an impertinence no sir i cannot popham snapped this expedition is a joint affair we all bear responsibility for what occurs and should it be known that for want of due dispatch a treasure in the amount that will pay for this expedition many times over is let go for the sake of a nicety then we shall all answer for it beresford glared at him as he went on strongly and where pray do you expect to find monies sufficient to pay troops for an extended occupation and reserves for works of fortification and other sir we have no choice whatsoever we must go after it the general hesitated the people here will resent its seizing we cannot the city of london will be much encouraged by its display and will hotly desire to invest in such a place while whitehall must perforce send reinforcements to safeguard same the greater object is achieved nevertheless i havent the troops a small detachment will suffice the spanish are not expecting a bold move beresford gave it thought perhaps those dragoons very well they shall set out this hour he said coldly now if youll excuse me the room resumed its clamour popham mopped his brow and recovering himself went to kydd an entertaining time for you these last days i dont doubt he surveyed kydds soiled uniform and winced did our marine brigade put up a reasonable show of it they did so indeed kydd answered warily unsure what construction to put on pophams outburst but youll be happy to part with them sir he said carefully good for ive a particular service for you that is of vital importance to our existence here itll be my pleasure to be back aboard dasher that ill confess popham smiled briefly that is i have no power to elevate you to the felicity of port admiral but i can make you port captain a very necessary post responsible for all ship movements in and out of the port and for the sake of our survival here the effectiveness of our resupply and cargo handling you will keep a weather eye open for any motions of the enemy to agitate against us and regulate the merchantmen when they come which they surely will when they smell the trade but laurore is in good hands in your absence your premier has behaved himself well and in any case her tasking is simple seaward picket duty i had hoped yes oh and one more thing popham leaned forward and lowered his voice it would oblige me greatly should you keep me in touch with whats going on among our army colleagues not that i dont trust em but they have odd ways and id rather not be surprised if you take my meaning kydd bristled in all fairness dasher i think ive done my part can you not find another to no youre the only one of my captains experienced with the lobsterbacks and besides this is but an extension of your current situation which will last only until our reinforcements arrive in a few weeks kydd paused it was a necessary and responsible post certainly but not best suited to his temperament yet if looked at in the light of his career as a whole kydd had to concede it was a not unwelcome development a spell ashore as port captain was often a necessary prelude to active flag rank in order to demonstrate organisational ability further if laurore was indeed to be kept crisscrossing the vast estuary it wasnt as if he was missing any action it settled his mind an office staff you shall have my written order this day raise what you need against it and do remember a healthy and profitable trade is what is most calculated to rally the people to our cause he clapped kydd on the shoulder turned and left quickly the din resumed but kydds mind was engaged the first priority was to register an account of every marine resource from the total length of alongside berths to docking facilities slipways shipbuilding and repair then to establish procedures for customs clearance legal quays and all the apparatus of port control together with the outer services such as pilots and surveyors a form of coastguard and revenue service would be needed but was that within his remit and they said this was where id find you kydd looked round in surprise why nicholas what are you doing here is it so strange old fellow to witness a confidential secretary bearing ships papers to his captain i know you too well nicholas youre curious you want to see the ethnicals of south america and so i have renzi said with a grin in my short walk here look if we go to the roof of this stout fortress youll see they climbed a flight of stone steps and emerged on to a flat roof edged by parapets and populated by guns to gaze out over the city behold renzi exclaimed throwing out his arms the fort itself was modest in size compared to other buildings one side of it facing on to the large square with the great cathedral in one corner and all parts connected by colonnaded pathways and arcades on the far side there was an impressive multiarched building which renzi suggested was the seat of city government the cabildo closer to the high gateway they had gone through was apparently the entrance to the marketplace already with hopeful traders bringing in their produce but beyond the opposite wall was the river still a limitless expanse to the horizon a long stone mole extended out but at this state of tide no boat could reach it instead they came to a stop some way out and peculiar carts went to attend them narrow with a pair of immense wheels that served to keep them clear of the thick mud they were drawn by listless pitifully thin horses they looked downwards on to a stretch of foreshore and saw washerwomen at grassy pits working vigorously with wooden mallets completely oblivious to the great happenings about them further along seabirds wheeled in noisy clouds shrieking as pieces of fish offal were thrown into the water and out in the bay dozens of small ships lay at anchor waiting for the situation to resolve a certain fragrance dont you think the air was thick with competing odours the fish a suggestion of the grasses of the pampas and the usual exotic cooking smells of a foreign land yes as may be did you hear im to be port captain no i didnt then we shall be deprived of your presence on our good ship the next few weeks or so until the reinforcements arrive im told something passed across renzis face and kydd added nicholas you never thought wed do it did you doubted that wed win over such odds as we saw that pophams plan was nonsense isnt that so renzi shook his head and looked at him gravely dear fellow its more that i have misgivings not to say a sense of foreboding i cant say it more precisely but it was all too easy so like our success at cape town but this continent is strange ominous in its differences in a way africa never was ha youve grown qualmish old trout weve made a conquest and mean to keep it as simple as that just so you havent heard from our mr serrano at all renzi asked with concern chapter serrano knew it was fearfully dangerous not to say utter madness to return to the place he had fled hunted by the authorities and in peril of recognition now when they were alerted by the british fleet off their shores it needed only one to betray him and he fought down his emotions and a flood of patriotism returned as he waved a proud farewell to his english friend renzi in the boat he was on a mission to bring about the conjoining of the forces that would result in independence for his country it might even be that future generations would see his name emblazoned in the history books first things first he must make haste into the anonymous countryside and procure a horse to take him to los patriotas at las piedras was the venerable and wise don baltasar still the leader or was it now the fiery and impulsive deputy manuel bustamente he prayed it was so for hed been told of the rash actions of the man at the abortive affair at juanico which had led to serranos exile he had a plan a fellow student at the university martin miguel de guemes as ardent as he himself for freedom had been placed by his father as an ensign of cavalry and stationed at montevideo his family was respected and he was trusted by the patriots the next morning his confidence rose after he had successfully bargained for a horse for himself from an estancia it was a rangy cob which he soon had galloping towards the garrison town he was familiar with the place and took modest lodgings not far from the fort a passing soldier knew guemes and promised to deliver a note to him that evening he heard a discreet knock at the door there was a whispered exchange and then after all that had happened he was looking at the finely drawn features of his friend come in mi querido amigo its been so long the door was shut quickly and they embraced what are you doing here vicente if they catch you again not now martin theres more at stake this night than you can possibly conceive how is this old friend guemes asked we must say my life is in your hands from this moment im on a mission that is of the gravest importance to our future tell me does don baltasar still lead i believe he does guemes said guardedly the blessed virgins name be praised i have a chance vicente do you swear to keep what i say in your heart and tell no one this is to do with the armada inglesa is it not it may be they are here to do a mischief to the viceroyalty thats plain and all are in a fever to know what they intend your presence here at the same time is no coincidence id wager it is not i return from exile by their hand but martin i have wonderful and terrible news he burst out the english are preparing an invasion they wish to set free the south american colonies as part of their grand war on spain and invite all those who desire liberation to join with them guemes stood still emotion working on his features ive been chosen to make contact with los patriotas to open communications im to bring don baltasar to their councils so that a rising might be timed to coincide with their descent on montevideo such that nothing the viceroy can do will stop us at first guemes did not speak then huskily he said you want me to take you to him of course who else amigo guemes slowly turned away you dont know what youre asking vicente yes that things have changed you must understand im no longer a student im an officer in the cavalry ive sworn my life to the king the enemy is massing at the gate and therefore my duty is clear if the patriots march against his majesty it is my burden and honour to fight them serrano caught his breath then the oaths we swore in our youth count as nothing even as we pledged to do all in our power to bring down the spanish overlords and raise up a great nation this is now to be cast aside as inconvenient that moment of destiny is now upon us how will history judge you that at this time you hang back reluctant to seek glory in the tide of war about to break that brings us our liberation he said with contempt neither spoke then guemes turned back and faced him i will have no part in any rising he held up his hand at serranos protest yet to keep faith with the cause i will take you to baltasar but not to join for i will then return to my post to fight the liberator to fight the enemy he gave a twisted grin which i fancy will not be so arduous im no veteran but five transports speak of no more than one or two thousand under arms against our five and more in the capital it would take a madman to think to challenge el virreinato del rio de la plata with such contemptible force he surveyed serrano briefly then said briskly so you have a horse good you will not wish to lose a moment so well ride hard through the night are you ready tired and sore but elated in the early hours of the morning serrano found himself in the barely furnished room of a country finca as far as he knew somewhere to the northeast in paraguay province guemes told him to remain there and rode off once more serrano lay on the floor pulled a small smelly rug around him for warmth and slept fitfully he was awakened by the thud of horses then the massed jingle of harness as they came to a halt a little later the door was flung open the larger than life figure of a gaucho stood there with a wicked grin not the shabby imitations seen on the streets of buenos aires but a free spirit of the open pampas his moustachioed face burned dark by the sun a wide flamboyant hat strung around his neck and large rowels on his boots en pie compadre he rasped serrano obeyed quickly scrambling to his feet a gaucho was not to be crossed a large knife the facon tucked familiarly in the sash was his only eating instrument but was just as easily the means of settling personal differences the man crossed to him spun him around and blindfolded him with a red bandanna muevase he was jerked forward led stumbling to a horse and helped into the saddle they cantered off the horse picking its way the ground seemed to get rough its stride interrupted more than once at one point it jibbed and he lost his grip sliding down one side and painfully into a cactus harsh laughter broke out at his predicament and he was left to remount by himself at length serrano smelt cooking fires and heard voices they slowed to a halt desmontad he dismounted and the bandanna was removed he saw he was in a straggling camp of many horsemen an imposing figure was coming towards him drawing himself up serrano asked gravely sir do i find myself addressing don baltasar hidalgo de terrada you do sir and you are vicente ignacio serrano de santiago vazquez y colon at your service i dont know you i was a messenger in the legion de voluntarios patricios at juanico serrano replied and martin miguel de guemes has spoken to me on your behalf you have my ear sir now what matter is so pressing that i must hear you he became aware that behind baltasar a thickset man with a chestlength black beard and extravagant ornamentation had appeared bustamente sir ive been in exile in south africa since juanico and why are you here then if africa is more to your fancy bustamente snapped difficult to understand in his hoarse voice serrano tried to ignore him and a meeting by chance the big man lunged forward caught him by his shirt and lifted him bodily i asked a question cerdito he snarled leave him manuel lets hear what he has to say baltasar said serrano patted himself down and continued i became friends with an english officer and learned they planned a strike against the spanish i took passage as an interpreter and once here i saw my chance to act the spy croaked bustamente with an evil glint no sir he took a deep breath to offer to them my services to bring the chief of los patriotas himself to a council of war to join an army of liberation the two men stared at him then bustamente roared with laughter holding his sides suddenly he stopped and fixed serrano with a cruel expression so you are a high delegate from the english fleet he thrust himself into serranos face theres only one trouble with that little man we already have one he laughed again then turned and bellowed bring barreda a tall individual dressed in black breeches and in a plain naval cocked hat was brought forward baltasar held up a restraining hand at bustamente and asked quietly senor barreda do you know this man looking at serrano distrustfully he said i cannot recollect ever having seen this individual no sir turning back bustamente said silkily this gentleman is from your shipoftheflag diadem sent by comodoro popham and he does not know you a cold wash of fear came over serrano it was the last thing he had expected and he knew that if his credentials were doubted they would assume he was a spy for the hated spanish authorities that is because i come from another ship the laurore of captain kydd you may send for confirmation naturally that wont be necessary baltasar said easily just be so good as to show us your papers you have some of course the cold inside turned into a knot of terror do show this gentleman yours if you please baltasar told barreda the papers were handed across they were undoubtedly genuine from the naval cipher to pophams signature he had possibly five seconds to save his life a way out suggested itself his very being revolted at the act but in the longer term what was the fate of one man against the cause he pretended to peruse them then looked up why these are perfect he declared so close to the genuine as would fool the commodore himself barreda goggled at him as baltasar snapped explain very simple no military commander would put his delegate at risk by having him carry papers on his person and even worse would never compromise his own position to the extent of personally signing an admission of subversion he sighed and handed the papers back to the thunderstruck barreda avoiding his eye and he must explain also why he had the complete confidence to pass through spanishheld territory so easily unless baltasar eased into a tight smile you are vouched for by guemes this by clever papers the smile vanished take him away he rapped at bustamente and find out what he knows serrano fought back a tremor as baltasar asked softly now sir what is it that you have to tell me a tearing shriek came from the corral then another well sir the british fleet lies at anchor off maldonado it will shortly set sail to fall on montevideo his voice had become unsteady at the inhuman sounds coming from the corral this we know er they are anxious that los patriotas are not denied their just share of glory in the wresting of this country from the spanish you mean they want us to assist them they are saying that the spanish cannot withstand a simultaneous assault by land and sea there was a last ragged squeal from the corral and then silence they do respectfully request a councilofwar with yourself baltasar eyed serrano thoughtfully the idea has merit but theres much to be settled first what guarantee have i that this is not a trap sir i signal with my red flag from the shore and a boat will be sent to convey you to the commodore you will see this and there can be no spanish trap aboard a royal navy ship the older man gave a tight smile you have much to learn in wars of the people senorito vicente for instance who is to command what is to stop the ingles general placing our glorious cavalry before his to take the casualties in place of his own and if we suffer reverses and the campaign is long who will supply us pay the fighters arm our men these things you may discuss with the commodore sir not so fast young man when we face the english it will be with our demands clear our decisions made for instance what is the status of prisoners taken if this is a war of liberation then they will be in a very different situation from your usual prisonerofwar do you not wish to be avenged on them for your exile sir time is short i heard the officers on board the ship complaining that supplies are limited and the sooner they are landed the better quite but there are other matters to settle which because they bear on the whole can be agreed upon only by the full council of the sociedad patriotica be tranquil compadre i shall summon a meeting a conclave met that very night from far and near men of legend were called to bring their wisdom and authority to the congress riding in with wild speed and elan as the true gauchos they were they sat together around the fire tales of derringdo echoing into the night until at last they could be prevailed on to debate the matters in hand they exuberantly entered into discussion which then turned to argument beside himself with despair serrano could only wait for the interminable toandfro to end there was much to talk about to ally themselves with an almost unknown foreign power would need careful consideration and they were not about to rush into this the arguments raged on through the night into the next day and the next night then as a cold morning broke came the grand spectacle of half a thousand gaucho warriors on the move riding to the sea for the fiftieth time serrano felt for his red flag pray god that the boat was quick then it was the last rise before puerto del ingles and the sea at the summit he looked out over the glittering sea but with something approaching terror he saw that it was quite empty there was not a ship to be seen chapter general beresford raised his glass gentlemen do join me if you will to audacity and its just rewards the toast was noisily acclaimed and bibulous shouts rose above the hubbub from the assembled officers stand up a speech at the other end of the hastily improvised table popham took his cue and rose to a storm of applause gentlemen my fellow warriors i can confidently say that in the long history of our nation there are few deeds of military daring that can stand with what we have accomplished so rapidly and so efficiently he paused to let the exuberant shouts of agreement subside we have achieved nothing less than the taking of buenos aires in a lightning thrust that has sent the spanish viceroy fleeing and which has turned over this great city to his majestys protection a city which i may remind you of some forty thousand and if you count the province of which it is the capital as a whole then some six million more than the entire people of england it is at the end of the silver trail from the potosi mines and has a prodigious population hungering for the products of english mills ready to pay for them with the bounty of this immense region a hush descended as the enormity of the achievement sank in kydd flushed with wine could only shake his head in wonder at the whole thing where was history leading now what lay in their future popham continued in full flow and let me speak plain this is our doing and ours alone sixteen hundred to achieve what takes napoleon two hundred thousand and with britain an impossible seven and a half thousand nautical miles distant theres been none to help in the planning the support the execution weve seized the moment and been proved right all we have to do now is stay where we are keeping our position secure for another few weeks while we await the reinforcements and then return to our loved ones victorious and feted by a grateful nation there was an ovation but now strangely restrained as if each man was struck in awe of the occasion or troubled by their sudden elevation from puny expedition to masters of the land beresfords face had turned sober and grave and kydd felt for him the lieutenant governor of a piece of empire that no one knew existed and without a single order or authority to stand behind any of his decrees in the morning the wonder of their achievement was still with kydd but there was work to do he was found an office on the upper floor of the fort small but well situated near the steps that led down to the main floor and importantly up to the roof for he had plans to erect a small signal mast there outside at ten there was much saluting and crashing of arms as a deputation arrived kydd peered down from his window and saw a religious procession wending its way towards the higharched entrance below he was able to keep to his office while beresford dealt with them but later there was no escaping the cabildo the governing council of the city these were dignified spaniards of another age richly dressed in ruffled shirts and elaborately groomed rigid with formality and barely concealed hostility they filed into the biggest room beresford could find one that his new interpreter revealed was the real audiencia where the viceroy would receive his petitioners the harassed general listened courteously to their longwinded address and when it became clear they wanted assurances on the future he patiently outlined a programme of peace the upholding of local authority and above all a new era of libre comercio the blessings of free trade this caused the first stirring among them and beresford went on to affirm the undoubted advantages and profit to be gained from their city being flung open to commerce with the rest of the world for some reason it caused mutters and frowns a little baffled beresford asked the port captain to set out some of the working details for them kydd picked up on his request these men wanted to know how the system was to be run whether it would be truly open or an elaborate front behind which arrangements were to be made it was not so difficult to explain for he had seen that the methods that had proved so successful in cape town could be applied here the waterfront with its freely accessible warehousing inward and outward this of course with the necessary side advantage that all was visible to his officials no enemy contraband possible and duties a mere pittance but at the same time rigidly enforced to cover harbour maintenance with no other charges incurred in order to be cleared for the open sea a recipe for commercial success if ever there was one there was grudging acknowledgement and they left among a flurry of stiff bowing a sour lot beresford ruminated but theyll get over it in time towards evening there was a much more agreeable prospect instead of army campaign beds in the fort the officers were to be billeted close by youre with a senor rodriguez kydd was informed by the adjutant a merchant of means who speaks english the man was waiting for him on the steps of a very fine stone house in the grand san benito street ah capitan keed you are expected sir do enter your baggage it follows the house had a balcony with ornate latticework inside kydd noted the heavy dark furniture and curious rugs of some kind of animal skin this is my wife dona corazon a petite darkeyed woman in silk with a profusion of lace and long black hair curtsied shyly to kydd accompanied by an indian maid in formal attire she showed him to his room and then led him back to the sitting room jerez enquired his host er yes thank you sir kydd guessed that he had been offered sherry we favour manzanillas from around the port of sanlucar de barrameda would you kydd picked up on the casual namedropping realised that any wine from faroff spain would cost a great deal and therefore allowed himself well impressed when it arrived he was surprised to discover it had a light and fresh yet almost saline quality he would surprise renzi with it one day most acceptable mr rodriguez he said warmly after a short interval dinner was declared rodriguez apologetic that evening meals were much lighter than at midday tonight it would be cabrito as the roast kid was expertly carved by his host and a platter of papas alhorno golden potatoes arrived kydd felt at a loss how could he make conversation with a man whose country his own had so recently conquered but on the other hand he realised he would not have been taken in to lodge unless there were certain sympathies how goes your business sir he asked mildly as you would expect in the circumstances we do intend to make buenos aires a free port thees we hear oddly there was no gushing enthusiasm and you will take advantage of it kydd encouraged possibly baffled kydd decided to leave it for the moment do you find buenos aires very different from spain he ventured shortly tucking into the delicious dessert dulce de leche that rodriguez had described as milk jam i was born here as my father and his father before a criollo i am he he added my advice capitan the people here are not as in england one race one speaking there are so many by the end of the evening kydd had the picture the local born criollos were despised by the spanishborn peninsulares who dominated the upper reaches of society and government and in return were restive under a rule that gave them little power even though they were the economic driving force then there were the arribenos those born in the vast interior with little understanding of the world outside and indians both native and of mixed race together with a bewildering spectrum of others there were slaves country gauchos peons and any number of foreigners who had decided to make this their home and cutting across all was a divide on one side the loyalists who stood with spain and the old ways and on the other the patriots who strove to free themselves to achieve independence and will they succeed do you think kydd asked carefully only a little a very little and the city will explode then god help us all rodriguez said fervently over the next few days the city settled to a strained quiet beresfords proclamations were received without murmur the first a restating that the supremacy of the roman catholic church would remain unchallenged and untouched closely followed by a state opening of the cabildo and the installing of the previous alcalde de primer voto to officiate from his same chair bullfighting at the retiro would continue currency reform and the judiciary could wait the most vital matter was the opening of the port to free trade kydd found his time taken up with explaining over and over that this was no byzantine ploy to entrap traders into incurring punitive fees later but when a few nervous shippers began loading and sailing others started to come forward passing vessels with no knowledge that the port had changed hands were agreeably surprised to be welcomed in and from the roof of the fort kydd could take satisfaction in looking out at a fair number of sails moored in the river plate goods being lightered to and fro and the sight unique in his experience of a major port of the strange highwheeled carts wending their way out across the mudflats to the flat boats renzi his curiosity satisfied preferred to stay with the ship no doubt in a fever of creativity with his novel but from time to time various laurores were sent as relief kydd was in a conference when a subaltern of the light dragoons galloped into the square and demanded to be taken instantly to general beresford sir the young man declared as he was shown into the room captain arbuthnot is in need of escort why so sir on account we caught up with the viceroys treasure and having relieved em of it the captains on his way back hes now encumbered with fourteen mulecarts of bullion the meeting broke up in a buzz of astonishment beresford snapped orders detaching part of the garrison then growled and now well have every goldcrazy lunatic in buenos aires about our ears until were rid of it it made an incredible sight winding into the square an endless file of carts accompanied on each side by troops of soldiers a gathering crowd was held at bay while the treasure was transferred into the forts strongroom in the evening word came through a first count had the amount in the sum of an incredible halfmillion pieces of eight as well as gold and silver bars more than a score boxes of doubloons and at least a hundred pouches of coins three thousand clinking in each together with what had also been discovered hidden in the city treasury they were now in possession of considerably more than a million spanish dollars the dragoons royally entertained that evening told of how viceroy sobramonte disbelieving that the british would chase him so far into the interior had panicked dropping everything he had fled towards distant cordoba leaving his party to throw the treasure down wells it had been a tense day or two in the recovery for roving bands had come down to dispute it but discipline and haste had won the day needing to report kydd went to see popham in his flagship off maldonado a prime catch the commodore purred as will warm the cockles of every man in the fleet if its not deemed droits of the crown kydd said uneasy at what others might see as naked plunder it wont be we did main well in the article of guns dasher eightysix pieces of artillery and five hundredodd barrels of powder found in the arsenal not to mention some hundred or so stand of muskets very good indeed i would like to think that at last things are going our way he extracted a sheet from out of a neat stack of papers before him do look at this old fellow and tell me your opinion kydd read to the mayor and corporation of manchester i consider it a duty to the commercial interest of great britain that the conquest of this place opens an extensive channel for your manufactures hitherto the trade of this country has been cramped beyond belief and the manufactures could only find their way to this rich province by neutral bottoms and contraband intrigues from this moment its trade will be thrown open if that doesnt set them in a tizzy of speculation as to whos to be here first then im a dutchman popham added kydd was impressed it was a direct call to the northern industries that a market of immense size was suddenly open to them with premium prices going to the first to satisfy the hunger for manufactured goods the river plate should very soon be thronged with enterprising merchantmen and our reinforcements it was critical that these were not delayed for it would not be long before the spanish in the north heard about the catastrophe and stretched as the british were there could be only one result in st helena i sent dispatches to england with our intentions and now by fast frigate i shall tell them of our victory against the odds this news will be accompanied by freight to the value of a million silver dollars to delight the crowd do you not think then that the admiralty would wish to safeguard the nations hope kydd came to the alert instantly any frigate captain fortunate enough to return with news of a famous victory and treasure to prove it would be the talk of the hour not to mention the considerable fee he would earn by right for carrying specie er have you given thought to who oh well it will have to depart very soon of course popham said airily ive dispatches to complete and general beresford pleads for much in the way of army stores and supplies id think narcissus would answer she being newvictualled for sea kydd kept his thoughts to himself was popham taking the opportunity to rid himself of donnelly a senior captain and outspoken critic of his handling of the expedition and of course as a heavy frigate shes of limited value in these shoal waters popham finished smiling briefly he enquired so how is our port captain taking to his responsibilities does all march well on the waterfront no sir his adjutant was polite but firm and beresford had no choice but to hear him out since your proclamation went out six days ago there have been but sixtyfive citizens sworn so few the general said incredulously sir this was perplexing of the tens of thousands of inhabitants only a tiny handful had come to pledge allegiance to the crown did this suggest that the people had no sense of relief at having thrown off the yoke of spanish rule or had it deeper significance to do with the king of great britain also being defender of the faith but not the old one should we perhaps follow it up with some form of coercion loss of citizens rights that sort of thing do you think the officer spoke carefully sir your words to the deputation of patricios were im persuaded not best calculated to settle their fears they asked for an undertaking that we would defend them against a spanish counterattack and you i know what i said damn it they wanted me to guarantee their security against all and every motion of the enemy this is militarily impossible and i cannot sacrifice my honour to a false promise sir yes sir the officer said patiently but it were better you didnt say so in so many words the implication now is that if it suits us tactically to withdraw from the city before the spanish return in force they will be subject to reprisal for collaborating with us and your spaniard is well known to be cruel in vengeance im not pledging my word to an absurdity besides any undertaking assumed by the crown is a grave responsibility which is always to be taken seriously i cannot possibly bind any future military commander to such terms i understand sir now we must buckle down to the matter in hand supplies were settled in and need to find our own forage instead of relying on the ships this is always a necessary business and i want it in hand as soon as possible who knows what the future might bring hey yes sir to another matter we have our fifteenth desertion reported by colonel pack and more it does seem to be the same class of man sir irish they find the same religion and opportunities here not to be countenanced in ireland and we suspect theyre being lured away by the spanish women deserters will meet the same penalty as they would on home station harder this is in the face of the enemy enemy sir the officer asked innocently chapter with rising emotion serrano paused in the darkness of the doorway exhausted and famished mi flor mi bella flor he called out rafaela opened the door and squealed with delight throwing her arms around his neck she kissed him with a passion that melted his terror and confusion alma mia mi corazon she sobbed caressing his matted hair once inside she held him at arms length then her hands dropped and she slapped his face hijo de perra where did you go that you left me with no word of what you were going to do i worried that the partidarios leales had betrayed you and i lied to everyone that serrano shook his head and pulled her close breathing her fragrance rafaela mi angel then he stood back and declared i was betrayed carino who not by the loyalists or the patriots but by the british the british she said incredulously what have you to do with them in my exile in cape town i heard from their officers that they were to fall on the spanish here and i hid in one of their boats it all came tumbling out and hot tears of anger pricked as he told of the cunning and alltoobelievable secretary who had wormed his way into his confidences by pretending to learn spanish before setting him up to lead the patriots away from montevideo probably to distract the spanish eastwards while they made their move on buenos aires they told me it was a mission of glory to bring the forces of great britain and los patriotas to a triumphal destiny of liberation instead i was used as a common tonto to deceive and blind in a rush of feeling he described his devastation at don baltasars side when they had looked out over an empty sea only by quick thinking saying that the british would be returning to look for his signal did he escape being branded a spy leading them all to destruction that night i fled for my life feeling the hounds of hell at my back now i have both sides after my skin he said bitterly youre a fool vicente and i love you can you not see by running you have confirmed their suspicions and the spanish have proof of your sympathies with the independentistas youre in deep trouble my little cabbage she bit her lip does anyone know youre here did they see you enter this house do you think im stupid how do you think i made it this far no its dark i kept close to the wall and watched carefully until it was quiet good we must think what to do her brow furrowed then suddenly she tensed did you hear anything it sounded like the door flew open with a crash revealing a tall man with a cynical smile others behind him rafaela moved protectively in front of serrano who are you why do you enter my home like this the man gave a languid bow dona rafaela callejo a thousand apologies for the inconvenience but our business is with your friend he closed the door in the low candlelight the mans face was lined and cruel the black eyes piercing he circled them slowly his hand loosely on his poniard stopping he addressed serrano in a voice barely above a whisper it is entirely my decision whether you leave this room alive or no do you understand i demand to know who you are serrano said shakily for you that is of no concern the poniard leaped into his hand and he inspected its gleaming edge i come from don baltasar to clear up a few points that still vex him i didnt betray him it was british treachery they said they wanted to join with us overthrow the villainous spanish and and he never doubted that for one moment my little chicken then he knows you to be young and impulsive and foolish in the ways of the world what he wants to know is how ardent in the cause you still are liberty freedom on my soul i put them first in my life he must believe me and what of your friends the british i hate them i see you will be interested to know that the council has met and decided that in the furtherance of independence we must throw our entire force at the main enemy yes spain the tip of the poniard flicked out and came to rest at serranos throat not at all the man said silkily they are not the main enemy it is the one who tries to lure us into joining them to make conquest of the viceroyalty only to turn on us as it seeks to add this country to its swollen empire the british just so there will be no independence for us only a change of masters why do we not make use of them to throw out the spanish and then fool his lips curled in contempt by trickery and the unforgivable craven flight of viceroy sobramonte they were enabled to take a great city it is done they hold our capital and will never give it to us therefore we must take it against their mighty force in this emergency it has been decreed that nothing is too sacred to be sacrificed to this end los patriotas will join as brothers with the royalists the blandengues will be summoned and the gauchos armed all in the great cause to drive los imperialistas into the sea whence they came serrano caught his breath the blandengues were a centuriesold militia with roots deep in the frontier and gauchos as cavalry would be glorious but would it be enough this was either catastrophic folly or inspired who will be leader he asked carefully if baltasar don santiago de liniers at serranos incomprehension he added at montevideo he commands our only regular troops and is experienced in war it is he whom we allow to issue the orders serrano drew himself erect with rising exultation he knew now which was the true cause i wish to serve the poniard slid back into its sheath that is what don baltasar wants to hear very well you shall for there is a service that will silence your enemies for ever oh said serrano in sudden apprehension you shall return to your british friends with a tale then you will pass us all we want to know of the vermin a spy the man smiled captain kydd the aide looked distracted general beresford is calling an urgent meeting sir with relief kydd put down the tortured wording of a customs regulation then felt a stab of concern beresford was a good administrator and not one to disrupt his staff unduly with idle meetings they assembled in the usual room but beresford was not there minutes passed and they began to talk uneasily among themselves as far as anyone knew no spanish armies were massing no fleets sighted the summoning of all his commanders to meet together at this time was disturbing beresford strode into the room as if he was eager to plan a campaign but his expression was grave right gentlemen are we all here we have our uprising well enough but im sorry to say not in our support as expected a spanish counterattack i rather think not our informant tells us our spies the employment of spies and similar is beneath my honour sir and will not find service with me you will find in this city however parties who are quite without scruple in delating upon their countrymen now what i have learned this day is unsettling if not alarming where before we looked to the rebels to rise up with us against the spanish in the hope of independence now they have completely reversed their allegiance and are in amicable alliance with their old foes to go against us good god they stand to lose so much by going back to the old ways why is it with the golden prospect of free trade that they turn their backs on us ah the free trade weve all been trusting will be our shining gift i believe captain kydd has discovered something that throws a quite different light on our assumptions sir kydd nodded im billeted with a merchant and have the full griff what ive found out is that our talk of free trade is meaningless to them the merchants that is its true that before they were liable for the quinta real a royal tax of twenty per cent on all landed cargoes and that all freights must under penalty be carried in spanish bottoms naturally we assumed theyd jump at the chance of open trade under our protection particularly as all spanish ships were swept from the seas after trafalgar what we didnt count on was what they did in response to their situation the colony had great need o modern manufactures and such and as well the people were loud in their demands for foreign and luxury goods so much so that the government took fright and settled with the big merchant houses for a fat sum in bribery they promised not to notice discreet arrivals of shipping in a quiet bay set aside for it this grew into quite a sizeable arrangement with even foreign commercial agents invited to encourage their ships to call he chuckled who would have thought it a government setting up a smuggling operation against itself quite and the result prompted beresford why our notion of free trade is upsetting to a degree the grand businesses having paid big sums for the privilege of landing cargo are not to be welcoming a system that places them at an equal standing to any johnnycomelately and as well upsets their cosy relations with the nobs in government house no sir nothing would suit them more than that the spanish come back tomorrow beresford let it sink in around the table then said this means weve lost the support of most of the middling sort who cannot now be relied upon and the common people are being stirred up by hotheads who claim that the only way to wipe away the shame of forty thousand capitulating to two is by a grand rising against us but with what success i cannot say then what is the threat sir beresford looked up with a grim smile we chose to bypass montevideo to assault directly now we must pay for it a leader there has stood up and declared that with regular troops there being reinforced by irregulars in considerable numbers he will march on buenos aires there were shocked looks around the table after so little time an enemy had now become visible a menace that could only continue to grow and threaten i dont have to tell you that our choices are few indeed our prayer is of course that our expected reinforcements do arrive without delay therefore ive decided that to this end my strategy must be to keep the enemy confined to the north shore of the river plate which they term the banda oriental as of this moment captain kydd is relieved of all duties to attend to it the northern shore where the troops were concentrating was separated from the southern at the head where it joined a fortymile width of impassable marshes through which six tributary watercourses meandered slowly to become the river plate it was an effective enough impediment the only way the enemy could reach buenos aires was by sea and that was where they must be stopped to clear his head kydd mounted the stone steps to the parapets and open sky he looked out over the foreshore to the fretful greybrown expanse of sea all big ships and even the frigates were unable to sail up to administer a thundering barrage because of the impassable mudflats but more to the point he had not a ship of any kind that was his to command the foreshore was in its usual rowdy disorder sailors staggering out of grog shops others fighting and wafting above it all the odour of mud horses and putrid fish offal it was a foreign land in quite a different sense from cape town and he would be glad when he was free to sail away in his dear laurore but he had been given a duty to perform and he would do all he could to discharge it but it was a damn near impossible thing to ask to stop an entire army in its tracks how in heavens name could a sea officer accomplish such a feat he balled his fists helplessly what would nelson have done he would not have been disheartened find an enterprising action anything as long as it was positive after a few moments concentration he had the solution a miniature navy if the muddy shallows would defeat a proper one hed lay hands on everything under sail that could take the conditions and with them throw a blockade against the other shore resolved he clattered down the steps and bellowed for the duty masters mate to bring the charts it was possible at no point was the distance between the two shores narrower than thirty miles any sally by a heavily laden enemy would be spotted in time and he could quickly bring up his forces to dispute the crossing he gave a wry smile in many ways it was a smallscale version of the invasion threat to england the year before would there be a miniature trafalgar as well beresford approved the plan and detailed an adjutant to assist him for which he was grateful as a young lieutenant kydds first thought would have been to move fast to sweep the harbour clear of the right vessels and send them out immediately to face the enemy as a somewhat wiser postcaptain he was only too aware of the devil behind the details there was no question the navy did not have the necessary craft and therefore these would have to be found locally but were the citizens of buenos aires the enemy meaning he could simply take them as prize if they were of local registry it would amount to piracy if he seized vessels under the protection of the crown so they would have to be paid for but how and much more importantly under whose line of account then there was the problem of manning them enlist rebels and the disaffected not if they were reported to be turning on the british and letting loose a pressgang on the riffraff idling about the port was not practical for where a big ship could absorb the unwilling or unable in small craft every man must be relied on to pull his weight it had to be their own men therefore which brought all kinds of other problems it was not just that it would sap the already tiny numbers available to garrison the city in view of the seriousness of the situation the commodore would certainly authorise a manning from the big ships but that it would throw an unknown extra number on slender supplies that could no longer be guaranteed to the detriment of them all and other matters where were they to be quartered in ships crews stayed aboard there was no need for living spaces but these vessels would be little more than boats and unfit for extended habitation if they were to maintain lengthy patrols there was the question of clothing and victuals of a kind that could be readily stowed a dockyard of sorts with skilled hands for timely repairs a reliable source of water in a city that carried its own about in carts the complications went on and on general beresford was in a foul temper god rot his soul er who is that sir his aide enquired why this liniers in montevideo in course sent to me that he begs to attend his sick family here in buenos aires i grant him a passport and he spends his time creeping about noting down our strength and positions liniers sir an officer lost to honour and civilised conduct yes this is the scoundrel whos leading the insurrection out of montevideo a cunning fox im told and a frenchman been in the spanish service for twenty years but he fought us in the american war and knows his onions well need to keep good guard im persuaded colonel pack glowered from the other end of the table what sticks in m craw is those priests o yours you give em leave t range as they will and next thing the damn papists are topping it the spy i had little choice in the matter dennis they claim it their religion to take their ministration to the people and will not be denied should i forbid their free movement itll anger the populace and that is something neither you nor i wish so we i have a plan that should give you heart the people are restless and inquisitive of our small numbers i now propose to free the slaves on the grounds that as slavery is not countenanced in england neither is it here this will result in many thousands of grateful men who at the same time are unemployed you will offer the more ablebodied service in the army at the very least it will double if not triple our strength ah now thats a capital idea ive taken t dressing as a soldier any common servant on his rounds the odd sailor an such just t have em march about the place to impress when will i have em im to tell the cabildo tonight now im getting reports that upcountry horsemen are massing against us from this side to the northwest gauchos who are apparently splendid light cavalry as we have next to none its of grave importance that they are prevented from joining up with liniers ive pickets out on that side of the city but i dont fear any assault unless liniers gets to em for a moment his eyes glazed and he muttered these damned reinforcements cannot come fast enough for me then he stiffened and snapped captain how are our sea defences proceeding kydd tried to give a confident smile sir should you come with me up to the lookout youll get a sight of our progress then i shall gentlemen let us remove to the upper regions the same prospect of muddy grey sea looked increasingly morose under a threatening low winter sky small clusters of merchant ships were moored together further out and at the far distant dark grey horizon two specks of white spaced far apart ive named em staunch and protector kydd enthused on patrol already at the far side of the ortiz bank and here he indicated the mole below the fort where four other craft were in varying stages of fitting out there are more in all seven armed vessels they look very small captain beresford said doubtfully eyeing the halfdecked twomasted craft and the men swarming over them sixty feet long sir this is accounted sizeable in these waters any bigger and theyd take the mud and we need em to go into every creek and bay without fear this was the local sumaca nearly flatbottomed and with a gaff main square sail on the fore and headsails aplenty often to be seen about the province carrying local cargo how are they armed carronades kydd answered immediately this gave them a great advantage in firepower but only if they could close with the enemy and these were boat carronades only not the formidable weapons of a frigate in the closequarter scuffles to be expected in lonely bays it would be cutlasses and pistols that must settle the day and how deployed general liniers will not want to take boat from montevideo as this is a long voyage and leaves him exposed to our cruisers hell stay on that side and march to the only other port o consequence colonia which is opposite us thirty miles and wait his opportunity to cross which in course well deny him i asked how deployed two on watch off colonia two at large off the coast one on passage to relieve two under replenishment and repair umm so theyll live on board yes sir there was no need for details it would be the hardest of conditions but these were all volunteers and hed been insistent on extra foulweather clothing a double rum ration and precooked meat the best he could do for them jack tars jaunty spirit had known worse and your captains are you confident that theyre selected by me personally general and bear my complete confidence there had been no shortage of bored junior officers in the larger ships who were eager for action and popham had had to decide whether or not he should weaken their sea defences against a return of the spanish navy from the north very well ill be sleeping a little better for your efforts captain thank you back in his office kydd held his head in his hands so much depended on him one thought hammered in was there anything else that could be done the strategics were straightforward but stopping liniers crossing now had added urgency with the reports of gauchos gathering on this side if they managed to join together it would be a short time only before they must be overwhelmed or sent running like rabbits from their newwon piece of empire where were their damned reinforcements then there was the threat of winter weather if a dreaded pampero struck it would decimate his little fleet the only comfort being that the enemy would suffer likewise yet there was no alternative they had to keep the sea whatever the cost he picked up a halfcompleted provisioning list irritated by the task despite the increasing threat it seemed he had to find time to attend to pettifogging details like this the army was given forage money if not supplied in the field the navy received no such allowance because it was assumed that the men would be properly victualled in their ship the contrived solution was complicated the seamen would be borne on the garrison books but the army quartermaster would be reimbursed by individual pursers even though the ships muster rolls would show the men present on board obliging the purser to seek compensation from the admiralty directly he ground his teeth and set to authorising the insanity sir the masters mate approached hesitantly well kydd gave an illnatured grunt ltenant garrick dolores sir hes below wishes to report theres two sizeable enemy menowar just been sighted opposite chapter kydd was out of his chair and down to the entrance room in a flash garrick scrambled to his feet and took off his hat sir er pursuant to your be damned to it what did you see he demanded two shipsloops enter colonia this changed everything three masted squareriggers often termed minor frigates were a dismaying menace to his little navy and obviously brought up for the job of securing the vital crossing where theyd come from and how they were handling the shoal water was another matter for now he snatched up his boatcloak from behind the door im going to take a look he threw at the duty masters mate then turned on garrick lets be having you sir the two hurried down to the mole where dolores lay alongside rotated to face seaward kydd grabbed a stay and leaped lightly on to its humble deck closely followed by garrick who quickly gave orders to cast off i do apologise sir he said as sailors in pairs got to work with long quant poles in the mud heaving off the ungainly flatbottomed vessel their departure would obviously not be in crisp naval fashion only after reaching open water could they set the gaff main and headsails and later a square fore to begin a workmanlike clawing to seaward in the rattling easterly standing out of the way on the small afterdeck kydd glanced back at the receding coastline utterly flat as far as the eye could see the buildings of the city the only objects in a vertical dimension not a single mountain or cliff to relieve the monotonous level however with the wind in his teeth and the willing surge of motion kydds heart swelled he was at sea once more dolores picked up speed kydd could see why this workhorse with her exaggerated beam and generous sail area was relied on to ply these waters but squinting astern at a mark he noted the dismaying amount of leeway she was making with the wind abeam the seaman at the long tiller which was comfortably wedged into his thigh chewed contentedly on his quid of tobacco with the customary glassy stare forward of his tribe when under the gaze of an officer suddenly restless kydd snapped put us about quickly mr garrick i need to see how she handles before we go in the sails heavy and tanned ochre with a peculiarly rancidsmelling mixture were difficult to handle but he could appreciate that they would take substantial squalls without fear they went about without fuss but there would be no sharp manoeuvring in dolores the tiller had needed two men to throw against the pressure of the turn but the tacks and sheets were easily handled by the other three kydd gave orders to take up on the original course and waited until they had settled to speed then went across and relieved the startled seaman at his tiller he adopted the same pose leaning against it feeling the thrum and life as they foamed along it was correctly balanced a little to weather and he brought the vessel more by the wind feeling its direction with his cheeks as he experimentally luffed and touched much as he had as quartermaster in seaflower long years ago in the caribbean kydd found dolores surprisingly agreeable to closehauling probably due to the big headsails he reasoned satisfied he gave up the tiller and paced forward an anxious garrick close behind her armament a twelvepounder carronade on the foredeck and swivels each side of the afterdeck was enough to dominate in an action between equals but near hopeless if they were ranged against shipsloops which could muster a full broadside of sixpounders it was a measure of how close colonia del sacramento was that they raised the opposite shore soon after midday the sharpeyed garrick spotted staunch further in with the coast well join her if you please kydd said his thoughts raced if these did prove to be sloops what the devil was he to do even concentrating his entire force of seven he could not be expected to prevail against them but sending to popham for heavier metal would take time and risk stranding his vessels in this damnable maze of shoals that was the rio de la plata leaving the sloops alone was not in question for in the crossing they had only to lay off each side of the transports to crush with broadsides any foolish enough to contest their passage what was puzzling was that vessels of such size were sailing with impunity among the banks and shoals it was a mystery demanding close reconnaissance they reached staunch which jauntily dipped her ensign on seeing kydd were taking a look at your shipsloops he hailed the waters very shoal hereabouts selby her captain came back anxiously must be certain of the channels those devils damn well know what theyre about kydd had made plenty of allowance for leeway in coming over and they were upwind of colonia by some miles having only to bear away before the wind and past a few headlands to reach the hooked point that was the ports shelter the chart little more than a crude sketch in spanish gave scant help scrupulous in showing the positions of churches inland and giving names to every one of the scatter of offshore islands but not mentioning the presence of subsea reefs or deepwater channels the hook in the coastline gave kydd his clue in its lee was colonia but more importantly it then trended sharply away northward there would be tidal scour around it as the waters scurried past to make the wider bay and where there was scour there would be deeper water he looked up well take it close as we can bear away if you please with staunch in their wake they closed with the land it resolved into a partly wooded area with long strips of pale beach and little sign of habitation but he had been right the seaman forward with the hand lead was reporting steadily deeper soundings this was how the pair had reached colonia the town was ahead kydd had little information to go on other than that it was yet another ancient portuguese colony that had passed into spanish hands he had no idea how formidable it was still less of their likely reception so close after more curving beaches and nondescript woods the first signs of settlement appeared caught to seaward of them wary fishermen stood motionless in their punts while they passed dolores was fast coming up to the last foreland before colonia pale buildings and the incongruous end of an avenue were spotted but then came the thud of a gun and smoke driven downwind from an unnoticed little fort at the waters edge another the alarm had now been given were they small enough targets they barrelled along the last few hundred yards and passed the point there two ships at anchor off the small harbour the red and yellow of spanish climbing to the mastheads their design took after the french corvettes that were causing mayhem in the channel these vessels were smaller but he could see the menacing line of sixpounder gunports on each side a swarm of little craft encircled them kydd quickly took in other details an exaggerated beam and turn of bilge meant shallower draught baldheaded with sail only to topsails they would not be speedy on a wind but with low tophamper were well suited to these conditions he looked more sharply at the further one closer inshore it had no sails bent on the yards and had a definite heel it was resting on the mud careening he could see the telltale gleam of white among the weed on the hull the same preservative used in the royal navy before the use of copper had become widespread with these two as the nucleus of a crossing force it was all too clear he hadnt a chance his ambition for a classic blockade leaving liniers and his growing army impotent at the shore was now in ruins and they could cross with impunity when they were ready where the devil had they come from how had they got past pophams patrols and what was he proposing to do about it he felt garricks eyes on him while he tried to think they were completely outclassed and the reasonable conclusion was that it would be nothing but a waste of lives to throw his little fleet at them yet to give up without trying to run from the scene was intolerable if only laurore were here to set about them like a terrier after rats it was a stalemate the best he could do sail dropped from the foreyard in the nearer sloop then jibs and courses blossomed it was putting to sea and its quarry had to be the insolent sumacas flaunting the british ensign kydd hesitated hed seen what hed needed to see and the sensible thing was to return and confess this grave turn of events to general beresford over on the sloop its focsle party finished the anchor cable was buoyed and slipped and the yards were bracing round for a lunge to sea he hailed staunch through cupped hands return to buenos aires independently we go back he told garrick their passage had taken them well past colonia and on into the bay beyond beating back against the easterly the way they had come was unwise under chase in these waters over to larboard a mile or so off lay one of the islands low and thickly wooded take us around it and then direct home kydd ordered as an afterthought he added post a couple of men in the bows for i mean to make it uncomfortable for our friend to follow after his service around guernsey he knew what to look for in shoal waters the arrowed ripples out of synchrony wavelets the dark of seaweed beneath the surface as well he posted two men to lie flat on deck in the eyes of the craft staring down into the water for the ghostly shadow of reefs or banks looming he shielded his gaze to take in the lie of the island it was often possible to note a backbone of rock stretching out into the sea that would later be a jagged underwater spine extending out and indeed there was one pointing like an accusing finger back at colonia two points to starboard leave it well clear he glanced back at the sloop it was making remarkably good sailing before the wind its plain broad sailplan working well in this northeasterly north the wind was backing what did this mean in these unholy waters a faster return certainly and once around the island theyd take advantage of their foreandaft rig to cosy up to the wind and leave the shipsloop standing it would almost certainly be satisfied with seeing them off and let them go for the moment it was half a mile or so in their wake but when they began passing the island it gave no sign of breaking off the chase it made no difference because the double yell from forward came too late with a sharp wooden thump and squeal of outraged timbers the sumaca reared up and ceased forward motion sent sprawling kydd picked himself up get sail off her move yourselves he bellowed hoarsely the craft had mercifully slewed round spilling the wind if it had gone the other way they would have been a dismasted wreck by now kydd looked over the side in the turbid water he saw the line of a ledge below the surface at rightangles and as abrupt as if it had been built that way no wonder the sloop had let them crowd on sail garrick scrabbled up the canted deck nursing an arm tides on the make sir if we could kydd looked sourly at the oncoming enemy theres no time if youve any signals papers get em ditched now their nemesis hove to well clear and quickly had two boats in the water pulling strongly towards them when they found that not only had they a prize but also made prisoner a senior officer of the royal navy there would be no end to the crowing it was hard to take be damned to it im not fr a spanish chokey one of the seamen shouted and leaped into the sea forward quickly followed by another it was foolish for they would soon be picked up by the boats and then kydd saw they had found firm ground under them and were now standing in water no more than chest deep kydd looked at garrick to the island i think they scrambled for the bow and lowered themselves in trying to ignore the cold and wet kydd waved them forward to the island he thrust ahead feeling ironhard sand beneath powering towards the island a good three hundred yards off the others followed in a straggling line snatching a glance behind he saw both boats making straight for them and redoubled his efforts panting hard stumbling at occasional hidden rocks the seabed began rising and the last hundred yards were done in a stumbling run suddenly they were among a scatter of lightgrey rocks in the sand and then into low woods spiky branches whipping across their faces until they stood gulping and wheezing together in a clearing theys more interested in the dollars one seaman said originally the sailors had called nuestra senora de dolores our lady of the dollars but the spanish now swarming over her would find little to plunder and then they would come after her crew i cn see staunch a sailor shouted pointing through a gap in the trees to the sea the other side of the island spontaneously they broke into a stumbling run crashing through the undergrowth and low branches until they emerged on to a rockstudded beach where they waved and shouted she sailed on and their hopes faded theyre not keepin a lookout the shonky bastards but then the two masts started to come together as she began to put back they were returning to pick them up god bless em every one see if the dons are after us yet kydd told a seaman pointing back the way theyd come the man loped off but returned quickly boat on its way he panted too many on em they were completely unarmed and must surrender to any with a weapon and staunch was still some way off into the water kydd barked urgently and waded into the sea on the weather side the waves were several feet high slamming and jostling against him the seabed under his feet was much less even with rocks and crevices that twice nearly had him sprawling fulllength from the splashes and cursing behind him he knew it was slowing the others too the sea bottom grew steeper and before they had gone out a hundred yards the water was to his armpits and he was being carried off his feet by the surging waves they could go no further ahead staunch was cautiously slowing but she was way out of reach suddenly to the right there was the smack and plume of a bullet another whipped over to strike between kydd and staunch he swung around on the beach the spanish were running down to take aim at the waters edge he turned back to staunch and saw that a boat had been launched but with only one aboard then he understood they were streaming the boat downwind to them at the end of a long line the meaty thump of a ball in flesh and an agonised cry came from nearby as kydd pressed on it had been a lucky shot it would have been impossible to take accurate aim at this distance after a fast run the boat was coming quicker nearer and nearer and then within reach he grabbed at the gunwale and hung there urging others in seeing them tumbling over each other and roughly heaving in the wounded seaman the remaining men hung on where they could and at his signal the boat was hauled bodily through the water to the waiting staunch well done ltenant kydd gasped gratefully accepting the stout oilskin pressed on him a pity about dolores he broke off as selby bawled orders to get under way then he stopped as a thought came and stayed to blossom into a beautiful glorious possibility the sloop had stopped to take possession of dolores it had men away on the island and was otherwise occupied what if ltenant i desire you to make best speed to the barky not ours the one hove over for careening a broad grin appeared on the officers face the sloop might be grounded but there would be depth of water for a sumaca er weve only the carronade he said apologetically it would take hours of bombardment to reduce a warship with it but kydd had other ideas no not that fetch me all the combustibles you can find we set her afire by the time they had reached a line of sight from the first sloop they were well on their way but had minutes only to accomplish their mission as they approached it must have become obvious what they were about but kydd was leaving nothing to chance they came in on the immovable vessels bow where its guns could not bear then lay off at the first crash from the stumpy carronade the few men left aboard emerged and hastily tumbled into boats for the shore go kydd roared himself taking position at the blunt prow of staunch with two others a quick look told him that the other sloop had spotted them and was making to return but in her square rig she was hard up against the wind yet it was still only minutes they had skilfully the two ships were brought at an angle nose to nose and kydd reached out to clutch the martingale swinging a leg up and then levering himself atop the naked bowsprit to slither into the plain foredeck the bare decks were deserted and awkwardly canted over but he knew where to go passing hand to hand he found the forehatchway and went down casting about in the gloom behind him he heard the footsteps of his men one made salty comment on the alien smell all ships were much the same between decks and kydd quickly found what he was looking for the carpenters storeroom and workshop inside they set to feverishly heaping into a pile the wood shavings with the oakum and torn cotton ration bags they had brought flint and steel were nervously produced kydd took them and ordered the room cleared before upending gluepots jars of spirit and anything else he could find over the mess he struck some sparks but they went out before they could catch the flammables he had to get nearer to the dangerous mixture an eddy of the sharp stink of fumes hung in the air and when he struck again they caught in a whoomf of searing flame he staggered back temporarily blinded but felt the hands of a man behind plucking him out and steering him for the hatchway his eyes cleared in the open to see the other sloop plunging vengefully towards them but staunch was there hauled under the bowsprit and kydd thankfully dropped to its deck now for the crowning moment if it came off back down our track he snapped when he reached the wheel it caused frowns it was the course home but would take them past the returning sloop which would not hesitate to salute them with a broadside the two vessels closed bear away to leeward if you please kydd said tightly his eyes on the spanish this would take them downwind of the bigger ship which was precisely what he wanted a trifle more i think it would not do to appear too brazen it was not long before they met a fleeing mosquito of a craft trying to make the open sea in time and a righteous avenger and the temptation was too much with no flames from their work yet outwardly visible on the other sloop the spaniard put over his helm and lunged for them probably relishing kydds mistake at this point of sailing it was going to be the squarerigged ship that had the advantage kydd watched the sloop gradually close and set his trap a little to larboard that will do now it was all down to the cupidity of the spanish captain so eager to cap his day by taking both craft they were passing the end of the island where the long finger of a point entered the water and kydd now remembered the significance of the wind backing northerly in this vast funnel of sea an easterly blowing in would have a heaping effect on the mass of water resulting in a greater depth with this backing to the north it would be released and the effect of several hundred tons of ship striking at speed on the underwater spine of rocks was dramatic instantly the ship slewed and the foremast bowed forward under press of sail fell majestically quickly followed by the main transforming a fine creature of the sea to a ruin disbelieving yells of triumph went up and the young captain turned to kydd with such admiration that he felt a blush rising sir you knew hed follow then let it be a lesson to you sir he said modestly flames were now shooting up from the foredeck of the grounded sloop and the boats coming out from the shore were hanging back as kydd had intended the fore magazine was not far from where they had started the fire selby looked over at the distant figures clambering disconsolately over the wreckage of the other sir shall we no my friend well leave em to it there was no point in finishing it both sloops put down was a quite acceptable result in any case there was still something he had to do when they arrived dolores was still aground but now quite deserted and ready to be restored to the british flag mr garrick do you desire to take up your command again there was little damage aboard for it appeared the spanish had been more concerned with searching for booty and keeping their prize in good condition all it took was a modicum of skilful seamanship to have her towed off the bank kydd swelled with satisfaction even in the face of his little fleet there was no chance liniers would risk a crossing now let the army strut and parade it was the navy that had held the line when they arrived back at the mole kydd could feel an oppressive uneasy atmosphere as he reached the waterfront he caught averted glances lowered voices the sudden stilling of laughter things were changing fast he went to his billet it was the same there a stiff disinclination in the ladies of the house for conversation the children running off and rodriguez formidably polite but of few words kydd left quickly at the fort beresford was still out on inspection and kydd wearily made his way to the officers mess to take a meal and seek company on seeing his royal marines lieutenant he called over ah mr clinton might i sup with you id be honoured sir weve just heard of your success on the other shore and well all rest the better for it thank you a diverting occasion for a clerking warrior im bound to say kydd turned his attention to the food a hot breakfast would be a welcome change but the egg that was placed before him was small and discoloured with an unmistakable reek stale and off damn it steward clinton looked uncomfortable sir i beg you hes not to be blamed the situation with victuals is getting insupportable the city market near deserted and we dare not go into the country to secure our own i fancy well be on short canny before long kydd sat back in dismay that it had come to this so quickly was a serious development clinton went on all the transports have been stripped of provisions and been sent up and down the country to try to get more at any price but in a hostile province i think not has the commodore yes hes been informed the lieutenant said matteroffactly naturally it was squarely the senior officers problem he ventured sir should you wish to take the temper of buenos aires we could go for a stroll and kydd felt he was being invited for a reason and fell in with the suggestion they walked out of the fort into the main square here again there were few people a handful of forlorn basket traders a couple of children running and the familiar grind of the highwheeled water carts for the rest there was an uncanny silence they passed into a minor street and heard the tramp of boots the squeal of fife and drums as they emerged on to a main street they saw a broad column of redcoats with a splendidly ornamented sergeant major to the fore the few people watching stared dully or turned their backs clinton snapped to attention kydd did the same and they were acknowledged with screamed commands and a salute by the sergeant major the soldiers marched stolidly along in widely spaced threes not at all with the crisp professionalism kydd had come to expect from these veteran troops as they passed he recognised to his astonishment laurores pursers steward stepping it out in a corporals tunic and further on the duty coxswain daily we rope in every idler we can find servant boatboy shore party dress em up in uniforms and ask them to march about for a period notice how theyre spaced apart we hope it gives the locals the impression weve numbers beyond what we really have clinton explained i see i must allow its a powderkeg sir forty thousand kept at bay by one and a half if they take it into their heads kydd nodded gravely then asked er by now you know buenos aires well enough why theres continuous streets and buildings all of two miles long and a half wide and it spreads out far into the country youll be wondering how we keep watch and ward i fancy well as to that the general desires that we make a presence everywhere we can so weve posts on the roads regulating entry into here and roving patrols and sentries at important locations ive stood sentrygo as a private myself just to see the lie of the land but our biggest problem is men even in two watches we cant really secure a city this large are the men in good heart theyre doing their duty sir clinton said firmly do sit and take a taste of wine mr kydd beresford mumbled through his food ive not yet eaten today and im clemmed he finished his modest meal quickly and turned to kydd a capital action against the shipsloops sir were safe for now youve heard of our difficulties with provisioning sir the commodore has sent the victuallers elizabeth and mary on a cruise to chase up supplies but im not sanguine well find any in the province im persuaded theyll need to go to rio possibly as far as cape town kydd had his doubts about the cape there would probably be little enough to be found even at that distance so soon after it had been taken there hadnt been a harvest and the capetonians were still on thin times but what else could the defenders do rations are vital of course but what worries me is that weve no line to other military stores were quite on our own with what weve brought with us for instance ive taken the precaution of buying up all the gunpowder i can lay hands on among the merchantmen lying here what ill do for the other i cannot say sir weve only to hold on for the reinforcements ah the reinforcements and when do you conceive theyll be here if i knew we could make our dispositions as it is were forced to plan for months if youve any ideas id be glad to hear them kydd said ruefully st helena weve sent jane there but theyre east india company not set up for crown supply no it has to be comprehended that were in a devilish pickle the slaves are they to be added to our colours no the local merchantry plead their economy will be overset should they lose their services ive had to let them keep their slaves a good thing too he said absently i couldnt feed em topping up the generals wine kydd commented a sullen enough crew about town ive noticed im puzzled to know just what it is thats made them set their faces against us beresford sighed hard to say at a guess id presume its something to do with the dons pride that weve taken the place with so few and what were offering of prosperity and freedom does not weigh that much with them theyve the chance to rid themselves of spanish rule and they refuse it ah yes this they would value above all things but they are asking too much of me sir there are many who would accept us possibly the majority of the better class but first they desire a guarantee of protection against reprisal from the spanish should they return this i cannot on my honour sign up to as it is not within my power to defend against everything unforeseeable he sighed therefore that puts paid to any hope of a harmonious future so none will be seen to collaborate with us for fear of retribution later kydd knew what he was saying like guadeloupe when the french returned the streets ran red for weeks ive heard he had been a young seaman on the island when beresford sniffed and added sourly and those priests are a pestilential lot theyre making open offer of a place in the country and a new wife if a soldier deserts his post and takes off his hat to the pope im sorry to say theres been more than one irishman think it the better bargain the senoritas being so obliging abruptly he stood up hard times but we have our duty chapter you are quite clear amado mio what we must do rafaela said her voice breaking with intensity of course serrano replied although in his nervousness his hands were working together you will wait at los tres reyes and i will bring the english captain to you now dont forget mi rosa you do your part and i will do mine i shall not fail don baltasar they walked together in a wary silence through the shabby streets then separated towards the centre the city was unusually quiet and had an air of tension and dread that played on serranos mind he tried to tell himself that it was safer now he was known where it counted as an agent of the patriots and need not fear them but was it really true that they were in sacred alliance with the loyalists whose hatred had seen him exiled distant sounds of a military column marching came echoing through the streets in a panic he hid in a side alley while the tramping feet went by he had no idea how the british must regard him now it was rafaelas job to feel for this before she brought captain kydd to the back room of the tavern the column seemed endless there must be many thousand troops in the city and now they were his sworn enemy i say for the ears of captain keed only rafaela snapped at the fortress guard she stood there stubbornly until eventually an importantlooking naval officer and a plainly dressed man descended senorita que quieres con el capitan ignoring him she addressed the officer directly dona rafaela callejo an i have informacion for you captain keed he was a handsome man with a strong open face that paradoxically allowed her fears to subside a little how do you know my name he challenged she said nothing very well ill see her inside kydd told the translator and led the way to his office now what is it you have to tell me miss callejo rafaela adjusted her shawl he looked directly at her no play with the eyes or attempt to dominate or charm and she felt a twinge of guilt at what she was about to do sir you know my lover vicente serrano i do kydd said cautiously he left my ship some time ago yes to reach los patriotas i am to tell you he was not in time for your attack and only now has arrive in buenos aires im pleased to hear it youre not angry wi him kydd shook his head no we had to sail quickly these things happen in war capitan he wish to do more to help king george against the spanish so they can be throw from our country she smiled winningly sir he is hiding he frighten that someone will see him if he come to the fort i understand he know you he trust you sir will you see him at all serrano stood up when kydd and rafaela entered his nervousness allayed by her smile captain keed i er but all his imaginings for a suave line of questioning leading to secrets fled before the reality of facing the man he was about to betray you wanted to help us against the spanish kydd prompted er yes sir then im not at all sure what you can do unless first you tell us i um then what is your problem may i ask serrano blurted that must be finding victuals for the soldiers bread and spirit provisions were in much need but this is not something you can help us with i fear unless you know of secret stores or such kydd finished hopefully i will try thank you sir thank you he spluttered the excitement in him building while rafaela looked on in bafflement and if you ever hear of mischief from the spanish yes yes goodbye sir goodbye blinking kydd allowed himself to be escorted outside by rafaela who hurried back afterwards what are you doing you fool she blazed where are the secrets to tell don baltasar you should have serrano gazed back with a saintly smile i have the biggest of all mi bella flor he said challenging her with his eyes what is this big secret then she pouted only that im to tell general liniers to order his soldiers to rest easy there will be no battles no mortal struggle with the english what are you saying this is lunatic vicente tonight i shall leave in the fishing boat and at dawn i shall be speaking to the general directly he declared you shall wait for my return colonia del sacramento was now overwhelmed by an armed encampment that extended far out into the country as serrano was escorted through it he was thrilled by the sight of legendary regiments soldiers in blue with red sashes drilling proudly and countless volunteers in their tall shakos with their muskets aslope led by officers in magnificently plumed headgear over to the right the blandengues the veteran frontier militia had their distinctive poled tents in rows and in the distance cavalry thundered in mock charges these blandengues had just completed a forced march over the ninety miles from montevideo to colonia but showed no sign of it serrano threw out his chest he was not in a fine uniform but he knew he had tidings for the commander in chief that would affect every last one of them approaching the headquarters tent he saw guemes talking to an officer and waved gaily his friend looked back at him in astonishment and serrano felt his gaze follow him into the tent several distinguishedseeming officers stood over a desk where an older man in a severe black uniform finished in gold and scarlet was seated writing sir an agent from buenos aires with news wait the man finished scratching away then thrust a paper at one of the officers before looking up at the intruder don santiago liniers whispered someone behind serrano sir i have to report well the voice was soft and calm encouraged serrano went on sir there is no need for a battle sir there were gasps and a stifled giggle go on i personally have interviewed the capitan de puerto himself and have made discovery that the treacherous english are in dire want of any kind of provisions i put it to you sir that it is only a matter of a short while and they will be starved out if we are patient they must soon surrender to us and without a drop of our own blood shed what do you know of military affairs snarled one of the officers leave us to serranos face burned no no miguel he means well tell me what account of the present state of their stores can you give me how many men are on rations where is it kept can they supply from the sea these things i need to know for if we wait longer we must find more supply for our own army and the biggest question is when will their reinforcements arrive if you can tell me the answer to that it would be of the greatest service as it is i must go forward without delay on the assault you see a tall officer bent down and whispered to liniers who nodded and said there is an office you can perform for me as it happens anything sir youll no doubt be aware that our naval forces at colonia suffered in a recent reversal at arms this has had the unfortunate effect of frustrating our strategy to cross the rio de la plata and join with our brothers for the grand assault on buenos aires i would not have them think we are unwilling and therefore i shall write a message of encouragement and patience which i desire you shall take to them sir said serrano stiffening to attention it will be to colonel general pueyrredon commander of the voluntarios montados bonaerense the gauchos quite well stand on a little further i believe acting lieutenant hellard said evenly watching the three craft fleeing ahead of him each not much smaller than his own and which together could overcome stalwart the sumaca if they chose but they were at a crucial disadvantage they faced the moral superiority of the famed royal navy that had the year before at trafalgar crushed the best that spain could send against it these would never chance a confrontation the chill wind was getting stronger tearing the tops from the waves it gave speed to the more stoutly built sumaca but was threatening the odd assortment they were chasing two feluccas whose soaring lateens could not easily be reefed and a balandra a more europeanstyled cutter all were clawing into the wind the edges of their sails fluttering desperately pale faces looking back on their implacable pursuer the heading could not be sustained up the river plate to its end there was a maze of mudflats and the blunt thirtymile barrier of impenetrable marshes that separated the two shores sooner or later they must turn and face their fate or drive aground to be taken separately by stalwart hellard grinned in anticipation and glanced at his crew each with a cutlass and a brace of pistols they didnt need to be told what was in prospect abruptly the lead felucca put her helm down and lay over on to the other tack followed like wheeling starlings by the other two ready about hellard ordered languidly and stalwart made to follow suit in an instant the three ahead swung back to their original course gaining nearly a hundred yards but the end could not be long in doubt it was the balandra marginally larger than the other two that took the ground first almost comically slowing as the muddy seabed rose to brush her undersides she stopped still under full sail the other two pressed on hellard ordered savagely come to a halfpistolshot abeam then he snapped ahoy there the swivel one round to wake him up the shot was sent low over the little halfdeck aft where the crew crouched they ducked out of sight and he ordered boarders away in a wellpractised move their boat was launched with hellard at the tiller and four men at the oars they pulled strongly towards the balandras squaredoff stern muskets banged from the deckline but hellard smiled cynically in their inexperience they were firing much too early and the shots were going wide at the last minute he threw over his tiller and brought the boat in at an angle with a thump with a roar a brawny seaman tossed his cutlass aboard and reached for a rope to heave himself in four crouched men rose to meet him but hellards readyaimed pistol kicked in his hand and the first went down in a gurgle of blood a seamans pistol behind him took the next with a bullet in the stomach and the man toppled forward screaming into the sea the third held his blade at point and retreated pale and shaking hellard swung aboard and faced him with his sword motioning for him to drop his weapon the man was rigid with terror but kept his position the tip of his crude cutlass wavering his eyes black pits of fear the lieutenant made a threatening gesture but the sailor kept up his weapon a plunge overboard the other side was presumably the last making his escape it was butchery but there was no alternative hellard swept up his blade as though to slash down the cutlass went up to protect and with a sharp twist and stoop hellard was lunging inside catching the man in the throat in a bloody spray he fell to his knees choking his life away out ahead the two feluccas were making a broad circle looking to an opportunity for revenge hellard and his party had little time in the cabin he found an oil lamp he shouted down into the waist for the wreckers to stop smashing at the bottom of the vessel with broadaxe and maul then dashed the lamp to the deck it splintered and the oil caught in roiling flame as men tumbled into the boat to return to stalwart the bowman leaned over and fished out a shapeless dripping black object so whats thisn get on your oar hellard snarled at him in reply and they were away in the dim twilight serrano stood up to his knees in the sea clutching his arms and shivering uncontrollably with cold and fright it had taken hours for the blaze to be noticed from shore and a cautious fishing boat sent to investigate but now it was coming and he would be back in blessed safety and warmth before long it had been the worst experience he had ever had the quick crossing abruptly interrupted by scenes of stark terror ended only by the plunge for his life over the side the desolate time standing in the mud was preferable to the alternative being seized by the british and taken before their senior officer captain kydd who would quickly recognise his real position and he could congratulate himself that even in all the horror he had thought to cast his precious dispatches overboard to prevent their capture the fishing boat loomed close hands hauled him in and he was found a blanket and a mug of rough aguardiente suddenly he realised their direction where are we going ive to report to general liniers himself take us back what were from las conchas and i can swear to you by the holy name were going there it was the wrong side of the river but youd rather get out and walk he slumped down then he realised that telling liniers he had not been able to deliver the message was neither informative nor helpful las conchas was well to the north of buenos aires and he could safely move down to the gauchos who were secretly concentrated at the perdriel ranch much better to see pueyrredon himself and pass on the message personally las conchas will do serrano said loftily the old and stinking fishing village provided a measure of compensation a resident impressed with his tale of escape from the clutches of desperate english pirates on the high seas lent him a horse in a matter of an hour or so he was cantering into the sprawling perdriel ranch juan martin de pueyrredon was tall handsome and imperious and of startling youth in his blaze of stars and epaulettes his piercing gaze never left serrano as he heard his story very well ill accept this comes from general liniers your father is known to me he mounted his horse with a flourish then gestured towards the open country where great numbers of horsemen were thundering backwards and forwards in mock charge how he expects me to keep these noble caballeros entertained while he and baltasar dally is quite beyond me he sniffed and should the english dare to show their faces i cannot be held accountable that these brave fellows insist on falling upon them without recourse to orders it was fished out of the water near the balandra hellard said handing over the sodden object i saw there was a packet inside kydd inspected it curiously a small leather holdall not military and inside a wellfolded package secured with rawhide fastenings its covering was a stout oilskin preserving its contents against the seawater his pocketknife soon had it open it was a message still quite legible but in spanish what was plain however was that from the conspicuous spanish royal coat of arms this was official and of some importance yet why was it not in a military form and would anyone be foolish enough to ditch valuable dispatches without the customary pair of musketballs to weigh them down it had to be a deception but he was dutybound to pass it on to the general found in the sea near a vessel taken by one of my captains kydd murmured a trickery no doubt beresford said immediately but handed it to an aide what does it say erskine the man scanned it closely then looked up sir its a note from general liniers to a colonel general pueyrredon ah thats our gaucho fellow im told carry on a warm message encouraging them to hold fast until he can find some way to cross their progress being halted at the shore by our navy which holds the sea then he says they will join together to liberate their fair city from the invader ha i cant see how they believe this might constitute a misleading we know very well that liniers is confined to colonia in idleness and we also know that the gauchos cant move without he crosses and joins up with them so wheres the deceit he frowned then a slow smile spread yet there is a message in this for us sir if this is their admitted position i see no reason why we cant take advantage of it gentlemen im to make a sally out of the city and deal with our country gaucho friends while theyre thus separated i shall not lose a moment send for colonel pack if you please in the chill dawn a column of infantry of the st regiment with fifty of the st helena infantry and their guns tramped through the silent streets watched by citizens awed by the warlike array of an army on the march the general was taking more than half his strength a grave risk for if the future battle went against him buenos aires could not be held by those remaining they moved quickly the guns and limbers pulled by mules and the soldiers with light packs their marching rhythm eating up the miles until they had left the city and its suburbs well behind with few horses scouts could not be deployed on either flank and therefore it had to be assumed their progress was observed by pueyrredons outriders and the news relayed on the land was flat and monotonous scrub and occasional trees bent with the wind adding to the feel of a godforsaken landscape a forward observer galloped back with news ahead there were at least two thousand troops mounted and with field guns near four times the british number in their familiar country and on ground of their own choosing beresford took the news calmly and the column marched on without pause at a little after ten they passed two ranch outbuildings then caught sight of the enemy they were taking advantage of a long stone wall for a defensive work their guns at regular intervals behind them a mass of horses and troops the glitter of steel and the colour of pennons clearly visible the guns thudded into life too early with wild firing the british continued advancing in column and the balls gouged earth well away from them then beresford gave the order to deploy bringing his men to a halt while his guns took position his artillerymen opened up with devastating effect a stone wall was the worst shelter imaginable as the iron balls struck they dissolved it into flying razorsharp splinters that carried into the packed mass behind fix bayonets to the fore march the st formed a double line and advanced the st helenas stayed with the guns from the enemy positions a stream of riders burst out to the left another to the right maddened gauchos in an impulsive charge that owed little to soldierly discipline and much to their lust for glory against veteran highlanders it was a mistake with crisp commands the redcoats halted and formed a loose square the gauchos were met with the concentrated fire of the first rank which brought down men and horses in a chaos of flying bodies and squeals of terror to the front one gaucho officer was spectacularly unhorsed but staggered to his feet and stood defiant against the foe the gold of his epaulettes and decorations an incongruous glint against the filth of the battlefield the british resumed their advance but the officer didnt run he snatched up a flag which he flourished aloft shouting heroically into the anarchy and confusion seemingly from nowhere a gaucho dragoon galloped wildly towards him low in the saddle beating his horse mercilessly in a feat worthy of a circus spectacle the unhorsed officer vaulted into the saddle behind him and they made their escape gauchos circled out of range then a pair made a wild dash for the british lines straight towards where the general and his staff were standing beresford tried to draw his sword but it jammed in its scabbard musket fire brought one gaucho crashing to the ground but the other sabre at the ready thundered in the generals aide threw himself between them and parried the swing with his own weapon the rider circled for another pass but was brought down with pistols ahead two spanish guns fired but fell silent before the charging scots the gunners fled all save one who valiantly stayed by his weapon and was captured the st had taken perdriel the equipment and guns for no loss there was nothing the gauchos could do but leave their dead and retreat a glorious day sir a young officer enthused to beresford you think so the general said what do you see a conquered army at my feet no sir we have the field but what are we going to do with it we have to quit it immediately and return to buenos aires having taught em respect but their force still exists and we must meet them again this only buys time he called to his aide do bring that prisoner before me the bravest fellow the spanish had this day the man was led forward tell him i shall compliment him on his conduct as his own commanding officer would whats his name there was no response from the gunner who stood defiant and silent come come sir you have nothing to be ashamed of tell us your name and rank beresford said colonel pack stormed up redfaced the villain i know that man sir hes an irish deserter the generals expression turned bleak you see he said to the young officer now i have to hang a good man a glorious day i think not there were shouts of men returning but they were spanish serrano had not heard english spoken for some time were the british abandoning the battlefield fearfully he cleared a hole from his hiding place under the mule feed to see a colourful gaucho swaggering past he got up to find the camp in ruins the british had destroyed what they could and had left taking the guns and now there was nothing but the desolation of a battlefield and wailing women he wandered around in shock they had outnumbered the enemy by four to one yet had been soundly beaten what had happened what now of the future he saw pueyrredon with his officers around him and heard him cry out the glorious sacrifice of our men on the field of battle will not be in vain we know were children in the arts of war compared to the imperialista british but we have an advantage a mighty sword in our hand our cause is just there was a roar of support but impatiently he cut through it and every last bonaerense son would flock to the colours if they could and join us in our time of glory serrano was spellbound with leaders like this man how could they fail to stand against the english and then in the fullness of time march on to seize the golden crown of liberation and independence pueyrredon went on i have a plan that will grant them their sacred wish we cannot prevail in the open field of battle before the forces the british can muster against us therefore we shall arm the people and as one we shall rise up against them in numbers they cannot withstand by stealth and courage we will infiltrate muskets and pikes guns swords and powder into the city when general liniers crosses to join us at last a trumpet will sound forth our freedoms call and the entire city will rise up and humble them joining in the storm of applause serrano pushed forward eagerly i shall be first to return i know the british let me be the one pueyrredon looked around grandly then fixed on serrano very well you shall have your wish you shall accompany my chief lieutenant and emissary charcas hidalgo de sarmiento to buenos aires there to raise our peoples army eyes shining serrano snapped to attention yes general then go pueyrredon said looking pointedly over his shoulder serrano turned round and met the eyes of the man he had last seen in the home of his lover charcass cynical smile sliced through his elation do lead on be first and i will follow he added grimly they left disguised as farm peons on a cart of donkey hay but under the load lay a dozen muskets at the reins serrano led off towards the city in the distance his apprehension turning to terror as they approached the first sentry charcas took over chewing a straw and spreading his hands in incomprehension the nervous young soldier let them pass the cart wound its way through the meaner streets of the northern suburbs passing into an enclosed courtyard at the back of an inn in a dramatic gesture charcas threw off his poncho to reveal a glittering uniform then stood on his seat and waited haughtily his arms folded a curious face appeared at a window then a few customers stepped out to see charcas declined to notice them more came filling the little courtyard then taking a long and significant look about him he proclaimed citizens of buenos aires i am here at the peril of my life to bring you hope his words swept over them promises of glory and sacrifice war and patriotism until the space rang with shouts of fire and ardour he drew himself up and looked about impressively who will then be first to enlist in the glorious legion de patricios voluntarios urbanos de buenos aires with a purse of dollars each month and freedom to elect your own officers a thrusting crowd pressed forward with a roar and charcas pointed at one individual what is your name sir ah manuel galvis as it pleases you sir the man said whipping off his cap then it is now sergeant galvis you shall take the details of all who will serve their country and i will come later to enlist them a priest pushed through frowning but was carried along by the excitement and insisted on giving heavens blessing to the uprising we thank you father charcas said in dignified tones and crave a further service this was to act as trusted intermediary between various units of the peoples army the british having issued special passes to priests to go about freely in ministering to their flock and now as an earnest to the future sarnt galvis sir with a flourish he swung down and went to the rear of the cart snatching away the loose hay to reveal the muskets gleaming and deadly take these for your good men be certain theres many more to come in the sudden hush charcas added in your hands is the destiny of our great city guerra al cuchillo mueran los ingleses when they met up again that evening charcas wore the black cloak serrano remembered all too well but serrano himself was still in his shabby and torn clothes they slipped through the darkened and near deserted streets until once more he was before rafaela find me some clothes mi angel he said importantly at her wideeyed apprehension tonight im about the work of the patriots looking at the impassive charcas she shivered mi querido you know what it is that the clothes serrano demanded she returned with them herself arrayed in a cape and hood rafaela you cannot possibly i can go in places denied to a man will you stop me playing my part the three hurried down the calle victoria to the mansion of martin de alzaga where they were hastily admitted senor charcas the silverhaired man said softly is it planned i have word from don baltasar now in amicable alliance with the royalists it is that you should proceed as planned ah breathed alzaga i shall start hiring tomorrow and who are these he added carefully servants of the fatherland serrano said loudly with a bow i see charcas allowed a thin smile to show senor alzaga is a rich man but he is dedicating his fortune to the glory of his country and to his honour serrano blurted he is funding the construction of a secret tunnel which will begin under the seminary of st francis and will end under the barrack rooms of the soldiers thirtysix barrels of gunpowder will put an end to them as they sleep wait for it about turn sergeant dodds effortless bellow echoed across the square to the lines of royal marines opposite they stamped about crisply their dress faultless a few passersby stopped to watch but most ignored them companyyyyyy halt dodd strode up and inspected them before reporting to clinton with a quivering salute the lieutenant acknowledged and accompanied by dodd went over for an officers inspection that complete dodd stood before the men while clinton reported to kydd who had emerged from the fort he went up and down the ranks here and there giving words of praise and encouragement a splendid body of men lieutenant carry on please the men marched off kydd receiving a magnificent salute from dodd the drill had been devised to give heart to the men solid evidence that the world while being out of joint was still under discipline a dish of tea william kydd offered kydds room was cheerless and cold a fire now a luxury and the two kept their coats buttoned how goes it then clinton paused before he answered id be to looard of the truth should i say were improving our situation those on sentrygo are taunted daily and some even suffer rotten food thrown at them theyre being tempted by offers of women and employment if they desert but no chance of that with our chaps sir its asking much of em i believe to stand alone on those far posts in the city if things begin to theyll do their duty sir never fear if only those damnable reinforcements they took their tea the leaves used twice to eke them out in silence so close to the foreshore the miasma of rotting fish offal was always on the air and the harsh cawing of a soaring condor sounded above the rumble of a passing cart and theyre changing the people i mean clinton said theyre now openly contemptuous defiant hard to handle as a crowd the young man was maturing fast only in his early twenties his face was acquiring lines of care and his voice now had the practised calm of authority he and the fine longservice dodd were a shining credit to their service and kydd wished he could express this but it would never do to say it how are our royal blues bearing their lot the short canny i mean clinton gave a wry smile they say as how theyve always held our reasty pork is to be preferred over foreign kickshaws they were reduced to picking the bread going through the last of the hardtack for insect life and buying up voyageend stores from merchant ships but in the absence of provisions from upcountry there was little else kydd knew the older marines were making light of conditions for the sake of the younger men an aide interrupted captain kydd general beresford desires you should attend on him at convenience sir he rose dreading what emergency it was this time beresford sat moodily at his desk twirling a quill and looked up with a start when kydd entered ah kydd theres trouble afoot im persuaded one of our patrols found three stand of muskets in a house not far from here someones arming the mob and it has to be stopped have we any conceiving of how theyre entering sir no ive doubled up on checkpoints into the city where we search everything it must be by another route by sea it seems so beresford said flatly kydd was at a loss to know how to prevent this with nearly all of his vessels blockading the far shore but he replied ill do what i can sir beresford nodded bleakly and kydd took his leave it came to him as he made his way back to his office some thirty miles further down the coast there was a discreet landing place ensenada de barragan where in the past dutiable goods had been smuggled into the viceroyalty by that unofficial arrangement with the authorities but his little navy was now stretched out along the opposite coast bar one ship in repair protector and hellards stalwart in only that morning her captain and crew exhausted after days in action rather than drive them to sea once more kydds impulse was to spare them and do it himself im taking stalwart away he announced muster the protectors as her crew they put out into driving rain from the northwest and squally spiteful winds which kicked up an uncomfortable short sea against the incoming tide yet having the advantage that it was fair for barragan stalwart was plainly built with few comforts but a snug messdeck had been fashioned within the cargo hold in the way of sailors it had all the touches of home in a space that would be spurned in a london rookery racks against the side for mess utensils hooks to take the ditty bags that held each individuals readyuse gear mirrors and small ornaments and forward a neat rectangular bin for stowed hammocks in accordance with kydds own standing orders they stopped on the way and boarded the larger flatbottomed fishing boats a form of deterrence against contraband that was proving remarkably effective then as the wan sun was lowering over the flat and bleak shore they came up with the maze of channels and shoals that was their objective off the point there were four vessels a sumaca a lugger and two faluchos local craft twomasted with a lateen and jib even as kydd watched sail was hoisted and they were rapidly off downwind a bad conscience grinned dougal stalwarts masters mate whod insisted on keeping an eye on his ship well have that gaff higher kydd snapped these could either be innocents wary of pirates or indeed those they were looking for but either way he had to stop them to prove the case the chase was played well by the spanish fairly quickly they separated the larger sumaca heading for deeper water offshore and the two faluchos shying from stalwarts progress to each side the smaller lugger with its three masts beating hard into the wind and away the sumaca kydd decided and they headed after it out to sea it didnt take long to discover that the bigger craft was making better speed standing away in regular bursts of white until it was obvious they had lost the race kydd swore and turned to see where faluchos were they had vanished it was impossible but there was no sign of them feeling foolish he called down the deck stalwarts ahoy any who saw where the faluchos went sing out saw em down sail an then go in a creek or some such a young lad said diffidently touching his cap he pointed out where it had happened the area had once been a watering place for ships but had gradually silted the dark grey mud now extending for miles with an offshore island entrapped in its creeping embrace an old coastal fort was some miles inland possibly connected through channels but the evening was well advanced and there was nothing for it but to leave further investigation for the morning light taking position off the creek the anchor went down in two fathoms the weather easing with the onset of night and as the darkness crept in they snugged down for the long hours until morning kydd had served in the caribbean in seaflower a tiny cutter there the threats had been many and diverse and now his old instincts came back to assert themselves while there was light to see he had the two bow carronades loaded and primed and the arms chest of cutlasses and pistols open and handy a pair of lookouts took position fore and aft satisfied he went below not to the rabbit hutch of a captains cabin but to the messdeck with the soft light of its single oil lamp the seamen looked up in surprise then dismay a postcaptain even in worn and faded sea rig was a formidable being and now their standdown time was set fair to be an awkward trial stand fast the puffery were all stalwarts here kydd said easily taking a stool at the corner of the small table whats for scran cuffin easing into a smile dougal slid across the bread barge a wicker basket that held prebroken hard tack and carefully sliced cheese kydd took a piece of the woodhard and greyish cheese and helped himself to the dry biscuit which he calmly tapped on the table no weevils emerged and he tucked in with appreciation feeling the disbelieving eyes of the three foremast hands on him weve the dago biltong to follow piped up beekman a south african midshipman originally brought aboard diomede in cape town he hesitantly offered some to kydd thank ee he said with a grin and set to on the dried beef strips these were not the spicy toothsome morsels of africa hed enjoyed but they would have to do with no galley fire in a craft so diminutive there could be no coffee or piping hot kai cocoa stripped from a chocolate block until they made port once more but there was a welcome mug of grog kydd had insisted that it be included in the rations as the evening drew on the talk eddied back and forth over the ageold sailorly concerns of wind and weather the quality of buenos aires as a stepashore port the prospects for action inevitably it turned to the immediate future and beekman asked sir if you please things are in a pretty moil youll agree what will happen to us if dont pay any mind to that mlad kydd said heartily weve one parcel of spanish locked up on the north shore and weve just beaten the other all weve to do is hold out until the reinforcements arrive whens that then sir the young man said artlessly whos to say tomorrow next week on the way here the commodore sent dispatches from st helena requesting em which i saw with my own eyes theyll be here shortly never fear knowing that the rest of the table were behind him the midshipman persisted ifn mr liniers gets across and joins with the goochies the armyll be hard pressed to hold em and if we cant get ships in close to give fire kydd nodded these were no ignorant loobies and deserved an answer if things go against us we retire he said flatly take the army off and return to cape town no heroic last stands clear it seemed to satisfy and he stretched and yawned well im for my mick ill take a turn about the uppers and then get my head down dougal im to be called the instant theres a change o weather or tide aye aye sir goodnight then kydd pronounced and left for his customary sniff at the wind before sleep the weather had eased even further there was nothing but a light offshore breeze and the pale dappling of wavelets the moon was totally hidden behind low cloud that stretched in a sullen stillness in every direction leaving a dull uniform luminosity just sufficient to make out the low scrubby shoreline he shivered the thought came again that the sooner he was quit of this place the better then he paused for a moment something subliminal touching his senses the scene was blameless a bird flapping on the sea the only disturbance and nothing but a grey desolation of mudflats and reeds hairs prickled on his neck there was something keep a bright lookout you men he called and stood for a space listening intently nothing then something caught his eye along the shoreline to the left he strained to see but couldnt make out anything then tried the old lookouts ruse of looking off to one side to trick the eye into perceiving motion and then he saw somewhere among the scruffy wooded inland a barely perceptible spiderwebthin vertical line that moved and close by another he froze trying to make sense of it then he had it get below and turn up the hands he barked they tumbled up confused and blinking sir dougal said with a bewildered look the spanish theyre in the channel under oars and mean to take us too long the stalker they had not imagined themselves to be prey kydd mentally took off his hat to the audacious commander who had looked to turn the tables on them it was their masts he had seen unavoidably above the level of the undergrowth as they made their way stealthily out to the open water the question now was whether to open fire as soon as they were visible or keep quiet to lure them near and to destruction but there was a big risk if these two had soldiers to swell their boarders the stalwarts might easily be overwhelmed and if they were resolutely handled they could press home their attack through stalwarts broadside which consisted only of the two carronades and two swivels after that they were defenceless apart from their small arms this implied a single course of action allow the spanish to believe their surprise had been successful then open up with everything that could fire in a single devastating blast of shot in the night it might be terrifying enough to deter the onslaught or at the very least to gain them enough time to reload silence fore n aft kydd snapped and made his dispositions having the men keep out of sight until his order each had a blade weapon and a brace of pistols with four muskets lying in the chest while the oil lamp was suspended out of sight by rope yarns ready to be lashed to the foremast as a fighting lantern for reloading the carronades there was little more he could do water chuckled against the vessels side the wind dropping yet more to a cold night zephyr bringing a stillness that carried every sound in breathless clarity the distant betraying slither and clunk of unmuffled oars on the air became plain as the two faluchos emerged from the channel and came around kydd gave a conspiratorial grin at dougal lying on the deck next to him that would never do in a professional cuttingout expedition it was a halfmile of hard pulling for them they could have hoisted sail and done it in less time but the sudden pale glimmer of canvas would have been an immediate giveaway kydd was content to let them tire themselves the better to dull their fighting ardour at two hundred yards he hissed stand by in the winter gloom men gripped their weapons loosened pistols in readiness and tensed for the order fire kydd roared the night was split apart by multiple flashes and concussion as ball grape and musket fire hammered into the hapless faluchos shrieks and shouts accompanying the mayhem slewing sideways the leader canted to one side out of the fight but the other stretched out frantically with the obvious intention of falling on stalwart before her guns were reloaded the fighting lantern was in place but to go through the motions with sponge rammer and charge was asking a lot of men who were half blinded by gunflash kydd felt a creeping anxiety as the enemy craft came in fast broad on their beam an officer was shouting encouragement and foreignsounding cheers came floating over the water kydd saw the white face of beekman looking back at him from forward waiting on his decision a gentle puff of the night breeze came they were at anchor stemming the slight current and get that mizzen hoisted he bellowed in sudden conviction startled men turned in incomprehension now hoist the bugger his voice cracked with the effort but it lashed them into movement two seamen clambered aft and helped him raise the ponderous sail it flapped twice then bellied and under the leverage of sail aft on the anchor forward stalwart obediently began swinging into the wind bows on to the approaching enemy it had worked now the target they offered was reduced and most important under oars there was no easy coming in to board at an angle amidships instead they must either grapple and come in over the bow by ones and twos or crab around to get alongside while under fire the whole time they chose the bows with three men on muskets and pistols and two reloading stalwart did what she could but a grapnel came sailing in and hauled the craft together the other bowsprit spearing over their foredeck until the two were awkwardly locked side by side with a roar of triumph the enemy boarders crowded forward throwing aside their empty pistols the defenders drew their cutlasses and with bared teeth dared them to try the first two ran out on the bowsprit if stalwart had had pikes they would have been dead men and with sword points extended they leaped down either side then raced for the defenders kydd had four men in a line across the wider part of the triangular foredeck and the two closed with a vicious clash of steel dougal took one and kydd the other but behind two more were jumping down and kydd was aware of the setfaced petty officer beside him lunging forward to meet them and a vague impression of their fourth giving savage blows to one side before he was swallowed in the confusion his opponent had an oldfashioned rapier which flicked about like a snakes tongue searching for an opening its lightness giving it deadly speed while kydds snatchedup cutlass seemed heavy and unresponsive in the flickering pool of light the fight was brutal and with no quarter possible but they had to hold the line no more enemy boarders could make it on to the crowded deck while they did so and their attackers knew it throwing themselves forward in a frenzy of violence stabbing hacking smashing as he parried and slashed a tiny part of kydds mind coolly told him he was right this ferocity owed its intensity to the need to stop a secret being spilled which could only be the point of entry of the arms smuggling his momentary lapse in concentration was punished by the sight of the pitiless features of his opponent as the rapier pierced his defences in a lunge to his face he reflexively tried to avoid the blade but it hissed through his collar and he felt its hot burn along his neck instinctively he twisted away it brought pressure on the rapier blade impeding its withdrawal and kydd desperately brought his cutlass in a wide slash across towards the belly the man pulled back and tripped falling full length and kydd was on him the heavy cutlass swinging down and laying the mans body open in a welter of blood and viscera in a split second kydd trampled over the body and thrust his bloody cutlass at the one bearing down on dougal the man swung to meet him but dougals blade transfixed his side in this morbid hackery there was no space for the gallantries of the fencing code and he whirled around to meet one about to impale him from behind his blade at parry something made the man hesitate kydd pressed his advantage and his opponent stumbled backwards against the low bulwark to topple over the side the sound of the plunge was loud against the grunts steel clashing and slithers that filled the air thinking perhaps that his comrades were abandoning the fight and swimming for their lives one made the fatal mistake of looking over his shoulder and was cut down in an instant another turned and ran and a last leaped over the side there were more in the falucho but they hesitated a figure bravely darted past kydd and began sawing at the grapnel line with his midshipmans dirk it fell free the craft swinging clear but with their boarders out of the line of fire there was a last vengeful burst of musketry from the enemy in the vicious whip of bullets kydds upraised blade took a ball squarely with a numbing clang that caused him to drop it in pain but with a sudden flash their starboard carronade had banged out and a storm of grape tore into the men opposite throwing them aside like bloody skittles it was the end of the fight the falucho out of control drifted away leaving the stalwarts to count the cost there were two enemy dead one seaman on his hands and knees rocking with pain another biting off gasps as a shipmate bound his forearm and the huddled form of beekman still forward kydd hurried over but by the sputtering light of the lamp it was obvious his wound was mortal even as the midshipman had knelt at his shipsaving task a ball had struck in at the shoulder and raked down into his body the lads consciousness was slipping his eyes flicking from one side to the other desperately scrabbling for life kydd tried to cradle the absurdly slight body while the last battle was fought his heart wringing at the pity of it a sudden spasm seized the boy in a paroxysm of desperation but when it had left so had his life chapter the sound of kydds steps echoed from the stone stairs as he made his way yet again to the roof parapets of the fort he stood and looked out to the restless grey water with its limitless horizon feeling for the freedom and contentment of the open sea with every fibre of his soul he wanted to be quit of the place with its mood of foreboding and treachery the monotony of the flat endless landscape the inescapable stink of mud and animals the pinched rations and strained faces the tedium of waiting and keeping his flotilla at their vital blockade until relief finally came he thought of brave little beekman who would leave his bones here never again to see the grand sight of cape towns table mountain and the sunsplashed veld in his sea life kydd had seen countless tragedies and had acquired a detachment that usually kept him distant but beekman had got under his guard such a pitiable waste swallowing kydd forced himself to concentrate as he made his usual appraisal of the weather the glass was falling but too little to worry about the winds gusty and sulky from the northeast not a concern for the blockade of colonia moreover the mudflats close by were under water ensuring there was navigability around the chico bank there was no telling however in these duplicitous waters he had heard of one occasion when with an adverse wind the incoming tide had actually been cowed into retreating leaving the whole river plate a vast mudflat shore to shore he turned to go but hesitated at what he saw developing inland to the southwest a peculiar roll of cloud separate from the rest stretched for miles and had a dark unhealthy hue it put him in mind of the southerly buster a phenomenon he had once been caught up in some years ago off australia it had the vicious trick of advancing with high winds from one direction then whipping round to attack an unfortunate ship from the opposite direction when he wandered back up just before noon to check it was considerably nearer a peculiar uniform long tube of browngrey slowly and ominously rolling forward under its baneful influence the winds before it faded bringing an oppressive humidity and the feral apprehension that always came before a storm kydd thought of his little band of vessels on their ceaseless patrol against the far shore at the sight of this kind of weather he himself would be taking full storm precautions no matter how big his vessel should he call off the blockade and bring them all safely back to port if this was a harmless local phenomenon he would be risking all for liniers with his superior knowledge of these parts would jump at the chance of a breakout no he must leave it to the judgement of his captains at two however it became clear that this was no trivial weather spat the rolling cloud was nearly overhead and behind it hung a dark pall in nearby buildings wooden shutters had been hastily fastened the last people abroad were hurrying home and all small craft had vanished and not one of his little fleet had returned they had chosen to stay at their post but if it was the same species of tempest hed encountered in australia would they know of the fiendish wind reversal even if they survived theyd be thrown on a deadly leeshore driven in by the bluster and a heavy concussion so loud it shook the stonework of the fort startled kydd not far out on his right a fork of lightning burst on his senses then another leaping between the clouds in hideous display a further avalanche of thunder pealed out nearly deafening him in the breathless atmosphere it was a devils display of malice intense bluewhite lightning arcing down in strikes seconds apart the smell of sulphur clear on the air then a squall buffeted him a chill and malevolent blast from the south the wind swung back fretful and restless before another southerly gust caught him pummelling with a force that increased all the time then came the rain gusty torrents and afterwards a hammering roar of heavy drops that quickly became a deluge driving kydd to take shelter in a corner his last sight of the sea was of a perfect fury of whiteness it was a fight for life that now faced his navy out there somewhere another stupefying round of thunderclaps burst overhead this time accompanied by a volley of hailstones as big as musket balls that rushed and clattered violently about kydd retreated hurrying back down the steps now echoing with the storms frenzy and returned to his desk the view from the window was a blur of grey and white through the sheeting rain on the glass the muted drone and scream of the wind quite different from the open howl through bare rigging at sea and his heart went out to the seamen facing the worst in this chaos for hours the tempest beat about them from dead south to more in the west a flat hard savage blast that numbed the senses with its roar and venom kydd was unable to work and sat staring at his papers here he was in the warm and dry while others fought for their lives and was laurore in good hands he knew gilbey as a tarpaulin to be sensitive to weather moods but for the same reason he could be relied on to make no concessions to comfort and the frigate would be lying to two anchors jibbing like a frightened horse at the onrush of frenzied seas kydd dozed at his desk but was wide awake at the first sign of light before the winter dawn the storm had diminished to a sullen bluster cold and heartless but the rain had thankfully ceased the sea was in a fret and restless and wherever he peered there was no sight of distant sails clutching an oilskin to himself he went outside and looked towards the mole to see one craft alongside and one poling itself in just two he pretended to exercise pacing up and down the foreshore in the mud among the seaweed and debris thrown up his oilskin ballooning and the cold wind piercing but of his seven vessels by midmorning there was only one further arrival unable to keep up the pretence he returned to the fort but was shortly summoned back um just beyond the point sir a soldier said stolidly leading it was as kydd had dreaded some way out there was the low untidy black outline of a washedup wreck with two figures picking at it with a catch in his throat he started out to it oi sir dont you began the soldier but kydd was not to be stopped and squelched on over the mud then into the heavily discoloured water until he reached the pathetic remains shattered and tangled with seaweedstrewn rope stalwart sir said a petty officer from the fort any two on em only sir the man said pointing to the foreshore where tarpaulincovered bodies lay which hed overlooked in his haste he sloshed back and with the soldier gravely watching he carefully pulled back the covering on one dougal masters mate the pallor of death but a calm face a trace of wistful sadness that was so touching in one on the threshold of manhood kydd tenderly covered it again the other was lieutenant hellard utterly determined to succeed in his first command his features were heavily bruised but not enough to hide the bitter indignation the rage at fate that had been his final emotion kydd turned away this cursed place was touching so many lives he felt hatred rising as he stalked back trailing mud and water into the fort in his office he heard the reports of the three vessels that had survived listening with compassion as the officers recounted their ordeal the hard truth of the matter was that two might be made fit for sea but the third was little more than a wreck brought back by sheer bullheaded courage and matchless skill two to stand before colonia and the massing spanish army it was impossible but the imperatives of war dictated he try conscious of their tired and strained faces kydd nevertheless spoke firmly thats a grim tale which im surell be told in every wardroom in the fleet but heres the rub youre the only ones left to me we have to make a showing off colonia or the dons will take heart and try a crossing gentlemen i desire youll get your craft ready for sea by any means you can contrive in two hours youll put out for colonia and the blockade where youll stay to the last biscuit drop of water and shot they must not sail do you understand me he did what he could finding seamen to bear a hand with repairs soldiers to help with the storing and watering and any small thing he could think of that might in any way make their lot more bearable when he went back to his desk a hovering clerk said apologetically sir a mr serrano t see you seems very anxious an all show him in kydd said that the artist was daring to come to the fort and risk being taken for a spy in the pay of the british must indicate some urgency good in you to come mr er senor serrano a tea perhaps the young man was rumpled and unshaven but had an intensity about him an exaltation even no captain keed no time i will tell you ver important i come as quick as i can genral liniers he coming he trick you while your ships scatter because of the storm hes to make a crossing over when kydd breathed his tiredness vanishing in a flash is not when is where not from colonia del sacramento there he knows you will see him no he march forty mile along to punta pavon at there is deeper an ship can come in close he can load up his boats wi soldiers quickly you cannot see him kydd rummaged for his largestscale chart and found the spot a third of the way back to montevideo sure enough there was a tongue of three or fourfathom water the other side of the ortiz bank coming to within a short distance of the uninhabited coast ships hows he going to get them without we see them move from colonia kydd snapped cudgelling his mind to take in the implications of the alltoopossible stratagem he leave them there an you think he will still cross he brings boats from montevideo many mr serrano i need to know when not more an two days this i hear from the general talking kydd slumped in despair only two to set against a probable armada and they a good sixty miles off in still rough conditions and in two days this is hard news mr serrano are you very sure of what you heard is so sir and youre telling me the truth that is to say no twisters do you swear to it i say it true the young man said set and pale oh im not saying your flamming me kydd said hastily its just as how i must now change plans at the gallop they come i swear it kydd looked into the burning eyes then eased into a smile thank you mr serrano i believe you can we find you some refreshment you must be i go now he whispered and slipped away kydd tried to marshal his thoughts he should go immediately to beresford with the news and the grave admission that the navy was powerless to stop liniers the general would have to improvise his own defences but if only he could report to him with something stirred at the back of his mind he peered again at the chart the tongue of deeper water was indeed an extension of the indented sea passage that gave montevideo its ocean access the sparse soundings were probably unreliable but it was worth a try animated he snatched up the dividers and stepped it out fortyeight miles possible he shouted for the masters mate rouse out our fastest dispatch boat ive orders for laurore frigate as will need it to fly it would be a closerun thing but if the frigate met linierss invasion at sea it would be a massacre grinning savagely he dashed off the order that would have the frigate rendezvous off punta pavon with his remaining two sumacas staunch and protector sobering he took another sheet and carefully outlined the situation for popham setting out his reasoning for working the frigate up to the embarkation point even if it meant stranding the vessel helpless on the mud between tides it would exercise gilbey considerably to lighten the ship to the extreme as well as the tricky task of feeling his way through the shoals and banks was there anything else yes he should make some showing off colonia to assure the spanish that he was still there and blockading for if they suspected he knew of the real embarkation point they would revert back and no frigate could make it up that far there was just one snag he didnt have a ship for the task in frustration he stood up and looked out over the open roadstead before the city there was a huddle of small fry and one or two larger craft like the finelined schooner close in and the europeanlooking shiprigged merchantman circumstances demanded a desperate remedy but what he was contemplating was little more than piracy when the masters mate returned kydd was ready i want a party of twenty good seamen arm them and let me know when theyre mustered aye aye sir it was done now with his orders safely on their way across the stormtorn waters it was time to let beresford know what he had in mind the general smiled thinly i can only suppose you are aware of the legal niceties captain if there is a disinclination to assist and you have a confrontation then theres nothing i can do to intervene or indeed shield you from the rigours of the law should they press suit kydd bit his tongue that beresford was honourable and upright was well known that his high principles would prevent him giving his support to an action that would save his situation was taking it to absurdity i understand sir he replied evenly you have my word therell be no contravention of the law he had until those ships were boarded to think of something the men were waiting when he returned ask the duty lieutenant to join us with our usual interpreter cove he ordered surveying his party these were good men volunteers out of the big ships and reliable the lieutenant appeared out of breath ltenant herrick sorry sir i stand easy sir ive something to say he turned to the little group and stood in an uncompromising quarterdeck brace if you men are the kind of prime hands i think you are looking for a frolic at the expense of the dons then today youll get your fill ive word general liniers thinks to cross secretly from another place only we can stop him and it may turn out to be a firstrate dusting now laurore frigate is on her way to dispute with him weve staunch and protector but need more sail and ive a notion where well find it he had their full attention and as he outlined his plan it turned to a fierce glee ill repeat no man to raise a weapon unless he gets my personal order clear diadems launch was manned kydd himself taking the tiller and they pulled for the schooner there were no colours evident he would have to play this carefully schooner ahoy he hailed a frightened face appeared above a hatch coaming im coming aboard her low freeboard allowed him to step directly on to her deck and he wasted no time what flag he demanded miming the hoisting of one aiya portuguee kydd heaved a sigh of relief the portuguese were neutral but this was no portuguese vessel in his experience they still continued the old custom of the prominent display of a crucifix on the afterdeck to which every officer and seaman made passing obeisance and here the deck was bare more tellingly in his capacity as port captain he had not heard of any such seeking clearance their canny merchants keeping well away until the situation was settled this had to be a local trader seeking to evade port dues he addressed the launch ltenant herrick and five if y please from below two more bemused crewmen appeared and then an apprehensive officer inform this man of who i am that i suspect his vessel of illegal entry to buenos aires he told his interpreter and that im impounding it forthwith it was unheard of to have the captain of the port himself board a harmless trader at the head of an armed party but it had the desired effect the officer babbled nervously then waited while the interpreter said he say he forget t get his paper sign isnt there some way he can possibly kydd said stroking his chin has he a cabin where we can talk some minutes later he came back on deck and with a smile made a mock bow to herrick ltenant this is your new command i wish you to ship guns and make motions before colonia until relieved good luck now for the larger ship it would add presence and should with its row of false gunports give pause to any troopladen vessel it was anchored further out and the launch began shipping water from the stillboisterous seas resolutely they pressed on until they made its lee but kydd had noticed that this ship was an altogether different matter its red flag with three vertical crowns proclaimed it a danziger which he remembered hazily was nominally under the grand duchy but in practical terms a fief of prussia disputed by poland there was no other in sight that was as substantial and he had no alternative but to go through with it as the boathook seized the mainchains he grabbed the manrope and hauled himself over the gunwale to be confronted by a bull of man who stood with his arms folded and feet planted on the deck kydd captain of the port of buenos aires he said in crisp tones you are the captain ja papers kydd said making riffling motions they were produced in the oldfashioned saloon as far as kydds experienced eye could tell they were faultless and flourished last like a trump card were the entry papers to buenos aires signed by kydds own staff he snatched one up this charter party admits youre trading with spain sir another paper was slapped down it was a form of release signed in florid detail by the danzig authorities and countersigned with margin notes by the british consul there nevertheless captain you have attempted to land cargo out of bond contrary to port regulations and i must therefore i haf not broken bulk the bald statement was irrefutable if the freight had not been broached then the cargo was in the same legal position as that of any ship with part retained for the next port and therefore not subject to duty or exaction i jus wait for th spanische to take back buenos aires kydd had been inclined to let him go but this remark made him smoulder a mischievous thought broke in but if it went wrong there was no going back sir i have reason to believe you have been engaged in commerce with france a belligerent power in violation of your status a look of open astonishment was quickly replaced by one of contempt so you vill search me yes kydd snapped and got up abruptly if he was wrong in his estimate of the man it would be nothing short of disastrous he went up on deck and motioned to his men to come aboard he whispered instructions to bolt the petty officer in charge then stood back instead of heading for the monkeyhatch to the hold forward bolt went straight to the masters cabin closely followed by the prussian who was now spluttering with anger ignoring him the men looked for the small hatch let into the deck in which all captains kept private provisions it was opened and bolt dropped into the little storeroom and to kydds intense relief passed up three bottles of best french cognac not the usual schnapps another three down there sir bolt called up helpfully kydd allowed a look of grave displeasure sir i have proof positive that you have been in breach of the law it is now my duty gott in himmel is for my use on voyage half a case and more elsewhere i dare to say kydd said darkly no sir this will not do cognac is not to be obtained without you trade with the enemy i think we must talk together dont you well before sunset standing out beyond the chico bank a small group of oddlooking ships under the flag of king georges navy made a brave sight bound for rendezvous off punta pavon but for kydd the feeling of elation had faded the cold reality was that there were only two effectives staunch and protector the schooner was off colonia and the danzig merchantman would be there but only as a hired vessel to sail about looking fierce and not to engage directly could they stand fast before the unknown number of ships that liniers had been able to muster laurore had been summoned but could she be relied upon to navigate the banks and shoals in time in his borrowed hammock in the saloon sleep evaded kydd in the morning much would be decided into his mind came images of the unforgettable spectacle that he had witnessed only the previous year of nelsons fleet at trafalgar sailing to glory as they defended england against invasion here he was an admiral of his little fleet in much the same position would he fail succeed or die in the attempt at dawn they made landfall down the coast and spent the morning working up towards punta pavon the shoreline was flat drabbrown and monotonous and without any sign of settlement with tension building by the hour they approached the point until a little before midday they raised the slight foreland and not a sail in sight it was inconceivable that they had failed to make contact with a widescattered flotilla heading for buenos aires on the direct course they had taken so the ships and boats for the crossing had not yet arrived from montevideo they were in time but there was no sign of laurore if the transports and their escorts made their appearance it would go hard for them but there was nothing he could do about it other than be prepared to sacrifice them all in an attempt to deter the crossing while they waited there was no point in uselessly sailing back and forth and he ordered an anchoring with doubled lookouts an hour passed two kydd climbed the stumpy shrouds and scanned the hinterland with his pocket telescope he saw nothing the spanish army was either on its way out of sight inland or well concealed for now he sent away boats to take soundings all round with the hand lead to give him a picture of their room for manoeuvre which turned out to be little enough outside their length of deeper water evening drew in and kydd deployed the two sumacas to the south by turns during the hours of darkness to give warning of the approach of the enemy then stood his men down another endless night began condemning him to the sleeplessness of tension and worry when a wan sun rose the next morning it revealed a waste of cold grey but nothing else he sent the men to breakfast but could not face his own greasy offering and remained on deck gazing resentfully at the shore in the middle of the morning the situation changed completely sail hooooo heart bumping kydd leaped for the shrouds and trained his glass southwards barely visible against the cheerless murk was a sight that he could never mistake the topsails of laurore frigate it was a wonderful glorious vision that pricked at his eye she was under triplereefed sails and moving slowly ahead on either bow two boats leading and no one could deny that she was quite inexpressibly breathtakingly beautiful she came to in the danzigers lee correctly recognising kydds flag in the bluff merchantman as the senior he wasted no time in going to her blankfaced the boatswain piped him aboard with what seemed her entire company watching on well done mr gilbey youre in time for our little party he said unable to stop himself shaking hands heartily with his first lieutenant behind him was curzon and beyond him renzi watching gravely were glad t have you back aboard sir its been a rare trial judging from gilbeys grey face it had been a nightmare of responsibility for him officers to muster in ten minutes if you please in my cabin that longedfor yearnedfor familiar haven with all its comforts and appointments dear brother if youll pardon my remarking it your appearance gives pause to all who love you oh kydd said well nicholas i have to confess to some difficult times er i do have to say this claret tastes like nectar of the gods he added just so weve been hearing rumours concerning conditions in the city that are a mort unsettling do you wish to talk at all not now old bean the spanish are mounting a counterattack here were to stop them joining with their friends the gauchos on the far side then theyre not yet persuaded of the felicities of british administration kydd put down his glass sharply i know how you feel about the commodore and his scheme but im to tell you were seeing this through b god i have my reservations yes but they dont prevent me offering my services to you in these entangled times as you know i have the spanish and thank you nicholas thats well said im bound to tell you however weve enough spanish speakers and er more mouths to feed would be unwelcome i believe kydd however saw the sincerity and tried to make amends im sorry i havent had time to bear more of a fist with your novel m friend its just been so pay no mind to it brother its done that is complete finished well now and youre to be truly congratulated old fellow kydd said warmly um what happens next as will see you a copperbottomed author at all renzi gave a halfsmile to be truthful im not so sure a pile of papers into which ive put my heart and soul means a lot to me but will it to the world theres only one way to find out kydd said firmly i know thats why i took the opportunity to send it off in a mail with narcissus and the bullion what without you have some lawyer cove draw you up a legal thing as will save you from plaguey copyists and so forth ill have you know the business is too complex by half it has to be entered at stationers hall and um other things which im not to be expected to know and so ive placed it all in the hands of mr john murray with instructions that he may do with it as he will in my interests kydd sat back appalled so if he prints it he may set his own price on the book and give you naught but a paupers bauble im bound to say it seems to me a wry way to proceed nicholas renzi drew himself up mr murray is a gentleman its done he said defensively and nothing more to be said there was an awkward pause so he went on in a different tone then you are receiving satisfaction from mr serrano a young man of some ardour it would seem we are kydd chuckled in fact it was his timely warning that told us of this spanish trickery now time presses my friend and i have to see my officers before the battle almost lighthearted he brought them together and explained the situation the more he spoke the better he felt even with a warship of comparable strength present to oppose them laurore would put paid to any sally by liniers any questions sir when will curzon never finished the sentence as clear above their talking came the urgent hail of the masthead lookout sail kydd leaped to his feet and pounded up to the quarterdeck fumbling for his glass which he had up as soon as he could see the southern horizon at first he couldnt spot anything and began searching more carefully until the master pointed out that the sail was actually to the north puzzled he swivelled round and focused in the other direction in a few minutes he made out that it was a lone sail and schoonerrigged it couldnt be but it was herrick had abandoned his place off colonia and was heading towards them at a great clip through his glass kydd saw that the schooners sails were ragged with holes and pockmarks of shotstrike showed dark against the hull with a growing sense of dread he waited captain kydd sir herricks voice floated across the water its edge of urgency clutching at kydds heart yes the schooner rounded to brailing up sir ive news the dons have sortied from colonia i did my best but so many say again kydd shouted down at the powderstained and bandaged figure more for time to think i have it from a prisoner that they sailed together for las conchas i brought em to action but only winged a few i thought it my duty to acquaint you without delay shocked to the core kydd felt desolation and fury there could be only one possible explanation for what had happened he had been utterly and comprehensively deceived cynically betrayed by serrano decoyed away from the true crossing point and now the fate of buenos aires was sealed chapter youve just missed him sir clinton said hes marched out to meet the spanish advance keyed up to explain himself to the general kydd searched the marine officers face but saw no condemnation pity or contempt did he leave any orders for me he asked none sir apparently when liniers had made his crossing he had joined very quickly with pueyrredons gauchos the blandengues and others and was now advancing on buenos aires beresford had wanted to deal with the threat as soon as possible and had stripped the city of most of its troops and left for the north at a rapid pace with the number of his field guns much increased by earlier captures with the discipline and experience of the highlanders on the battlefield there was every hope that even heavily outnumbered he could at least cause a halt in the advance and gain time for the reinforcements to arrive kydd looked around the fort was near deserted the only men those on guard duty then who is the garrison commander clinton grinned awkwardly i do confess its me and if its orders you seek then they are that i desire you tell me what happened kydd took a seat i did what i thought right at the time he said defiantly lifting his chin and i vow id do it again should i have the same information as then he had no need to justify himself to his junior lieutenant of marines but he wanted to get it off his chest and he suspected clinton had realised this whoever gave serrano his falsehearted lay knew what he was about and no time for me to send reconnaissance to verify and it had to be a strike with all my ships so they came up with a convincing enough tale and a likely place on the chart and i was gulled he glowered for a moment and added with heat and that bloody dog did swear on his honour to the truth of it may his soul roast in hell just so sir clinton said leaning forward in sympathy its done and theres nothing more to be said about it kydd concluded bitterly and whos to say with a bare handful of sail left to me would we have prevailed consumed by restlessness and frustration he stood and paced about the room there has to be something the navy can do theres the royal blues sir theyre with the general now and hes openly declared theyre worth a battalion in the field kydd didnt answer this was not the best use of a navy he could think of countless devastating exploits that had changed the course of many a campaign from bombardment with the equivalent of a regiment of artillery to daring raids by marines there was nothing for it he couldnt just sit around waiting im to go to the general i believe he found beresford at the edge of the city with his troops at rest but drenched after yet another heavy rain squall he looked up dully his eyes tired and bloodshot yes captain general i came to offer my most earnest apologies for for linierss crossing dont be do you really think youre the first commander to be betrayed by false intelligence no sir ive always thought it to be the mark of a leader that he makes his determination on the best evidence acts on it and if it goes against him does not repine kydd felt a surge of both anguish and warmth that the man who must take the consequences of his decision had not held it against him sir is there any service we can perform for you even carronades on our smaller vessels might thank you no beresford muttered do you see there he pointed ahead to where the heavily rutted stony road gave way to a puddled quagmire of red mud after that frightful rain theres no point in trying to haul guns through that still less the bogs beyond theyre pleased to call pasture no kydd i have my own decision to make and that as harsh as the one you faced sir i will teach you something of military affairs that all strategy fails if the gods decree that nature aligns with the enemy consider we defeated the spanish and their superior cavalry numbers in the field because we deployed in line and square as needs must and none may stand against us in going as bad as this aught but a wretched swampy mire our infantry will struggle hopelessly in the mud not so the enemy for horses will make light of such should i send my columns forward they will find it impossible to move rapidly when necessary in order to draw up in square my brave fellows will therefore be cut to pieces by their cavalry you must fall back to retreat my duty as i see it is to play out the game to gain every hour i can for those wretched reinforcements to come not to mention what a regrettable effect it would have on morale on highlanders not accustomed to retreat and on the city which sees us cowed by general liniers and his host um then hold position here sir deny the enemy entry to buenos aires even that will not be possible in a city of this size any halfcompetent commander will try to circle around our rear and cut us off while they retake it and general liniers is a wily sort french did you know that in the spanish service these thirty years fought against us before the revolution sir i beg youll tell me what else is possible kydd said uncomfortably nothing of these alternatives i must choose the least bad at one extreme i could fall back in the face of impossible odds leave buenos aires to the spanish and quit the country but this can never be in consideration at the other i could move forward to endeavour to inflict as much damage on liniers as i can but at grievous cost this also is not to be contemplated not for the pity of the thing but that id then have too few to garrison the city therefore beresford shook his head sadly therefore i choose to contest his entry with half my force the other half to return and secure the city colonel pack sir he called out kydd knew what was being said this was a fighting retreat but a retreat for all that liniers would have parties out probing thrusting and must eventually drive a wedge in beresfords forward elements causing it to fall back by stages the only saving grace was that even he could see that city streets were not the place for cavalry and the two armies would in these terms at least be on a level footing as far as naval support went a battlefield hidden among the streets would make targeting from seaward out of the question an impossibility but surely there must be tasks for the navy to do when beresford had concluded his dispositions he cast one long look about him exchanged deepfelt salutes with pack his forward commander then moved off with half of his men some five hundredodd only less than a single battalion to hold a modern city the column marched off to the sound of a defiant piper joined by another until heads high the proud scots were swinging along as if on parade before the world as the suburbs became denser so did the onlookers this time there was little curiosity only a sullen hostile stare from balconies came catcalls and jeers then ugly shouts that had an edge of contempt there was now a different mood a surging restlessness a tension that radiated out from tight knots of people others hurried to distance themselves in another interminable rain flurry they at last halted by the colonnades of the plaza mayor outside the fort kydd followed beresford and a conclave of officers was hastily convened clinton was appointed secondincommand after captain arbuthnot for the internal security of the city beresford went off to begin his dispatches and kydd settled down to the task of finding work for the navy the front line would need supply provisions rum gunpowder what better than to ship it in as the line moved forward or back it would need escort and his newly released staunch and protector could do the job and just as important was the sea guard protection of the army from seaward raids and then of course operations against the enemys own supply lines as well there was but where was he going to get the hulls or the crews so many good ships and seamen had been lost in the storm it was becoming difficult to concentrate he had been shifted into clintons office to make way for others beresford wanted as many as possible brought inside the forts walls a subaltern arrived and reported to clinton that the sentries who had been posted at key points were being harassed taunted muskets stolen threatened kydd felt for the young men out on their own in this treacherous and alien place but they had a vital part to play if they withdrew they would be giving up the city to the enemy his own concerns claimed his attention again provisions in the cask were heavy and cumbersome water was a critical matter how many barrels could be stacked on say those flat fishing craft he could seize a few and set up a running supplyline and be damned to the noise from their owners perhaps it would be better to preserve staunch and protector for gun action at a stirring below and raised voices kydd looked up as an angry popham stalked in we shall speak alone sir he demanded sharply kydd got to his feet there is no such in this building sir popham snorted you he snapped at clinton out until i say return clinton hesitated but left with an awkward glance at kydd now sir youll tell me how in hades you managed singlehanded to destroy this expedition kydd reddened but kept his temper i beg to differ dasher my blockade was sound until the pampero and then you let em pass and now my entire enterprise is under dire threat the my did not escape kydd he replied curtly after the storm i was left with just two sail even if id been athwart their course when they sallied i could not have stopped them you didnt even try kydd took a deep breath and replied levelly if i had wed now be left with not a single armed vessel to see off attacks or escort supply popham glowered at him but said nothing his hollow eyes and haggard face betrayed an inner torment that kydd could only guess at forced to stay idle in the big ships that were on watch in the outer reaches of the river plate while the destiny of his adventure was decided by others aware that failure was now not impossible and his was the responsibility nevertheless i find your conduct questionable sir to say the least there are those kydd said quietly who say venturing upon an invasion without we have reinforcements assured is how dare you popham exploded his face white you you have the temerity to criticise me this expedition was soundly conceived but ill have you know brought to hazard by others ill not be cried down by the likes of you my most junior captain b god sir youre being ill not forget this kydd if we fail its to your tally ill sheet home the blame for the whole bloody thing be damn sure about that he stood for a moment chest heaving then stormed out after a decent interval clinton came in taking his chair without catching kydds eye and busied himself with a paper kydd tried to compose himself he had nothing to be ashamed of and be damned to popham if he tried to prove otherwise there was vital work to do and he wasnt about to let that suffer on his account he picked up his quill and resumed his order to take up three fishing boats as evening drew in the subaltern appeared again to address clinton ive a strange thing to report sir if youll hear it helped by dodd whose calm acceptance of discomfort and danger was unfailing clinton had been assigning night duties in such a way that nearby support could be summoned quickly if there were any outbreaks of trouble it was not an easy task and he looked up distracted er what is it then in the barracks sir one of my privates was cleaning his musket when the damnedest thing happened he was tapping his firelock on the floor when it disappeared clinton sighed youre not making yourself clear old bean the musket it went right through a hole and he lost it he called over his sergeant and they found that there was a suspicious cavity underneath where it had fallen and beg it be inspected not now im afraid im too busy impulsively kydd stood up ill go need to stretch the legs thats kind in you sir clinton said gratefully sarnt dodd will go with you er a sword would not be noticed they left by the main gate striding out into the gathering dark towards the barracks two streets distant as they turned the corner without warning a screeching crowd with clubs ran towards them instantly the three drew their swords and back to back awaited the onslaught it never came the mob hesitated at the sight of the steel then with derisory shouts ran away down a passage rum lot sir dodd said sheathing a stout highland broadsword he had somehow acquired the lads never could work em out the barracks fronted on to a grand street and in the quarters for privates located in the lower part a ring of offduty soldiers stood around a splintered plank they drew back as kydd approached he peered into the blackness of a void underneath a probe with a broomhandle found nothing tear up the boards he ordered out of the gloom the outlines of a small passageway or tunnel appeared bring a lantern it could be nothing but an old bolthole for soldiers to slip out into the town or was it something more sinister kydd held the light over the hole and there below was a row of round familiar objects he went icy cold if these really were stand clear im going down he grunted swinging his legs over and dropping into the pit more light he went to the first object now there was no doubt thirtysix barrels of gunpowder lay beneath the barracks in a plot to wipe out in one blast half of beresfords army struck dumb by the enormity kydd took some moments to recover he looked about him the tunnel led away deep into the pitch darkness were they still there sarnt dodd come with me dodd lowered himself in peering around apprehensively kydd asked for two pistols and a lantern to be lowered crouching they set off into the blackness it seemed to go on for ever but the tunnel was straight and the wavering light reached well ahead it ended in a stone cellar with dusty stores and a wooden ladder going up to a small trapdoor kydd eased it up very carefully light spilling in as he did so and all became clear the little group looking down the hole in the barrackroom floor started with surprise when kydd and dodd magically appeared behind them turn out the guard kydd said briefly we know where theyre coming from sir the convent of st francis opposite under the protection and assurances of the bishop the convent and other sanctuaries had been exempted from access by the british and that trust had been betrayed clinton was concerned at the revelation of the tunnel but had other pressing problems to deal with a sentry had been assaulted by a masked figure whirling a bolas the deadly efficient gaucho method of bringing down steers hed then been badly beaten five men had simply disappeared for kydd there was unsettling news four feluccas had reached buenos aires they were full of militia from the south and attempted to land them behind the lines a small sea battle had ended with their withdrawal but if the spanish had the sense to make a massed attack with more it was certain that kydds tiny navy would be overcome he fought off a sense of inevitability and doom and when the victuallers failed to arrive from rio de janeiro it was four upon two the meagre rations of two men now shared four ways night brought with it its own terrors sleep in the barracks was once shattered by a demented screeching and howling outside that went on and on an armed party sent outside returned whitefaced wild dogs had been staked under the walls then flayed alive and left and in the morning the naked and mangled body of one of the missing soldiers was found on the foreshore was this the beginning of the end chapter the sound of trumpets echoed up from whitehall avenue grenville hurried to the window of the admiralty quite neglecting the table of grave faces that were discussing the war at sea i say what a grand sight the prime minister exclaimed come and see you fellows with a scraping of chairs the others dutifully obliged moving to the long windows to peer down into the crowdlined streets in the distance the head of a cavalcade was approaching an escort of the loyal britons volunteers proudly stepping out with fixed bayonets to the sound of two military bands people were shouting and cheering urging on the colourful parade in waves of joyfulness my word but ive not seen the mobility so exercised since trafalgar murmured sidmouth the lord privy seal even the torpid figure of fox the notorious but ageing foreign secretary gained some measure of animation an theyve little enough to cheer these last months since austerlitz he grunted since that climactic confrontation at sea napoleon had raged about europe winning one titanic battle after another this had brought the late pitts coalition to ruin and had rendered england without friends and alone in the war once more now however they had a victory better than that there was plunder treasure that took a stream of wagons each drawn by six horses to make the journey from portsmouth to the bank of england the thump of drums grew louder and details of the procession clearer what flags that enquired grenville noticing a royal marine holding aloft a green and gold tasselled banner in the first wagon ive been told its that of the viceroyalty of peru my lord viscount howick the first lord of the admiralty said sourly and the others flags various taken at buenos aires the procession came nearer the shouts more strident each wagon had a large pennant aloft bearing the single word treasure woven with blue ribbons and drawn behind each was a gleaming brass fieldpiece taken from the enemy nice touch sidmouth grunted appreciatively the cavalcade came to a ceremonial halt below their window a smart party of royal marines emerged from the front portico bearing a banner of blue silk with words in gold buenos aires popham beresford victory and carried it out to a carriage where captain donnelly of narcissus graciously accepted it on behalf of the gallant soldiers and sailors so far away come now charles why so peevish grenville said the government could safely be said to be at least by implication responsible for this ray of light into the dark miseries of war the mans insufferable very plausible and has insinuating manners howick blustered had the hide to dress up a pirate raid on the spanish as a tilt at liberation popham id have thought weve reason enough to be grateful he sails off on some unplanned treasurehunting expedition and then starts badgering me to find reinforcements from somewhere for his whimsy isnt that what we want in a commander pluck and enterprise he left station without so much as a byyourleave the first lord snorted which for the navy you can be very sure will earn any commander a courtmartial at the trot like nelson grenville responded lightly the great admirals legendary and unauthorised race across the atlantic had necessarily been accepted by the admiralty hmm popham was lucky he takes a city the size of bristol with a handful of men and ships then trumpets it to all the world like a fairground huckster pens letters that puff south america as the next big market after india and gets the city all in a tizzy now i dont suppose i can touch him hes the peoples hero in the wide street below the bands started up again and the parade got under way heading for a grand climax along pall mall the two men watched it together as it disappeared around the corner i dare say i should get reinforcements out to the villain muttered howick the plaza de toros the bullring was at the retiro in the north of the city after dark in the moonless night it was approached from three directions by a silent stream of men and equipment by midnight general liniers had an encampment established within the city the only british in this district were a sergeant and seventeen men of the st who occupied a derelict house in the predawn cold a tired sentry was aroused by the sound of dogs barking maniacally he woke his sergeant who was in no doubt of what was happening go as fast as y legsll carry you an tell colonel pack theyre on the move he told the lad say ill hold em as long as i can the sixteen soldiers were posted in fours covering each other steel glittered in the early light as bayonets were fixed and after hed told them what he expected the sergeant solemnly shook hands with each man then sent him out a wellaimed shot crashed out in the silence and felled the first blandengue turning the corner return fire was ineffective the disciplined highlanders spaced their own to cover reloading and the advance was halted the enemy recovered and spread out before making a first charge this was stopped within yards fleeing men stumbling over bodies sprawled in the street then they split their numbers advancing down several streets simultaneously the sergeant placed his men in pairs to confront them but now there was a tidal wave of attackers one went down the other snatching up his musket but the enemy saw their chance and closed with them in a welter of blood the exulting spanish hacked and gouged at the bodies as they surged forward pack drew in his outer guard and sent for field guns these were positioned at street intersections loaded with grape they could quickly be wheeled round and fired down any street where the enemy were massing that night beresford ordered a counterattack three parties set out at four in the morning one to steal along the riverbank while the other two circled around to drive in from the flank this was however a city in a feverish state of alert and very soon they were detected and found themselves fighting for their lives soon the british had no alternative but to pull back and tighten their defences then at eleven in the morning there came a defining moment colonel pack at the head of his advance guard was trying to hold the line in the face of impossible numbers when the firing began to fall off in less than an hour it had stopped completely into the silence came an eerie distant thumping it strengthened until a small group appeared at the end of the long avenue an ornately dressed officer in a plumed hat was preceded by a soldier with a massive drum on which he kept up a steady double beat ta ta boom ta ta boom behind him two soldiers supported a large white flag of truce lets hear him then pack growled it was the virrey diputado quintana who had earlier met them at the gates of the city to proffer surrender this time he bore a letter from general liniers it was addressed to the commanderinchief of the british forces general beresford pack found a close escort for quintana and he was taken to the fort where beresford it seemed was not about to be impressed the general is in conference and will see you in due course quintana was told and shown to an anteroom where he sat with his letter fuming when at last he was ushered in he wasted no time standing rigidly erect he intoned sir comandante liniers is privy to your difficulties in every wise and demands you give up the city of buenos aires beresford gave a thin smile sir im unaccustomed to demands placed upon my person by others still less by a foreign officer good day to you sir with a brief bow he turned on his heel to leave general beresford sir i have a letter from the commanderinchief of the spanish forces comandante general santiago liniers i give you joy of it beresford said tightly sir sir the letter it contains it is very important very well read it beresford commanded his interpreter it began by pointing out that the british had seized buenos aires in the first place by an audacious stroke enabled by a lack of direction of the population but these same inspired by patriotic enthusiasm and led by regular troops under a full general were now about to fall on beresfords tiny force it ended with an ultimatum demanding unconditional surrender by one oclock why this is nothing but a threat sir beresford said in mock astonishment but do allow me to consider it for a space and i shall pen a reply quintana was led away expressionless gentlemen beresford said after his officers had assembled the dons are in earnest i believe clinton grinned and whispered to kydd if the commodore knew whats in contemplation id wager hed have an apoplexy do put a stopper on your jawing tackle william kydd wondered how the general would style his withdrawal it was fast becoming clear that buenos aires must be abandoned either now or in the near future if there were to be an orderly evacuation the rearguard must be supported at the same time as the main body was extracted but without a wharf or normal port facilities it could be a hardfought action for the navy beresford finally spoke briefly and abruptly i do not propose to accede to this demand my duty is clear to hold the city until reinforced which at this time i expect hourly i shall not be quitting my post until then you may believe gentlemen i shall remain here as long as it is within my power to do so there would be no withdrawal no retreat out of the city no return to the fleet just a holding out until kydd glanced at clinton whose expression sobered then turned grave the general issued various orders then turned to kydd sir i would ask that you find a transport to take off our sick and wounded to be at the mole before one this was barely disguised advice to any whose business was not at the end of a gun that they should for their own safety leave with them kydd told the general he would attend to the transport directly but did that include himself a siege was without question a matter for the army which didnt need distractions for him with few ships left and no port to speak of perhaps it were better he left quietly and returned to laurore then accusingly a vivid recollection came of the time when he was a junior lieutenant at the siege of acre fighting alongside the army together they had held out against napoleon bonaparte in person and prevailed their victory owed squarely to the tenacity and loyalty of the navy if only to honour that memory he must stay and do what he could taking clinton aside he told him im coming back after i get the wounded away i have some ideas ill need a dozen of your royal blues which id be obliged if youd find for me at my return clintons gaze was level and calm itll be done sir the mole was only a short distance from the fort and there was no firing on the injured soldiers as they were trundled over the mud on the highwheeled carts and laid gently on the deck of the transport kydd noted with concern that for a hundred yards or so it was open ground to the mole if their final withdrawal was contested this might be a bloody place indeed but he put these qualms to one side for there was work to do he planned to create a floating artillery platform that could lie offshore and fire into the enemy this would need to be the shallowestdraught vessel he could find that would bear carriage guns an empty grain brig oddly named iasthma was conveniently at anchor offshore kydd bundled out its captain and crew and set his party to preparing it as best they might it was simple but effective everything possible was offloaded sails furniture victuals spars stores and on the bare deck cannon were lined up to form a onesided broadside to manoeuvre a kedge would be streamed out forward and another aft sailpower would be replaced by hard work at the capstan but now at least they had means to fight back he wished them well and returned to the fort knowing the unearthly quiet would end at one oclock a distant trumpet bayed it was taken up by another out to the left and one more to the south an ugly surging roar sounded in response coming ominously from all three directions it meant that liniers had succeeded in flanking pack and his line and now the net was tightening the fighting was vicious and onesided although pack could command the streets with his artillery it was the city buildings themselves that were his greatest foe in deference to the sultry heat of summer each had a flat roof edged for safety with a modest wall all round enemy marksmen quickly found these an admirable parapet and firing down made a hell of blood and death for the english gunners and any who stood to fight iasthma hauled herself up and down the seafront stopping only to open up with a crash of guns when enemy troops showed themselves at one point liniers ordered two of the spanish field guns down to the shore and a gun duel opened a hit brought down her mizzen and with it her ensign wild cheering erupted from the enemy a nimble sailor however quickly had the colours aloft once more on the bare mainmast and her crew gave savage cheers as they threw themselves into serving their guns then for reasons that couldnt be made out from the shore the brave vessel took fire flames starting from her after end and rapidly finding naked powder charges which flared and blazed her guns stopped and in minutes her crew were in the water making for the land to inevitable death or capture beresford had no choice he pulled in his forces so that only the big square the plaza mayor was being defended and this with every gun and soldier he had captain ive no right to ask it of you he said in a low voice to kydd if i had any means of landing a force behind their lines to delay justina was one of the few vessels left in the roadstead she had fulfilled her charter as troop transport and had been hovering waiting for the rich cargoes promised now she was at anchor and deserted her crew long since fled i shall need volunteers kydd replied thinking of the gallant royal blues fighting on land this would be more to their liking and he knew he could count on them the st helena men have volunteered beresford said missing his meaning artillery men all they begged a more active war kydd was touched that faroff island a tiny speck in the vast wastes of the atlantic and since these were east india company men there was no compelling reason for them to be in this fearful cauldron he nodded thank you sir well sail immediately it took a moment or two for kydd to shift from a landbound perspective back to the imperatives of the open sea a respectable northeasterly was building so it would be closehauled on the starboard tack and the tide safely making with no doubt a useful northerly current it was possible clinton had another royal blues detachment mustered ready there were set faces among them iasthmas fate might well be their own but none had been conscripted into the venture and all knew the risks an army subaltern reported that men had now been posted to cover the embarkation at the mole and it was time to leave i i would wish you well of the day sir clinton said extending his hand in his eyes kydd saw a look almost of pleading and felt a chill presentiment steal over him thank you william he replied his handshake lingering on an impulse he unbuckled his sword belt and handed across the fine blade that his canadian uncle had provided for him and that he had treasured since crossing the miraculous gulf to become an officer take care of this until i return will you he settled the broad baldric of a cutlass across his shoulders then found a stout weapon testing its edge and slipped it into its scabbard goodbye my friend he said simply and left with his men outside the fort there was a lethal chaos of bullets and stone splinters men ran crouched while marines at the corners of the building fired up at windows and rooftops until they reached the boats and pushed off looking back as the boat pulled out strongly kydd saw a pall of powdersmoke drifting up from all around the dark bulk of the fort battle sounds floated out over the water and a choking atmosphere of war and waste was fast clamping in justina was in a neglected state rigging slack and hanging her sails mildewed and dank but by the time the last boatload of st helenas had come alongside to join the royal blues they were ready to cast to the wind no one spoke as they passed the city then bore away to close with the land kydd reasoned that after theyd passed the front line there would be far fewer of the enemy beresford needed a distraction in the enemys rear if he placed his raiding force at any point from now on it would cause maximum shock and dismay and conceivably a lessening of pressure at the front liniers would be forced to turn back to deal with it they were sailing close to the chill northeasterly and made heavy going of the short steep waves it kicked up but they had the tide in their favour something niggled at the back of his brain about the combination but nothing crystallised and he shrugged it off he tried to find a place for the landing but no spot suggested itself possibly that small tussocked headland the tiller was brought over and under brailed course they nosed inshore the st helenas readied themselves for without boats they would have to wade to the beach then an unwelcome puff of white smoke showed at the shoreline and another they would have to fight their way in the merchantman had only four sixpounders of doubtful vintage but these were plied with ferocity their rage kicking up gouts of earth around the positions on the foreshore which then fell silent musket fire came from a warehouse and justinas guns banged out windows disappeared and black holes peppered the walls before there too resistance ceased if they were going to make their move now was the time ease away he ordered and the ship swung in to a closer angle foul water a seaman shrieked forward hard t starbd kydd snarled there was a mudshoal or some such ahead but the clumsy vessel shied from the wind and slowly they ceased their forward motion it was the worst of situations not only were they prevented from going anywhere but they had lost that most priceless asset to a ship under sail her manoeuvrability and of course without boats there was no chance of hauling off they could only wait and pray that the incoming tide would lift them off however minutes later a troop of cavalry appeared along the shore cantering along as they spied out the situation justinas guns opened up and the leading horseman went down in a flurry of kicking but the rest increased to a reckless gallop until they were out of range then turned and milled about in a watchful group kydd had known there would be cavalry in their rear but they had come up so fast certainly now all ideas of a landing would have to be revised he improvised a hand lead with a belaying pin and went about the stationary vessel taking soundings expecting to find it shallower forward at the mudbank and deeper aft he found to his surprise that it was the same all around the treacherous rio de la plata had betrayed them one of its inexplicable winddriven surges had sent the mass of its headwater back against the tide flow and now the broad expanse of mudflats was beginning to drain and would leave them high and dry the cruel twist was hard to bear and he knew he must make some very bleak choices in the near future the cavalry made another pass and justinas guns thundered sending up gouts of mud and water that deterred the horsemen who raced away to regroup again but kydd had seen one other thing his gunners had slammed in their quoins to their maximum and the guns were now at the extremity of depression it meant that as the ship settled on its muddy bed it was canting over very soon the guns facing the shore would be pointing helplessly at the sky and on the other side directly into the sea and mud the cavalry troop was now being joined by a larger mass of horsemen galloping along the wide strip of wet mud down by the shoreline in minutes they would notice justinas plight and then they would make their charge and they were completely helpless kydd tried to cudgel his brain into providing some last ingenious trick that would see them sail away but theyre coming led by an officer in plumes and frogging waving a sabre the mass of horsemen splashed into the water in a glorious charge towards them there were no longer any options kydd opened his mouth to order the colours to be struck but of course there were none justina not being in naval commission in an ultimate stroke of irony they were to be massacred because they could not surrender he sent a nervous soldier below to find a bedsheet which was hung over the side just in time with much splashing and triumphant whoops the cavalry sheathed their sabres and noisily surrounded the vessel the officer shouted hoarsely and they obediently fell back to allow him to get through and climb on to the low maindeck snatching off his tall shako he swept down in a deep bow when he rose kydd saw a preposterously young man with intelligent and finedrawn features teniente martin miguel de guemes your service sir he said the fortunes of war and this ship is prize of his catholic majesty he held out both hands meaningfully his cup of bitterness full kydd slowly unbuckled and rendered up his weapon his career as a sea officer ended a bullet struck the fort roof parapet near clinton and ricocheted off he felt the usual sting of stone chips but this was more serious they were being fired on from a higher angle he looked about the chaos of smoke and dust and spied where it was coming from the san miguel church sarnt dodd weve got to get to those rascals or theyll make it impossible to man our guns the sergeant nodded oi you two he called and two marines left their embrasures to report follow me clinton ordered and rattled down the steps to the base of the fort the square was alive with men guns and noise and as they raced across to the ornate church at the corner the air was choked with acrid gunsmoke the whip and zing of unseen missiles they reached the massive doors dodd tried to force them open but their solidity resisted all his panting efforts bayonets their points were levered into cracks and the butts of their muskets used as battering rams but to no avail when one of the marines fell with a cry the effort was abandoned ill do it ifn youll leave me at it dodd gasped hefting a length of market timber no get back and cover me clinton hoisted the wounded marine over his shoulder and stumbled back towards the fort other soldiers were racing to get there too this must be the last act every man was being pulled back into the citadel with a roar of triumph the crowd pressed forward but beresford had positioned guns at the gate and smallercalibre weapons on the roof and with the square now evacuated there was a clear field of fire a double charge of grape erupted and the far side of the square was instantly transformed into a carpet of dead and wounded the remainder fleeing musket fire was futile against the thick stone of the fort and under the threat of the british guns there would be no sudden storming it was stalemate beresford stood among his officers gravely troubled gentlemen it now appears time to consider the last sanction we have done what we can but the reinforcements have not arrived therefore i have decided to withdraw where is mr kydd pray im sorry to say sir that he has not returned from the diversionary raid we can only assume he is captured or a shadow passed across the generals face so many good men he whispered clinton spoke sir any evacuation by sea cannot now be in contemplation there is open ground before the mole and with the state of the tide as it is then i understand you sir pack said heavily an theres no route south the blandengoes are there in strength and the gauchos to the north added another it was beresfords decision and his alone then i have no alternative gentlemen to avoid vain loss of life in two hours i shall ask general liniers for terms pray do what you must to prepare in the shocked silence he turned on his heel and left them that the british army the conqueror of cape town and so recently buenos aires was to capitulate to a few spanish regulars and a ragtag host of militia cowherders and townsfolk was an intolerable shame and tears could be seen in the eyes of some officers his mind reeling at the turn of events clinton called the faithful dodd to his office and together they went through papers adding them to a pile destined for destruction as they worked a lump rose in his throat it was likely that as an officer he would at some point in the future be exchanged but men like dodd through no fault of their own would now face incarceration in an enemy land for possibly years in the heightened atmosphere the thought threatened to unman him he excused himself and pretended to look for something he couldnt let it happen not to this man finding his pen he scribbled fast on a paper signed it carefully folded it twice then sealed it the outside he left blank no address er dodd i have a last service for you if you can sah there was no resentment no sullen reproach just a calm acceptance of how things had turned out now this is a secret dispatch and it is to go to the commanding officer of hms laurore sah its of vital importance do you think it possible you could deliver it dodd hesitated his open face working with emotion sir if they youre a reliable longservice sergeant who else may i trust if not you snapping to rigid attention dodd threw off a quivering salute to his officer hell get em sir i knows how right well go now and the best of luck the british colours at the flagstaff lowered and when they were raised again they were over a white flag of truce seeking a parley this was greeted by an instant roar of gratification the square was invaded by a joyous incoherent rabble cheering and firing into the air there would be no respectful falling back to allow the principals of both sides to conduct negotiations on neutral ground the scene quickly became rudely chaotic some planting field guns opposite the gateway and many shouting taunts and firing muskets at any british they could see in a wild and uncontrollable uproar a yell of triumph heralded the arrival of an officer it was quintana who was carried shoulderhigh through the seething mob to the very gates of the citadel at a sign from beresford they were flung open and the rabble found themselves at the muzzle of two guns and a ring of steel and held back angrily quintana went in to redoubled fury and shooting after the gate had been closed he bravely ran up to the roof and throwing open his splendid coat to show himself berated the rabble for their indiscipline negotiations were brief in the circumstances there was no other recourse immediate and unconditional surrender after some hours regular spanish troops arrived to bring order and comandante general liniers made his appearance beresford went out to meet him after linierss sincere expressions of regret at the behaviour of his men terms were agreed and he accepted the generals sword finally the highlanders left their positions marching out together tears of frustration and rage on many they halted and the colours of the st highland regiment were given up to the enemy the officers were then separated from their men who were taken off to the other end of the square where they were ordered to ground arms many threw down their muskets bitterly before being placed in three ranks under guard such a brave and pitiful sight brought a catch in clintons throat these few hundred who had achieved so much then to be overcome by numbers so overwhelming they were marched away to catcalls and defiant shouts which left no doubt that their captivity would not be easy quintana asked the officers to go back into the fort where they were invited to sign a book of parole general beresford stepped forward first there seemed little point in refusing and clinton added his own name after that nothing seemed to matter any more chapter boooat ahoy the forward lookout yelled into the night with laurore at such a pitch of nervous tension and her first lieutenant pacing the deck like a pennedup hound it would never do to allow a stranger to approach too near without challenge an answering shout came weak and distant gilbey arrived to stand beside the lookout tell that lubber t stand away or hell get a cold shot in the guts he said peevishly the hail was dutifully made but the little fishermans punt kept on obstinately a single indistinct figure at the oars when he was close enough he stood up swaying and hailed back in unmistakable english laurore ahoy one t come aboard men scrambled up from below eager to hear any news and with them renzi who had become increasingly troubled since the betrayal at punta pavon they had lain at anchor for several days waiting for orders or even word of how matters stood for their friends and shipmates ashore one to come aboard agreed gilbey slowly and painfully the figure came up the side by the time he swung inboard an eager welcoming committee was waiting for him begob its sarnt dodd an excited babble broke out and gilbey thundered hold y tongues silence fore n aft make yr report sergeant dodd straightened with difficulty bad news sir th worst get on with it well as weve struck t the spanish sir after a moment of shocked surprise there was pandemonium silence gilbey yelled anyone says a word more goes t the bilboes he waited for quiet then said carry on ive to give ye this dodd said fumbling for the dispatches seein as youre the new captain from m officer ltenant clinton sir urgent like he managed a tired but proud salute gilbey snatched it and read it avidly he frowned then reread the paper his brow darkening whats this nonsense do you know whats in this sergeant confused dodd shook his head m orders were t get it to you wi all dispatch is all i know sir glaring gilbey thrust it at renzi can you make anything of this he asked angrily renzi took it and read to the commanding officer hms laurore in fifteen minutes we shall be obliged to lay down our arms in all conscience i cannot allow the bearer sergeant dodd a man i have come to value above all reason in these ruinous days to be carried off to a vile captivity at the greatest loss to his majestys service this therefore is the only method i have of ensuring his obedience in quitting his men signed clinton lieutenant royal marines folding the paper renzi replied well mr gilbey i see it to be clintons thoughtfulness in providing us with one who may give us verbal news of conditions in buenos aires this paper a means of getting him past our sentries oh well what the blazes is happening dodd sir after them dons got across th whole town rose up an we had t fall back on the fort too many on em the general had t ask for terms is all wheres captain kydd dont rightly know sir went off on a raid or such sorry t say he didnt come back you mean taken maybe or er snabbled dumbfounded gilbey simply stared renzi swallowed tightly controlling his feelings then our forces have capitulated he asked gently and general beresford and all others are captured must be i suppose dodd said scratching his head i got away before y see gilbey came to and snapped irritably then how many of the enemy are there now in the city come along man whats their force er cant rightly say fr sure sir seein as how m post was in the fort what youve no idea said gilbey contemptuously youre sent to inform us sir the man is sorely tried after his ordeal renzi came in ill take him below and see he has something to recruit his strength while i build up an idea for you of how things are very well ill see you in half a glass renzi in the privacy of his own cabin renzi teased out the story finding a hiding place the wily sergeant had lain low while the surrender was completed waiting as the city erupted into celebration then after dark he had stolen a fishing punt and made his escape rowing singlehanded against wind and the seas bluster mutely he held up his hands they were piteously blistered and bloody asked about surrender terms dodd could shed no light on them but believed they had been concluded rapidly as hed heard the men being marched off within less than an hour after the guns had stopped firing this implied overbearing force and therefore an unconditional capitulation of the whole city and youve no idea what happened to the captain enquired renzi feeling a cold pit forming in his belly sorry sir dodd said sorrowfully jus didnt come back dont mean t say hes not in clink somewhere he added with loyal fervour renzi left the exhausted man wolfing cheese and hard tack and appreciative of a jug of thin wine gilbey impatiently dismissed the report clinton should have had more sense than t leave it to a royal to get intelligence out to us completely useless renzi bit back a hot retort while gilbey went on so mr kydd is taken or more probably killed it means im captain o the barky now i have m duty and thats to get to commodore popham an acquaint him of developments ashore likely hell confirm me in post on the spot i wouldnt wonder should i move into my captains quarters now do y think or wait till im confirmed as being somewhat more important than we the commodore will certainly have been advised by now renzi said icily and i believe your assumption of the dignity of captain should certainly wait wait what for on impulse renzi rapped until ive returned from buenos aires im going back to find him it had been said and he felt a fierce glee begin to swell in him youre what be damned to it man youre proposin to present yourself in a city new relieved an swarmin with poxy spanish to demand what happened to yr captain fighting down the temptation to reveal that hed done something like that in revolutionary paris renzi contented himself with a simple yes i am gilbey sat back with a look of bafflement then retorted youre mad even if hes still alive how th devil will you find where he is no its lunacy and i wont have it im going youre not as acting captain o this ship an you crew renzi i forbid it i dont think so he said acidly youve not the authority recollect im captain kydds confidential secretary his personal retinue not a member of the ships company but renzi waited for the implication to sink in then added but id be beholden if youd allow me to call for volunteers to assist me gilbey recovered quickly no i will not do y really think a foremast jack will want t go back into im going alone these are boats crew only to lie to a kedge offshore and yes i do think theyll come forward gilbey gave him an intense look and snapped you go then however youll get no men from me renzi leaned across then id ask you to conceive of your standing as captain among your jack tars if it becomes known youd not allow me even to try a rescue of their mr kydd comprende there were many volunteers far too many for laurores smallest boat the gig which was all a grudging gilbey would allow as hed also been adamant that there were to be no officers or midshipmen it was just poulden on the tiller stirk in the bow and old shipmates pinto and doud to tend sail and oars all others had to be content with a wellmeant and noisy farewell which inevitably finished in a three times three hearty cheer we sail after twentyfour hours growled gilbey not a minute later renzi had no idea how it was to be done when they pushed off into the darkness the fishing punt in tow he realised they would need the rest of the night to make passage lying at one of the many hard sand shoals midestuary during the day and closing to within a mile or so of the city the next night gilbey would not dare to put to sea before dawn the following day a plan crystallised it all hinged on the traitor or patriot serrano if he could persuade him with sufficient threat to divulge kydds fate or possibly his whereabouts it would radically change the odds in his somewhat worn plain shoregoing rig he would be a confused italian merchant unsure of what was happening seeking news reassurance it would suffice the boats crew were not to be risked for this matter was what he owed his friend personally to pen a sorrowful letter to kydds sister without knowing his ultimate fate was unthinkable they could come inshore but the final dash would be his alone in the punt brought along for the purpose the lights of buenos aires were visible miles to seaward and as they crept in there were soaring fireworks gunshots and all the signs of a city very much awake lie off for me poulden be sure if im not back an hour before first light to return immediately to laurore is that clear there was some mumbling but renzi was having nothing of it i say quit this place an hour before no later compree aye poulden said grudgingly renzi stepped into the punt and took the oars looking shoreward to take bearings for the return the punt swayed dangerously he looked round stirk was climbing in shift y arse im coming wi ye he announced toby you cant cant i two reasons y need a pair o peepers asll watch yr stern an blow me down whatll they say o the billy roarer that they lets orficers take th oars he shouldered renzi out of the way and shipped oars professionally give way sir there was one spot that suggested itself as a place for landing below the fort he remembered was where the washerwomen plied their trade there would be none there at this hour and renzi conned the punt in conscious that they would be under observation but he also knew that this was the time when flounder fishermen were about in england and might not the equivalent be abroad in buenos aires it seemed to work there were the silhouettes of sentinels behind the parapets of the fort but they were taking no notice and the foreshore was deserted the punt nudged in to the muddy shore they pulled it up beyond the tide line and prepared to set out er toby if youd kindly allow me he bent down then came up suddenly to slop mud in his face stirk spluttered with indignation but renzi inspected him critically perhaps a little more just here possibly looking around he found a pile of fishermens sacks waiting for the morning and helped himself to one bulking it out with seaweed and thrusting it at stirk ready then follow me my man on the streets knots of revellers drifted by figures laughed brawled and argued they took no notice of the woebegone merchant trudging along with his servant behind it was not far to the back street where he had discovered serrano lived with his woman renzi had no real animosity towards the young man who must have done as he had more out of ardent patriotism than perfidy and he was the only possible lead to kydds fate if however he suspected serrano was aware of his friends whereabouts he would have no qualms at all about doing what was needed to wrench the information from him after his time with french royalist agents he knew the ways watch my back he told stirk with a bent wire he prised open the door lock and stepped inside ready for anything serrano was there alone sitting moodily at a table with a single candle he looked up in fright when renzi appeared santa madre de dios how you find me renzi remained silent you assassinate me that depends renzi said silkily taking a seat opposite his eyes drilling remorselessly into serranos skull the artist looked up obstinately his eyes were red it make no difference not now oh tell me slowly it came out liniers was now revealed as a royalist he had gone along with the revolutionary fervour but had cunningly diverted it into a movement to oust the british first he had been joined by los patriotas to whom hed given deliberately minor roles in the reconquista and now in control he had hardened his grip with a view to handing the whole back to the spanish with himself high in government that it was not yet so was mainly because the viceroy sobremonte was still far inland where he had fled but the fact remained that don baltasar and the sociedad patriotica were therefore neatly sidelined and destined to be once more hunted rebels in the resumed administration they had been betrayed and the clock was being wound back mr renzi i didnt mean that captain keed is tricked when they said i had to i thought renzi let it hang then leaned across and demanded i want to know what happened to him and i want details serrano looked surprised why he were caught his ship go on the mud so hes a prisoner relief washed over him in a flood why no he sign parole so he in lodging but not the old they are liking the english too much so he was move to another where i say the captain is a good man not many as him im apologise for what i do an ashamed for my country why do you say that serrano hung his head as he explained the terms gained by beresford were good that in return for laying down their arms there would be an immediate evacuation of the british each man to undertake not to serve against the spanish until the formalities of an exchange were completed their passage back to england to be funded by the spanish government yet even with the terms ratified in writing it quickly became clear that the spanish had no intention whatsoever of abiding by them carts had been rounded up and the brave soldiers were beginning to be marched away far upcountry they would be followed by the officers there would be no release the ultimate betrayal we dont get t him an main quick hes a gone goose wheres he at y bugger renzi hadnt noticed stirk slip in but given the circumstances he couldnt have phrased it better himself hes not far you write to say come he see your writing an he come i send a boy to bring him on parole an officer was released on his word of honour to return and therefore had limited freedom to move about prudently serrano disappeared and twenty minutes later kydd walked suspiciously into the room hail fellow and well met renzi cried moved beyond words to see his friend once more but instead of an effusive greeting kydd said abruptly you too are taken nicholas hows this not at all dear chap were here to take you back kydd held his breath then let it out slowly youre on the loose in a captured city i wont ask how but it wont answer i beg your pardon i cant go back and you know why you and stirk have risked it for nothing you mean youve given parole indeed as has general beresford and we all i would have thought it reasonable given were to be shortly exchanged according to the terms o capitulation theres a boat from laurore lying off waiting for us we must move fast you didnt hear me my parole is my word given which on my honour will never be broken can you not see this and how damn cruel it is you tempting me like this renzi swallowed his irritation dear fellow i have to tell you the spanish have broken the surrender terms and are marching all british away upcountry as prisoners parole is meaningless in the face of such treachery where did you hear that i cant believe general liniers to be so lost to honour hed risk the worlds condemning its nonsense or is it that youre spinning me a stretcher as will make me break my parole he demanded incredulous not at all dear friend i hesitate to hurry you but urgency dictates no theyll only be moving the men to better quarters id think no nicholas i dont believe a word of what youre saying im dutybound to stay and thats an end to it the stalemate was suddenly broken when the bedroom door opened and serrano came in palefaced but resolute in open astonishment kydd looked first to renzi and then to serrano his face darkened this treacherous dog whats he doing here serrano replied in a quaver captain keed sir hear me he tell it right they are sending the british soldiers off i here because i too am betrayed seeing kydd swell with growing anger he quickly went on why am i here is easy for me not to come but i come to tell you is the truth the terms are broken by general liniers your soldiers are taken away soon you kydd hesitated to break parole is a hard thing he muttered nicholas what do you the abrogation of a treaty by one sovereign nation renders it a nullity for both renzi said firmly i cannot see how an agreement of parole is in any wise different then then perhaps we should exercise a modicum of celerity in our departure kydd straightened my word of parole is withdrawn as of this moment quite so renzi said with relief shall we now not yet understand im not abandoning the others he paused then ordered crisply this room is now our centre of operations all british officers are to be assembled here for escape which will be done by twos theres only the gig it can only take say five at a time and im not leaving em nicholas now we have to pass the word to muster here um mr serrano hows this to be done do you think clinton billeted nearby was the first to arrive blinking at the sudden turn of events they waited in rising tension for the others but then serrano burst in panting not good the officers they being taken genral beresford argue wi liniers now they come looking for you captain they had to get away instantly but it was madness to think that two english officers in uniform could get through kydd had a plan nicholas youre taking us somewhere stirk follows as servant this would give them a chance on the main streets where parole would allow them a not uncommon sight but closer to the fort and the foreshore it would be a different matter ready kydd then turned to serrano i thank ee for what youve done tonight but if ever you run athwart my hawse again ill screw your neck so help me god the streets of buenos aires were still in festive array when they moved out renzi affecting to ignore the taunts and jibes and taking refuge in a dignified silence it seemed to work and they made good progress but he feared it couldnt last not if they were out looking for kydd they were four such a number was too many to overlook it was time to make for the backstreets and the waterfront their little boat so near yet so far as they came closer to the water the danger multiplied for they had no excuse to be there the fort loomed the sentries limned in the diffuse moonlight renzi came to a sudden stop weve a problem he whispered and pointed ahead to the mole it was guarded the boat is beyond just around the point but how the devil do we get past there was no slipping underneath the massive compacted stone structure then clinton had an idea a long shot but there was no going back ill trouble you for your coat mr kydd he removed his own and explained its fever smallpox you and stirk are carrying me a dead body and mr renzi will chant the offices the coats were turned inside out and arranged over the body and they set off in the dim light with renzi in the lead making the sign of the cross and mumbling away they approached the sentries who lapsed into a suspicious silence unslinging their muskets paso paso la viruela renzi wailed mournfully and resumed his reciting there were exclamations of alarm and the soldiers drew back watching fearfully as they passed it wasnt until they had gone around the point that the spell was broken one of the sentries woke up to the fact that the burial ground was in another direction and urgent shouts broke the night stillness quickly we need to get the boat in the water renzi urged looking about with stirk in the dimness clinton threw off the coats and got to his feet waiting tensely with kydd cant find the damned thing renzi blurted breathless and angry it aint here cos the owners taken un back stirk spat more shouts came and figures started to run towards them find another bloody boat kydd demanded but there was none there was only one thing they could do into the water renzi urged and hurled himself in splashing noisily out as fast as he could the others followed stumbling in the mud the cold of the sea shocking as they sloshed their way further out a musket shot came then another but the wild firing into the darkness was no real danger the little group moved out deeper and deeper the line of freezing cold rose remorselessly up their bodies bringing uncontrollable shuddering and a draining of lifewarmth until their minds could hold only the desperate need to press on and on and then with water up to their necks out in the night there was an anxious low call toby mr renzi chapter the outlines of a boat emerged from the early morning pearly mist two challenges rang out simultaneously from the lookouts in laurore the triumphant reply roared back laurore indicating that this was no less than the anointed captain of their ship it brought every man and boy of the ships company on deck in a gleeful rush with a disbelieving gilbey then the boatswain importantly took position at the ships side with his silver call the gig hooked on and kydd mounted the steps gravely his dignity respected even when coming aboard in a filthy uniform without cocked hat or shoes the sideparty however was all grins order had returned to their universe pleased to be back mr gilbey kydd replied to the mumbled welcome hands to unmoor ship if you please he acknowledged warm greetings from curzon and bowden and quickly left the deck for that unimaginably desirable heaven his quarters he opened the door to see tysoe advancing with soap and towels a fresh uniform on the side dresser kydd stood for a moment with misted eyes then croaked not now tysoe theres something i have t do first and in front of his appalled valet he reverently knelt down and kissed the deck later after they had got under way there was time for breakfast with his officers in the gunroom it was stout but meagre ships fare and he recalled as if in a bad dream that his last meal had been rancid blood sausage he heard of their interminable idleness at anchor provisions and stores ransacked to be sent ashore leaving them on woefully short rations and above all as matters worsened the complete absence of news he heard too how clinton had sent dodd away with false dispatches and was touched to find that the sergeant had loyally carried back his precious sword as well but there were so many faces missing from laurore good men who had volunteered for the royal blues and were now somewhere out in the bleak country ranges of south america but what could he do for them maldonado was raised a day later the fleet left at just two sixtyfours and some transports in a loose moor with the frigate leda away and the small brigsloop encounter a distant sail it was no real deterrent if the spanish navy ever returned from the north kydd forced the thought away it was hardly pophams fault that the reinforcements had not arrived to swell the numbers but after his treatment the last time they had spoken he found it difficult to summon a warm sympathy for the commodore at the flagship he was shown to the great cabin by the first lieutenant popham was sitting at a table by the window and raised his head at kydds entrance id thought you to be taken at the fall of the city he said distantly as i was dasher but with the help of shipmates i got away kydd was shocked to see the effect of the last few weeks on the man features ravaged by care bloodshot eyes and a pall of weariness about his movements popham stared for a long time out of diadems stern window at the hurry of grey sea and the distant bleak coast im sorry for what i said to you before kydd he said so softly that it was difficult to catch it was churlish of me i can only plead an extremity of distraction with a surge of feeling kydd came back it was a near enough thing im thinking and if it wasnt for those blaggardly reinforcements yes quite popham said bitterly ive pleaded and begged but still none he pulled himself together visibly and enquired were all on short commons as youve no doubt noticed whats the state of laurore in want of water dry provisions to three weeks but the barky in good fettle and i suppose it must be said that with more than a few in spanish hands well last the longer he paused then continued in a low voice i feel it hard dasher that theyre still there while we sail away dont be popham said with something like his old fire im staying here when those damned reinforcements finally come well be in a position to retake buenos aires and then in course theyll be freed were mounting a second invasion we are popham said shortly were on the spot weve achieved so much with so few and well we know the way he finished his head drooping again kydd was taken aback the reinforcements might well be fewer in numbers than he supposed and to go in again without overwhelming force would in any circumstances be a grave mistake dasher ive seen this liniers hes stirred up the people with patriotism and high words and id wager theyd be much harder to beat this time do you take me for a poltroon im not cutting and running theyre for the most part an undisciplined rabble that will crumble before a determined thrust take my word for it well still need to find many more ships and men than we can expect of the reinforcements dasher kydd paused can we not make sure of it by calling for more from another station popham spoke slowly ive asked governor baird for more from cape town but st helena wont send another man no dasher i was thinking more of the leeward islands station shipsotheline troops stores all for us if we can convince em of the value of rescuing this expedition for a long moment popham remained silent then he straightened painfully umm it is the nearest ill grant you but id hoped not to trouble them in matters concerning this expedition at his words kydd realised that he must have refrained from such a move before for one very compelling reason the far more senior commanderinchief there would promptly take control of the whole enterprise its profits and laurels but higher things were at stake now popham gave a sad smile however i believe you to be in the right of things thomas it would make it sure and thats what counts i shall pen a letter immediately i dont suppose youd object to the voyage kydd threw off his coat and eased into his favourite chair by laurores stern windows accepting tysoes proffered toddy his friend waited impatiently so what is to be our fate dear fellow kydd finished his drink then replied to sail to the leeward islands station to beg for reinforcements were to clap on all sail and spare none renzi beamed the caribbean a little tropical sunshine would be a capital restorative he looked intently at his friend and im put in mind of some illustrious adventures in the past on that refulgent main do you remember our dear seaflower cutter for a long space kydd gazed out of the window and then for the first time in many weeks a smile spread authors note for readers wondering what happened next well the longedfor reinforcements arrived a few weeks after the surrender took place not from england but from baird at the cape however they were too slight to effect more than the token capture of maldonado stung by public opinion the government had in fact sent out reinforcements but they did not arrive until early the following year and with them pophams replacement hed been summarily recalled to face courtmartial for leaving his station the reinforcements were turned into an expedition for the retaking of buenos aires this started well with the capture of montevideo but whitelocke a remarkably incompetent political appointee had been sent out to replace the able general auchmuty the final assault on buenos aires was all but over when victory was turned into complete defeat by whitelocke liniers then had the satisfaction of taking the sword of yet another british general terms this time were for a complete evacuation including prisoners from the first incursion a year after they had arrived the british finally sailed away for ever the subsequent fate of the main players varied pophams courtmartial resulted in a severe reprimand but it seems not to have affected his career he at the same time being presented with a sword of honour by the city of london for his efforts to open up the markets of the river plate in future kydd tales you shall see more of this intelligent manipulative gifted and controversial figure beresford escaped in a manner much like kydd did taking the same line on parole later he led in the capture of madeira where he so won the confidence of the portuguese that he was given the command of their armies following the invasion of portugal by napoleon like so many military in this book pack the st itself other officers he went on to distinction in the peninsular war the bluff and energetic baird however was caught up in the recriminations and ended under recall losing his governorship of the cape he was never employed at that level again santiago de liniers twice victor was hailed as viceroy to replace the cowardly sobremonte but in the growing divisions between loyalists and patriots as a royalist and french by birth he was suspected of treason and executed barely a year later in a stroke of irony spanish and argentinian sources both freely admit that it was the barely known fringe act of empire portrayed in this book that produced the spark that set south america ablaze to achieve independence by demonstrating the fragility of the spanish hold on their old colonies while mirandas descent on caracas failed this struggle for independence beginning three years after the british left saw other bonaerense such as pueyrredon guemes and belgrano take forward roles and the colonial south america that kydd knew was quickly swept away buenos aires never before and never since under threat from the outside is now the capital of argentina the city bears little resemblance to what it was in those days vastly bigger and with only the plaza mayor itself barely recognisable the fort long gone and the waterfront an altogether healthier prospect the river chuelo in which seamen swam heroically to build their bridge of boats is now straddled by a vast dock area while ensenada de barragan is a naval base and the perdriel ranch has been swallowed by the suburbs the northern shore is now uruguay but colonia del sacramento still has a defiant portuguese colonial feel to it the little bastion at the waters edge attracting curious visitors of this whole south american episode there are very few relics remaining but in the downtown church of santo domingo a visitor to buenos aires may stand before the actual colours of the st regiment of highlanders surrendered on that fateful day by general beresford as usual for space reasons i am unable to acknowledge everyone i consulted in the process of writing this book but to all i owe my deep
