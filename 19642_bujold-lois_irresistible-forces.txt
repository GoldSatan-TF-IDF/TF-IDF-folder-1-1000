irresistible forces to the dancers and teachers of the ballet theatre of maryland for their expertise kindness insights and most of all for helping a starryeyed young girl reach for her dreams acknowledgments i would like to thank the people who made this book possible to denise little who listened to my dreams of such an anthology and led the way to laura anne gilman our much appreciated editor at roc to our agent lucienne diver who worked wonders for us to marty greenberg for his help and support to my assistant editors jeri smithready and tricia schwaab for their thoughtful input to the publisher and all the fine people at nal who put out this book to publicist binnie syril braunstein for her enthusiasm on our behalf and to the authors who were a joy to work with catherine asaro introduction writers are fond of two adages write what you like to read and write what you know ive always enjoyed love stories and im a scientist so i naturally write science fiction romance when i first started i had no idea it was an unusual combination i didnt know optimistic stories of courtship and love had an entire genre called romance or that science fiction with a strong scientific basis was called hard science fiction i just knew i enjoyed both i never expected my work to stir controversy so i was startled by the commotion my first book caused commentators remarked with surprise on how i blended strong romance with strong science fiction yet to me both romance and science are integral aspects of life i have always thought that the sharp distinction we make between our emotions and intellects arises more out of cultural expectations than an intrinsic quality of the human mind some of the best authors in both romance and the genres of science fiction and fantasy have blended these aspects of our humanity to beautiful effect as in ursula le guins classic science fiction romance forgiveness day in fact the seeds of speculative romance are as old as storytelling itself such as in the greek myths when our ancestors tried to understand both the human heart and the universe they lived in by invoking a pantheon of gods and goddesses with the power to alter nature today what characterizes a speculative romance ive often thought of romance as the figure skating of literature skaters constantly seek to perfect their performance to go for the romance seeks to tell the ultimate story of romantic relationship including such classics as a regency tale of a rake falling for a vicars daughter or a timetravel adventure with a modernday woman stranded in the past we watch figure skating or read romances for the sheer pleasure of seeing it done well and just as iceskaters push the boundaries of their sport with innovative movements so romance authors push the boundaries of their genre with innovative ideas as a literary movement romance is an art with many and diverse forms with science fiction and fantasy my thoughts turn to rock music it may be wild or lyrical rough or gentle based on classical technique or it may challenge accepted forms but it always pushes the envelope trying something new its no wonder that such music has become inextricably linked with youthful rebellion its about breaking rules so it is with speculative fiction it wants to be different the stories may be exhilarating dark optimistic dire humorous gritty beautiful inyourface or sedate but they always push boundaries extrapolate into the unknown the story must differ in some basic way from our normal lives it asks the question what if so how do we mix the genres it doesnt surprise me that science fiction romance became popular in hard science fiction such works are about science and science is about solving problems science seeks to better understand the universe to extend our knowledge and discover new insights that worldview or perhaps i should say universeview is why hard science fiction is often referred to as an optimistic subgenre inherent in many of its works is the assumption that whatever intellectual problem drives the plot will be solved not all my works or those of other speculative romance authors fit into the hard science fiction subgenre but they do share that optimism romance is the emotional equivalent of hard science fiction fundamental to its many forms is the assumption that no matter how great the problems of the heart we can solve them and achieve emotional fulfillment underlying romance literature is an intrinsic faith in the human spirit a belief in the strength of love honor and loyalty in my more mischievous moments i think of science fiction as a strapping young fellow showing off for his ladylove romance intrigued she comes closer deciding that maybe this handsome stranger isnt so strange after all science fiction romance is their marriage as in any marriage it succeeds best when the two partners love and respect each other a fantasy or science fiction romance will work if the author enjoys both genres and translates that into her or his fiction in this anthology i have the pleasure of bringing you stories by many accomplished writers in both speculative and romance fiction they offer a cornucopia of romantic adventures that take the best of these genres and meld them into a marriage of heart and mind best regards catherine asaro winterfair gifs by lois mcmaster bujold from armsman roics wrist com the gate guards voice reported laconically theyre in gates locked right roic returned dropping the house shields he turned to the discreet security control panel beside the carved double doors of vorkosigan houses main entry hall pressed his palm to the readpad and entered a short code the faint hum of the force shield protecting the great house faded roic stared anxiously out one of the tall narrow windows flanking the portal ready to throw the doors wide when mlords groundcar pulled into the porte cochere he glanced no less anxiously down the considerable length of his athletic body checking his house uniform halfboots polished to mirrors trousers knifecreased silver embroidery gleaming dark brown fabric spotless his face heated in mortified memory of a less expected arrival in this very hall also of lord vorkosigan with honored company in tow and the unholy tableau mlord had surprised with the escobaran bounty hunters and the gooey debacle of the bug butter roic had looked an utter fool in that moment nearly naked except for a liberal coating of sticky slime he could still hear lord vorkosigans austere amused voice as cutting as a razorslash across his ears armsman roic youre out of uniform he thinks im an idiot worse the escobarans invasion had been a security breach and while hed not technically been on duty hed been asleep dammit hed been present in the house and therefore on call for emergencies the mess had been in his lap literally mlord had dismissed him from the scene with no more than an exasperated roicget a bath somehow more keenly excoriating than any bellowed dressingdown roic checked his uniform again the long silvery groundcar pulled up and sighed to the pavement the front canopy rose on the driver the senior and dauntingly competent armsman pym he released the rear canopy and hurried around the car to assist mlord and his party the senior armsman spared a glance through the narrow window as he strode by his eye passing coolly over roic and scanning the hall beyond to make sure it contained no unforeseen drama this time these were very important offworld wedding guests pym had impressed upon roic which roic might have been left to deduce by mlord going personally to the shuttleport to greet their descent from orbit but then pym had walked in on the bug butter disaster too since that day his directives to roic had tended to be couched in words of one syllable with no contingency left to chance a short figure in a welltailored gray tunic and trousers hopped out of the car first lord vorkosigan gesturing expansively at the great stone mansion talking nonstop over his shoulder smiling in proud welcome as the carved doors swung wide admitting a blast of vorbarr sultana winter night air and a few glittering snow crystals roic stood to attention and mentally matched the other people exiting the groundcar with the security list hed been given a tall woman held a baby bundled in blankets a lean smiling fellow hovered by her side they had to be the botharijeseks madame elena botharijesek was the daughter of the late legendary armsman bothari her right of entree into vorkosigan house where she had grown up with mlord was absolute pym had made sure roic understood it scarcely needed the silver circles of a jump pilots neural leads on midforehead and temples to identify the shorter middleaged fellow as the betan jump pilot arde mayhew should a jump pilot look so jumplagged well mlords mother countess vorkosigan was betan too and the pilots blinking shivering stance was among the most physically unthreatening roic had ever seen not so the final guest roics eyes widened the hulking figure unfolded from the groundcar and stood up and up pym who was almost as tall as roic did not come quite up to its shoulder it shook out the swirling folds of a grayandwhite greatcoat of military cut and threw back its head the light from overhead caught the face and gleamed off were those fangs hooked over the outslung lower jaw sergeant taura was the name that went with it by process of elimination one of mlords old military buddies pym had given roic to understand and dont be fooled by the rank of some particular importance if rather mysterious as was everything connected with lord miles vorkosigans late career in imperial security pym was former impsec himself roic was not as he was reminded oh three times a day on average at lord vorkosigans urging the whole party poured into the entry hall shaking off snowspotted garments talking laughing the greatcoat was swung from those high shoulders like a billowing sail its owner turning neatly on one foot folding the garment ready to hand over roic jerked back to avoid being clipped by a heavy mahoganycolored braid of hair as it swept past and rocked forward to find himself face to nose to staring directly into an entirely unexpected cleavage it was framed by pink silk in a plunging vee he glanced up the outslung jaw was smooth and beardless the curious pale amber eyes irises circled with sleek black lines looked back down at him with he instantly feared some amusement her fangframed smile was deeply alarming pym was efficiently organizing servants and luggage lord vorkosigans voice yanked roic back to focus roic did the count and countess get back in from their dinner engagement yet about twenty minutes ago mlord they went upstairs to their suite to change lord vorkosigan addressed the woman with the baby who was attracting cooing maids my parents would skin me if i didnt take you up to them instantly come on mothers pretty eager to meet her namesake i predict baby cordelia will have countess cordelia wrapped around her pudgy little fingers in about oh three and a half seconds at the outside he turned and started up the curve of the great staircase shepherding the botharijeseks and calling over his shoulder roic show arde and taura to their assigned rooms make sure they have everything they want well meet back in the library when you all are freshened up or whatever drinks and snacks will be laid on there so it was a lady sergeant galactics had those mlords mother had been a famous betan officer in her day but this ones a bloody giant mutant lady sergeant was a thought roic suppressed more firmly such backcountry prejudices had no place in this household though she was clearly bioengineered had to be he recovered himself enough to say may i take your bag um sergeant oh all right with a dubious look down at him she handed him the satchel shed had slung over one arm the pink enamel on her fingernails did not quite camouflage their shape as claws heavy and efficient as a leopards the bags descending weight nearly jerked roics arm out of its socket he managed a desperate smile and began lugging it twohanded up the staircase in mlords wake he deposited the tiredlooking pilot first sergeant tauras secondfloor guest room was one of the renovated ones with its own bath around the corridors corner from mlords own suite she reached up and trailed a claw along the ceiling and smiled in evident approval of vorkosigan houses threemeter headspace so she said turning to roic is a winterfair wedding considered especially auspicious in barrayaran custom theyre not so common as in summer mostly i think its now because mlords fiancee is between semesters at university her thick brows rose in surprise shes a student yes maam he had a notion one addressed female sergeants as maam pym would have known i didnt realize she was such a young lady no maam madame vorsoissons a widow she has a little boy nikki nine years old mad about jumpships do you happent know does that pilot fellow like children mayhew was bound to be a magnet for nikki why i dont know i dont think arde knows either he hardly ever meets any in a free mercenary fleet he would have to watch then to be sure little nikki didnt set himself up for a painful rebuff mlord and mladytobe might not be paying their usual attention to him under the circumstances sergeant taura circled the room gazing with what roic hoped was approval at its comfortable appointments and glanced out the window at the back garden shrouded in winter white the snow luminous in the security lighting i suppose it makes sense that hed have to wed one of his own vor kind in the end her nose wrinkled so are the vor a social class a warrior caste or what i never could quite figure it out from miles the way he talks about them youd half think they were a religion or at any rate his religion roic blinked in bafflement well no and yes all of that the vor are well vor now that barrayar has modernized isnt a hereditary aristocracy resented by the rest of your classes but theyre our vor says the barrayaran hmm so you can criticize them but heaven help any outsider who dares to yes he said relieved that she seemed to have grasped it despite his stumbling tongue a family matter i see her grin faded into a frown that was actually less alarming not so much fang her fingers clenching the curtain inadvertently poked claws through the expensive fabric wincing she shook her hand free and tucked it behind her back her voice lowered so shes vor well and good but does she love him roic heard the odd emphasis in her voice but was unclear how to interpret it im very sure of it maam he avowed loyally mladytobes frowns her darkening mood were surely just prewedding nerves piled atop examination stress on the substrate of her notsodistant bereavement of course her smile flicked back in a perfunctory sort of way have you served lord vorkosigan long armsman roic since last winter maam when a space fell vacant in the vorkosigans armsmens score i was sent up on recommendation from the hassadar municipal guard he added a bit truculently challenging her to sneer at his humble nonmilitary origins a counts twenty armsmen are always from his own district ysee she did not react the hassadar municipal guard evidently meant nothing to her he asked in return did you serve him very long out there in the galactic backbeyond where mlord had acquired such exotic friends her face softened the fanged smile reappearing in a sense all my life since my real life began ten years ago anyway he is a great man this last was delivered with unselfconscious conviction well he was a great mans son certainly count aral vorkosigan was a colossus bestriding the last half century of barrayaran history lord miles had led a less public career which no one would tell roic anything about the most junior armsman not being eximpsec like mlord and most of the rest of the armsmen eh still roic liked the little lord what with the birth injuries and all roic shied away from the pejorative mutationshed had a rough ride all his life despite his high blood hard enough for him to just achieve normal things like like getting married although mlord had brains enough belike in compensation for his stunted body roic just wished he didnt think his newest armsman a dolt the library is to the right of the stairs as you go down through the first room he touched his hand to his forehead in a farewell salute by way of paving his escape from this unnerving giant female the dinings to be casual tonight you dont needt dress he added as she glanced down in bewilderment at her travelrumpled loose pink jacket and trousers dress up that is fancy what youre wearing is fine oh she replied with evident relief that makes more sense thank you having made his routine security circuit of the house roic arrived back at the antechamber just outside the library to find the huge woman and the pilot fellow examining the array of wedding presents temporarily staged there the growing assortment of objects had been arriving for weeks each had been handed in to pym to be unwrapped and to undergo a security check rewrapped and as the affianced couples time permitted unwrapped again and displayed with its card look heres yours arde said sergeant taura and heres ellis oh what did she finally decide on asked the pilot at one point she told me she was thinking of sending the bride a barbedwire choke chain for mles but was afraid it might be misinterpreted no taura held up a thick fall of shimmering black stuff as long as she was tall it seems to be some sort of fur coat no wait its a blanket beautiful you should feel this arde its incredibly soft and warm she held a supple fold up to the side of her head and a delighted laugh broke from her long lips its purring mayhews eyebrows climbed halfway to his receding hairline good god did she now thats a bit edgy taura stared down at him in puzzled inquiry edgy why mayhew made an uncertain gesture its a live fur a genetic construct it looks just like one mles once gave to em if shes recycling his gifts thats a pretty pointed message he hesitated though i suppose if she bought a fresh new one for the happy couple thats a different message ouch taura tilted her head to one side and frowned at the fur my lifes too short for arcane mind games arde which is it search me in the dark all cat blankets are well black in this case i wonder if its intended as an editorial well if it is dont you dare let on to the poor bride or i swear ill turn both your ears into doilies she held up her clawed fingers and wriggled them by hand judging by the pilots brief grin the threat was a jest but by his little bow of compliance not an entirely empty one taura observed roic just then refolded the live fur into its box and tucked her hands discreetly behind her back the door to the library swung open and lord vorkosigan stuck his head out ah there you two are he strolled into the antechamber elena and baz will be down in a little shes feeding baby cordelia you must be starving by now taura come on in and try the hors doeuvres my cook has outdone herself he smiled up affectionately at the enormous sergeant while the top of roics head barely came up to her shoulder mlord just about faced her belt buckle it occurred to roic that taura towered over himself in almost exactly the same proportions that ladies of average height towered over lord vorkosigan this must be what women looked like to mlord all the time oh mlord waved his guests through to the library but instead of following them shut the door and motioned roic to his side he looked thoughtfully up at his tallest armsman and lowered his voice tomorrow morning i want you to drive sergeant taura to the old town ive prevailed upon aunt alys to present taura to her modiste and fix her up with a barrayaran ladys wardrobe suitable for the upcoming bash figure to hold yourself at their disposal for the day roic gulped mlords aunt lady alys vorpatril was in her own way more terrifying than any woman roic had ever encountered regardless of height she was the acknowledged social arbiter of the high vor in the capital the last word in fashion taste and etiquette the official hostess for emperor gregor himself and her tongue could slice a fellow to ribbons and tie up the remains in a bowknot before they hit the ground howt devil did you roic began then cut himself off mlord smirked i was very persuasive besides lady alys relishes a challenge with luck she may even be able to part taura from that shocking pink she favors some damned fool once told her it was a nonthreatening color and now she uses it in the most unsuitable garments and quantities its so wrong on her well aunt alys will be able to handle it if anyone asks for your opinion not that theyre likely to vote for whatever alys picks i shouldnt dare do otherwise roic managed not to blurt aloud he stood to attention and tried to look as though he were listening intelligently lord vorkosigan tapped his fingers on his trouser seam his smile fading im also relying on you to see that taura is not um offered insult or made uncomfortable or well you know not that you can keep people from staring i dont suppose but be her outrider in any public venue and be alert to steer her away from any problems i wish i had time to squire her myself but this wedding prep has gone into high gear not much longer now thank god how is madame vorsoisson holding up roic inquired diffidently he had been wondering for two days if he ought to report the crying jag to someone but mladytobe had surely not realized her muffled breakdown in one of vorkosigan houses back corridors had included a hastily retreating witness judging by mlords suddenly guarded expression perhaps he knew she has extra stresses just now ive tried to take as much of the organizing off her shoulders as possible his shrug was not as reassuring as it might be roic felt mlord brightened anyway i want sergeant taura to have a great time on her visit to barrayar a fabulous winterfair season its probably the only chance shell ever have to see the place i want her to look back on this week like like dammit i want her to feel like cinderella magicked off to the ball shes earned it god knows midnight tolls too damned soon roic tried to wrap his mind around the concept of lord vorkosigan as the enormous womans fairy godfather so whost handsome prince mlords smile went crooked something almost like pain sounded in his indrawn breath ah yes that would be the central problem now wouldnt it he dismissed roic with his usual casual halfsalute a vague wave of his hand in the vicinity of his forehead and joined his guests in the library roic had never in his whole career as a hassadar municipal guardsman been in a clothing store resembling that of lady vorpatrils modiste nothing betrayed its location in the vorbarr sultana thoroughfare but a discreet brass plaque labeled simply estelle cautiously he mounted to the second floor sergeant tauras massive footsteps creaking on the carpeted stairs behind him and poked his head into a hushed chamber that might have been a vor ladys drawing room there was not a garment rack nor even a mannequin in sight just a thick carpet soft lighting and tables and chairs that looked suitable for offering high tea at the imperial residence to his relief lady vorpatril had arrived before them and was standing chatting with another woman in a dark dress the two women turned as taura ducked her head under the lintel behind roic and straightened up again roic nodded a polite greeting he couldnt imagine what mlord had said to his aunt but her eyes widened only slightly looking up at taura the second woman didnt quail at the fangs claws or height either but when her glance swept down the pink trouser outfit she winced there was a brief pause lady alys shot roic an inquiring look and he realized it must be his job to do the announcing as when he brought a visitor into vorkosigan house sergeant taura my lady he said loudly then stopped hoping for more cues after another moment lady alys abandoned further hope of him and came forward smiling her hands held out sergeant taura i am mles vorkosigans aunt alys vorpatril permit me to welcome you to barrayar my nephew has told me something about you uncertainly taura stuck out one huge hand engulfing lady alyss slender fingers and shook with care im afraid he hasnt told me too much about you she said shyness made her voice a gruff rumble i dont know many aunts i somehow thought you would be older and and not so beautiful lady vorpatril smiled not without approval only a few streaks of silver in her dark coiffure and a slight softening of her skin betrayed her age to roics eyes she was trim and elegant and utterly selfpossessed as always she introduced the other woman madame somebody not estelle though roic promptly dubbed her that in his mind apparently the senior modiste im very happy to have a chance to visit miless lord vorkosigans homeworld taura told them although when he invited me to come for the winterfair season i wasnt sure if it was hunting or social and whether i should pack weapons or dresses lady vorpatrils smile sharpened dresses are weapons my dear in sufficiently skilled hands permit us to introduce you to the rest of our ordnance team she gestured toward a door at the far end of the room through which presumably lay more utilitarian workrooms full of laser scanners and design consoles and bolts of exotic fabrics and expert seamstresses or magic wands for all roic knew the other woman nodded do please come this way sergeant taura we have a great deal to accomplish today lady alys tells me my lady roic called in faint panic to their disappearing forms what should i do wait here a few moments armsman lady alys murmured over her shoulder to him ill be back taura too glanced back at him just before the door eased silently closed behind her the expression flitting over her odd features seeming for a moment almost beseechingdont abandon me did he dare sit on one of the chairs he decided not he stood for a few moments walked around the chamber and finally took up a guardsmans stance which by dint of much recent practice he could hold for an hour at a stretch his back to one delicately decorated wall in a while lady vorpatril returned a pile of bright pink cloth folded over her arm she shoved it at roic take these back to my nephew and tell him to hide them or better burn them or anything but do not under any circumstances allow them to fall into that young womans hands again come back in about oh four hours you are by far the most ornamental of miless armsmen but theres no need to have you lurking about cluttering up estelles reception room till then run along he looked down on the top of her perfectly groomed head and wondered how she could always make him feel four years old or as though he wanted to hide in a large bag for his consolation roic reflected as he made his way out she seemed to have the same effect on her nephew who was thirtyone and ought to be immune by now he reported again for duty at the appointed time only to cool his heels for another twenty minutes or so a submodiste of some sort offered him a choice of tea or wines while he waited which he politely declined at last the door opened voices drifted through tauras vibrant baritone was unmistakable im not so sure lady alys ive never worn a skirt like this in my life well have you practice for a few minutes sitting and standing and walking oh heres roic back good lady alys stepped through first folded her arms and looked oddly enough at roic a stunning vision in hunter green stepped through behind her oh it was still taura certainly but the skin that had been sallow and dull against the pink was now revealed as a glowing ivory the green jacket fit very trimly about the waist above her pale shoulders and long neck seemed to bloom from a white linen collar below the jacket skirt skimmed out briefly around the upper hips a narrow skirt continued the long green fall to her firm calves wide linen cuffs decorated with subtle white braid made her hands look if not small wellproportioned the pink nail polish was gone replaced by a dark mahogany shade the heavy braid hanging down her back had been transformed into a mysteriously knotted arrangement clinging close to her head and set off with a green hat feather anyway a neat little accent tilted to the other side the odd shape of her face seemed suddenly artistic and sophisticated rather than distorted yees said lady vorpatril that will do roic closed his mouth with a lopsided smile taura stepped carefully forward i am a bodyguard by trade she said evidently continuing a conversation with lady vorpatril how can i kick someones teeth in wearing this a woman wearing that suit my dear will have volunteers to kick in annoying persons teeth for her said lady alys is that not so roic if they dont trample each other in the rush gulped roic and turned red one corner of that wide mouth lifted the golden eyes seemed to sparkle like champagne she caught sight of a long mirror on a carved stand in one corner and walked over to it to stare somewhat uncertainly at the portion of her it reflected its effective then downright terrifying roic averred roic intercepted a furious glower from lady alys behind tauras back her lips formed the words no you idiot he shrank into cowed silence oh tauras fanged smile fled but i already terrify people human beings are so fragile if you get a good grip you can pull their heads right off i want to attract somebody for a change maybe i should have that pink dress with the bows after all lady alys said smoothly we agreed that the ingenue look is for much younger girls smaller ones you mean there is more than one kind of beauty yours needs dignity i would never deck myself in pink bows she threw in a little desperately it seemed to roic taura eyed her seeming struck by this no i suppose not you will simply attract braver men oh i know that taura shrugged i was just hoping for a larger selection for once she added under her breath anyway hes taken now what he roic couldnt help wondering she sounded rather sad about it some very tall admirer now out of the picture larger than roic there werent too many men of that description around lady alys rounded out the afternoon by guiding her new protegee to an exclusive tearoom much frequented by high vor matrons this proved to be partly for the purposes of tutorial party to refuel tauras ferocious metabolism while the server brought dish after dish lady alys offered a brisk stream of advice on everything from gracefully exiting a groundcar in restrictive clothing to posture to table manners to the intricacies of vor social rank despite her outsized scale taura was naturally athletic and coordinated seeming to improve almost as roic watched drafted as practice gentleman roic found himself coming in for a few sharp corrections himself he felt very conspicuous and clumsy at first until he realized that next to taura he might as well be invisible if they drew sidelong looks from other diners at least the comments were lowvoiced or far enough away that he was not compelled to take notice besides tauras attention was entirely upon her mentor unlike roic she never needed the same instruction twice when lady vorpatril removed herself to consult with the head server about some fine point taura leaned over to whisper shes very good at this isnt she yes the best she sat back with a smile of satisfaction miless people generally are she regarded roic appraisingly a server guided a welldressed vor matron shepherding a girlchild about nikkis age past their table toward their own seating the girl stopped short and stared at taura her hand lifted pointing in astonishment mama look at that gigantic the mother captured the hand shot an alarmed glance at them and began some hushed admonishment about it not being polite to point taura essayed a big friendly smile at the girl a mistake the girl screamed and buried her face in her mothers skirts hands frantically clutching the woman shot taura a furious frightened glower and hustled the little girl away not toward their table but to the exit across the tearoom lady alyss head swiveled around roic looked back at taura then wished he hadnt her face froze appalled then crumpled in distress she seemed about to burst into tears but caught herself with a long indrawn breath held for a moment tensed to spring where roic instead eased back helplessly in his chair hadnt mlord specifically detailed him to prevent this sort of thing with a gulp taura brought her breathing back under control she looked as wan as though shed been wounded by a knife thrust yet what could he have done he couldnt very well draw his stunner and pot some vor ladys terrified kid lady alys taking in the incident returned quickly with a special frown at roic she slid back into her seat she smoothed over the moment with some light comment but the outing did not recover its cheerful tone taura kept trying to shrink down and sit smaller a futile exercise and whenever she began to smile stopped and tried to hold her hand over her mouth roic wished he were back patrolling hassadar alleys roic arrived with his charges back at vorkosigan house feeling as though hed been run through a wringer backward several times he peered around the tower of garment boxes he carried the rest madame estelle had assured taura would be delivered and managed not to drop them getting through the carved doors under lady vorpatrils direction he handed off the boxes to a pair of maidservants who whisked them away mlords voice wafted from the antechamber to the library is that you aunt alys were in here roic trod belatedly after the two disparate women just in time to see mlord introduce sergeant taura to his fiancee madame ekaterin vorsoisson like it seemed everyone but roic she had apparently been warned in advance she didnt even blink holding out one hand to the huge galactic woman and offering her an impeccably polite welcome mladytobe looked fatigued this evening although that might be partially the effect of the drab gray halfmourning she still wore her dark hair drawn back in a severe knot the garb went with the gray civilian suits mlord favored though giving the effect of two players on the same team mlord regarded the new green outfit with unfeigned enthusiasm splendid work aunt ays i knew i could rely on you thats a stunning look with the hair taura he peered upward are the fleet medicos making some new headway with the extension treatments i dont see any gray at all great she hesitated then replied no i just got some customized dye to match it ah he made an apologetic motion as if brushing away his last words well it looks lovely new voices sounded from the entry hall armsman pym admitting a visitor no need to announce me pym hes right in there then sir lady alys just arrived better still simon illyan impsec retired entered upon these words bent to kiss lady alyss hand then tucked it through one arm as he straightened she smiled fondly at him and he snugged her in close to his side he too absorbed his introduction to the towering sergeant taura with unruffled calm bowing over her hand and saying i am so pleased to have a chance to meet you at last sergeant i hope your visit to barrayar has been pleasant so far yes sir she rumbled back apparently controlling an impulse to salute the man only because he still held her hand roic didnt blame her he was taller than illyan too but the formidable former chief of imperial security made him want to salute and hed never even been in the military lady alys has been wonderful no one it seemed was going to mention the unfortunate incident in the tearoom im not surprised oh miles illyan continued ive just come from the imperial residence some good news came in when i was saying goodbye to gregor lord vorbataille was arrested this afternoon at the vorbarr sultana shuttleport trying to leave the planet in disguise mlord blew out his breath thats going to put that ugly little case to bed then good i was afraid it was going to drag on over winterfair illyan smiled i wondered if that might have had something to do with the energy with which you tackled it heh i shall give dear gregor the benefit of the doubt and assume he did not have my personal deadline in mind when he assigned me to it the mess did proliferate unexpectedly case sergeant taura inquired my new job as one of the nine imperial auditors for emperor gregor took an odd and unexpected turn into criminal investigation a month or so back mlord explained we found that lord vorbataille who is a counts heir like me from one of our southern districts had involved himself with a jacksonian smuggling ring or possibly been suborned by it anyway by the time his sins caught up with him he was up to his eyebrows in illicit traffic hijacking and murder very bad company now wholly out of business im pleased to report gregor is considering sending the jacksonians home in a box suitably frozen let their backers decide if they are worth the expense of reviving if everything is finally proved on vorbataille that i think will be for his fathers sake he may be allowed to suicide in his cell mlord grimaced if not the council of counts will have to be persuaded to endorse a more direct redemption of the honor of the vor corruption on this level cant be allowed to slop over and give us all a bad name gregor is very pleased with your work on this one illyan remarked ill bet he was livid about the princess olivia hijacking in his own understated way an unarmed ship all those poor dead passengers god what a nightmare roic listened a bit wistfully to all this he thought he might have done more this past month when mlord was buzzing in and out on the highprofile case but pym hadnt assigned him to the duty granted someone had to stand night guard for vorkosigan house week after week but enough of this nasty business mlord caught madame vorsoissons grateful glancelets turn to more cheerful affairs why dont you finish opening that next package love madame vorsoisson turned back to the crowded table and the task everyones arrival had interrupted heres the card oh admiral quinn again mlord took it brows rising what no limerick this time how disappointing perhaps this one is to make up for oh my i imagine so and all the way from earth from a small box she drew a short triple strand of matched pearls and held them up to her throat chokerstyle oh how pretty momentarily she let the iridescent spheres line up upon her neck touching the two ends of the clasp in back would you like me to fasten it her bridegroom offered just for a moment she bent her head and mlord reached up and fiddled with the catch at her nape she walked to the mirror over the rooms unlit fireplace turning to watch the exquisite ornament catch the light and gave mlord a quizzical smile i believe they would go perfectly with what im wearing the day after tomorrow dont you think lady alys lady alys tilted her head in sartorial judgment why yes indeed mlord bowed at this endorsement by the highest authority the look he exchanged with his bride was less decipherable to roic but he seemed very pleased even relieved sergeant taura watching the byplay frowned in unease madame vorsoisson removed the strands and laid them back in their velvetlined box where they glowed softly i believe we should let your guests freshen up before dinner miles oh yes except i need to borrow simon for a moment will you excuse us there will be drinks in the library again when you are all ready someone let arde know where is arde nikki captured him and carried him off said madame vorsoisson i should probably go rescue the poor man mlord and illyan withdrew to the library lady alys escorted taura away presumably for one last tutorial on barrayaran etiquette before the impending formal dinner with count and countess vorkosigan taura glanced back at the bride still frowning roic watched the giant woman out with some regret distracted by the sudden speculation of what it would be like to patrol a hassadar alley with her mlady madame vorsoisson that is roic began as she started to turn away not for much longer she smiled turning back whats with that is how old is sergeant taura do you know around twentysix standard i believe a little younger than roic actually it felt unfair that the galactic woman should seem so much more complicated then why is her hair turning gray if shes bioengineered i wouldnt have thought theyd muff up such details madame vorsoisson made a little gesture of apology i believe that is a private matter for her which is not mine to discuss oh roics brow wrinkled in bafflement whered she come from where did mlord meet her on one of his old covert ops missions he tells me he rescued her from a particularly vile bioengineering facility on the planet of jacksons whole they were trying to develop a supersoldier having escaped enslavement she became an especially valued colleague on his ops team she added after a contemplative moment and sometimelover also especially valued i understand roic felt suddenly very rural backcountry not up to speed on the sophisticated galactictinged vor life of the capital er he told you and and youre all right with that he wondered if meeting sergeant taura had rattled her more than shed let on it was before my time roic her smile crimped a little i actually wasnt sure if he was confessing or bragging but now that ive seen her i rather think he was bragging but but how would i mean shes so tall and hes urn now her eyes narrowed with laughter at him although her lips remained demure he didnt supply me with that much detail roic it wouldnt have been gentlemanly to you no i guess not to her oh oh um yeah for what its worth i have heard him remark that a height differential matters much less when two people are lying down i find i must agree with a smile he really didnt dare try to interpret she moved off in search of nikki a scant hour later roic was surprised when pym gave him a headsup on his wrist com to bring mlords groundcar around he parked it under the porte cochere and entered the blackandwhite paved hall to find mlord assisting madame vorsoisson on with her wraps are you sure you dont want me to go with you mlord asked her anxiously id like to go with you see you get home and in all right madame vorsoisson pressed a hand to her forehead her face was pale and damp almost greenish no no roic will get me there go back to your guests theyve come so far and youll only be getting to see them for such a short time im sorry to be such a drip give my abject apologies to the count and countess if you dont feel well you dont feel well dont apologize do you think youre coming down with something i could send our personal physician round i dont know i hope not not now it mostly seems to be a headache she bit her lip i dont think i have a fever he reached up to touch her brow she winced no youre not hot but youre all clammy he hesitated then asked more quietly nerves dyou think she hesitated too i dont know i have all the wedding logistics under control you know all you have to do is show up her smile was pained and not fall over he was silent a little longer this time you know if you decide that you really cant go through with it you can call a halt any time right up to the last hope you wont of course but i need you to know you could what with everyone from the emperor and the empress on down coming i think not id cover it if i had to he swallowed i know you said you wanted a small wedding but i didnt realize you meant tiny im sorry she blew out her breath in something like exasperation mles i love you dearly but if im going to start throwing up id really prefer to be home first oh yes roic if you please he motioned to his armsman roic took madame vorsoissons arm which was trembling ill send nikki home safely with one of the armsmen after dessert or after he wears arde out ill call your house and let them know youre coming mlord called after her she waved in acknowledgment roic helped her into the rear compartment and closed the canopy her shadowed form sat bent head clutched in her hands mlord chewed on his knuckle and stared in distress as the house doors swung shut upon him roics night shift was cut short at dawn the next morning when the counts guard commander called him on his wrist com and told him to report to the front hall in running gear one of mlords guests wanted to go out to take some exercise he arrived shrugging on his jacket to find taura bending and stretching in a vigorous series of warmups under pyms bemused eye lady alyss modiste hadnt gotten around to providing active wear it appeared because the huge woman wore a plain set of wellworn ship knits although in neutral gray rather than blinding pink the fabric hugged the smooth curves of a lean musculature that without being bulky gave an unmistakable impression of coiled power the braid down her back looked cheery and sporting in this comfortable context oh armsman roic good morning she said started to smile then lifted her hand to her mouth you dont roic motioned inarticulately you dont have to do that for me i like your smile it wasnt he realized altogether a polite lie now that im getting used to it her fangs glinted i hope they didnt drag you out of bed mles said his people just used the sidewalk around this block for their running track since it was about a kilometer i dont think i can go astray roic intercepted a look from pym roic hadnt been called out to keep mlords galactic guest from getting lost he was there to deal with any altercations that might result from startled vorbarr sultana drivers crashing their vehicles onto the sidewalk or each other at the sight of her no problem said roic promptly we usually use the ballroom for a sort of gymnasium in weather like this but its being all decorated for the reception so im behind on my fitness training for the month itll be a nice change to do my laps with someone whos not so much older um that is so much shorter than me he sneaked a glance at pym pyms wintry smile promised retribution for that dig as he coded open the doors for them enjoy yourselves children the biting air blew away roics nights fatigue he guided taura out past the guard at the main gate and turned right along the high gray wall after a few steps she extended herself and began an easy lope within a very few minutes roic was regretting his cheap shot at the middleaged pym tauras long legs ate the distance roic kept half an eye on the early morning traffic fortunately still light and concentrated the rest of his attention on not disgracing house vorkosigan by collapsing in a gasping heap tauras eyes grew brilliant with exhilaration as she ran as if her spirit expanded into her body as her body stretched out to make room half a dozen laps barely winded her but she slowed at last to a walk perhaps out of pity for her guide lets circle through the garden to cool down roic wheezed madame vorsoissons garden which occupied a third of the block and was her bridegift to mlord was among other things sheltered from view of the cross streets by walls and banks they dodged around the barricades temporarily barring public access till after the wedding oh my said taura as they turned down the winding walk descending between curving snow hillocks the chilly brook its water running black and silky between feathery fingers of ice snaked gracefully from one corner to the other the peachcolored dawn light glimmered off the ice on the young trees and shrubs in the blue shadows why its beautiful i didnt expect a garden to be so pretty in winter what are those men doing a crew was unloading some float pallets piled high with boxes of all sizes marked fragile another pair was going around with water hoses misting selected branches marked with yellow tags to create yet more delicate shimmering icicles the shapes of the native barrayaran vegetation grew luminous and exotic with this silvergilding theyre putting out all the ice sculptures mlord ordered ice flowers and sculptured creatures and things to fill up the garden since all the real plants are under the snow pretty much and fresh snow to be added too if there isnt enough they cant put outt real live flowers for the ceremony till the very last gasp late tomorrow morning good grief hes having an outdoor garden wedding in this weather is that a barrayaran thing is it um no not exactly i believe mlord originally was shooting for fall but madame vorsoisson wasnt ready yet but hed got his heart set on getting married in the garden because it was hers ysee so he is by damn going to have the wedding in the garden the idea is people will assemble in vorkosigan house then troop out here for the vows then scurry back into the ballroom for the reception and the food and dancing and all and the frostbite and hypothermia treatments itll be all right if the weather stays clear i guess the backstairs commentary on the potential disasters inherent in this scenario roic decided to keep to himself vorkosigan houses staff seemed united in their determination to make the eccentric scheme work for mlord anyway tauras eyes glinted in the level dawn light now filtering between the buildings of the surrounding cityscape i can hardly wait to try out the dress lady alys got up for me to wear to the ceremony barrayaran ladies clothes are so interesting but complicated in a way i suppose theyre another kind of uniform but i dont know whether i feel like a recruit or an enemy spy in them well i dont suppose the real ladies will shoot me in any case so much to learn about how to go on though i suppose it all seems ridiculously easy to you you grew up with it i didnt grow up with this roic waved a hand toward the imposing stone pile of vorkosigan house rising above the high bare trees on its grounds my father is just a construction hand in hassadar thats the vorkosigans district capital city just this side of the dendarii mountains a few hundred kilometers south of here lots of building going on there he offered to apprentice me to the trade but i got the chance to become a street guard and i took it sort of an impulse truth to tell i was eighteen didnt know up from down sure learned a lot after that what does a street guard guard streets among other things the whole city really you do what needs done sort out traffic before or after its a big bent pile deal with upset peoples problems try to keep em from murdering their relatives or clean up the mess after if you cant trace stolen property if you get lucky i did a lot of night foot patrol you learn a lot about a place on foot up close i learned how to handle stunners and shocksticks and big hostile drunks i was getting pretty good at it i thought after a few years how did you end up here oh there was a little incident he gave an embarrassed shrug some crazed loon tried to shoot up hassadar square at rush hour with an autoneedler i um took it away from him her brows went up with a stunner no unfortunately i was off duty at the time had to do it by hand a little hard to get up close and personal with someone firing a needler that was a problem yeah her lips curved up or at least the ivory hooks lengthened it seemed to make perfect sense at the moment though later i wondered whatt hell id been thinking i dont think i was thinking at any rate he only killed five and not fiftyfive people seemed to think it was a big deal but im sure its nothing compared to what youve seen out there his glance upward was meant to indicate the distant stars though the sky was now a paling blue hey i may be big but im not needlerproof i hate the shrieky sound when the razorstrands unwind and whiz around even though i know in my head that those are the ones that missed yeah roic said in heartfelt agreement anyways after that there was a stupid fuss and someone recommended me to mlords own armsman commander pym and here i am he glanced around the sparkling fairy garden i think i was a better fit in the hassadar alleys naw miles always did like having big backup saves a lot of smallscale grief though the largescale grief we still had to take as it came he asked after a moment how did you bodyguard um mlord such a funny way of thinking of him to me hell always be the little admiral mostly i just loomed at people if i had to i smiled but your smiles really kind of nice he protested and managed not to add the once you get used to it out loud hed get the hang of this savoir faire thing yet oh no the other smile she demonstrated her lips wrinkling back her jaw thrusting out roic had to admit it was a much wider smile and um sharper they were just treading past a workman on the rising path he gasped and fell backward into a snowbank with lightning reflexes taura reached past roic and caught the heavy lifesize ice sculpture of a crouching fox before it hit the pavement and shattered into shards roic lifted the gibbering man to his feet and dusted snow off his parka and taura handed back the elegant ornament with a compliment upon its artistry roic managed not to choke with muffled laughter till they both had their backs to the fellow heading away see what you mean did it ever not work occasionally next step was to pick up the recalcitrant one by the neck since my arms were invariably longer than theirs theyd swing like mad but couldnt connect very frustrating for them and after that she grinned stunner by preference hehyep theyd fallen unconsciously into an easy sidebyside pace tracing loops around the garden paths talking shop roic thought what mass dyou lift with or without adrenaline oh without say two hundred fifty kilos with a good grip and a good angle he emitted a respectful whistle if you ever want to give up mercenarying i can think of a fire fighting cadre might could welcome you mbrothers in one down hassadar way though come to think of it mlordd be a more powerful reference now theres an idea id never thought of she pursed her long lips and her brows bent in a quizzical curve but no i expect ill be as you say mercenarying till for the rest of my life i like seeing new planets i like seeing this one i could never have imagined it how many have you seen i think ive lost count i used to know dozens how many have you seen justt one he admitted though hanging around mlord this one keeps getting wider till im almost dizzy more complicated does that make sense she threw back her head and laughed thats our miles admiral quinn always said shed follow him halfway to hell just to find out what happened next wait this quinn you all keep talking about is a lady admiral she was a lady commander when i first met her secondsharpest tactical brain its ever been my privilege to know things may get tight following elli quinn but you know they wont get stupid she didnt sleep her way to the top by a long shot and theyre halfwits who say so she grinned briefly that was just a perk some might say his but id say hers roics eyes crossed trying to unravel this ymean mlord was lovers with her t he cut off the too not quite in time and flushed it seemed mlords covert ops career was even more complicated than hed ever imagined taura cocked her head and regarded him with crinkling eyes thats my favorite shade of pink roic you are a country boy arent you lifes uncertain out there things can go down bad fast anytime people learn to grab what they can when they can for a time we all just get a time in our different ways she sighed their ways diverged when he took those horrible injuries that bounced him out of impsec he couldnt go back up and she wouldnt come down here elli quinns got no one but herself to blame for any chances she threw away though some people are born with more chances to waste than others ill admit i say grab the ones youre issued run with them and dont look back something might be gaining on you i know perfectly well whats gaining on me her grin flashed oddly tilted this time anyway quinn might be more beautiful but i was always taller she gave a satisfied nod glancing at him she added i guarantee miles likes your height its sort of an issue with him i know recruiting officers in three genders who would swoon for your shoulders as well he hadnt the least idea how to respond to that he hoped she was enjoying the pink mlord thinks im a fool he said glumly her brows shot up surely not oh yeah you have no idea how i screwed up ive seen him forgive screwups that put his guts on the bloody ceiling literally youd have to go some to top that how many people died if you put it in that perspective no one he admitted i just wished i could have she grinned in sympathy ah one of those kinds of screwups oh cmon tell he hesitated yknow those nightmares where you find yourself walking around naked in the town square or in front of your schoolteachers or something my nightmares tend to be a bit more exotic but yeah so no lie there i was last summer mlords brother mark brought home this damned escobaran biologist dr borgos that hed picked up somewheres and put him up in the basement of vorkosigan house an investment scheme the biologist made bugs and the bugs made bug butter tons of it slimy white stuff edible sort of we found out the biologist had jumped bail back on escobar for fraud no surprise whent skiptracers theyd sent to arrest him showed up and talked their way into vorkosigan house naturally they picked a time when almost everyone had gone out lord mark and the koudelka sisters who were in on the bug butter scheme got in a fight with them when they tried to carry off borgos and the house staff waked me up to go sort it out all in a tearing panic wouldnt even let me grab my uniform trousers id just got to sleep martya koudelka claims it was friendly fire but i dunno id just about pushed the whole mess of em out the front door when in walks mlord with madame vorsoisson and all her relatives hed just got engaged and wanted to make a good impression on em all it was an unforgettable one i guarantee i was wearing briefs boots and about five kilos of bug butter trying to deal wit all these screaming sticky maniacs a muffled sound escaped from taura she had her hand over her mouth but it wasnt helping little squeaks still leaked out her eyes were alight i swear it wouldnt a been half so bad if id had my briefs on backwards and my stunner holster on frontways i can still hear pyms voice he mimicked the senior armsmans driest tones your weapon is worn on the right armsman she laughed out loud then and looked him up and down in somewhat unsettling appreciation thats a pretty amazing word picture roic despite himself he smiled a little i guess so i dunno if mlords forgiven me but im right sure pym hasnt he sighed if you see one of those damned vomit bugs still around squash it on sight hideous bioengineered mutant things kill em all before they multiply her laughter stopped cold roic reran his last sentence in his head and made the unpleasant discovery that one could do far worse things to oneself with words than with dubious food products or possibly even with needlers he hardly dared look up to see her face he forced his eyes right her face was perfectly still perfectly pale perfectly blank perfectly appalling i meant those devilbugs not you he managed to stop that idiocy on his lips before it escaped to do even more damage but only just he couldnt think of any way to apologize that wouldnt make it worse ah yes she said at last mles did warn me that barrayarans had some pretty ugly issues about gene manipulation i just forgot and i reminded you were getting better he tried good for you she inhaled a long breath lets go in im getting cold roic was frozen straight through um yeah they walked back to the gate in silence roic slept the day around trying to force his body back onto the boring night shift cycle that by the duty roster was to be his junior armsmans fate this winterfair he was quite sorry to thus miss seeing mlord take his galactic guests and a selection of his inlawstobe on a tour of vorbarr sultana hed have been fascinated by what the two disparate parties made of each other madame vorsoissons family the vorvaynes were solid provincial vor types of the sort roic had always regarded as normal to the class before hed taken up his duties in vorkosigan houses high vor milieu mlord well mlord wasnt standard by anybodys standard the four vorvayne brothers though dutifully pleased with their widowed sisters upward social leap plainly found mlord an unnerving catch roic wished he could see what they would make of taura he melted into sleep with a vague scenario drifting through his reeling brain of somehow imposing his body between her and some undefined social insult maybe then she would see that he hadnt meant anything by his awful gaffe he woke at sunset and made a foray down to vorkosigan houses huge kitchen below stairs usually mlords genius cook ma kosti left delectable surprises in the staff refrigerator and was always looking for a good gossip but tonight the pickings were slim and the personal attention nonexistent the place was plunged into final preparations for tomorrows great event and ma kosti driving her harried scullions before her made it plain that anyone below the rank of count or perhaps emperor was very much in the way just now roic fueled up and retreated at least the kitchen did not have to deal with a formal dinner atop all the rest mlord the count and countess and all the guests were off to the imperial residence for the winterfair ball and midnight bonfire the heart of the festivities marking solstice night and the turning of the season when they all decamped from vorkosigan house roic had the vast place to himself but for the rumble from the kitchen and the servants rushing about completing the lastminute decorations and arrangements in the public rooms the great dining room and the seldomused ballroom he was therefore surprised about an hour before midnight when the gate guard called him to code open the front door he was even more surprised when a small car with government markings pulled up under the porte cochere and mlord and sergeant taura climbed out the car buzzed off and its passengers entered the hall shaking the cold air out of their outer garments and handing them off to roic mlord was dressed in the most elaborate version of the brown and silver vorkosigan house uniform befitting a counts heir attending upon the emperor complete with customfitted polished riding boots to his knees taura wore a closefitting embroidered russet jacket made high to the neck where a bit of lace showed and a matching skirt sweeping to ankles clad in soft russetcolored leather boots a graceful spray of creamandrust colored orchids was wound into her braidedup hair roic wished he could have seen her entrance into the imperial winterfair ball and heard what the emperor and empress had said upon meeting her no im all right taura was saying to mlord i saw the palace and the ball they were beautiful but ive had enough its just that i was up at dawn and to tell the truth i think im still a little jumplagged go see to your bride is she still sick i wish i knew mlord paused on the steps three up and leaned on the banister to speak facetoface with taura who was watching him in concern she wasnt sure even last week about attending the emperors bonfire tonight though i thought it would be a valuable distraction she insisted she was all right when i talked to her earlier but her aunt helen says shes all to pieces hiding in her room and crying this is just not like her i thought she was tough as anything oh god taura i think ive screwed up this whole wedding thing so badly i rushed her into it and now its all coming apart i cant imagine how bad the stress must be to make her physically ill slow down dammit miles look you said her first marriage was dire yes not bruises and black eyes bad no draining the blood of your spirit out drop by drop for years bad maybe i only saw the very end of it it was pretty gruesome by then words can cut worse than knives the wounds take longer to heal too she didnt look at roic roic didnt look back isnt that the truth said mlord who wasnt looking at either of them damn should i go over there or not they say its bad luck to see the bride before the wedding or was that the wedding dress i cant remember taura made a face and you accuse her of having wedding heebiejeebies miles listen you know how the recruits got precombat nerves before they went out on a mission the first time oh yes now do you remember how they got precombat nerves before they had to go out on a big drop for the second time after a long pause mlord said oh another silence i hadnt thought of it like that i thought it was me thats because youre an egotist i only met the woman for one hour but even i could see that youre the delight of her eyes at least consider for five consecutive seconds the possibility that it might be him the late vorsoisson whoever he was oh he was something else all right ive cursed him before for the scars he left on her soul i dont think you have to say anything much just be there and be not him mlord drummed his fingers on the banister yes maybe god pray god dammit he glanced across at roic ignored as if he were vorkosigan house furniture a rack to hold coats a dummy roic scrape up a vehicle meet me back here in a few minutes i want you to drive me over to ekaterins aunt and uncles house im going to run up and change out of this armorplating first though he ran his fingers across the elaborate silver embroidery upon his sleeve he turned away and his bootsteps scuffed up the stairs this was way too alarming what int worlds going on roic dared to ask taura ekaterins aunt called him i gather ekaterin lives at her house with lord auditor and professora vorthys yes shes been going to university from there anyway the bridetobe seems to be having some sort of awful nervous breakdown or something she frowned or something miles isnt sure if he should go over and sit with her or not i think he should that didnt sound good in fact it sounded about as notgood as it could be roic tauras brows knotted do you happen to know if i could find any commercial pharmaceutical laboratories open at this time of night in vorbarr sultana pharmaceutical labs roic repeated blankly why do you feel sick too i can call out the vorkosigans personal physician for you or one of the medtechs who ride herd on the count and countess would she need some kind of offworld specialist no matter the vorkosigan name could access one he was sure even on bonfire night no no i feel fine i was just wondering nothing much is open tonight its a holiday everyones out to the parties and bonfires and the fireworks tomorrow too itll be the first day of the new year here by the barrayaran calendar she smiled briefly it would be a new start all round ill bet he liked the symbolism of that i suppose hospital labs are open all night their emergency treatment intakes will be busy as hell too we used to bring the ones in hassadar all kinds of customers on bonfire night hospitals yes of course i should have thought of them at once why do you want one he asked again she hesitated im not sure that i do it was just a train of thought i had earlier this evening when that auntlady called mles not sure i like its destination though she turned away and swung up the stairs taking them two at a time without effort roic frowned then went off to scare up a vehicle from whatever remained in the subbasement garage with so many signed out to transport the household and its guests already this might take some rapid extemporizing but taura had spoken to him almost normally maybe maybe there were such things as second chances if a fellow was brave enough to take them lord auditor and professora vorthyss home was a tall old colorfully tiled structure close to the district university the street was quiet when roic pulled the car borrowed without notification ultimately from one of the armsmen off with the count at the residence up to the front from a distance mainly in the direction of the university drifted the sharp crackle of fireworks harmonious singing and blurred drunken singing a rich heady scent of wood smoke and black powder permeated the frosty night air the porch light was on the professora an aging smiling neat vor lady who intimidated roic only slightly less than did lady alys let them in herself her soft round face was tense with worry did you tell her i was coming mlord asked in a low tone as he shed his coat he stared anxiously up the stairs leading from the narrow woodpaneled hallway i didnt dare helen what should i do mlord looked suddenly smaller and scared and younger and older all at the same time just go up i think this isnt something thats about talking or words or reason ive run through all those he buttoned then unbuttoned the gray tunic hed thrown on over an old white shirt pulled down his sleeves took a deep breath mounted the stairs and turned out of sight after a minute or two the professora stopped picking nervously at her hands gestured roic to a straight chair beside a small table piled with books and flimsies and tiptoed up after him roic sat in the hall and listened to the old house creak from the sitting room visible through one archway a glow from a fireplace gilded the air through the opposite archway the professoras study lay lined with books the light from the hall picked out an occasional bit of gold lettering on an ancient spine in the gloom roic wasnt bookish himself but he liked the comfortable academic smell of this place it occurred to him that back when he was a hassadar guard hed never once gone into a house to clean up a bad scene blood on the walls and evil smells in the air where there were books like this after a long time the professora came back down to the hall roic ducked his head respectfully is she sick maam the tiredlooking woman pursed her lips and let her breath run out she certainly was last night terrible headache so bad she was crying and almost vomiting but she thought she was much better this morning or she said she was she wanted to be better maybe she was trying too hard roic peered anxiously up the staircase would she see him the tension in her face eased a little yes is it going to be all right i think so now her lips sought a smile anyway mles says you are to go on home that he expects to be a while and that hell call if he needs anything yes maam he rose gave her a kind of vague salute copied from mlords own style and let himself out the night duty guard at the gate kiosk reported no entries since roic had left the festivities at the imperial residence would go on till dawn although roic didnt expect vorkosigan houses attendees to stay that late not with the grand party planned here for tomorrow afternoon and evening he put the borrowed car away in the subbasement garage relieved that it hadnt acquired any hardtoexplain dings in its passage back through some of the rowdier crowds between here and the university he made his way softly up through the mostly darkened great house all was quiet now the kitchen crew had at last retreated till tomorrows onslaught the maids and menservants had gone to roost for all that he complained about missing the daytime excitements roic usually enjoyed these quiet night hours when the whole world seemed his personal property granted by three hours before dawn coffee would be a necessity little less urgent than oxygen but by two hours before dawn life would start trickling back as those with early duties roused themselves and padded down to start work he checked the security monitors in the basement hq and started his physical rounds floor by floor window and door never in quite the same order or at quite the same hour as he crossed the great entry hall a creak and a clink sounded from the halflit antechamber to the library he paused for a moment frowned and rose on his toes moving his feet as gently as possible across the marble pavement breathing through his open mouth for silence his shadow wavered passed along from dim wall sconce to dim wall sconce he made sure it was not thrown before him as he moved to the archway easing up beside the door frame he stared into the halfgloom taura stood with her back to him sorting through the gifts displayed upon the long table by the far wall her head bent over something in her hands she shook out a cloth and upended a small box the elegant triple strand of pearls slithered from their velvet backing into the cloth which she wrapped around them she clicked the box closed set it back on the table and slipped the folded cloth into a side pocket of her russet jacket shock held roic paralyzed for a moment longer mlords honored guest rifling the gifts but i liked her i really liked her only now in this moment of hideous revelation did he realize just how much hed come to to admire her in their brief time together brief but so damned awkward she was really beautiful in her own unique way if only you looked at her right for a moment it had seemed as though far suns and strange adventures had beckoned to him from her gold eyes just possibly more intimate and exotic adventures than a shy backcountry boy from hassadar had ever dared to imagine if only he were a braver man a handsome prince not a fool but cinderella was a thief and the fairy tale was gone suddenly sour sick dismay flooded him as he imagined the altercation the shame the wounded friendship and shattered trust that must follow this discovery he almost turned away he didnt know the value of the pearls but even if it were a citys ransom he was certain mlord would trade them in a heartbeat for the ease of spirit hed had with his old followers it was no good theyd be missed first thing tomorrow in any case he drew a breath and touched the light pad taura spun like a huge cat at the flare of the overhead lights after a moment she let out her breath in a huff visibly powering down oh its you you startled me roic moistened his lips could he patch up this shattered fantasy put them back taura please she stood still looking back at him tawny eyes wide a grimace crossed her odd features she seemed to coil tension flowing back into her long body put them back now roic tried again and i wont tell he bore a stunner could he draw it in time hed seen how fast she moved i cant he stared at her without comprehension i dont dare her voice grew edgy please roic let me go now and i promise ill bring them back again tomorrow huh what i cant all the gifts have to go through a security check did this her hand twitched by her pocket full of spoils yes certainly what kind what did you check it for everything is scanned for devices and explosives all food and drink and their containers are tested for chemicals and biologicals only the food and drink she straightened eyes glinting in rapid thought anyway i wasnt stealing it maybe it was the covert ops training that enabled her to stand there and utter baldfaced what counterfactual statements complicated things well then what were you doing again a kind of frozen misery stiffened her features she looked down away into the distance borrowing it she said in a gruff voice she glanced across at him as if to check his reaction to this feeble statement but taura wasnt feeble not by any definition he felt out of his depth flailing for firm footing and not finding it he dared to move closer to hold out his hand give them to me you mustnt touch them her voice went frantic no one must touch them lies and treachery trust and truth what was he seeing here suddenly he wasnt sure back up guardsman why not she glowered at him narroweyed as if trying to see through to the back of his head do you care about miles or is he just your employer roic blinked in increasing confusion he considered his armsmans oath its high honor and weight a vorkosigan armsman isnt just what i am its who i am hes not my employer at all hes my liege lord she made a frustrated gesture if you knew a secret that would hurt him to the heart would you could you keep it from him even if he asked what secret this that his exlover was a thief it didnt seem as though that could be what she was talking about around think man i cant pass a judgment without knowledge knowledge what did she know that he didnt a million things he was sure hed glimpsed some of them dizzying vistas but she didnt know him now did she not the way she evidently knew say mlord to her he was a blank in a brownandsilver uniform with his mirrorpolished boot stuck in his mouth eh he hesitated then countered mlord can requisition my life with a word i gave him that right on my name and breath can you trust me to hold his best interests to heart stare met stare and no one blinked trust for trust roic breathed at last trade taura slowly not dropping her intent searching gaze from his face she drew the cloth from her pocket she shook it gently spilling the pearls back into their velvet box she held the box out what do you see roic frowned pearls pretty white and shiny she shook her head i have a host of genetic modifications hideous bioengineered mutant or no he flinched his mouth opening and shutting among other things i can see slightly farther into the ultraviolet and quite a bit farther into the infrared than a normal person i see dirty pearls strangely dirty pearls and thats not what i usually see when i look at pearls and then miless bride touched them and an hour later was so sick she could hardly stand up an unpleasant tremor coursed down roics body and why the devil hadnt he noticed that progression of events yes thats so theyll have to be checked maybe im wrong i could be wrong maybe im just being horrible and paranoid and and jealous if they were proved clean that would be the end of it but roicquinn you dont have any idea how much he loved quinn and vice versa ive been going halfmad all evening ever since it all clicked in wondering if quinn really sent these it would about slay him if it were so wasnt him these are meant to slay it seemed his liege lords love life was as deceptively complicated as his intelligence both camouflaged by his crippled body or by the assumptions people made about his crippled body roic considered the ambiguous message arde mayhew had evidently seen in the live fur blanket had this quinn woman the other exlover and how many more of them were going to turn up at this wedding anyway and in what frame of mind how many were there altogether and whatt hell did the little guy do to have acquired what was beginning to seem far more than his fair share when roic didnt even have he cut off the gyrating digression or is this necklace lethal or not could it be some nasty practical joke to just make the bride sick on her wedding night ekaterin barely touched them i dont know what this horrible goo may be but i wouldnt lay those pearls against my skin for betan dollars her face twisted up i want it to not be true or i want it to not be quinn her dismay roic was increasingly convinced was unfeigned a cry from her heart taura think you know this quinn woman i dont but you said she was smart dyou think shed be plain stupid enough to sign her own name to murder taura looked taken aback but then shook her head in renewed doubt maybe if it were done for rage or revenge maybe what if her name was stolen by another if she didnt send these she deserves to be cleared and if she did she doesnt deserve anything what was taura going to do he hadnt the least doubt she could kill him with one clawed hand before he could fumble his stunner out the box was still tightly clutched in her great hand her body radiated tension the way a bonfire radiated heat it seems almost unimaginable she said almost but people mad in love do the wildest things sometimes things they regret forever afterward but then its too late thats why i wanted to sneak the pearls away and check them in secret i was praying id be proved wrong tears stood in her eyes now roic swallowed and stood straighter look i can call impsec they can have those whatever they are on the best forensics lab bench on the planet inside half an hour they can check the wrappings check the origin everything if another person stole your friend quinns name to cloak their crime he shuddered as his imagination sketched that crime in elaborating and grotesque detail mlady dying at mlords feet in the snow while her vows were still frost in the air mlords shock disbelief howling anguishthen they should be hunted down without mercy impsec can do that too she still stood poised in doubt on the balls of her feet they would hunt her down with the same unmercy what if they got it wrong made a mistake impsec is competent roic im an impsec employee i can absolutely guarantee you they are not infallible he ran his gaze down the crowded table look theres that other wedding gift he pointed to the folds of shimmering black blanket still piled in the box the room was so quiet he could hear the live furs gentle rumble from here why would she send two the blanket even came with a dirty limerick handwritten on a card not presently on display true madame vorsoisson laughed out loud when mlord read it to her a reluctant smile twitched tauras mouth for a moment oh thats quinn all right if thats truly quinn then this he pointed at the pearlscant be eh trust me trust your own judgment slowly with the deepest distress in her strange gold eyes taura wrapped the box in the cloth and handed it to him then roic found himself facing the task all by himself of stirring up impsec supreme headquarters in the middle of the night he almost wanted to wait for pyms return but he was a vorkosigan armsman senior man present even if merely because sole man present it was his duty it was his right and time was of the essence if only to relieve tauras troubled mind at the earliest possible instant she hovered bleak and worried as he gulped for nerve and fired up the secured comconsole in the nearby library a seriouslooking impsec captain reported to the front hall in less than thirty minutes he recorded everything including roics verbal report tauras description of what the pearls had looked like to her both their accounts of madame vorsoissons witnessed symptoms and a copy of pyms original security check records roic tried to be straightforward as hed often wished witnesses would have been to him back in hassadar although in this version the fraught confrontation in the antechamber became merely sergeant taura voiced a suspicion to me well it was true for tauras sake roic made sure to mention the possibility that the pearls had not been sent by quinn at all and pointed out the other gift certainly known to be from her the captain frowned and bundled up the live fur as well and looked as though he wanted to bundle up taura along with it he carried off the pearls the stillpurring blanket and all related packaging in a series of sealed and labeled plastic bags all this chill efficiency took a bare half hour more do you want to go to bed roic asked taura when the doors closed behind the impsec captain she looks so tired i have to stay up anyway i can give you a call to your room when theres any news if theres any news she shook her head i couldnt sleep maybe theyll have something soon theres no telling but i hope so they settled down to wait together on a sturdylooking sofa in the antechamber opposite the one displaying the gifts the noises of the night odd squeaks of the house settling against the winter cold the faint whir or hum of distant automated machinery were very noticeable in the stillness taura stretched what roic suspected were knotted shoulders and he was briefly inspired to offer a back rub but he wasnt sure how shed take it the impulse dissolved in cowardice quiet around here at night she said after a moment she was speaking to him again please dont stop yeah i sort of like it though oh you too the night watch is a philosophical kind of time its own world nothing moving out there but maybe people being born or people dying necessity and us eh and the bad night people were put on watch against she glanced through the archway into the great hall and beyond apparently so what an evil trick she trailed off in a grimace this quinn youve known her a long time she was in the dendarii mercenaries at the time i joined the fleetoriginal equipment as she says a good leader a friend by many shared disasters and victories sometimes ten years adds up to some weight even if youre not watching especially if youre not watching i suppose he followed the thought spoken by her glance as well as her words eh yeah god spare me from ever facing such a puzzle it would be as bad as having your count revolt against the emperor i suppose or like finding mlord in on some insane plot to murder empress laisa shouldnt wonder that youve been running around in circles in your head all night tighter and tighter yes i couldnt enjoy the emperors party from the moment i thought of it and i know miles so wanted me to and i couldnt tell him why im afraid he thought i was feeling out of place well i was but it wasnt a problem exactly im usually out of place she blinked tawny eyes gone dark and wide in the halflight what would you do if you discovered or suspected such a horror his lips twisted thats a tough one a higher honor must underlie ours the count says we cant ever obey unthinkingly huh thats what miles says too is that where he got it from his father i shouldnt be surprised mlords brother mark says integrity is a disease and you can only catch it from someone who has it a little laugh sounded in her throat that sounds like mark all right he considered her question with the seriousness it merited id have to turn him in i guess i hope id have the courage anyways nobody would win in the end least of all me oh yeah i can see that her hand lay on the sofa fabric between them clawed fingers tapping he wanted to take it and squeeze it for comfort hers or his but he didnt dare dammit try cant you his argument with himself was interrupted when his wrist com sounded the gate guard reported the return of the vorkosigan house party from the imperial residence roic coded down the house shields and stood aside as the crowd disembarked from a small fleet of groundcars pym was in close attendance upon the countess smiling at something she was saying over her shoulder to him the guests variously cheerful drowsy or drunk streamed past chatting and laughing anything to report pym inquired perfunctorily he glanced in curiosity past roic at taura looming over his shoulder yes sir see me in private as soon as you can please the benign sleepy look evaporated from pyms features oh he glanced back at the mob now divesting wraps and streaming up the stairs right lowvoiced as roic had been the countess had caught the exchange a wave of her finger dismissed pym from her side although if this is of moment pym ill take a report before bed she murmured yes my lady roic jerked his head toward the antechamber of the library and pym followed him and taura through the archway the moment the guests had cleared the next room roic decanted a short precis of the nights adventure selfplagiarized from the one hed given to the impsec forensics captain omitting again the part about tauras attempted theft he hoped like hell that it wasnt going to turn out to be horribly pertinent later he would submit the full account to in lords judgment he decided when the devil was mlord going to return pym grew rigid as he took in the report i checked that necklace myself roic scanned it clear of devices the chemical sniffer didnt pick up anything either did you touch it asked taura pyms eyes narrowed in memory i mainly handled it by the clasp well well impsec will run it through the wringer mlord always claims they can use the exercise it cant hurt you acted correctly armsman roic you can continue about your duties now ill follow it up with impsec with this tepid praise he moved off frowning is that all we get taura whispered as pyms ascending footsteps faded on the winding staircase roic glanced at his chrono till impsec reports back i guess it depends on how hard that dirty stuff you saw he didnt insult her by phrasing it as you claimed you sawis to identify she scrubbed tiredlooking eyes with the back of her hand can i uh can i stay with you till they call sure in a moment of true inspiration he led her down to the kitchen and introduced her to the staff refrigerator hed been correct her extraordinary metabolism was in need of fuel again ruthlessly he cleared out everything on the shelves and laid it in front of her the early morning crew could fend for themselves there was no shame here in offering up servants food to a guest everyone ate well from ma kostis kitchen he dialed up coffee for himself and tea for her and they perched together on two stools at the counter pym found them there as they were finishing eating the senior armsmans face was so drained of blood as to be nearly green well done roic sergeant taura he began in a stiff voice very well done i just now spoke with impsec headquarters the pearls were doctored with a designer neurotoxin impsec thinks its of jacksonian origin but theyre still crosschecking the dose was sealed under a chemically neutral transparent lacquer that dissolves with body heat casual handling wouldnt release it but if someone put the necklace on and wore it for a time half an hour or so enough to kill someone tauras tone was tense enough to kill a bloody elephant the lab boys say pym moistened dry lips and i checked it myself i bloody passed it his teeth clenched she was going to wear them to mlord would have he choked himself off and ran a hand over his face hard does impsec know who really sent them asked taura not yet but theyre all over it you can believe a vision of the deadly pale spheres lying on mladytobes warm throat flashed through roics memory madame vorsoisson touched the pearls last night night before last that is now said roic urgently she had them on for at least five minutes is she going to be all right impsec is dispatching a physician to lord auditor vorthyss to check her one of their toxins experts if shed taken in enough to kill her shed have died right then so thats not going to happen but i dont know what other i have to go now and call mlord there and warn him to expect a visitor and and tell him why well done roic did i say well done well done pym drew a shaken unhappy breath and strode back out taura her chin in her hand as she drooped over her plate scowled after him jacksonian neurotoxin eh that doesnt prove much the jacksonians will sell anything to anyone mles made enough enemies there in some of our old sorties if they knew it was intended for him theyd probably offer a deep discount yeah i imagine tracing the source is going to take a little longer even for impsec he hesitated although wouldnt they know him on jacksons whole only under his old covert ops identity your little admiral that covers been wellblown for a couple of years he tells me partly as a result of the mess his last mission there produced partly from some other things over my head she yawned hugely it was impressive shed been up since dawn roic was reminded and hadnt slept through the afternoon as he had stranded in what must seem to her an alien place and wrestling terrible fears all by herself for the first time he wondered if she was lonely one of a kind the last of her kind if he understood correctly without home or kin except for that chancy wandering mercenary fleet and then he wondered why he hadnt noticed her essential aloneness sooner armsmen were supposed to be observant yeah if i promise to come by and tell you if i get any news dyou suppose you could try to sleep she rubbed the back of her neck would you then i think i could try that is he escorted her to her door past mlords dark and empty suite when he clasped her hand briefly she clasped back he swallowed for courage dirty pearls eh he said still holding her hand yknow i cant speak for arty other barrayarans but i think your genetic modifications are beautiful her lips curved up he hoped not altogether bleakly you are getting better when she let go and turned in a claw trailing lightly over the skin of his palm made his body shudder in involuntary sensual surprise he stared at the closing door and swallowed a perfectly foolish urge to call her back or follow her inside he was still on duty he reminded himself the next monitors check was overdue he forced himself to turn away the sky outside was shifting from the amber night of the city to a chill blue dawn when the gate guard called roic to code down the house shields for mlords return as the armsman whod been called out to chauffeur drove the big car off to put away roic opened one door to admit the hunched frowning figure mlord looked up to recognize roic and a rather ghastly smile lightened his furrowed features roic had seen mlord looking strungout before but never so alarmingly as this not even after one of his bad seizures or when hed had that spectacular hangover after the disastrous butter bug banquet his eyes stared out from gray circles like feral animals from their dens his skin was pale and lines of tension mapped the anxiety across his face his movements were simultaneously tired and stiff and jerky and nervous a spinning exhaustion that could find no place of rest roic thank you bless you mlord began in a voice that sounded as though it were coming from the bottom of a well is mladytobe all right roic asked in some apprehension mlord nodded yes now she fell asleep in my arms finally after the impsec doctor left god roic i cant believe i missed the signs poisoning and i fastened that death around her neck with my own hands its a damned metaphor for this whole thing thats what it is she thought it was just her i thought it was just her how little faith in herself or me in her to misidentify dying of poison for dying of selfdoubt shes not dying is she roic asked again to be sure in this spate of dramatic angst it was a little hard to tell the bit of exposure she got isnt going to have any permanent effects is it mlord began to pace in circles around the entry hall while roic followed vainly trying to take his coat the doctor said not not once the headaches pass off which they seem to have done now she was so relieved to find out what it really was she burst into tears go figure that one out eh yeah except that roic began then bit his tongue except that the crying jag hed inadvertently witnessed had occurred well before the poisoning what nothing mlord lord vorkosigan paused at the archway to the antechamber impsec we must call impsec to take away all those gifts and recheck them for they already came and collected them mlord roic soothed him or tried to an hour ago they say theyll tryt get as many as possible cleared and back before the wedding guests start arriving come midafternoon oh good mlord stood still a moment staring into nothing and roic finally managed to get his coat away from him mlord you dont think your admiral quinn sent that necklace do you oh good heavens no of course not mlord dismissed this fear with a startlingly casual wave of his hand not her style at all if she were ever that mad at me shed kick me downstairs personally great woman quinn sergeant taura was worried i think she thought this quinn might a been um jealous mlord blinked why i mean yes its almost exactly a year since elli and i parted company but ekaterin had nothing to do with that didnt even meet her till a couple of months later the timings pure coincidence you can assure her yeah so elli turned down the wedding invitation she has responsibilities she got the fleet after all a small sigh escaped him his lips screwed up in further thought id sure like to know who knew enough to steal quinns name to smuggle that hellish package in here though thats the real puzzle quinns connected to admiral naismith not to lord vorkosigan which was the sticking point in the first place but never mind now i want impsec to put every available resource on to tearing that one apart i believe they already are mlord oh good he looked up and his face grew if possible more serious you saved my house last night you know eleven generations of vorkosigans have narrowed down to the choke point of me this generation this marriage id have been the last but for that chance no not chance that moment of shrewd observation roic waved an embarrassed hand wasnt me who spotted it mlord it was sergeant taura shed have reported it herself earlier if she hadnt been half taken in byt bad guys nasty camouflage with your um friend admiral quinns name mlord took up his taut orbit of the hall again bless taura then a woman beyond price which i already knew but anyway i could kiss her feet by god i could kiss her all over roic was beginning to think that line about the barbedwire choke chain wasnt such a joke after all all this frenetic tension was if not precisely infectious starting to get on what was left of his nerves he remarked dryly in pymlike periods i was given to understand you already had mlord mlord jerked to a halt again who told you that under the circumstances roic decided not to mention madame vorsoisson taura eh maybe its the womens secret code i dont have the key though youre on your own there boy he snorted a trifle hysterically but if you ever do win an invitation from her beware its like being mugged in a dark alley by a goddess youre not the same man after not to mention critical feminine body parts on a scale you can actually find and as for the fangs theres no thrill quite like miles a bemused voice interrupted from overhead roic glanced up to see the countess wrapped in a robe leaning over the balcony railing and observing her son how long had she been standing there she was betan maybe mlords last remarks wouldnt discombobulate her as much as they did roic in fact he reflected he was certain they couldnt good morning mother mlord managed some bastard tried to poison ekaterin did you hear when i catch up with him i swear im going to make the dismemberment of mad emperor yuri look like a house party yes impsec has kept your father and me fully apprised during the night and i just spoke with helen everything seems under control for the moment except for persuading pym not to throw himself off the star bridge in expiation hes pretty distraught over this slipup for pitys sake come up and take a sleeptimer and lie down for a while i dont want a pill i have to check the garden i have to check everything the garden is fine everything is fine as you have just discovered in armsman roic here your staff is more than competent she started down the stairs a distinctly steely look in her eye its either a sleeptimer or a sledgehammer for you son i am not handing you off to your blameless bride in the state youre in or the worse one itll be if you dont get some real sleep before this afternoon its not fair to her nothing about this marriage is fair to her mlord muttered bleak she was afraid it would be the nightmare of her old marriage all over again no its going to be a completely different nightmare much worse how can i ask her to step into my line of fire if as i recall she asked you i was there remember stop gibbering the countess took his arm and began more or less frogmarching him upstairs roic made a mental note of her technique for future reference she glanced over her shoulder and gave roic a reassuring if rather unexpected wink the brief remainder of the most memorable night shift of his career passed to roics relief without further incident of note he dodged excited maidservants hurrying to the big days tasks and mounted the stairs to his tiny fourthfloor bedroom thinking that mlord wasnt the only one who should get some sleep before the afternoons more public duties mlords last decidedly freefloating comments kept him awake for some time though beguiling him with visions of somewhat shocking charm such as hed never dreamed of back in hassadar he fell asleep with his lips curling up a few minutes before his alarm was set to go off roic was awakened by armsman jankowski tapping at his bedroom door pym says youre to report to mlords suite right away some kind of briefing you dont have to be in your uniform yet right dress uniform jankowski meant although jankowski was already sharp in his own roic slipped on last nights wear and ran a comb through his hair frowned in frustration at his beard shadowright away presumably meant just that and hurried downstairs roic found mlord in his suites sitting room halfway dressed in a silk shirt the brown trousers with silver sidepiping and the silverembroidered suspenders that wentwith and slippers he was attended by his cousin ivan vorpatril resplendent in his own houses blueandgold uniform as mlords second and chief witness in the imminent ceremony lord ivan was also playing grooms batman as well as general supporter one of roics fonder secret memories from the past weeks was of witnessing in his role as disregarded coatrack the great viceroy count vorkosigan himself taking his handsome nephew aside and promising in a voice so low as to be almost a whisper to have ivans hide for a drumskin if he allowed his misplaced sense of fun to do anything at all to screw up the impending ceremony for mlord ivan had been humorless as a judge all week side bets were being taken belowstairs for how long it would last remembering that deeply ominous voice roic had selected the longest shot in the pool and thought himself likely to win taura also in last nights gear of skirt and lacy blouse lounged on one of the small sofas in the bay window apparently offering bracing advice mlord had evidently taken the sleeptimer for he looked vastly better clean shaved cleareyed and very nearly calm ekaterins here he told roic in the awed tone of a besieged garrison commander describing the unexpected relieving force the brides party is using my mothers suite for their staging area mothers going to bring her down in a moment she needs to be in on this in on what was answered before roic could voice the question by the entry of impsec chief general allegre himself in dress greens escorted by the count also already in his best house uniform allegre was a wedding guest in his own right but it clearly wasnt for social reasons that hed arrived an hour early the countess and ekaterin followed on their heels the countess graceful in something sparkling and green mladytobe still in her drab dress but with her hair already braided up and thickly entwined with tiny roses and other exquisite little scented flowers that roic could not name both women looked grave but a smile like a fugitive gleam from paradise lit ekaterins eyes as they met mlords roic found he had to look away from that brief intensity feeling a clumsy intruder he thus surprised tauras expression shrewdly approving but more than a little wistful ivan drew up extra chairs and all disposed themselves around the small table near the window madame vorsoisson took a seat beside mlord decorously but with no wasted centimeters between he gripped her hand roic managed to slip in next to taura she smiled down at him these chambers had once belonged to the late great general piotr vorkosigan before theyd been claimed by his grandson the rising young lord auditor this spot not the grand public rooms downstairs was the site of more military political and secret conferences of historic import to barrayar than roic could readily imagine i dropped by early to give you impsecs latest report in person miles madame vorsoisson count countess allegre halfleaning on a sofa arm nodded around he reached into his tunic and withdrew a plastic bag in which something white glimmered and gleamed and to return these i had my forensics people clean them after collecting and recording the evidence theyre safe now gingerly mlord took the pearls from his hand and set them down on the table and do you know yet who gets the thankyou note for this gift im rather hoping to deliver it in person illconcealed menace vibrated beneath his light tone that has actually broken open much faster than i was expecting said allegre it was a very nice forgery job on the date stamps from escobar on the outer packaging but the inner decorative wrapping checked out under analysis as of barrayaran origin once we knew which planet to look on the item was sufficiently unique the necklace is of earth origin by the way we were able to trace it by jewelers import records almost at once it was purchased two weeks ago in vorbarr sultana for a large sum of cash and the store security vids for the month hadnt been erased yet my agent positively identified lord vorbataille mlord hissed through his teeth he was on my short list yes no wonder he was trying so hard to get off planet he was up to his eyebrows in the plan but he wasnt its originator do you remember how you said to me three weeks ago that while there had to be brains behind this operation youd swear they werent in vorbatailles head yes said mlord i had him pegged for a front man suborned for his connections and his yacht of course you were right we picked up his jacksonian crime consultant about three hours ago you have him we have him hell keep now allegre gave mlord a grim nod although he had the wit to not bring attention to himself by trying to get off planet one of my analysts who came in last night to look over the new evidence that came in with the necklace was able to run a backtrace and crossconnect and so identify him well actually he fingered three suspects but fastpenta cleared two of them the source for the toxin was a fellow by the name of luca tarpan mlord mouthed the syllables his face screwed up damn are you sure ive never heard of him quite sure he appears to have ties with the bharaputra syndicate on jacksons whole well that would give him access to quite a lot of somewhat scrambled twoyearold information about me and quinn yes both mes in fact and it accounts for the superior forgery but why such a heinous attack its almost more disturbing to think that some total stranger would have we crossed paths before allegre shrugged it seems not the preliminary interrogation suggests it was a purely professional ploy although he clearly had no love left for you by the time you were about half done ripping open this case your talent for making interesting new enemies has evidently not deserted you the plan was to create distracting chaos in your investigation just after the group made its getaway vorbataille was preselected to be thrown to us for a goat it turns out but we shut them down about eight days early the necklace had only just been slipped into the delivery services records and dispatched at that point mlords teeth set youve had vorbataille in your hands for two days and fastpenta didnt turn this up allegre grimaced i just reviewed the transcripts before i drove over here it came very close to surfacing but to get an answer even especially under fastpenta as useful a truth drug as it is you must first know enough to ask the question my interrogators were concentrating on the princess olivia it was vorbatailles yacht that was used to insert the hijacking team by the way knew it had to be grunted mlord wed have caught up with this necklace scheme in a few more days on our own i think said allegre mlord glanced at his chrono and said rather thickly youd have caught up with it in about one more hour actually on your own allegre tilted his head in frank acknowledgment yes unfortunately madame vorsoisson he touched his brow in a considerably more formal gesture than the usual impsec saluteon behalf of myself and my organization i wish to offer you my most abject apologies my lord auditor count countess he looked up at roic and taura sitting side by side on the sofa opposite fortunately impsec was not your last line of defense indeed rumbled the count who had seated himself on a straight chair turned backward arms comfortably crossed over its back listening intently but without comment till now countess vorkosigan stood by his side her hand touched his shoulder and he caught it under his own thicker one allegre said illyan once told me that half the secret of house vorkosigans preeminence in barrayaran history was the quality of the people it drew to its service im glad to see this continues to hold true armsman roic sergeant taura impsec salutes you with more gratitude than i can rightly express he did so in a sober gesture altogether free of his sporadic irony roic blinked ducking his head in lieu of the return salute he wasnt sure if he was supposed to make he wondered if he was expected to say something he hoped to hell no one would want him to make a speech like after that incident in hassadar that had been more horrifying than the needler fire he glanced up to find taura glancing down at him eyes bright he wanted to ask her he wanted to ask her a thousand things but not here would they ever get a private moment again not for the next several hours that was certain well love mlord blew out his breath staring down at the plastic bagi think thats your final warning travel with me and you travel into hazard i dont want it to be so but its going to go on being so as long as i serve what i serve mladytobe glanced at the countess whose return smile was decidedly twisted i never imagined it would be otherwise for a lady vorkosigan ill have these destroyed mlord said reaching for the pearls no said mladytobe her eyes narrowing wait he paused raising his eyebrows at her they were sent to me theyre my souvenir i shall keep them id have worn them as a courtesy to your friend she reached past him and scooped up the bag tossed it up and caught it again out of the air her long fingers closing tightly around it her edged smile took roic aback ill wear them now as a defiance to our enemies mlords eyes blazed back at her the countess seized the moment possibly roic thought to cut off her son from further blithering and tapped her chrono speaking of wearing things its time to get dressed mlord went a shade paler yes of course he kissed mladytobes hand as she rose looking as if he never wanted to let it go again countess vorkosigan herded everyone except mlord and his cousin into the hallway shutting the door to the suite firmly behind her he looks much better now said roic to her glancing back i think your sleeptimer was justt thing yes plus the tranquilizers i had aral give him when he went in to wake him up a while ago the double dose seems to have been just about right she hooked her arm through her husbands still think it should have been a triple he murmured now now calm not comatose is the goal for our groom she escorted madame vorsoisson toward the stairs the count went off with allegre taking advantage of the chance to discuss details or perhaps drinks in private taura stared after them her smile askew you know i wasnt sure about that woman for miles at first but i think shell do him very well that vor thing of his always baffled elli ekaterin has it in her bones same as he does god help them both roic had been about to say that he thought mladytobe better than mlord deserved but tauras last remark brought him up short huh yeah shes true vor all right its no easy thing taura started down the corridor but stopped at the corner and halfturned back to ask so what are you doing after the party night guard duty all bloody week roic realized in dismay and taura only had ten days left onplanet ah she whisked away roic glanced at his chrono and gulped the generous time hed allotted to dress and report for wedding duty was almost gone he ran for the stairs the guests were already starting to arrive spilling from the entry hall through the succession of flowergraced public rooms when roic scuffed quickly down the staircase to take up his allotted place as backup to armsman pym in turn backing up count and countess vorkosigan some onsite guests were already in place lady alys vorpatril acting as assistant hostess and general expediter and her benevolently absentminded escort simon illyan the botharijeseks mayhew in apparent permanent tow of nikki an assortment of vorvaynes who had overflowed from lord auditor vorthyss packed house to vorkosigan house guest rooms mlords friend commodore galeni chief of impsec komarran affairs and his wife were early arrivals along with mlords special progressive party colleagues the vorbrettens and the vorrutyers commodore koudelka and his spouse known universally as kou and drou arrived with their daughter martya martya was standing in as madame vorsoissons second in place of mladytobes closest friend yet another koudelka daughter kareen still at school on beta colony kareen and mlords brother lord mark were much missed albeit in remembrance of the bug butter incident not by roic but the interstellar travel time had proved too tight for their schedules lord marks wedding present was a gift certificate for the bridal couple for a week at an exclusive and very expensive betan resort however so perhaps mlord and his lady would soon be visiting his brother and their friend not to mention mlords betan relatives as gifts went it at least had the advantage of shifting all the security challenges inherent in the trip to some later time martya was sped upstairs by a maid detailed to that purpose martyas escort and lord marks business partner dr borgos was quietly taken aside by pym for an unscheduled frisking for any surprise gift insects he might have been harboring but this time the scientist proved clean martya returned unexpectedly soon her brow wrinkled thoughtfully and repossessed him to stroll off in search of drinks and company lord auditor and professora vorthys arrived with the rest of the vorvaynes altogether a goodly company four brothers three wives ten children and mladytobes father and stepmother in addition to her beloved aunt and uncle roic glimpsed nikki showing off arde to his mob of awed young vorvayne cousins pressing the jump pilot to decant galactic war stories to this enthralled audience nikki didnt roic noted seem to have to press very hard the betan pilot grew downright expansive in the warm glow of these attentions the vorvayne side stood up bravely to the glittering company that was vorkosigan houses norm well lord auditor vorthys was notoriously oblivious to any status not backed by proven engineering expertise but even the brides most buoyant older brother grew subdued and thoughtful when count gregor and countess laisa vorbarra were announced the emperor and empress had chosen to attend the supposedly informal afternoon affair as social equals to the vorkosigans which saved a world of protocol hassles for everyone not least themselves not in any other uniform but that of his counts house could the emperor have publicly embraced his little foster brother miles who ran downstairs to greet him nor been so sincerely embraced in return in all mlords little wedding numbered one hundred twenty guests vorkosigan house absorbed them all at last the moment arrived the hall and antechambers became brief crowded chaos as wraps were redonned and the guests all streamed out the gate and around the corner to the garden the air was cold but not bitter and thankfully windless the sky a deepening clear blue the slanting afternoon sun liquid gold it turned the snowy garden into as gilded glittering spectacular and utterly unique a showplace as mlords heart could ever have desired the flowers and ribbons were concentrated around the central place where the vows were to be complementing the wild brilliance of the ice and snow and light although roic was fairly sure that the two realistically detailed ice rabbits humping under a discreet bush were not part of the decorations mlord had ordered they did not pass unnoticed as the first person to observe them immediately pointed them out to everyone within earshot ivan vorpatril averted his gaze from the cheerfully obscene artwork the rabbits were grinning a look of innocence on his face the counts menacing glower at him was alas undercut by an escaping snicker which became a guffaw when the countess whispered something in his ear the grooms party took up their positions in the center of the garden the walkways swept clear of snow met at a wide circle of paving brick with the vorkosigan crest of mountains and maple leaves picked out in contrasting brick in this obvious spot the small circle of colored groats was laid out on the ground for the oathmaking couple surrounded by a multipointed star for the principal witnesses another circle of groats crowned a temporary pathway of tanbark flung wide around the first two rings providing dry footing for the rest of the guests roic wearing a sword for the first time since hed taken his liegemans oath took his place in the formal lineup of armsmen making an aisle on either side of the main pathway he looked around in worry for taura did not loom up among the grooms guests sorting themselves out along the outer circle mlord his hand clutching his cousin ivans blue sleeve gazed up at the entrance in almost painful anticipation mlord had with difficulty been talked out of hauling his horse in to town to fetch the bride from the house in the old vor style though roic personally had no doubt that the placid elderly steed would have proved much less nervous and difficult to handle than its master so the vorvayne party made their entrance on foot lady alys as coach led the way like some silken banner carrier the bride followed on her blinking fathers arm shimmering in a jacket and skirt of beige velvet embroidered with shining silver her booted feet striding out fearlessly her eyes seeking only one other face in the mob the triple stand of pearls gracing her throat glimmered their secret message of bravado to only a few persons here a few extraordinary persons by his narrowed eyes and wryly pursed lips it was clear that emperor gregor was one of them roics might have been the sole gaze not to linger on the bride for following beside her stepmother in the place of no asthe brides second walked sergeant taura roics eyes shifted though he kept his rigid posture yes there was martya koudelka with dr borgos on the outer circle apparently demoted to the status of mere guest but not looking in the least putout in fact she seemed to be watching taura with smug approval tauras dress was everything that lady alys had promised champagnecolored velvet exactly matched her eyes which seemed to spring to a brilliant prominence in her face the jacket sleeves and long swinging skirt were decorated on their margins with black cord shaped into winding patterns champagnecolored orchids coiled in her boundback hair roic thought hed never seen anything so stunningly sophisticated in his life everyone took their places mlord and mladytobe stepped into the inner circle hands gripping hands like two lovers drowning the bride looked not so much radiant as incandescent the groom looked gobsmacked lord ivan and taura were handed the two little bags of groats with which to close the circle then stood back to their star points between count and countess vorkosigan and vorvayne and his wife lady alys read out the vows and mlord and mladytomlady repeated their responses her voice clear his only cracking once the kiss was managed with remarkable grace mlady somehow bending her knee in a curtsylike motion so mlord didnt have to stretch unduly it suggested thought and practice lots of practice with immense panache lord ivan then swept the groat circle wide with one booted foot triumphantly collecting his kiss from the bride as she exited lord and lady vorkosigan passed out of the dazzling ice garden between the lines of vorkosigan armsmen swords drawn and lowered at their feet rose in salute as they passed when pym led the armsmens shout the sound of twenty enthusiastic male voices bounced and echoed off the garden walls and thundered to the sky mlord grinned over his shoulder and blushed with pleasure at this deafening endorsement as seconds taura followed next on lord ivans arm bending her head to hear something he said laughing the row of armsmen remained to rigid attention while all the principals streamed past them then formed up and marched smartly in their wake followed by the guests back around and into vorkosigan house it had all gone off perfectly pym looked as though he wanted to pass out there and then from sheer relief vorkosigan houses main state dining room boasted seating for ninetysix when both tables were brought out in parallel the overflow fit in the chamber immediately beyond through a wide archway so that the whole company could sit down at once essentially together serving was not roics responsibility tonight but in his role as arbiter of emergencies and general assistant for any guest needing anything he kept to his feet and moving taura was seated at the head table with the principals and the most honored guests the other most honored guests between tall dark handsome lord ivan and tall dark lean emperor gregor she looked really happy roic could not wish her anywhere else but he found himself mentally erasing ivan and replacing him with himself yet ivan and the emperor were the very pattern of debonair wit they made taura laugh fangs flashing without constraint roic would probably just sit there in inarticulate silence and gawp at her martya koudelka passed him in the entryway where hed temporarily taken up guard stance and smiled cheerily at him hi roic he nodded miss martya she followed his glance to the head table taura looks wonderful doesnt she sure does he hesitated how come youre not up there her voice lowered i heard the story about last night from ekaterin she asked me if id mind trading i said god no gets me out of having to sit there and make small talk with ivan for one thing she wrinkled her nose it was well thought of of mlady she hitched up one shoulder it was the one honor here that was wholly hers to bestow the vorkosigans are amazing but you have to admit they do eat you up they give you a wild ride in return though she stood on tiptoe and planted an unexpected kiss on roics cheek he touched the spot in surprise whats that for for your half of last night for saving us all from having to live with a really insane miles vorkosigan as long as he lasted a brief quaver shook her flippant voice she tossed her blond hair and bounced off the toasts were made with the counts very best wines including a few historical bottles reserved for the head table that had been laid down before the end of the time of isolation afterward the party moved to the brilliant ballroom seeming another garden heady with the scent of a sudden spring lord and lady vorkosigan opened the dancing those who could still move after the dinner followed them onto the polished marquetry floor roic found himself all too briefly passing by taura as she watched the dancers sway and twirl do you dance roic she asked him cant im on duty you im afraid i dont know any of these dances although im sure miles would have foisted an instructor on me if hed thought of it actually he admitted in a lower voice i dont know how either her lips curled up well dont let miles know if you want it to stay that way hed have you out there thumping around before you knew what hit you he tried not to snicker he hardly knew what to say to this but his parting halfsalute did not betoken disagreement on the sixth number mlady danced past roic with her eldest brother hugo splendid necklace kat from your spouse is it no actually from one of his business associates expensive yes mladys faint smile made the hairs stir on roics arms i expect it to cost him everything he has they spun away taura nailed it shell do for mlord all right and god help their enemies promptly on schedule the aircar was brought round for the bridal couples getaway the night was still fairly young but it was more than an hours flight to vorkosigan surleau and the lakeside estate that was to be the honeymoon refuge the place would be quiet this time of year blanketed with snow and peace roic could not imagine two people more in need of a little peace the guests in residence were to be left behind under the care of the count and countess for a few days although the galactic guests would travel down to the lake later among other things roic was given to understand madame botharijesek wished to visit her fathers grave there with her husband and new daughter and burn a death offering roic had thought pym would be doing the flying but to his surprise armsman jankowski took the controls as the newlyweds ran the gauntlet of raucous family and friends and made it to the rear compartment ive shuffled some assignments pym murmured to roic as they both stood smiling in the porte cochere to watch and salute mlord and mlady seemed to melt into each others arms in an equal mix of love and exhaustion as the silvered canopy finally closed over them im taking night watch in vorkosigan house for the next week you have the week off with double holiday pay with mladys own thanks oh said roic he blinked pym had been quite frustrated by the fact that no one from the count down had seen fit to censure him for the slipup with the necklace he could only conclude that pym had given up and decided to supply his own penance well if the senior armsman looked to be carrying it too far the countess could be relied upon to step in thanks you can consider yourself free from whenever count and countess vorbarra leave pym nodded and stepped back as the aircar eased out from under the overhang and began to rise into the cold night air as if buoyed up by the yells and cheers of the wellwishers a splendid and prolonged burst of fireworks made the sendoff a thing of beauty and a joy to barrayaran hearts taura applauded and hooted too and along with arde mayhew joined nikkis cohort for some added unscheduled crackers and sparklers in the back garden powder smoke perfumed the air in clouds as the children ran around taura urging her to throw the lights higher security and an assortment of mothers might have quashed the game except for the fact that the large bag of most remarkable incendiary goodies had been slipped to nikki by count vorkosigan the party wound down sleepy protesting children were carried past roic to their cars or to their beds the emperor and empress were seen out fondly by the count and countess soon after their departure a score of unobtrusive efficient servants on loan from impsec vanished quietly and without fanfare the remaining energetic young people hijacked the ballroom to dance to music more to their taste their tired elders sought quieter corners in the succession of public rooms in which to converse and sample more of the counts very best wines roic found taura sitting alone in one of the small side rooms on a sturdylooking sofa of the style she favored reflectively working her way through a platter of ma kostis dainties on a low table before her she looked drowsy and contented and yet little apart from it all as if she were a guest in her own life roic gave her a smile a nod a semisalute he wished hed thought to provide himself with roses or something what could a fellow give to a woman like this the finest chocolate maybe yeah although that was redundant at the moment tomorrow for sure um have you had a good time oh yes wonderful she sat back and smiled almost up at him an unusual angle of view she looked good from this direction too mlords comment about horizontal height differentials drifted through his memory she patted the sofa beside her roic glanced around overcame his guardstance habits and sat down his feet hurt he realized the silence that fell was companionable not strained but after a time he broke it you like barrayar then its been a great visit better than my best dreams ten more days ten days was an eyeblink ten days was just not enough for all he had to say to give to do ten years might be a start you uh have you ever thought of staying here it could be done yknow find a place you could fit or make one mlord would figure out how if anyone could with great daring he let his hand curl over hers on the seat between them her brows rose i already have a place i fit yeah but forever your meres seem like a chancy sort of thing to me no solid ground under them and nothing lasts forever not even organizations nobody lives long enough to have all their choices she was silent for a moment then added the people who bioengineered me to be a supersoldier didnt consider a long life span to be a necessity miles has a few biting remarks about that but oh well the fleet medics give me about a year yet oh it took him a minute to work through this his stomach felt suddenly tight and cold a dozen obscure remarks from the past few days fell into place he wished they hadnt no oh no hey dont look so bludgeoned her hand curled around to clasp his in return the bastards have been giving me a year yet for the past four years running ive seen other soldiers have their whole careers and die in the time the medics have been screwing around with me ive stopped worrying about it he had no idea what to say to this screaming was right out he shifted a bit closer to her instead she eyed him thoughtfully some fellows when i tell them this get spooked and veer off its not contagious roic swallowed hard im not running away i see that she rubbed her neck with her free hand an orchid petal parted from her hair and caught upon her velvetclad shoulder part of me wishes the medics would get it settled part of me says the hell with it every day is a gift me i rip open the package and wolf it down on the spot he looked up at her in wonder his grip tightened as though she might be pulled from him as they sat right now if he didnt hold hard enough he leaned over reached across and picked off the fragile petal touched it to his lips he took a deep scared breath can you teach me how to do that her fantastic gold eyes widened why roic i think thats the most delicately worded proposition ive ever received s beautiful an uncertain pause um that was a proposition wasnt it im not always sure i parlay barrayaran desperately terrified now he blurted in what he imagined to be mercspeak maam yes maam this won an immense fanged smilenot in a version hed ever seen before it made him too want to fall over backward though preferably not into a snowbank he glanced around the softly lit room was littered with abandoned plates and wineglasses detritus of pleasure and good company low voices chatted idly in the next chamber somewhere in another room softened by the distance a clock was chiming the hour roic declined to count the beats they floated in a bubble of fleeting time live heat in the heart of a bitter winter he leaned forward raised his face slid his hand around her warm neck drew her face down to his it wasnt hard their lips brushed locked several minutes later in a shaken hushed voice he breathed wow several minutes after that they went upstairs hand in hand the alchemical marriage by mary jo putney the tower of london july though the chambers were spacious and furnished as befitted a prisoner of rank the cold stone walls were saturated with pain and death sir adam macrae paced his prison shackles rattling wondering if he would be granted the formality of a trial before he was executed or would he be kept here forever quietly rotting as his spirit and body withered away the heavy door squealed open he turned warily knowing it was not time for food to be delivered his expression hardened at the entrance of two men in dark cowled cloaks so the virgin queen and her counselors had chosen to silence him by assassination rather than risk beheading a prominent scot well by god hed not be taken down without a fight he gripped the length of chain that connected his manacles though the damnable iron curbed his power the heavy links would make a fair weapon the taller of the men pushed back his hood revealing a long white beard and piercing eyes it was john dee the queens own sorcerer macrae caught his breath dee had true power as well as influence with the queen but he would not be sent here to perform a simple assassination i thought you were living on the continent master dee tis said that you might end your days in bohemia where your work is so much valued dee gave a dry little smile officially i am in bohemia still but my queen has need of me for a great crisis looms england is threatened splendid macrae applauded the manacles jangling i pray strength to her enemies dont be so swift to invoke destruction there are worse fates than elizabeth no matter how little you like her she murdered the queen of scots macrae said flatly she deserves everything i said and more no one regretted mary stuarts death more than elizabeth she stayed her hand for years decades despite all the evidence that your queen was involved in treasonous plots the necessity of executing her own cousin and fellow sovereign drove elizabeth halfmad with grief nonetheless murder her cousin she did couldnt you have waited until you returned to scotland before cursing elizabeths name and predicting that the wrath of god would strike her she had no choice but to imprison you the old sorcerer shook his head dourly you supported mary at the risk of your own life even though she was catholic and you a protestant though your loyalty is commendable one must wonder about your sense as a stubborn scot sense had never been macraes strong point what is a man without loyalty she was my queen and elizabeth had no right to execute her did you come here to taunt me for my foolish tongue no sir adam dees gaze was steady ive come to ask if you would like to earn your freedom freedom a vision of glen rath washed over macrae the most beautiful place on gods green earth with wild clear air where a man could breathe he clamped down on his longing knowing it would weaken him of course i want to be free but its possible for freedom to come at too high a price tis said you are the finest weather mage in britain sir adam the shrewd eyes glinted i want you to conjure me a tempest so dee knew of his powers that would explain why macraes jailers had known to keep him bound with the iron that curbed his magic he had wondered about that since rarely were prisoners of rank manacled the fact that the queens soldiers had burst into his lodgings at night and slapped irons on him before he could fight back had made him wonder if he had been betrayed by another guardian but apparently not the formidable dee had his own ways of learning perhaps i could but why should i to save britain from a great evil dee moved stiffly to one of the chairs shadowed by his attendant do you mind if i sit sir adam my old bones ache from the journey across europe reminded of his duties as host macrae took wine from a wellstocked cabinet and filled three goblets dee accepted readily but his companion hesitated before taking a goblet and withdrawing to the darkest corner of the room he moved with the suppleness of youth an apprentice sorcerer or a body servant whichever he had dees trust macrae must hope the boy also had discretion macrae took the chair opposite dee stretching his long legs out before him a portrait of ease despite his chains you say you want a tempest spain and england have been at each others throats since the death of mary tudor now spain is gathering an armada the greatest fleet ever seen more than one hundred thirty ships and thirty thousand men far more than england can muster dee stared into his wine i want you to call up a storm that will destroy the spanish ships and save england from invasion macrae gasped have you any idea what youre asking the greatest weather mage who ever lived could not conjure such a storm particularly not at this season magic must build on what exists in nature and the light airs of summer offer little of the power i would need to spin a small storm into a great one i know it will not be easy but if any man can it is you macrae let the metal links slide between his fingers the weight of the chain crushing his mind after more than a year of cold iron i dont know if i still have power even if i do ill fry in hell before using it on elizabeths behalf this is not about elizabeth but about britain that means scotland as well as england do you really want the harsh hand of spain to fall over this island macrae shrugged they may plunder london but i doubt theyll touch my people in the wilds of scotland let them come it matters not to me whether english elizabeth or spanish philip rules here not even if refusing my offer costs your life his mouth twisted ive lived in daily expectation of my death for fifteen long months master dee how is this day any different with a muffled oath dees hooded companion swirled from the shadowed corner if you think a spanish invasion doesnt matter you are as ignorant as you are foolish macrae put aside your prejudices and think the whiskeyrich voice was female sweeping back her hood the woman revealed blazing black eyes in a narrow byzantine face of fearsome intelligence in her late twenties she was not pretty instead she was beautiful in the manner of a glittering deadly sword sir adam meet my associate isabel de cortes dee said dryly if you need persuasion or assistance she can provide it macrae studied the woman even his ironcrippled inner vision could see that she burned with a mages power now that she was no longer masking her abilities isabel de cortes he said musingly a spanish name and a spanish face do you hate your own country so much mistress spain birthed my ancestors but it is not my country england has my loyalty isabels dark eyes narrowed you think a spanish invasion will not affect scotland but you are wrong when mary tudor reigned philip of spain was her husband and the burning flesh of protestant martyrs fouled the air of smithfield that was nothing compared to what will happen if the inquisition comes to britain that will never happen you think not your queen of scots bequeathed philip her claims to the english throne and his soldiers are coming to seize that bequest by fire and steel even your northern wilderness will not be distant enough to protect you you do not know scotland or the scots she made a sound that reminded him of a wildcat as a mage you must have some scrying ability take a long true look into this and then tell me it doesnt matter if the spanish come delving into a pocket of her robe she brought out a disk of polished obsidian perhaps four inches in diameter he refused to take the scrying glass you forget that iron chains bind me the touch of iron curbs all your powers even the smallest isabel looked shocked worse pitying most mages are not so sensitive i am his voice was flat for fifteen endless months his inner senses had been blind and deaf and dumb leaving aching emptiness that might never be filled again master dee you have the key to the shackles isabel said give it to me so i can free macrae dee produced the key sir adam must swear not to use his power to harm if you know anything of the guardians you must know that we are pledged to protect not destroy to be free of the chains macrae eyed the key longingly the conjuror was old and it would be easy to take the key from him no he had not yet fallen so far as to attack an old man deciding that macrae had tacitly agreed to dees condition isabel collected the key and came to unlock the shackles heart pounding with impatience he held out his wrists trying to keep his hands from trembling she bent her head over the chains as she wrestled with the crude locks which had not been opened in more than a year her fingertips brushed his wrists searing the chaffed tender flesh with her mages energy one hand released he had to exert all his control to hold steady while she twisted the key in the other lock her hair had the dark glossiness of a ravens wing the lock opened and the shackles fell across his lap he lifted the murderous chain that had imprisoned his mind even more thoroughly than his body then hurled it into the cold fireplace with crashing rage as he rubbed his wrists he was painfully aware that his numbed mind felt no different had fifteen months of paralysis hammered his power to uselessness he stalked to his single barred window and stared out at the sky through his long captivity he had envied the gulls that soared over the thames if he were a shapeshifter he would have transformed himself and flown home to scotland but he had no such power so he had remained earthbound deprived of his deepest self invoking the discipline of his training he visualized light pouring through his body burning away poisons of fear and frustration deep within stirred a small flex of power like a firefly sparking in the night torn between wanting to seize and wanting to savor he nurtured that spark delicately reviving what had been frozen so long like the spring ice break in a highland burn power surged through him giddy with the rush of magic he threw the rage of his captivity into a cloud drifting across the sun swiftly it grew and darkened until a storm struck the tower of london with a fury that rattled the rooftops slanting rain swept between the bars cold and refreshing he laughed aloud at the heady joy of once again shaping the wind a good use of anger isabel remarked now you must learn to hate the spanish fleet macrae had halfforgotten his visitors who had been waiting in silence releasing the cloud he turned back to the room the rain began to diminish in five minutes the squall would be gone look now once more isabel offered her scrying glass she had removed her cloak revealing a strong sensual body he had not been in the same room with a woman since his imprisonment and he found himself shamefully aware of her femaleness her scent sparked thoughts of starlight and desert spices he accepted the glass with reluctance a gifted scryer could see in any reflective surface water wine glass a gemstone but this smoky obsidian pulsed with its owners energy as if it were a living creature during his captivity he had been darkly glad the iron had blocked his vision for surely scrying would show his doom but even though he feared it would reveal more than he wanted to see the time had come to look beyond his cell he closed his eyes clearing his mind as he formulated a question what might a spanish invasion bring then he gazed through the glass with unfocused eyes so images might appear dunrath was burning his fingers spasmed around the disk dear god his mother was leaping from the tower window choosing a swift death to the slow horror of burning alive why would spaniards attack his home the answer formed in his mind as easily as the image had formed in the obsidian because his younger brother was another stubborn macrae who would refuse to foreswear his faith or bend his knee to foreigners dunrath would be razed as a lesson to other clans macrae had accepted the imminence of his own death but he had believed his home was safe his brother would become laird the girl macrae was to wed would find another husband and his family would continue in health and prosperity but this could isabel de cortes have planted false images in the glass he rejected the idea instantly true as the blade she resembled she would not spin lies to make her case even if such a thing were possible temples throbbing he looked at the scrying glass again hoping to see some mitigation of the horror of his first vision sweet jesus no the image that formed was of edinburgh castle looming majestically over the city a city that looked as if the wrath of god had struck no not god but men of hatred who would force others into their own mold and destroy when they could not persuade smoke began pouring from the castle itself the pride and history of scotland were being put to the torch while spanish soldiers ran wild raping and pillaging he didnt need dee or isabel de cortes to tell him that scrying was not truth but rather possibility grimly he forced himself to watch as other horrors shimmered before his eyes a group of martyrs singing to god as flames consumed them the virgin queen on the scaffold going to her death with steely courage armed soldiers breaking in on protestants who worshipped in secret the flash of blades contrasting with gouts of crimson blood how long macrae watched the glass he did not know but when he looked up his body was chilled and the room was darkening isabel rose to light candles against the approaching night it is not a good future she said quietly no though he disliked the idea of working with these sassenach he could not stand by while wolves prepared to ravage britain ill do what i can to thwart the armada but i warn you that conjuring such a tempest may be beyond my abilities his lips thinned as he returned the scrying glass it will be bitter to harm so many men when i am oathsworn to protect i have no more desire to take life than you sir adam dee looked old and very tired the intent is to disperse the ships destroy their fighting effectiveness not to kill a storm in the narrow seas would drive the ships onto the flemish coast and god willing most of the sailors and soldiers will survive it was a lawyers quibble even if the intent wasnt to kill a tempest powerful enough to scatter so many ships would surely cause the weakest to founder men would die macrae could not delude himself otherwise but if he saw true action on his part might save many more lives than it endangered power was a chancy dangerous gift guardians were trained in ethics and morality from childhood but no teacher could anticipate all possibilities when a situation was critical the guardian involved must decide what would be best and may god send wisdom to choose the right i shall do what i can but i will need help whatever you wish sir adam dee said what are your requirements first get me released from this poxy prison i want a letter signed by elizabeth herself saying that all charges against me have been dropped and i am a free man explain to her that on my oath i will do my best but i cannot guarantee that i will be able to conjure a storm great enough to destroy the armada dee nodded understood i am authorized to grant that what else macrae rubbed his throbbing head trying to imagine what he would need for an undertaking of this magnitude i must have a location within sight of the channel preferably in a place of power isabel said my family has a small manor in kent that fits that requirement what else i havent enough power to create such a tempest alone so i will need your assistance in the working master dee if i can draw on your magic there is a chance i may succeed the old man exchanged a glance with the woman isabel will be your assistant macraes gaze swung to her with dismay he was to work with this dangerously alluring wildcat with her obsidian eyes keeping his voice level he said i prefer to work with you our energies will blend better the old man shook his head i am a noteworthy scholar an astrologer and a student of ancient wisdom but my magical power is only moderate isabel is the best scryer and most powerful mage ive ever met except for you perhaps she can contribute far more than i macrae wanted to protest but couldnt his inner senses told him that dee spoke the truth for a great magical working isabel de cortes would be a far better partner more powerful and more dangerous he closed his eyes with weariness and once more saw dunrath burn kent august it was midafternoon when the dusty party of travelers arrived at leighton manor the sea wasnt visible but the scent of it was borne on the wind as soon as the half dozen horses pulled up by the leighton stables the scotsman vaulted from his mount tossed his reins to one of the servants who accompanied them and strode off toward the shoreline as his long legs carried him swiftly away isabel dismounted and crossed to master dee do you think hell try to escape the old man came off his horse with a groan of fatigue no hes given his word and guardians never break their word they believe it compromises their powers i would like to know more of the guardians dee gestured in the direction macrae had vanished theres the man who can tell you he could but he wont she said dryly macrae has done his best to avoid talking or looking at me ever since we started this journey he is not comfortable knowing how closely he must work with you sharing power is a very intimate process and you are a stranger and like to remain so go after him perhaps i shall after you are properly settled she beckoned to the housekeeper mstress heath who had emerged from the house to greet the guests dee smiled a little dont worry about your hostess duties the servants will see to my comfort it is more important that you weave a bond with our weather mage isabel let herself be persuaded because she wanted to follow macrae the man intrigued her he moved like a panther barely tamed and though he might dislike her he was a mage himself so didnt fear her as most men did she could learn much from him lifting her skirts clear of the tangled wildflowers she left the cluster of buildings and followed the lane macrae had taken the manor house was set in a fold of hills to shelter it from the scouring winds but the sea was only a short walk away she located her quarry in the ancient stone circle set on a bluff that rose a hundred feet above the crashing waves local legend said the circle had been built by druids for those with the vision to see three faintly glowing ley lines crossed at the site creating a starburst of earth energy as isabel had promised it was a place of great power sunlight glowing on his dark red hair the scotsman walked the circle touching each of the irregularly shaped stones in turn it didnt take you long to find me mistress de cortes i knew the circle would draw you it burns with power she had spent endless hours in this place meditating studying experimenting to find the shape and limits of her talent though it was disturbing to see her sanctuary invaded by such restless male energy the circle was the logical place to hold the ritual she could cleanse it of his presence when their work was done you said your family owns this manor while his tone was brusque at least he was speaking to her yes but im the only one who comes here leighton was her home far more than the grand london house where her parents and brothers resided here she could be her prickly stubborn self what does it mean to be a guardian is it a secret society he hesitated then shrugged as if deciding that her abilities gave her a right to know we are not so organized merely a collection of families in which power runs strongly we know one another and often intermarry but usually we go our separate ways our homes are in the fringes of britain where the ancient magic is strongest scotland wales cornwall the isle of man ireland you will find us in all those places we are sworn not only to protect but to keep our powers hidden for safetys sake are you all weather mages power comes in many forms and weather mastery is rare he smiled wryly specific abilities dont manifest until a child approaches maturity my first sign of weather work was blowing the roof off a cowshed my father was not pleased she hadnt seen him smile before and was surprised at how attractive his craggy bearded face was when he wasnt scowling how long have the guardians existed no one really knows certainly since before the romans came to britain in ancient times the great mages engaged in a struggle for power that nearly destroyed us all the survivors met in council and agreed that we must use our abilities for peace and protection he gazed out to sea his expression haunted we do our best but the struggle is unending so the name guardian was literal how strange and beautiful that these people of power pledged themselves to serve and protect what would it be like to come from such a family you must all be saints if you can agree on what is best i didnt say we always agreed but we try to do the right thing we dont always succeed he bent to pick a wildflower i wish my mother was here so i could discuss this undertaking with her she has the clearest mind of any mage i know women are accepted as equals in your councils she said startled of course some of the most powerful mages in britain are female what a wonder your family is not like that a few of my de cortes ancestors had minor gifts but there has never been one like me her parents despaired of her they had wanted a pleasant submissive daughter who would marry within their circle instead they had birthed a child too strange too independent for normal life when i began showing signs of unusual power my father engaged master dee to be my teacher so i would learn to control my abilities he has been my salvation i never once heard of your guardians master dee has suffered because of his public reputation as a conjuror and astrologer the abuse heaped on him illustrates why we prefer to stay in the background he raised his head and gazed out to sea as if scenting the wind the fleets are skirmishing near the dutch shore men are dying just out of sight and sound the reminder of their mission destroyed her pleasure in the perfect summer day you can see that without scrying i hear their cries on the wind she pulled out her scrying glass which was always with her in the smoky depths she watched the vicious recoil of cannon as two ships blasted silently away at each other sending smoke and flames billowing it was a scene from hell the english squadron is wellcommanded and seaworthy but vastly outnumbered the danger is great we must act quickly no doubt you are right yet it is hard to undertake a working that will cost so many lives if i am successful her lips thinned you do not seem wholly committed to our cause macrae has your detestation for the english blinded you to the probability that the spanish will murder your own mother his head whipped around his eyes sparking dangerously how do you know what i saw in your glass as your gift is weather mine is clearseeing after you looked into your future i was able to see the images you had invoked she shook her head passion fuels power you need more anger macrae this is not a game but a life and death struggle what will make you truly wish to destroy our enemies if i have too little anger you have too much mistress your loathing of the spanish is like a burning brand surely master dee taught you that hatred is dangerous for those with power you run the risk of destroying not only your enemies but yourself in this case you are hating those of your own blood these spaniards are not my blood her anger flared not only at the spanish but at macrae for reading her so easily it has been almost a hundred years since my people left spain we were tortured murdered robbed and exiled forever from the land that we had served loyally they called us marranos swine i care nothing for what happens to me as long as we prevent those spanish beasts from invading england he studied her face his hazel eyes golden in the afternoon sun so you are a jew i have heard that a few jewish families took refuge in england after they were expelled from spain and portugal did your family forswear the catholicism they were forced to embrace and return to the faith of their fathers we are good protestants now but our memories are long and if some jewish practices lingered still in the privacy of their homes well that was no one elses business they did what was necessary to survive and to keep the covenant in their hearts you accuse me of hating yet you hate elizabeth why she is a just and fairminded ruler her wisdom in balancing catholics and protestants has kept englishmen from spilling one anothers blood why do you despise her she executed my queen for that i cannot forgive her mary stuart a scot raised at the french court who spun plots from her prison and sought to have elizabeth assassinated isabel snapped even a scotsman as loyal as you cannot deny marys treachery his jaw tightened stubborn man knowing they would never agree about politics she said master dee tells me you have given your word to conjure a tempest so let us begin there is no time to waste she started to turn back to the house he caught her wrist they both froze as energy surged between them she felt as if all her breath had been blasted from her body so this was passion uncomfortable inappropriate undeniable he felt the same she could see it in his eyes he released her wrist his breath roughened the preparations are complex and dee must cast a chart for the best time to proceed if we dont harness every available wisp of power there will be no chance of success she retreated a step not wanting to meet his gaze very well do what you must but be quick about it before its too late as you wish mistress witch he said with heavy irony perhaps i can conjure a swift squall to end the fighting for the moment so the english will be able to regroup if you can do that why havent you she asked with exasperation because i fear the cost to my soul but youre right i cannot hold back any longer no matter how much i dislike this task he turned and rested his hands on the largest stone the one closest to the sea as he concentrated his energies on the task he became absolutely still except for the movement of his lips chanting soundlessly keeping her distance from the vortex of power swirling around him isabel used her glass to monitor the battle skies darkened vicious rain swept through the warring fleets and the fighting broke up the spanish fell back and one of their damaged warships foundered and sank while isabel whispered a soft prayer of thanks macrae expelled a long rattling breath and released his spell his face was gaunt drained of its usual vitality knowing how demanding weather work was she silently asked the obsidian what would become of macrae the battle images dissolved into swirling fog what about her fate she cleared her mind and tried to draw her own image from the glass still nothing she felt chilled even though the inability to scry could mean many things most likely she couldnt see because she was too closely involved in what was about to happen to have the necessary clarity but it was also possible that the demands of stopping the armada would be so great that neither of them would survive concealing her foreboding isabel said well done you succeeded in ending the battle before the english fleet could be badly damaged i begin to believe you can produce the great storm we need his eyes opened and he turned to lean against the stone folding his arms across his chest i was fortunate there was the beginning of a summer squall near the ships so all i had to do was strengthen it the spell required for that was to a great tempest as a barn cat is to a tiger his mouth twisted surely you know that magic always has a price and the one i pay will be high are you also willing to pay the cost of this conjuring she thought of the clouded obsidian i am willing even if the price demanded all that she had calling the winds the air tingled with power as macrae and mistress de cortes took their places in the ancient stone circle man and woman ever opposite but complementary dee was not present since he would be unable to help and he feared his presence would be a distraction the old man had cast a chart for the best time but his face had been somber when he studied the planetary positions it hadnt been necessary for him to say that the chart did not guarantee success but it was the best time available without waiting for days so macrae must make of it what he could despite his initial reluctance to undertake this task the images of dunrath and edinburgh haunted him now he was as determined as the woman who faced him across the circle he inclined his head to his companion mistress let us begin as you will macrae her demeanor was reserved though nothing could diminish the snap of her black eyes or the allure of her lush female figure he began by casting a circle of protection using the familiar ritual to focus his mind as his concentration increased his inner vision recognized the essences around him isabel de cortes was the most vivid deep and intense she was a beacon of power he reached out and touched her energy silently she acknowledged his presence and granted him access another time he would have been tempted to explore the riches of her mind and spirit at least until she clamped down her shields and expelled him but now he had more important work widening his perception he felt dees energy in the manor house the old mans pattern was a structure of immense complexity with a blazing mind at the core the servants were sparks of light each unique if one chose to study it closely he did not so choose not tonight he tuned himself to the earth and the ancient force that resided there isabel was right this was a place of great magic when he was fully oriented he flung his consciousness high into the sky soaring toward the sun like a giant hawk the circle the two human figures the coast and the rolling seas all dropped away below at a dizzying speed with isabels power to fuel his flight he soared higher and higher until his awareness stretched east across the channel north to scotland south to france west as far as ireland the day before isabel had scryed the english sending fire ships into the armada little damage was done but only because the spanish ships had cut their anchors to escape swiftly though doing so had saved them from burning without good anchors the ships were vulnerable when close to shore yes that was the answer the armada was now boxed between the harrying english and the sandbanks off the dutch province of zeeland if he could force the ships onto the shoals many would break up but the shallow waters and nearby mainland would minimize the cost in lives he would find no better location to fulfill his mission he cast the net of his mind outward to gather the winds and discovered why dees chart had been equivocal about this time throughout the british isles and the narrow seas the airs were light giving him little to work with but there was always weather even when times were mild he narrowed his vision to identify wind patterns strong enough to shape to his purpose over holland he found a choppy gusting breeze he gathered it in and added a series of light winds from scotland and northern england then he captured an energetic sea breeze from the coast of cornwall on the edge of his awareness he sensed a storm over bavaria but it was too distant for summoning each of the elements had its own essence qualities that made him think of rainbows and musical notes though in his mind there was neither sound nor color meticulously he wove the winds together into a single powerful chord then he shaped them into a northwest wind that hammered inexorably against the ships of the armada as he drove the ships eastward he sensed sailors frantically trying to beat against the wind while priests knelt to invoke gods help in avoiding the waiting shoals the water beneath the hulls changed color and the waves turned choppy as the seas became shallower and shallower he dimly recognized pounding pain in his temples and trembling in his limbs the first ships were minutes from striking but could he maintain his control over the increasingly rebellious winds he had assembled he reached for isabel again maddeningly he could channel only a small part of her power but surely he was strong enough to finish the job he had begun the cornish gust the strongest and most rebellious element of his coalition cracked its way loose weakening the whole savagely he worked to force it back into his pattern he almost succeeded then the scottish winds notoriously chancy broke away his painstakingly constructed northwest wind disintegrated like splintered glass desperately he reached again for isabel but he couldnt find the key to unlock the deepest reservoirs of her power it stayed tantalizingly beyond his grasp gasping for breath he tried again to exert his mastery over the winds bucking against his grasp as he stretched his mind to keep them in line his power thinned to the snapping point only a few moments more only a few clashing like silent thunder the spell shattered with a violence that pulsed through his skull he cried out in agony and fell to his knees the last thing he saw before falling into blackness was spanish ships turning sharply to port as they sought the safety of deeper water macraes collapse slashed isabels mind as viciously as a sword lacerated flesh after an instant of paralysis she reached out mentally to steady his convulsing spirit even as she raced across the circle to his sprawling body she dropped on her knees beside him his face was corpsewhite and he wasnt breathing moved by sheer instinct she inhaled deeply and bent over to share her breath with him placing her mouth on his she forced air into his lungs he was a master of wind and air surely all he needed was more breath once twice thrice she was growing dizzy with exertion when he coughed and twisted under her hands finally he was drawing great ragged breaths on his own god be thanked dee joined her panting i felt the spell go awry how is he breathing now beyond that she shrugged helplessly dee frowned as he rested his hand on macraes forehead hes burning with fever pray god he has not destroyed himself with his exertions getting to his feet with effort the old man signaled to the pair of male servants who had followed him from the house carefully the servants lifted macrae onto the battered pine door they had brought struggling with the scotsmans deadweight then they set off toward the house isabel started to follow but dee stayed her with a gesture when the servants were out of earshot he asked quietly what happened child why didnt you save him from such a disaster i tried tried desperately and had been seared by the backlash when his power and concentration failed he tried also but we could not fully connect our energies are too unlike too clashing that clashing can be a source of strength not conflict she rubbed her temples too drained to understand what do you mean think of your astrological studies opposite signs are both natural enemies and natural complements men and women are opposites and sometimes conflict between them is attraction that will not admit itself yet if opposites find balance in each other they can create a whole greater than the sum of their individual powers she thought back to dees lessons when he had poured rivers of information into her eager mind is this the alchemical marriage you once spoke of the alchemical marriage is a philosophical principle and it can be seen on many levels one is male and female he eyed her speculatively then shook his head the point is moot macrae may be out of his senses for days or worse do you know what has happened with the armada she had been too upset to even wonder wearily she drew out her scrying glass and conjured the scene the spanish ships are escaping the zeeland shoals and heading north the english pursue but they are still outnumbered once the spaniards regroup they will be able to resume their plans for invasion dees face tightened adding ten years to his age i must go to london and report to the queen perhaps macrae will recover and try again she suggested without much hope he will be lucky to escape with his life and his sanity dee said bluntly even if he survives todays work may have destroyed his magic forever having felt the cataclysmic collapse of macraes power she knew that dee spoke no less than the truth i will stay here and care for him my housekeeper is experienced at nursing god willing we will save at least his life he may not thank you for it if he survives deprived of his deepest self dee raised his gaze to the restless sea where spanish ships were sailing north around britain i once had great power not so much as you but enough to make me a true sorcerer in my arrogance and lust for knowledge i pushed my abilities too far and nearly died of it since then i have had to content myself with small magics and scholarship the naked longing in his face made isabel look away uneasily what would it be like to lose her power though her abilities made a normal womans life impossible for her the exercise of magic was also the purest delight and satisfaction she had ever known to be deprived of it would be like losing her limbs macrae had been bound in iron for more than a year now after only a few days restored to his full self he had risked his life and his power to stave off the spaniards though she had scarcely noticed at the time she had a sharp flash of memory of how his lips had felt under hers when she had breathed for him embarrassed she said if the body is saved perhaps the spirit will also heal we will do what we can the world needed adam macrae and she needed to know that somewhere he would be living under the same sun as she he had been lost for so long among the cinders of his mind that at first he didnt recognize returning awareness all he knew was cool darkness a soft night breeze redolent of country flowers a gentle hand on his forehead a womans hand he forced his eyes open he was in his bedroom at leighton manor the canopy above him barely visible in the dim light isabel de cortes was perched on a stool beside him her eyes narrow with concern so i did not die he said in a rasping voice not for lack of trying despite her acerbic words she gave him a smile that softened the austere beauty of her narrow face he closed his eyes again how long has it been since i conjured the winds eight days master dee has returned to london to confer with the queen seeing her expression brought back the last disastrous memories that preceded his collapse he exhaled roughly i failed perhaps not her gaze slid away your efforts have given more time to improve the coastal defenses surely that will help if when the spanish invade absurd britains coastline was far too long for defenses to be adequate everywhere and they both knew it as his vision cleared he realized that she looked different tonight defeated unbowed but preparing for the worst give me your scrying glass she looked doubtful guessing she thought him too weak he repeated give it to me i must know she reluctantly produced the obsidian disk and laid it on his right palm he was so weak he could barely raise the glass high enough to see the surface and he couldnt sense the glow of her energy as he had before as the surface remained blank he recognized that the center of his spirit was numb devoid of power sweating he closed his eyes and tried to shape the slight breeze that fitfully stirred the curtains it pulsed then faded had he done that or was the movement only the normal volatility of the night airs he tried again this time he was almost sure that he had briefly strengthened the wind his power was only strained not dead he refused to believe otherwise opening his eyes he tried the scrying glass again what might the spanish bring this time he saw a flickering image of edinburgh castle burning may god help scotland for the spaniards would come with torch and steel grimly he tried to conjure a vision of dunrath but the glass would show him no more trembling he let his head fall back against the pillows i wont tell you not to overexert yourself for it would be a waste of breath mistress de cortes said dryly but you might consider the fact that you have been out of your head with fever for days it is normal to be weak as a newborn kitten i have no time for weakness we must act before it is too late he struggled for more breath you think it still possible to change the course of events aye not easy but possible throwing back the covers he swung his legs over the side of the bed he was garbed in a coarse nightgown borrowed from a servant perhaps he leaned forward to stand and his knees buckled beneath him she swiftly moved forward and caught him around the waist for an instant they were pressed together as she struggled to prevent his sagging body from falling to the floor her breasts were soft and womanly against his chest desire blazed through him like storm lightning and with it came a shadow of renewed energy before he could gather his wits she managed to shift him back onto the edge of the bed youre a damned fool macrae she said a little breathlessly content yourself with talking for tonight she expertly lifted his legs onto the bed which pushed him back against the pillows his brief energy faded again but not his memory of it angels above she was enticing an embrace with her would make a stone saint dance we must learn to work together on all levels isabel you must be able to use my gifts as a weather mage and i must be able to draw fully on your strength it was the first time he had used her christian name when speaking to her acknowledging the intimacy she said does that mean i should call you adam he smiled a little i like the way you growl macrae im gifted at growling how are we to accomplish such closeness if she had been raised a guardian she would know such things groping for the right words he said to share energy fully there must be absolute trust and a willingness to reveal oneself with naked honesty flaws as well as virtues earlier time was short and neither of us wished to drop all our defenses so we did not delve so deeply if we had his mouth twistedperhaps i could have maintained the wind long enough to force the spanish fleet onto the zeeland shoals i was so close the silence was long and painful before she said i have never done what you are describing is it even possible we have little in common we are both disciplined and know how to wield power he caught her gaze and we will both pay any price to stop the spanish that should be enough she bit her lip the prospect of completely lowering my shields is troubling but it seems we have no choice but to try this will be hard for you since you have had little contact with other mages he admitted even among guardians complete openness is rare most often it was seen between husband and wife but sometimes between mages who worked together closely master dee spoke of the alchemical marriage the mating of opposites to create strength and harmony she said is that what you are speaking of i am no alchemist but yes that is the sort of closeness we must forge usually it takes a long time to develop but we dont have time so we must do the best we can let me try this and tell me if you experience anything she closed her eyes and for the space of a hundred heartbeats there was silence she gave a quick frustrated shake of her head then laid her hand on his immediately he felt a featherlight stroke of her energy it gently flowed through him sliding behind his weakened defenses and soothing scorched places in his spirit he had felt nothing comparable since his training with his grandfather when he was a boy but his grandfather was stern and male while isabel was profoundly female an object of desire whose touch sparked reactions that fizzed through his body he moved involuntarily for the effect was as alarming as it was exciting masking his reaction he said you reached very deeply it is a good beginning she sighed so little time feeling stronger than when he first woke he asked are you a healer only in a small way she rested her palm on his forehead again sleep macrae tomorrow we will begin our second campaign he slipped into deep slumber dimly aware that she had begun to heal the source of his power since macraes fever had broken and his wits were well on the way to mending isabel left him alone to sleep he needed the rest and so did she nonetheless her night was troubled macrae was disturbing at the best of times like a barely leashed lion to allow him access to the darkest secrets of her soul she shuddered at the thought the prospect of knowing his darkest secrets was even worse raised by protective baffled parents her life had been a sheltered one despite her studies with dees guidance she had learned the disciplines of power and her scrying ability had given her rare access to the workings of her society but that knowledge was of the mind macrae was of the earth intensely physical and experienced in matters beyond her imagination the depths of his mind would not be safe she should think of their joint endeavor as an opportunity to broaden her knowledge and understanding certainly the work was vital for the armada was a sword poised over britain nonetheless she felt like a mouse about to be seized by a hawk reminding herself that she was a mouse armed with powerful fangs she rolled over and forced herself to relax one muscle at a time she must hope that a hawk and a fanged mouse could between them stop the spanish she was rising after a night of restless dreams when her housekeeper entered the bedroom in a rush sir adam is gone isabel muttered an oath under her breath i think i know where he might be dont worry his fever broke last night and hes as sensible now as hes capable of pack food in a basket while i dress reassured mistress heath left to do her mistresss bidding after donning a plain country gown of creamcolored linen and dressing her hair in a simple knot isabel collected the basket and walked down to the stone circle at a leisurely pace as she expected macrae was there sitting on a stone as he looked out to sea his beard needed trimming he looked more pirate than gentleman her relaxation vanished when she saw his despair what has happened there is even less time than i thought she settled on the stone beside his tell me if events are not changed the spanish will sail into the firth of forth to provision and regroup and end by razing edinburgh isabel frowned wishing she had spent more time scrying edinburgh surely scots and spaniards are allies both hate the english enough the intent will not be war but tempers will clash the spanish commander medina will infuriate my countrymen and soldiers will become drunk and riot the city will be left a ruin of blood and bones and ashes she shuddered at the images he conjured in her mind when will this happen in two days the first spanish ships will moor at leith no more than two days more before trouble breaks out less than four days for them to change the course of a great armada i did not know you had such skill in seeing the future usually i dont but scotland is bound to my blood he drew a rough breath im glad i seldom see the future its a terrible gift my attempt to drive the armada onto the zeeland shoals might have increased the danger for my countrymen dont think about that they could not afford for him to become weakened by guilt you already had fears for edinburgh perhaps what you foresee now will be less terrible than what might have happened we cannot be sure his mouth twisted how arrogant we mages are to think we can make the world better by wielding our powers perhaps britain would be better off without guardians it is human nature to seek and use power at least you guardians do your best to serve the greater good she drew her knees up and looped her arms around them as she had in childhood her gaze unfocused as she watched the waves roll into chalk cliffs i envy you for being raised with others of your kind it would be difficult to be as alone as you isabel yet it has made you strong she felt him in her mind closer than was comfortable she wanted to slam the doors and hurl him out instead she forced herself to accept his demanding male presence proud that she could say calmly though the hours are few there is time enough to eat and youll be stronger for it she investigated the basket fresh bread and cheese and ale all made on her estate pulling out her knife she sliced the bread and cheese then poured ale into the pewter tankards his expression eased as he accepted the food youre a practical woman that is no bad thing someone has to be practical and usually it will be a woman she said tartly macraes amusement reverberated within her mind a surprisingly pleasant effect as they ate she cautiously experimented with this unwonted closeness she could not read his thoughts and for that she was grateful but she could sense his emotions with increasing accuracy as they spoke his mind shadowed his words with extra richness she also could enjoy his ravenous hunger his startlingly sensual enjoyment of the simple food was so intense that it distracted her from her own meal as he swallowed the last of his ale he said sunshine a fresh breeze and plain country food when i was in the tower i never thought i would know such simple pleasures again a pity that my freedom was granted for such a dire reason she stopped herself from saying that he might as well enjoy while he could only to have him say youre thinking i might as well take pleasure while i can since my next attempt at weather working might send me to an early grave she flushed and glanced away can you read my thoughts only your emotions but they are clear enough he set his empty tankard in the basket now it is time for work do you see that dark cloud in the middle distance she shaded her eyes against the bright sky yes we are going to make it rain he laid his large hand over hers the thought intrigues and alarms you well enough you will enjoy this i think and she did though his mental powers had not fully recovered from his collapse his instinctive understanding of wind and cloud was glorious if he was a hawk she was now his companion swooping through the air feeling the cool damp of the cloud then disintegrating into a swift shower of raindrops she laughed aloud when he drew her back to normal awareness delighting in the new sensations wonderful i felt this much more clearly than when we worked together before catching a sense of his sadness she said more soberly but its a very small achievement compared to what will be needed though his face was controlled she sensed that he was trying to shield her from his doubts it is much more than i could have done on my own he said we are blending our energies well so far her pleasure in what they had accomplished faded in the knowledge of how much further they had to go and that they had only another day to prepare they spent the rest of the long day delving into ever deeper levels of intimacy and sharing the power of isabels mind and spirit amazed macrae her commitment was also profound but the deeper he probed the more she resisted the last exercise of the day took him for an instant to an area of her emotions he had not yet explored raw passion exploded like the devils own fire triggering his own passions and then she hurled him from her mind with numbing power gasping he bent and buried his throbbing head in her hands you have a kick that would do a stallion proud isabel he could feel her distress when she laid her palm on his brow im sorry ii could not control my reaction he closed his eyes welcoming her soothing touch i am trying to teach you in a day what a guardian learns over years you are progressing remarkably well but not well enough he wasnt sure if her soft words were thought or spoken aloud perhaps tomorrow we will find a good summer storm to work with he tried to project confidence that will do most of the work for us she didnt believe that any more than he did but she didnt argue the point the two were joined in fatalism they had no choice but to try another major spell in the morning this time at a much greater distance than the zeeland attempt and with no major storm available to build on isabel knew the dangers after all she had nursed him through nearlethal brain fever when his first attempt failed she had accepted the fact that they might die trying in fact she accepted it better than he when he fell into his bed exhausted he uttered a silent prayer may god grant them success for the sake of scotland and if a life must be forfeit in the process let it be his macrae jerked to wakefulness heart pounding as he picked up a distant note of changing weather clouds rain and wind were sweeping in from the atlantic how long had he been asleep only a few hours he guessed since there was no sign of dawn he lit a candle and scrambled into his clothing then made his way through the silent house to isabels room as he opened the door he said isabel rough weather is approaching quickly from the west not a major storm but enough to give us a better chance if we start work immediately he swept back the bed curtains his candle revealed isabel blinking sleepily as she pushed herself to a sitting position her dark hair fell over her shoulder in a thick braid and she looked younger and more vulnerable than her daytime self he froze as he realized that she was dressed only in her night rail and the lightweight fabric did little to disguise her softly curving body knees weakening he stepped back putting the heavy carved bedpost between them damn the successful effort to lower barriers between them for now it was impossible to conceal his desire isabel would justly see him as a great randy brute she flushed scarlet as she read his reaction emotions reverberated between them like images in opposing mirrors and the hair prickled on his arms at the sheer erotic tension in the room recovering first she yanked the blankets to her shoulders very well we shall begin i will meet you in the stone circle grateful for the excuse to retreat he ignited one of her candles with his then bolted he was a fool for allowing attraction to muddy the waters when all their attention must be fixed on their mutual goal he was bleakly aware that even with the changing weather the odds did not favor them though he was recovering well from his earlier collapse he was still far below his normal strength despite isabels enormous power she hadnt an inborn talent for weather working if he was unable to weave the spells well enough they would fail worse though they had lowered the barriers between them enough for embarrassment they were still woefully short of being fully capable of sharing energy if he needed more than isabel was ready to give she might lash out at him instinctively with disastrous results but try they must the armada was critically near edinburgh and if they didnt act right away it would be too late his mind still chasing itself he stopped in the kitchen for a quick meal of bread and cheese then picked his way down to the stone circle it was a night fit for witches the ley lines that intersected at the circle a glowing spiderweb of power the wind was rising in fitful gusts shaping and tearing clouds so that footing on the lane was uncertain the sea beyond the bluff was lighter than the land and he could hear the harsh beat of waves against the shore he felt a curious fatalism as he cleared his mind and began to lay the foundations of his spell he would do his best no man could do more if he did not survive this last great working may god defend scotland and those he loved silent as the wind isabel joined him almost invisible in a dark cloak she handed him a similar cloak wear this the night is chill and fair weather will not return soon he accepted the cloak but said mildly a sorcerer should be able to rise above heat and cold why waste energy suppressing discomfort when it can be used on your weather working he smiled into the darkness a practical sorceress the contours of her face were barely discernible he had thought her austerely beautiful from their first meeting and the intimate knowledge he had gained during their work together had multiplied her beauty a thousandfold are you ready as ready as i can be knowing he might not survive the nights work he made a formal courtiers bow to her the cloak flaring around him it has been a pleasure working with you isabel de cortes then he buried personal thoughts grounded himself in the circles earth energy and reached for the winds as his awareness spiraled upward he saw that the north atlantic was blanketed with a vast patchwork of choppy clouds and gusty rain the spanish ships were strewn along the narrow seas the leading wave already approaching the firth of forth the gateway to edinburgh he started by sharpening the winds across scotland making it difficult for the armada to sail up the estuary but that was only a temporary measure to delay them while he constructed a tempest piece by meticulous piece he began to weave vicious winds drowning rain and lightning that could rip the sky and blaze through rigging it must be so powerful so wellwrought that it would continue onward even after his own strength failed the storm must rage for days sinking ships driving others onto rocky shores and into the grip of deadly north sea currents the armada must be destroyed to the point where it offered no threat and may heaven have mercy on the souls of the sailors already he was drawing heavily on isabels deep reserves of power her bright awareness followed him as he spun the winds into a pattern that fed on itself she helped him concentrate the rain from many thousands of square miles into a smaller more lethal storm and she soared with him when he forged the lightning a dark sullen dawn was breaking the sun only a dim glow on the horizon the overall spell was complete but the structure was fragile he needed a massive infusion of energy to set the pattern so that the tempest could become a force in its own right a gust of rain knocked him to his knees gasping he reached for his partner but for the first time he was unable to tap her strength though she had reserves still they were beyond his reach isabel he tried to call but his voice was a thin whisper lost in the rising wind he was on all fours most of his strength and awareness devoted to stabilizing the tempest with none left for holding him upright her arms came around his shoulders though her touch stirred a wisp of energy it was nowhere near enough to seal the spell he tried harder to connect with the silvery pool of her power she was struggling equally he sensed her frantic effort but there might have been a glass wall between them impenetrable impossible macrae her husky voice whispered in his ear the alchemical marriage the mating of opposites to form a greater whole it is the only solution left with shock he realized that she meant a physical mating his dazed mind tried to evaluate whether her proposal had a chance to work there had been strong attraction from the beginning in another time and place he would have courted her or perhaps swept her onto his horse and carried her off to the highlands but he had buried such thoughts as inappropriate to the work they were doing together she might be right that passion could forge their spirits into a single invincible blade but the cool voice of his conscience pointed out that he wanted desperately to believe that surrendering to lust was the key to victory was he a guardian a man of honor or a randy male who would lie to gain what he desired her lips touched his in a hesitant kiss her scent was of rainwashed roses his numb body began tingling to life sensing the change isabels kiss became fierce a demand laced with power primal passion exploded through him bringing every fiber of his body to blazing life be damned to his doubts he wanted and needed isabel more than reason more than conscience more than honor as he kissed her back the shields he had borne from the cradle dissolved allowing her access to the depths of his soul her fierce determination to conquer entered into his own soul making them the invincible sword he had imagined the gentle rain intensified into a downpour fluid and fertile as it mated with the earth isabel my enchantress he rolled above her pressing her long body into the wet grass as he kissed her hungrily blending his essence with hers their lovemaking shattered the skies as the last barriers collapsed power was abundant limitless flowing through them and into the tempest stabilizing the intricate structure of the spell lightning blazed until he was unsure if they were in kent or soaring high over the north sea in the heart of the storm as their spirits melded he discovered that at the heart of her power was a lonely child who was an outsider among those she loved convinced she was too strange too unattractive to ever find the closeness she craved even john dee greatest alchemist of the age had found his student disconcerting tenderly macrae showed her his vision of her unique bewitching beauty how she was a paragon among women a mistress of mages in return she mirrored him back to himself was he really so darkly intimidating yet she was drawn to his strength intrigued by his contradictions so he gloried in his darkness he was distantly aware of spanish ships foundering sails shredding and masts snapping without the anchors they had shed near the low countries to escape the english fire ships they were helpless before the tempest with a last paroxysm of power the hurricane crystallized into a living entity no longer dependent on its creator they had succeeded against all the odds they had won drained of every shred of strength and passion he fell once more into darkness exhausted to ashy numbness isabel cradled her lover to her breast as the rain drummed into their panting bodies she had not known the cosmos held such pleasure or such pain as she had discovered with macrae part of her would have been content to lie there and drown but now that passion had burned out she was aware that the soggy ground and cold wind were wickedly uncomfortable she managed to pull herself out from under his dead weight dead alarmed she laid her fingers to his throat his pulse was strong with effort she invoked subtler senses to look more deeply and decided that he was not profoundly injured as he had been by his earlier attempt on the armada only expended he would sleep at least a day perhaps longer she tugged his cloak over him shielding his face from the rain then stumbled her way up the long lane to the house luckily the torrent disguised her dishevelment her household was used to odd activities from her they would not suspect her of anything so plebian as coupling with a handsome stranger a stranger her mouth twisted she knew sir adam macrae to the depths of his stormy impatient generous soul as her numb fingers fumbled with the kitchen door it swung open and mstress heath pulled her into the warmth of the kitchen thank the lord you be all right mlady the housekeeper exclaimed tis worried ive been terrified more likely but all isabels servants knew better than to disturb her when she was working all is well mstress heath but send the men to the stone circle to bring sir adam to the house he he has not fully recovered from his illness and has been overcome by his exertions the sodden cloak was swept from her shoulders and a mug of warm beef broth pressed into her hands drink this mlady mistress heath said briskly by the time youre finished a hot bath will be waiting then its to bed with you ill see to your scottish savage grateful to be cared for as a child isabel drank her broth then allowed herself to be led to her room macrae was being carried in as she left the kitchen water pouring off him and the servants who had collected him when she cast a glance back mistress heath firmly tugged her onward the hot bath was spiked with lavender the healing herb soothing her frayed spirit isabel closed her eyes and willed herself to tranquillity what mattered was that they had succeeded they had forged an alchemical marriage that generated the power they needed and england would never again be threatened by spain even without her scrying glass she knew that with absolute certainty she uttered a prayer for the souls of the spanish sailors wearily she rested her head against the edge of the wooden tub she had sworn she would pay any price and her virginity was small enough as costs went much harder was losing half of her soul it would have been easier to give up her life but that loss was not something that could or should be undone she had found pleasure almost beyond bearing in their joining now she must face the anguish of knowing they must separate deep in macraes mind she had seen his distaste at the prospect of being fettered by marriage but guardians were subject to great pressure to wed preferably to other guardians so the blood and the power would remain strong he had accepted marriage as his fate before his intemperance had landed him in the tower of london he had been ready to offer for a gentle guardian maiden called anne a blonde as sweetnatured as she was beautiful best of all in macraes eyes was that anne was a scot when most guardian daughters were english he could not have tolerated an english wife his disgust at the prospect had been achingly clear isabel clambered from the tub and began toweling herself dry her body was warm now though her soul was chilled she had a sudden yearning for her mother who had never truly understood her strange daughter but who loved her anyhow as she donned her night rail and crawled into her bed isabel forced herself to accept that macrae was intended for another woman even if he was not his taste did not run to blackhaired harridans especially english ones so be it they had won a great victory today it was enough it must be enough the sun was shining when macrae awoke outside the diamondshaped windowpanes two larks perched on a branch and warbled to each other he listened in lazy peace scarcely able to believe that they had triumphed and survived of isabels survival he had no doubt for the rest of his life he would be aware of every breath she drew he was climbing cautiously from the bed when the housekeeper entered eager to see isabel he said tell mistress de cortes that i wish to speak to her the housekeepers brows arched youll have a wait then my lady left for london yesterday he stared unable to believe that she was gone why the devil did she do that mistress heath shrugged tis not my place to say she would surely go to her fathers house where does the de cortes family live ignoring the question mistress heath turned to leave one of the men will bring you hot water and food the door closed hard behind her isabel had left him the damned englishwoman had bloody left him how dare she swearing he opened the wardrobe and yanked out his cleaned and folded garments this could have been settled easily but nothing about isabel de cortes was easy she would pay for this insult aye she would pay as soon as her mother left the room isabel poured the latest tisane into the window box that hung from her sill though her flowers had been tattered by the great storm already they were recovering perhaps the herbal brews were good for them in her mothers arms she had found the warmth and comfort she craved but the maternal fussing was in a fair way to driving her mad as were the incessant questions about what had happened perhaps someday isabel would be able to speak of it but probably not master dee had visited and given her a magnificent ruby ring from the queens own hand in gratitude for what she and macrae had achieved but the visit was brief for the royal conjuror was anxious to return to his family in bohemia isabel drifted to the window wondering what more her life might hold her usual studies had no interest for her and even her scrying glass was cloudy when she tried to see her future she had been part of a great work that changed the course of nations so perhaps it was greedy of her to want something beyond a long desiccated spinsterhood though unlike the queen she was no longer virgin she heard a distant pounding as if soldiers were banging on the front door then an uproar broke out downstairs her blood froze under an onslaught of horrified ancestral memories of the inquisition coming to take members of the de cortes family away to torture and death surely not here in london not again heart racing she darted from her room and to the stairs she halted in shock when she looked down into the entry hall magnificently dressed and fierce as a wolf adam macrae was holding two of her fathers menservants at bay with a sword her parents stormed into the hall seeing the sword her father threw a protective arm in front of his wife as he barked what is the meaning of this you insolent devil you should be grateful master de cortes macrae replied in a voice of thunder ive come to take your stubborn spinster daughter off your hands her mother gasped youll not touch her you great brute my husband is a friend of the lord mayor of london and youll be hanged drawn and quartered if you assault a virtuous maiden a virtuous maiden macrae laughed out loud that is not the isabel i know her shock dissolved by fury isabel swept down the steps as if she were one of macraes own tempests how dare you force your way in and terrorize my fathers household take yourself back to scotland and marry that sweet bland blonde of yours his gaze snapped upward isabel with a smile like the sun at high noon he sheathed his sword and galloped up the steps three at a time meeting her on the landing he swept her into an embrace that bruised her lips thunder and lightning a storm in the blood her desire to shove him down the stairs dissolved and she kissed him back the damnable man he murmured into her ear did you think you could walk away from an alchemical marriage my beautiful witch but but anne the woman you are contracted to likely wed to another by now his long clever fingers began stroking the small of her back anne had no shortage of suitors and she found me alarming which is why the contracts had not yet been signed a man cleared his throat heavily face beetred isabel looked down the steps to find that she and macrae were the object of fascinated gazes by half the members of the household her father said sternly you know this rogue hhis name is sir adam macrae and he is a wellborn scot she stammered a scot her father snorted no wonder he behaves like a savage accustom yourself macrae raised his hand revealing a sapphire ring in a setting that matched isabels your queen herself has ordered isabel to marry me in return for my services to england you called on queen elizabeth isabels eyes widened with shock i wanted to make sure i held the high ground if you were so foolish as to try to refuse me he wrapped one arm around her waist and gazed down at isabels parents i am wealthy enough to gladden any parents heart and brave enough to take on your hellcat as it happens she and i share certain unusual talents and interests now if you will excuse us i wish to speak to my affianced bride in private her fathers eyes narrowed showing the formidable merchant who had prospered in good times and bad i dont care how wealthy you are or if god himself has given you permission to wed my daughter no man will have isabel unless she agrees to the union and if you attempt to force her youll face the swords of myself and my three sons isabels mother placed a hand on her husbands arm a faint knowing smile playing over her lips i doubt that anything is being done against isabels will give them the chance to settle matters in private david isabels father started to protest then subsided very well if isabel is willing to speak with this rogue i am willing matters between us must be settled although she wasnt sure if she would accept macrae or cut his heart out as he marched isabel up the steps she glanced back and saw that her parents were smiling smiling as easily as that this barbarian scot had won them over he led her unerringly to her bedroom how did you know where to find me she asked as he bolted the door behind them it would have been hard enough to hide from a mage but its impossible to conceal yourself from your bonded mate for mated we are isabel accept it he spun her around so that her back was to him and began deftly unlacing her gown with a swiftness truly magical he unbound her rigid leather corset then cupped her breasts with his warm great hands as she gasped with distracted pleasure his levity dropped away i love you isabel he said softly accept the fact that we are joined for life and quite possibly eternity as well will marriage be so very bad weve been granted a rare gift of passion and closeness my love she pulled away and turned to face him it wasnt possible to read his thoughts the white heat that had joined them when they conjured the tempest was only a distant pulse though it would always be there when summoned but they were still in resonance with each other and with dawning wonder she realized that she was no longer alone in his eyes she saw the reflection of her own soul and the mad glory of his desire even to her surprise a fear that she would continue to resist him she had always had faith in her magical abilities but for the first time a pleasing sense of feminine power began to flow through her despite macraes bluster he was wellaware that a mage of her power couldnt be brought unwilling to the altar this great brash scot was humbling himself humility was not one of his gifts which was why he was doing it so badly secure in her power as both sorceress and woman she asked so you have demanded me as a reward from my queen invaded my home and terrorized our servants because you want to marry me even though i am neither scottish nor a guardian he smiled wryly aye it doesnt matter that you are english and not of guardian blood you are isabel the most powerful sorceress in britain and my bonded mate and my family will rejoice when i bring you home must i terrorize anyone else to gain your consent my dear foolish rogue with a swift cascade of joy she linked her arms around his neck she didnt need her scrying glass to know that they would share passion and battles and unshakable love macrae was hers as she was his bonded for eternity in an alchemical marriage all you had to do was ask authors note the defeat of the spanish armada is one of those historical high points that just about everyone remembers from high school history classes it was a watershed that established englands ascendancy as a great sea power and was also a signifier of spains decline the expulsion of the jews from spain certainly contributed to that decline its ironic that the word marrano which meant swine and was highly insulting became marranos the term by which the exiles are now known john dee is a historical figure famous as the queens conjuror a metaphysical scholar alchemist writer and astrologer he cast a chart to pick the best time for elizabeths coronation given the success of her reign he was obviously good at his work it was said that he put a hex on the spanish armada which is why the weather was unusually bad that summer and the english triumphed the running battles in the english channel did only average damage it was the storms when the armada tried to sail north around britain that destroyed most of the spanish fleet dee was also a founder of the rosicrucian order a protestant response to the jesuits a devout christian he was both praised and vilified in his lifetime it is said that he was the model for shakespeares prospero in the tempest his library of more than four thousand volumes was the largest in england the guardians are my own invention their descendants will appear in some of my future historical romances starting with a kiss of fate coming from ballantine books in summer stained glass heart by catherine asaro the golden suns vyrl slipped outside the castle making sure no one saw him escape beyond the village the dalvador plains spread out like a silvergreen sea of reeds rippling with the breezes he took off in a loping run the grasses rustling around his legs reveling in his freedom he soon left the village behind he ran for the joy of being healthy strong and full of life out here he could be himself rather than prince havyrl torcellei valdoria in his more introspective moods vyrl realized he lived in an idyll his life marked by golden days his parents had set it up that way to shield their children from the harsh life of the imperial court in an interstellar empire the colonists who had settled the world lyshriol lived a simpler life one close to the land they cared more about a good harvest festival than long titles or dynastic lineages so vyrl and his many siblings tended crops pulled weeds and looked after livestock just like anyone else reedgrasses rippled around him the translucent tubes sparkling like glass but bending easily supple and soft iridescent spheres no larger than his thumb topped many of the stalks and floated off their moorings when he brushed by the drifting bubbles marked his path through the plains running hard throwing his arms wide he relished the strength of his muscles and broadening shoulders after a year of gawkiness when he had seemed to grow visible amounts every day he had finally stopped feeling gangly and awkward he was more comfortable now with his new height and strength he tilted his head up letting sunlight bathe his face two gold suns hung in a lavender sky side by side right now shaped more like eggs than spheres and speckled with dark spots the double star destabilized the terraformed planet but vyrl earnestly believed that by the time that difficulty threatened this world well into the future his people would have figured out how to fix the problem then vyrl ignominiously tripped over a rock laughing he staggered through the grass flailing his arms until he recovered his balance eventually his pentup energy spent itself and he slowed to a walk he glanced back at the village the distant cluster of white buildings and colorful turreted roofs barely showed above the waving grasses he could just see the topmost level of his home his family lived in a castle a small but lovely one with towers at the corners each capped by a blue turreted roof spires topped the roofs and pennants snapped on them violet with gold ribbing vyrl let out a contented sigh then he flopped on his back in the grass breathing deeply his heart beating hard swaying stalks bent over him releasing bubbles that glistened against the sky ah what a day he grinned relieved to have escaped his math homework a girl giggled vyrls sense of peace fled he sat up fast who is that silence scrambling to his feet he glared over the plains the breezes blew his redgold curls in his face and he pushed them out of his eyes he saw no one although a person could easily hide in the grass she should have left a trail of bubbles floating over whatever path she took here vyrl peered back the way he had come he had left more than a trail his wild race had stirred clouds of glimmering spheres if someone was following him she could have disguised her approach by keeping to his path he should have noticed someone skulking after him but then he hadnt been paying much attention none in fact who is here he called trying to sound forceful the words came out more startled than commanding but at least his voice wasnt breaking anymore it had finally finished changing and settled into a deep baritone which pleased him just fine no answer came to his question however the girl was playing a trick on him hah he wouldnt let her rattle him he saw no trampled grass nearby but the reedgrass always sprang back fast he had flattened a great deal of it when he lay down and already it was rising back into place vyrl continued his search but found no trace of the intruder he began to feel a bit foolish perhaps he had imagined that giggle finally he lay down again stretching out on his back with his hands behind his head another giggle floated on the air like a bubble who is that he had heard her glowering he jumped to his feet and stalked around the area stomping at the grass whos there two bubbles detached from a nearby stalk and bobbed off over the plain there he strode forward grasses whipping around his legs a trill of laughter rippled in the wind then a girl jumped up out of the grasses redgold curls and blue skirts with a laughing glance in his direction she took off and raced away hey he shouted lily you come back here instead of running after her though he hesitated lily was the daughter of a local farmer she and vyrl had been friends practically since they had been born but lately he had avoided her unable to do more than stutter banalities in her presence lily didnt look like lily anymore she had changed become all curves and mystery she ran through the grasses sending sprays of bubbles into the air her blue skirt swirled around her legs and parted the high grass showing glimpses of her thighs then hiding them again the top of her dress fit snug around her torso adorned by a maze of confusing laces vyrl had never figured out why girls needed so many ties on their clothes she made a beautiful sight though her waistlength curls flying in the wind streaming around her shiny and redbronze touched with gold sunstreaks hah he wouldnt let her get away with spying on him he took off in a sprint in the village he would have held back not wanting people to see them playing like children but out here he felt less constrained chasing lily making her shriek and laugh had always entertained him now the thought of catching her made his pulse quicken in a way that had never happened when they were younger lily glanced over her shoulder her gaze flashing with mischief her large eyes taunting him with an audacious gleam her teasing laugh sparkled across the plains that laugh had been the bane of his existence for as long as he could remember with his long legs vyrl easily gained on her coming alongside her he grabbed her around the waist with a gleeful shout they went into a spin their momentum whirling them around he almost regained his balance by swinging her in a dance step he didnt usually let anyone know he had learned given that men werent supposed to dance then they toppled into the grasses in a tangle of limbs and clothes got you vyrl flipped her onto her back still panting from his run he pinned her upper arms to the ground say give he demanded come on lily i win in years past she would have yanked up a clod of tubereeds and thrown it at him then escaped while he yelled and wiped his eyes clear of the sparkling dirt that clung to bulbs on the grass today though she wasnt laughing she stared up at him breathing hard her chest rising and falling her violet eyes huge most everyone in the dalvador province had violet eyes including vyrl himself but until this moment he had never realized the beauty of the color her lashes glimmered gold a thick fringe against her milky skin the rosy blush of her cheeks made his pulse race he felt hot then nervous lying here half on top of her gazing at her face which was so familiar and so new at the same time her emotions washed over his empaths mind confusion surprise and an uncertain anticipation sweet and intense it all mixed with another emotion harder to define a warmth that spread through her and made him even more aware of her curves vyrl flushed unsettled by his heightened awareness of her usually he shared emotions only with members of his family who were the only empaths in dalvador even then they had to be near one another to pick up moods and they had learned to guard their minds to give one another privacy yet with lily his mental defenses were drifting away as if they were no more than ephemeral bubbles that floated on the wind they lay staring at each other vyrl with no idea what to say lilys mouth parted slightly her lips full and soft so soft plump how would they feel if he touched them then she dimpled like an imp and grabbed a handful of reeds you must let me up o clumsy sir or i will be forced to shower your head with sod although she spoke as always full of play she sounded different today breathless a little scared in the past vyrl would have wrestled her for the grass today he murmured you must first pay a fine for spying on me she gave a mock gasp of dismay her heartshaped face as expressive as ever and what terrible fine would you wrest you heartless beast from a poor girl such as myself not so terrible he said softly then he bent his head and kissed her as often as vyrl had imagined this moment his daydreams were nothing compared to the real thing a jolt went through him as their lips touched she tasted so sweet and felt so soft her breasts against his chest her body round beneath his his heart thudded hard as if he were still running lifting his head he whispered lily then he kissed her again moving his hands up her sides caressing feeling where her hips curved in to her waist her emotions had become a confusing tumult ah no she wasnt responding mortification swept over him had he made a fool of himself if she pushed him away or laughed at him he was going to die utterly die instead she slid her arms around his waist her embrace tentative as if she wasnt sure where to put her hands her mouth parted under his and she nibbled shyly at his lower lip vyrl sighed almost giddy with relief he wanted to untie her laces and pull up her skirts touch her everywhere but he held back afraid he would scare her her emotions flooded past the natural barriers in her mind the protections all people raised without realizing it then he knew this was her first kiss as it was his despite his good intentions his hands roamed still kissing her he stroked her sides down and up his touch urgent he folded his palms around her breasts filling his grip with them if only this cloth would disappear he fumbled with the laces on her bodice baffled by their complexity frustrated he pulled harder straining to undo them pushing up her skirt with his other hand he reached for her thigh vyrl no slow down lily pushed his hand away from her leg she was breathing hard now but she had tensed no longer pliant under him he groaned softly one hand on her breast the other intertwined with hers at his side with her mental barriers fading he could feel her shy desire but also her fear im sorry he said youre just so soft and pretty he brushed his lips across her nose i could kiss you all day her blush deepened as pink as a sunrise he had always thought lily was lovely even in their early childhood when cruder children had called her a fat little sprout now the plump little girl had vanished replaced by this curvaceous beauty warmth washed out from her mind and he closed his eyes letting it flow over him she felt so very very right as if he had always known he would someday hold her like this youve been working on your fathers farm a lot she said ive seen you doing your chores vyrl opened his eyes they dont seem like chores he longed to kiss her more but he held back not wanting to ruin this moment by pushing too hard he shifted onto his side next to her their bodies fitting together like pieces of a puzzle the grass waved above and bubbles shimmered in the air one popped scattering glitter over them vyrl laughed then flicked the powder off lilys nose i like to work in the fields he said he would far rather plow a field than study the physics his tutors persisted in trying to teach him her mouth curved upward half shy half teasing you look very fine out in those fields with your shirt off he flushed you watched me like that you know vyrl you used to be skinny like a stalk of tootallweed hai he never had liked it when people called him that even if it had been true these past years when he shot up like the tootallweeds that grew over houses seeking light from the suns so what weed do i look like now he tried to make light of it though he would really rather not be called a plant her face gentled you dont touching his cheek she spoke in her lilting voice you look like a man now so strong and tall an emotion swelled in him one he wasnt sure how to define he knew only that he was where he belonged with a tenderness he hadnt known he possessed he brushed back a curl that had blown in her face then he kissed her again barely able to believe he had her in his arms he wanted to feel her skin against his to make love to her out here under the golden suns just as he had so often loved her in his dreams but he held back and did no more than kiss her taking it as slowly as she needed when the larger sun touched the horizon and shadows stretched across the plains vyrl and lily headed back to the village of dalvador walking hand in hand smiling and shy with each other vyrl was in no hurry now that he and lily had made clear what had always been unspoken between them they had plenty of time their entire lives to explore what they had begun today the hearth room was empty the fireplace at the far end of the long hall slumbered its coals dark no flames licking its blue stones no one sat in the armchairs there and the standing lamps with their roseglass shades remained unlit lost in daydreams vyrl walked across the other end of the long hall far from the hearth in the shadows as he passed the great stone staircase that curved up to the second floor he glanced around to make sure he was alone then he turned in a circle pretending to dance with lily with a flourish he snapped his foot to his knee and spun fast three times he came out of the turn in a leap jumping high off the ground then he landed on bent knees and stopped checking to make sure no one had seen him laughing softly at himself he resumed his staid walk youre late a voice said vyrl froze in response to the speaker the lamps at the far end of the hall came on shedding warm light over the hearth this far from the lamps shadows filled the hall but enough light filtered back to show a man standing a few paces away in the doorway vyrl had been approaching he hadnt heard anyone enter probably because he had been dancing vyrl managed to find his voice father eldrinson althor valdoria who carried the title of dalvador bard looked to vyrl like the hero of an epic poem at five feet ten his father stood half a handspan taller than the average man of dalvador he had a wellbuilt physique his muscles firm from years of farming winered hair brushed his shoulders its healthy sheen visible despite the dim light even vyrl who understood almost nothing about how women saw such matters could tell his father had a handsome face with its straight nose high cheekbones large eyes and classical features although vyrl never knew how to respond when people exclaimed over how he resembled his father he considered it a compliment more because he admired his father than because he cared about appearance where have you been eldrinson asked frowning out in the plains vyrl tried not to look guilty about his missed schoolwork his father would never understand no one could vyrl was all brimming confusion and desire although his older brothers sometimes saw girls in the village he was certain none of them had ever felt the way he did about lily as if his heart could soar one moment and shatter the next eldrinson came over to him and vyrl again had the unsettling experience of looking down at him instead of up he had yet to become used to being taller than his father and he was still growing and while you were running in the plains his father inquired who was doing your lessons vyrl imagined a black velvet cloth over his mind hiding his thoughts about lily from his father who was a strong empath ill finish them tonight you shouldnt leave them until so late i cant study all day vyrl grumbled ill turn into a mad marauder a marauder eldrinson tried to hold back his smile we cant have that although his father had guarded his mind vyrl could tell he wasnt angry either about the missed homework or about vyrl dancing which he had probably seen i feel suffocated in here vyrl said i need to run his father tried to look stern if you intend to carry through with this idea of yours to earn a doctorate in agriculture someday you have to study if i go to the university ill have to go offworld the prospect dismayed vyrl maybe i could attend through the computer webs instead you mean in a virtual classroom yes vyrls mood lightened exactly eldrinson rubbed his chin i dont really understand it these machines and things of your mothers people having grown up with the technology his mother had brought to lyshriol vyrl had never shared his fathers unease with it eager now he said ive been checking colleges many have programs for virtual students i would never have to leave lyshriol he longed to learn the science behind the farming he loved lyshriol was more than his home the plains the suns the land itself were part of him at a level so deep he couldnt separate them from his identity his father spoke carefully many possibilities exist vyrl could tell something more than unfinished homework was troubling his father disquieted he looked around where is everyone usually the house bustled with life he had six brothers and three sisters all at home except for eldrin his oldest brother they went to the festival in the village eldrinson said ive been looking for you for me why to talk his fathers expression had become unreadable if you stay here on lyshriol your life will have many constraints you wouldnt have to accept those limitations if you went offworld apprehension brushed vyrl i dont want to leave you may change your mind when youre older he pondered his father although eldrinson didnt seem overly upset he wasnt happy either vyrl had tended to avoid his parents lately but this cautious conversation bothered him his father was shielding his mind more than usual it didnt feel right vyrl went to the stairs and sat on the fourth step stretching out his legs what happened eldrinson came over and leaned against the banister his elbow resting on its gold curve you are familiar with the house of majda i guess vyrl knew majda the way he knew the other noble houses as institutions he studied in school and otherwise gladly forgot in this age of elected leaders the imperial nobility were an anachronism including his own family the ruby dynasty which topped that antiquated hierarchy he winced reminded of the history lessons he had neglected yesterday earning his tutors disapproval his mothers ancestors had ruled the ruby empire until that interstellar civilization had fallen stranding its colony worlds during the ensuing dark ages many colonies had lost their technology only in recent centuries had his mothers people regained star travel and begun rediscovering the lost colonies such as this one on lyshriol although vyrl knew the house of majda had been a strong ally of the ruby dynasty throughout history he had never met a single member of that venerated line majda belonged to offworld politics like a distant fog devon majda heads the house of majda his father said she inherited the title of matriarch ten years ago just after her twentyeighth birthday oh vyrl leaned back with his elbows on the stair above him eldrinson shifted his weight then cleared his throat as matriarch devon has responsibilities i see in truth vyrl had no idea what his father was talking about he couldnt pick up anything from eldrinsons guarded mind he wondered if he could make it to the festival in time to have dinner with his brothers do you know what those responsibilities are eldrinson asked was this a test maybe his father was more annoyed with him for playing truant than he realized if he had to stay in tonight while everyone else enjoyed the festival he wouldnt see lily he tried to sound knowledgeable as the head of her house devon majda has a seat in the assembly vyrl scoured his memory most councilors in the assembly are elected leaders who represent various worlds only the noble houses have hereditary seats its left over from the days when the ruby dynasty ruled instead of the assembly he squinted at eldrinson you and mother have seats too dont you mother is the councilor for foreign affairs thats right his father paused your mothers seat is more than hereditary she ran for election and won it gives her more votes oh yes although vyrl admired his mothers work in a theoretical sort of way right now he had more concern for his growling stomach lately he was hungry all the time he ate twice as much as his younger siblings but it never seemed to be enough the ruby dynasty and majda must balance their power with that of the assembly eldrin said still guarded vyrl knew he was missing whatever his father wanted him to see i didnt finish my studies on majda he admitted eldrinson hesitated discomfort leaking past his mental barriers he didnt even admonish vyrl for his lack of scholarly effort instead he said as the head of majda devon must ensure that her line continues although vyrl wasnt sure why his father cared he could well imagine that the house of majda was upset if their matriarch had reached the age of thirtyeight without producing any children she needs heirs thats right when his father said no more relief spread through vyrl apparently the lesson was over he stood up shall we join the others im starving vyrl wait eldrinson raked his hand through his hair we need to discuss this vyrl stopped then slowly sat again discuss what his father answered quietly your betrothal what the word thudded in on vyrl betrothal he must have misheard im not betrothed to anyone his voice cracked on the last word i realize this is unexpected his father gave him a look of apology your mother and i had intended to take more time to let you adjust to the idea this visit caught us by surprise weve just received word that brigadier general majda thats devon will be here in two days a constriction tightened vyrls chest making it hard to breathe brigadier general at thirtyeight he was no military expert but even he knew that however old it might sound to him that age was young for such a rank shes good at what she does very good his father added dryly her family connections dont hurt either vyrl struggled to mask his turmoil to hide the chaos of his emotions surely an escape existed from this disaster this is too fast sympathy washed across his fathers face im sorry it is such a shock your mother and i want you to be happy vyrl we spent a great deal of time checking out devon she is a good person and as the majda consort you can follow pursuits you could never have here awkwardly he added including an uh artistic career if you wish vyrl barely heard him all he could see was lily her lovely face bright in the sunshine like a lost dream betrothals among the noble houses were political arrangements his parents and majda had probably been negotiating for months even years these matters carried the weight of governmental decrees nineteenyearold eldrin his oldest brother had married the ruby pharaoh three years ago his own kin as tradition dictated but it wasnt fair he wasnt eldrin he wasnt the firstborn he had three older brothers and three younger ones his parents had turned down offers for his other brothers considering the matches unsuitable vyrl had never expected they would accept one for him especially with the highest placed member of the most powerful house what made it even worse was that he understood their reasoning he was more familyoriented than his older brothers more suitable as a consort if majda needed an heir she had to marry relatively soon which left out his younger brothers and more than anything he understood the gift his parents wanted to give him the chance to pursue his love of dance something he could never do here on lyshriol it didnt matter he couldnt marry a female warrior he couldnt do it just as men never danced on lyshriol so women never fought in battle his stomach clenched if he revealed how he felt about lily his parents would have her sent away to remove a distraction that might interfere with his betrothal he couldnt bear the thought he struggled for calm i dont want to marry eldrinson spoke in the kindly voice vyrl had trusted his entire life but which gave him no mooring now its all right you will have time to get to know her to feel more comfortable with this situation why cant althor marry her vyrl thought of his brother at seventeen althor was preparing to go offworld to a military academy he wants that life he would be perfect for her youre the one she offered for but why althor is older so is delkurj in truth vyrl couldnt imagine anyone marrying his wild brother delkurj but that didnt make this any easier eldrinsons face turned thoughtful i can only guess as to devons motives in regards to althor majda is a conservative matriarchy i suspect devon doesnt want a fighter pilot for a husband as for delkurj he made an angry wave with his hand lets just say he has had a few indiscretions few vyrl would have laughed if he hadnt been so upset delkurj already knew more about women than most grown men in dalvador he liked girls and they liked him and he made no secret about it despite the trouble it caused him del hadnt fathered any children yet but if he kept up in the way hed begun it would only be a matter of time vyrl spoke in a low voice does the assembly want this betrothal too his father nodded stronger ties between majda and the ruby dynasty will cement alliances the assembly sees as crucial to the stability of our government i dont want to stabilize a government he couldnt keep the pain out of his voice ah vyrl eldrinsons voice held deep regret i am terribly sorry this news is unwelcome if it helps to know your mother and i truly believe this can be a good match devon majda will treat you well with respect and honor shes ancient his fathers expression lightened if she is ancient i fear to ask what that makes your mother and me his smile faded we do have concerns about the age difference but with modern techniques to delay aging eventually you wont be so aware of it gently he added you may come to love her in time vyrl could only shake his head his dreams were slipping away like the glitter from a ruptured bubble spreading on the wind the silvered plains the circular chamber was high in a tower of the castle vyrl stood at the window looking out over the countryside the three figures crossing the dalvador plains were too far away to see clearly but he recognized his mothers streaming gold hair and his fathers confident stride beyond them about a fifteenminute walk from dalvador the starport made a cluster of whitewashed buildings with blue turreted roofs it resembled a dalvador hamlet except for the goldandblack spacecraft that crouched on the landing field like an intruder the shuttle had come down from one of the battle cruisers that orbited lyshriol vyrl had never thought much about the ships up there beyond knowing they provided one of the best orbital defense systems in settled space if only they could have defended him against the arrival of brigadier general devon majda he wished he could fly away beyond the suns in the lavender sky the larger orb was eclipsing the smaller like a great golden coin surrounded by a halo to the east and south farms drowsed in the sunlight uncaring of interstellar politics nearer by his parents and their guest reached the village he lost sight of them as they walked in among the houses vyrl bit his lip his heart aching for lily he glanced toward her home a round white house on a hill surrounded by other houses he hadnt dared talk to her in the past two days since their afternoon together he had never made it to the festival that night having been grounded for his truancy he missed her so much as if someone had taken out his center and left him with a hole only she could fill yesterday he had seen her while he was walking to his fathers farm with althor and delkurj she and some other girls had been carrying baskets of bubble fruit before he could even think he had started toward her his heart surging his pulse racing he had gone only a few steps when his brothers called him back he couldnt confide in them given that one of his brothers might have to marry devon if he didnt he doubted they would want lily distracting him but neither would they want to betray his trust rather than put them in that awkward position he said nothing they knew he was hiding his moods but they respected his privacy and never pried neither with word nor thought disheartened vyrl turned from the window and sat on an elegant stone bench against the wall he came here when he needed to soothe his agitation his mother had once referred to this chamber as a balm for his tempestuous soul he wasnt sure what she meant but he did like the austere beauty of this room with its polished bluestone walls domed ceiling and a floor tiled in squares of blue and white stone designs in basrelief bordered the ceiling and floor as if the chamber were a round gift box with him as the present that last thought dispelled his tenuous serenity with every fiber of his being protesting he made himself stand up he crossed to the arched door of the chamber but he paused without opening it such a beautiful door he could stay here all day admiring it really he loved its vibrant color made with layers of bluestalk from the stained glass forest it glowed like a mountain lake his mother had told him about an offworld substance called wood that came in brown shades and didnt glow he found it hard to imagine such dullness as much as he would have been happy to appreciate the door for the rest of the day he could no longer procrastinate so he left the chamber and descended the bluestone stairs that spiraled down the tower he had dressed formally today in blue trousers with a darker belt embossed in silver soft boots came to his knees goldleaf designs bordered their top edges and also the cuffs and collar on his white bellsleeved shirt thongs laced up the front of the shirt at the second story of the castle he exited the tower into a hall of lavender ashstone wall sconces held purpleglass lamps lit with flames he thought of stopping to turn on the superconducting light rods hidden in the ceiling but he didnt pause it would only delay the inevitable by a few moments and besides today he wanted no reminders of offworld technology or offworld technocrats far too soon he reached the top of the stairs that went down to the hearth room the great staircase curved around this part hidden from view of the hall below vyrl stood on the landing straining to hear voices came from below his parents and a woman with a husky contralto he clenched the banister unable to continue he couldnt go down he couldnt but if he didnt appear soon his parents would send someone for him so he fortified his resolve and descended halfway down he came around the curve of the staircase stopping there he looked out over the hearth room his parents and an unfamiliar woman were standing at the far end near the hearth unaware of him sipping from ruby goblets a girl with gold curls had just served them judging by her empty silver tray as she walked down the hall she glanced up seeing vyrl she started her mouth opening then she averted her gaze and hurried on her way leaving the room vyrls face burned he had known her for years she and lily were always giggling together often at him though he had never understood why they found him so amusing now she wouldnt even acknowledge him after the news about his betrothal had spread in the village his friends no longer seemed comfortable with him did they look away because he had become different his title made real the son of a mysterious queen who came from above the sky no one else had realized yet he was on the stairs so he remained still watching his mother looked every bit her ruby dynasty heredity tall and statuesque in a soft blue jumpsuit she stood by the fireplace with a posture of quiet confidence gold hair curled around her face cascaded over her shoulders and arms and poured down her back his father stood next to her one elbow on the mantel as he spoke to their guest devon majda vyrl couldnt stop staring at the general she wore a trim uniform green with gold on the cuffs and polished kneeboots that made her taller than his parents her black hair hung glossy and straight to her shoulders framing a face of austere aristocratic perfection from her aquiline nose to her dark upwardtilted eyes with her long limbs and athletic build she projected a sense of energy an aura of power surrounded her as if she took her rank and heredity for granted indeed she should only one other family had more status or wealth than majda the ruby dynasty vyrl didnt care about ancient empires modern politics or wealth he just wanted his own family and a farm unfortunately that probably had a lot to do with why devon had chosen him to sire her heirs thinking of what went into that siring he flushed certain his face was turning bright red given the differences in their ages he hadnt expected to find her so attractive but she still seemed old to him he couldnt imagine her as his wife glancing toward the stairs his mother caught sight of him with a smile she raised her hand beckoning devon idly glanced his way then did a double take her gaze widening a surge of appreciation overflowed her mind she apparently liked what she saw acutely aware of them watching he came down the stairs he grew even more selfconscious as he crossed the long room to the hearth when he reached them devon bowed deeply from the waist as she straightened vyrl nodded with the formality his title required raising his head he found himself looking straight into her eyes it startled him he was used to the girls in dalvador who came only to his shoulder if that much he took after his mothers people with their greater height devon spoke in iotic the language of the nobility my honor at your presence your highness although here in dalvador he rarely needed to follow the protocol of the imperial court vyrl had learned its ways he answered in flawless iotic and mine at yours general majda he wondered if he sounded as awkward as he felt she smiled her expression formal but not unfriendly devon please devon he tried to smile back though the expression felt stiff on his face please call me vyrl she repeated his name in her iotic accent making it sound like vahrialle which was he supposed the proper pronunciation all his friends drawled verle in the rural dalvador dialect they talked for a bit a stilted conversation he could think of almost nothing to say standing with his parents while he met the woman that half the galaxy expected him to impregnate was about the most mortifying experience he could imagine his father was watching them closely to devon he said perhaps you would like to take a walk vyrl can show you the countryside i would like that devon said vyrls shoulders relaxed the idea of being alone with her didnt ease his agitation but at least his parents wouldnt be watching although his mother smiled at him he felt the sadness she tried to hide her heart had ached that same way when eldrin had left home and when althor had received his acceptance to the offworld military academy i never wanted you to look at me that way vyrl thought to her ive always wanted to stay on lyshriol but he couldnt say it out loud not in front of general majda walking with devon across the plains made vyrl twitch inside just two days ago he had run free here and held lily in his arms it tore at him to return to this place with a stranger but he did his best to hide his sense of loss he could almost hear his brother delkurj deriding him enough of your melodramatic adolescent angst as if what vyrl felt for lily couldnt be serious or as if delkurj was so much more incredibly mature vyrl could tell his parents also believed he was too young to fall in love none of that mattered he knew what he felt for lily was genuine devon walked at his side her dark hair ruffled by the wind she spoke politely this is beautiful countryside ive always thought so vyrl glanced around at the nodding grasses that brushed their hips and the lavender sky with its blue puffs of cloud he wanted to add i love it with every part of my being i cant leave but he remained silent two suns she peered at the sky shielding her eyes with her hand its an unstable configuration you know the suns he had thought the problem was with the planet contradicting her would hardly be tactful though she lowered her hand i meant this world lyshriol its orbit is unstable the binary star system perturbs it oh yes vyrl pushed back the curls blowing across his face my tutor says astronomical engineers from the ruby empire moved lyshriol here and terraformed it for human colonists they had technologies weve yet to recover yes they did a good job she smiled her aristocratic face warmed by the sunlight its very pretty vyrl had never thought of the land that sustained his people and his dreams as pretty at a loss for an appropriate response he remained silent they strolled toward a distant herd of lyrine grazing on bubble stalks he stopped about a hundred meters away reluctant to disturb them those are my fathers livestock devon studied the herd theyre genetically engineered from horses arent they thats what we think biology was one of the few subjects he actually liked but if thats true theyve become very different animals she laughed softly i must admit ive never seen pastel blue horses before and those horns of theirs are charming they act like prisms yes well yes i guess so he had always liked the way sunlight refracted in rainbow flashes through the translucent horns of the lyrine their hooves produced the same effect making it look as if they struck sparks of color from the ground when they ran in sunlight it had never seemed unusual to him but perhaps it was more so than he realized or maybe she was simply trying to make conversation he motioned at several boulders that crested the grass which spread around them like an ocean of reeds would you like to sit yes thank you they settled side by side on the largest boulder which was shaped like a huge table devon continued to gaze over the plains the wind whipped back her hair accenting the classic bone structure of her face to vyrl she seemed out of place here a technocrat with an impeccable pedigree transplanted to a rustic setting that offered her no challenge he had a hard time reading her mood when he tried he ran into the mental wall she used to shield her mind nor could he relax his defenses around her with lily his barriers had dissolved without his even realizing it but now his mind felt as closed as a fortress devon spoke gently youre different than i expected different he blinked how quieter she considered him more polished although he said thank you her words didnt feel like a compliment he followed the manners his parents had taught him that he lived a rural simple life didnt make him crude devon leaned back on her hand what do you like to do vyrl when you arent in school come out here he motioned at a nearby field of nodding stalks each weighed down with orbs as large as a fist were going to harvest the baggerbubbles soon he smiled warming to the thought ill work with althor and del razing the stalks cutting plants you mean she seemed bemused cutting plants seemed a prosaic way to describe the joy of working with the land and the riches it produced he wasnt sure though if devon would understand his stumbling attempts to explain feelings he couldnt fully describe even to himself so he only said yes cutting plants ah they sat for a while when the silence became strained vyrl asked are you on vacation now i suppose you could call it that ive five days leave measured in lyshriol time she sat forward and rested her elbows on her knees the dates for the metropoli summit have been moved up thats why i had to reschedule this trip i have to give a presentation there about the groundbased defense systems for metropoli oh vyrl had no real idea what she meant it sounds important devon grimaced committee meetings always sound important the more elevated the description the less we get done she shook her head i see no point in stockpiling more weapons on metropoli the planet is already as well guarded as we can make it but its economy will benefit from the industry metropoli has a big population ten billion so it holds many votes within the assembly wryly she added hence my presentation he tried to look interested i hope it works out im sure it will she didnt sound convinced he was picking up traces of her thoughts now she didnt expect the summit to achieve anything useful he wondered why they bothered with meetings if they didnt think it would help after another silence devon cleared her throat she wouldnt look at him just kept staring across the plains the assembly sent me many files about you vyrl stiffened what was the assembly doing with files about him where did they get them she glanced at him they have dossiers on every member of your family surely you knew that his face was growing hot no oh now she looked embarrassed im sorry i didnt mean to sound intrusive you didnt that wasnt true but it wasnt her fault he hadnt known the assembly kept a dossier on him although it made sense it had simply never occurred to him ive also spoken at length to your parents she stared hard at the lyrine herd again avoiding his gaze vyrl wondered what she was trying to say they didnt tell me much about the negotiations she finally turned to him they are terribly proud of you you know they are as far as vyrl could tell his truancy and procrastination annoyed them no end yes very much now she looked selfconscious theyve made it clear that if i dont treat you well i will answer to them vyrl winced that sounded like his parents im sorry they say things like that sometimes to his surprise devon gave an affectionate laugh i imagine they do her smile faded they also made assurances discreetly of course vyrl waited for her to clarify that mystifying statement when she didnt he said what do you mean devon cleared her throat there are ah certain expectations for the consort of majda she squinted at him her cheeks tinged with red now parents may have idealized views of their children that arent well uh realistic vyrl had no idea what she meant and he didnt think he wanted to know but he couldnt restrain his curiosity what kind of views they might assume a certain innocence her blush deepened as her words trailed off oh now vyrl understood he knew exactly what she meant he spoke stiffly my parents know me well there now that he had humiliated himself with his lack of sexual experience maybe she would leave it alone mercifully she just went back to watching the lyrine apparently his father had been right about at least one reason why devon hadnt offered for delkurj vyrl suspected dels brash lack of discretion was the problem more than his actual experience if the noble houses had truly required male virginity on the wedding night they probably would have died out by now for lack of mates he focused on devon and one of her memories jumped into his mind a scene so vivid that it escaped her barriers a tall man of about thirtyfive with dark hair and eyes stood with his hands spread out from his sides laughing as he pretended confusion about something as if he were teasing the person watching him vyrl felt devons rush of love followed by a sense of loss the kind that came from separation a loneliness so deep it made him ache saints almighty what an insensitive clod his parents had birthed here he was bemoaning his own miserable fate and it had never occurred to him that this arrangement might be ruining her life too why would she want to court a halfgrown stranger when she had a lover her own age whom she would probably be far happier to make her consort if politics heredity and duty hadnt interfered devon turned to him with a strained smile when she touched his cheek a tingle went through vyrl but it only made him think of lily before he could stop himself he whispered its not fair i know she didnt even need to ask what he meant but this is how it works for those like you and me then she slid her hand behind his head and drew him forward vyrl hadnt expected her to kiss him when her lips touched his it jolted him but from surprise rather than desire the kiss was just well lips pressing his no heart no passion nothing after a moment she drew back and gave him a rueful smile perhaps it takes the sparks a while heh he wanted to crawl under the rocks my apologies if i disappointed you ah vyrl no i didnt mean that she sounded as if she wanted to hide under a few boulders herself im sorry im bungling this terribly no dont say that he struggled to smile its all right so they sat on their rock gazing at the plains trying somehow someway to find a common ground gusts of wind tried to knock vyrl off the castle wall in the light of the two moons which were both in the sky tonight he climbed down from his window hanging on to cracks in the stone despite the wind sweat dribbled down his neck he had on too many clothes not only those he had worn earlier today when he met devon but also a sweater and thicker boots he had rolled up his cloak and tied it onto his pack which he wore on his back altogether it made him hot heavy and clumsy even worse it would make it harder to run if anyone saw him finally his feet touched ground he hunkered by the wall hiding behind a cluster of bubble stalks in the garden then he checked his palmtop the silvery sheet unrolled in his hand and lit up with holos showing the house security system nothing had changed since he had turned off the alarms that guarded his room it hadnt been difficult the system was meant to keep prowlers out not hold him inside vyrl reset the system to hide his activities then tucked the palmtop back into his pack and stood up scanning the area he took off at a steady lope headed for the starport vyrl clung to the windowsill praying he didnt fall and smash himself on the gravel two stories below a nighttriller sang in the distance its musical call echoed by another triller farther away come on he muttered scraping his fingernails over the recalcitrant window open you bogboil with a protesting screech the window abruptly swung inward vyrl froze gods he was going to look stupid if someone caught him hanging here on the wall of a private home in the middle of the night it had taken him longer than he expected to finish his business at the starport it meant he hadnt reached here until well after midnight had passed in lyshriols twentyeight hour day mercifully no one seemed to be out this late at night few people wandered these high twisting lanes of dalvador no one came storming out of the house and no one yelled from any other house to find out what was going on when the trillers began singing again vyrl breathed out in relief he nudged the window wide open grateful it made no more noise and peered into the shadows beyond moonlight silvered the room below the cozy chamber looked as he remembered it though years had passed since he had last been here the bed was just below him but even the screeching window hadnt awakened its occupant vyrl grinned lily had always slept like a rock he had long suspected it had something to do with her rockheaded stubborn nature he let himself down into the room gripping the sill as he slid lower then his feet touched the bed exhaling he knelt next to the slumbering lily his head bent while he caught his breath she murmured turning restlessly this time the surge in his pulse had nothing to do with a fear of being caught he wanted to touch her but he held back having no idea how she would react when she discovered him kneeling in her bed lily rolled onto her back and sighed her eyes slowly opening for a long moment she simply stared at him her gaze fogged with sleep then she said vyrl she sounded as drowsy as she looked warm and snuggled in her nest of blankets the embroidered flowers on her white nightgown gleamed in the moonlight its me vyrl said for some reason the temperature in the room seemed to be rising how different lily made him feel compared to the enigmatic cool general majda her lips curved in the teasing smile she always used with him youre a terribly misbehaved fellow to climb in my window i must yell and make a great fuss lily his whisper came out fierce your father would kill me you better hide then her voice had an unexpected tremor with a start vyrl realized she wasnt her usual teasing self she was shaking in all the years he had known lily he had seen her laughing mischievous glowering joyous annoyed teasing and earnest but she had never been afraid of him vyrl lowered his mental barriers unsure but trusting that her thoughts wouldnt hurt him as her mood permeated his mind he realized she feared he would leave her forever disappearing from her life lost to rumors he had to marry an offworld queen his crawling in her window didnt frighten her she trusted him the same way he trusted her he touched her cheek its been a long time she folded her fingers around his with that new charming shyness of hers too long vyrl sighed his memories rushing in when he and lily had been small children they had often curled here in a pile on her bed then one day her parents and his had told them that they could no longer take naps together now vyrl felt as if he were returning home but with full knowledge of why their parents hadnt wanted them together this way they had been right if he were lilys father he would take a sharpened farm implement to any youth climbing in her window late at night but he wasnt her father he was the boy no the man who dreamed of her every day he stretched out next to her still wearing his backpack and sweater and pulled her into his arms a jolt went through him ten times stronger than the shiver devon had evoked nor did this fade it leapt like fire on oil you make me crazy he whispered fighting the urge to put his hands everywhere on her he pressed his lips against her cheek you torment my nights she slid her arms around him but ive done nothing good sir instead of offering sympathy for his travails she sounded inordinately pleased by his declaration of unrequited passion vyrl caressed her face pushing aside her disarrayed curls he found her lips with his and held her close losing himself in her tenderness he savored their kiss all the more for having so painfully labored to accept these last two days that he could never hold her again she parted her lips her embrace tightening her body fitted against his her touch uncertain but so very very fine with reluctance vyrl lifted his head she smiled her big eyes luminous in the shadows ah but he could lie here forever lost in her arms that was the problem though if he didnt stop now his plan would fail because he would end up staying the entire night he and lily would be found in the morning thoroughly shocking her parents and his everyone would hush up his scandalous behavior and his parents would probably lock him up in his tower room until he was safely married to devon as vyrl drew away lily made a low protest he swallowed even more aroused by her sweet guileless desire determined to control himself he sat up she regarded him puzzled and hurt while he took her hands and drew her into a sitting position the covers fell away from her body revealing the soft sleepgown that outlined her figure vyrls concentration flew out the window with a valiant effort he tore his gaze away from her curves and made himself focus on her face lily opaline i have an important matter to discuss with you and what might that be although she tried for a mischievous smile she looked more scared than playful he took a deep breath im running away her tremulous smile vanished vyrl no dont go softly she said please dont leave even if you have to marry that that person at least we can be friends vyrl couldnt imagine being friends with lily it would cut out his heart nor did lily understand to marry devon he would leave lyshriol and go live in some palace with a staff of hundreds which he would be expected to manage while his wife attended her military duties lily we cant be friends he said firmly he forced out the words general majda the woman who came from the sky the leaders of my mothers people say i must marry her my parents agree a tear ran down her cheek dont say goodbye this way her mischief had vanished i cant bear it dont cry he wiped his knuckles across her cheek smearing her tears then he went deep in himself calling up his courage and spoke the words he had come to say i want you to run away with me for a long moment she didnt react not in her face her posture or even her mood then her emotions flooded over him he couldnt sort it all out but two responses came through strong and clear she both feared and hoped he meant what he said its true he could hardly believe that he had actually asked her come with me but we cant she drew his hands together and held them as if they were a treasure your parents will bring us home with their magics they will easily find us vyrl had long ago given up trying to convince his friends that technology had nothing to do with magic i know they can find us but i have a well a a solution solution her emotions were clearer now apprehension that she would lose him uncertainty in how he felt about her compared to the mysterious adult who had trespassed in their midst a desire for him that she didnt fully understand and the shyness that came with that desire a selfconscious recognition of vyrls masculinity an awareness she had hidden this past year by tormenting him with mischief emboldened he plunged ahead before he lost his courage by the time they find us we will be married then he stopped terrified what if she refused him he would die of shame curl up into a ball the size of a bubble pod and blow away on the wind never to be heard of again lily stared at him then she gave an uneasy laugh youre teasing me im not vyrl raised her hands and pressed his lips against her knuckles he spoke with all the persuasion he could muster be my wife lily youre the only one ive ever wanted the only one i ever will say yes he had gone too far to turn back now tell me you will marry me tonight she let go of his hands and covered her cheeks with her hands when she said nothing he added i would court you but we havent time im afraid you have to decide now instead of accepting or refusing him she just lowered her hands he could no longer catch individual emotions in the tumult of her thoughts why wouldnt she speak had he offended her maybe he had been a fool presuming where he had no place chagrined he felt his face heating youre always so impatient she chided her voice quavering behind her bravado this is worse than the time you pushed me into the lake you would have taken the entire summer to jump if i hadnt pushed you his voice softened be brave now lily say yes we may never have another chance everyone is busy arranging my marriage general majda needs heirs and shes thirtyeight so she cant wait much longer lilys face changed slowly her expression unlike any she had shown him before no imp this no child this lily looked older when she spoke her voice caught then havyrl valdoria ii would be honored to marry you yes she had said yes he wanted to shout her answer to the sky and he would have if it hadnt meant her father would come thundering in here threatening to skewer him for invading his daughters bedroom he took her hands again and spoke in a low intense voice i will make you a good husband i swear it despite her best intentions to look somber naughtiness crept into her voice but how do i know you must give me a sample she put her arms around his neck and tilted her pretty face to his unless youre afraid to kiss me he grinned rubbing his hands along her back im not afraid you rascal but we have to leave we need to cross the backbone mountains tonight and find a bard in rillia to marry us if we ask one in the dalvador plains he will probably recognize me and refuse to do the ceremony without talking to our parents but i look at least two years older than i am lily and thats old enough for us to marry without parental consent if we go to the rillian vales we can have it done vyrl didnt care that in the interstellar culture of his mothers people he was many many years away from the age of majority on lyshriol he was almost an adult lily nodded her eyes glimmering then let us go the warlyrine raced across the plains thrilling in its speed releasing its pentup energy much as vyrl did when he ran through the endless grasses unlike the graceful slender lyrine he had shown devon yesterday this powerful animal had a massive build and a violet coat almost black in the moonlight its muscles rippled as it ran the dalvador plains spread everywhere an ocean of translucent reeds blued by the moonlight as if enchanted behind them the village of dalvador dwindled in the plains ahead still a ride of a few hours the backbone mountains speared into the sky vyrl sat astride the lyrine with lily in front of him his arms around her waist his hands gripped on the reins the lavender moon rode high in the sky bathing them in violet radiance and drawing glints of light from the lyrines horns the crescent of the blue moon hung above the horizon moonglaze had the full liquid gait of a wellbred lyrine his muscles bioengineered to even out his motions making his run so smooth that vyrl and lily could speak in full sentences even with their mount racing across the plains vyrls mother had expressed surprise to his father at the poetic names his people gave their war mounts but it made sense to vyrl who had been raised on lyshriol his mothers people seemed overly pragmatic to him leaning against vyrl lily pulled her cloak tight ive never ridden on such a glorious animal before im not surprised the great stallions like moonglaze let few people touch them vyrl didnt want to think what his father would do when he found out his son had absconded with his best warlyrine but moonglaze had always taken to vyrl and tonight he needed the animals strength moonglaze had gone to war only a few times conflicts on lyshriol were minor more like arguments than combat but beyond this simple world an interstellar civilization teemed with life and violence caught in a worldslagging war that most people here could never comprehend vyrl knew that to survive his mothers people needed military leaders much as devon and althor vyrl had no wish to fight he wanted only to raise crops and babies with lily although his father had trained him in the use of a sword and bow he seemed content with vyrls preference for farming certainly the most prevalent lifestyle in dalvador however vyrl was the only farmer here who wanted a doctorate in agriculture he could do it without leaving home as a virtual student if he could just buckle down to his studies lily would help in that she always seemed to settle him as devons consort he could earn as many doctorates as he wanted and then skolian nobility didnt farm he might like research he didnt really know but it wasnt his dream he had no grievance with devon she seemed an honorable person even so he could never imagine life in the imperial court she wanted the innocent farm boy but if she took him away from the land and life he loved it would destroy him if he hadnt loved another woman perhaps he could have accepted the arranged marriage it would have given him a great gift freeing him to pursue a life he had never dared imagine could be his he loved to dance and had trained all his life but only in private where no one except his family and offworld teachers knew it wasnt accepted among people here that men dance not under any circumstances not even at festivals it didnt matter without this woman in his arms his life would be infinitely poorer by the time their parents learned what he and lily had done it would be too late they would have consummated their marriage their wedding would be public knowledge devon could no longer wed him even if his parents annulled his union vyrl pulled lily close and she settled against him he knew he had made the right choice in asking her to marry him he just hoped it didnt cause an interstellar crisis snow pummeled vyrl and lily as they rode through the mountain storm an unexpected tempest after the clear weather down in the plains he kept his arms and cloak protectively around lily his backpack their most valuable possession right now was securely lashed in the travel bags moonglaze carried there the wind caught lilys voice and tore it away from his ears he leaned his head over hers what need shelter we could be gales stole the rest of her words be what hurt lily said vyrl clenched the reins inside his gloves his fingers had gone numb had he brought his love out here only to lose her to the fury of a blue storm no he would never let it happen he would die first yes he would before he allowed anything to hurt lily not that he was sure how his dying would help matters but that was how he felt lily was right though if they didnt locate shelter they could find themselves in serious trouble he couldnt see much of anything moonglazes head was barely more than a shadow in the swirling flurries the lyrine had slowed to a walk stepping carefully along the trail down lily was saying were probably safer on foot yes i think so vyrl reined in the lyrine and dismounted then steadied lily as she slid down next to him clutching the reins he put his arm around her shoulders darkness whirled around them and wind ripped at their cloaks his teeth chattered with cold their best hope was probably to take refuge within the clumps of boulders that dotted the meadows on either side of the trail if they could find some he took a cautious step drawing lily through the swirling storm almost blind in the darkness moonglaze followed crowding them his body too close dont do that vyrl muttered at the lyrine he wants to protect us lily said vyrl swallowed recognizing she spoke the truth what if his rash decision to run away ended in tragedy steeling his resolve he took another step into the icy dark i cant see a blasted thing she spoke with reassurance well manage weve been through worse thats true he said it to comfort her although he had experienced bad weather up here before he had been part of a wellequipped caravan then they had simply set up envirotents and sat out the weather in comfort right now he had nothing but hispalmtop his already stuffed pack hadnt had room for much else the palmtop could do little more than tell him they were in trouble which wasnt exactly a great revelation lily tugged on his arm over here he squinted into the darkness you see something she pulled his hand forward until it hit rock this little ones but thats enough he groped along the wall with one hand drawing lily and moonglaze with him all of them faltering through the storm their progress slow snow dusted vyrls eyelashes making it hard to see and he shivered constantly despite his heavy cloak he had checked the forecast twice that afternoon it had predicted chill weather in the mountains yes but it had also claimed the night would be calm with only a dusting of snow suddenly he stumbled into an open space he regained his balance with ease never losing hold of lily or the reins mercifully the storm had quit tearing at them he drew in a ragged breath his first full one since they had dismounted you did it lily hugged him hard as if he had just performed a great feat instead of lurching about in the dark like a dolt he smiled his heart warming even if his body felt halffrozen when he pulled her close he felt her shaking its all right he said i think i know this place he drew her farther into the cave waving his hand in front of them the lyrine moved at his side a large presence in the dark his knuckles hit a wall with painful force ah grimacing he shook his hand i found the back lilys cloak rustled as she felt the wall we can wait out the storm here yes vyrl reached around for the lyrine with no success dropping his hand he brushed its back hey moonglaze is lying down although it wasnt unheard of for a lyrine it was unusual enough to startle vyrl lily turned in the small space are you well moon the lyrine nickered to her he made a wall for us she said hes going to sleep that way i think hes warming the cave although vyrl still felt cold he was no longer shivering he scratched the base of moonglazes horn although lyrine would let people ride them the animals rarely showed much affinity for humans especially the great beasts like moonglaze in rare instances a warlyrine would decide it liked a particular human though vyrl had never figured out what made them choose a person he wondered if the ruby empire biologists had tried to breed loyalty into them but it either hadnt fully taken or else millennia of genetic drift had changed its manifestation whatever the reason he was glad moonglaze accepted his company and seemed to approve of lily lily put her palms against vyrls chest in the darkness he could just make out the pale oval of her face do you think the snow will trap us here her voice quavered dont be afraid he curled his gloved fingers around hers if this is the place i think its under a shelf sticking out from the cliff it would be almost impossible for snow to block our way out it will be an adventure he bent his head and brushed his lips over hers i do so love you complete silence lily when she remained silent alarm surged in vyrl she couldnt have been hurt not in the few moments hai vyrl she murmured and i do love you too he gulped comprehending what he had done caught up in their predicament he had spoken his love aloud for the first time embarrassed he started to stutter but she put her finger against his lips rescuing him from the need to answer vyrl tugged her close and they sank down onto the rocky ground wedged between moonglaze and the wall he wrapped his cloak around them both drawing her inside the warmth but when he tried to kiss her she ducked her head lily let me he coaxed well be married tomorrow goodness be patient she stroked his cheek would you have us grapple in a cold hard blizzard instead of having a proper wedding night grappling with lily anywhere sounded just fine to vyrl but he could tell this wouldnt be right for her so he made himself say i guess not he still held her close though settling her body against his for a while they just sat listening to the storm vyrl imagined how the snow must look drifted in great blue swells eventually he said do you know snow isnt blue on other worlds lily stirred what color is it white white how dull he laughed their clouds are white too or gray people must like coming here to have good water actually the water makes them sick but why it tastes so good he kissed her temple we have nanomeds in our bodies little biological machines to deal with the impurities that turn our water blue our ancestors were engineered that way most people dont have them my mother had to receive treatments before she could live here it must be strange and wonderful to live above the sky her voice had an odd sound now as if she feared her own questions dont you ever want to go there not really not at all not at all lowering his head he slipped back the hood of her cloak and nibbled at her ear everything i want is here even if you could marry a great offworld queen ah now he understood even then her relief flowed over him she does seem awfully old he laughed i must seem awfully young to her mischief danced in lilys voice but you are so very fine especially when you are falling over after running in the plains vyrl glowered im not clumsy she snuggled closer if i tell you a secret you must promise to tell no one his interest picked up all right you arent clumsy with shyness she added the way you move is well sexy heat spread through vyrl ah lily he murmured trying to kiss her again his hands searching for a way under her clothes now you stop that she thumped him on the head behave yourself he groaned you torment me you cant tell anyone what i said all right he promised i wont let anyone know that you like me certainly they will never guess were only getting married after all even so his good spirits faded as guilt gnawed at him he owed it to lily to tell her the truth about himself lily opaline he spoke in his serious voice but then paused unsure how to continue what if his secret disgusted her she might not marry him but she had a right to know before they took such an important step she leaned her head against his shoulder youre so warm i have to tell you you should know about me have you misbehaved her laugh chimed do tell im serious he wanted to tease her to lose his worries in familiar banter but he couldnt if he didnt tell her now he wasnt sure he would have the courage later you sound somber she said he forced out the words im not normal she snorted well i know youre not normal i mean really i have never seen any boy eat as much as you do exasperated he said lily im extremely serious here you sound terribly serious she said amiably there was nothing for it but to reveal the dreadful truth i dance silence lily you do what dance he waved his arms around you know i spin and kick and jump around to music but you cant dance men dont do that i know but i do every morning i have at least three hours of class with my instructors often more oh that she laughed relief in her mood everyone knows you exercise a lot it makes you strong good with a sword yes well everyone doesnt know all of it lily i dance classical mostly but some modern and jazz what is jazz an art form from the world earth you are making fun of me no its true he stopped unable to voice his next question will you still marry me what if he repulsed her now she spoke uneasily i dont like this game it isnt a game men dont dance only women in a matteroffact voice she added and vyrl you are definitely not a woman no im not but i dance he shifted her in his arms before my mother ran for election to the assembly she was a ballet dancer men among her people perform too no one thinks them strange lily was silent again apparently he had appalled her beyond speech she kept her mind well guarded shielding the worst of her revulsion he hadnt realized she could raise mental barriers that strong finally she said ive never heard of such a thing do you hate me now hate you saints above what a thing to ask will you answer i could never hate you she sighed although sometimes you do truly drive me crazy he squinted at her you think im crazy broadie candleson told us once that he saw you spinning around like you were dancing we laughed at him i was dancing vyrl felt as if he were poised at a chasm you havent answered me silence he couldnt believe his stupidity why had he opened his fool mouth if he had never said anything and never danced again she would have never known now he had lost her because he had to make his blasted declaration lily spoke slowly you must have to hide it all the time always watching everything you say and do always do your parents know yes also my brothers and sisters but they never talk about it not outside the family his brother delkurj gave him a hard time but only in private in a family of empaths it was too obvious to everyone how much it meant to vyrl they knew how deeply it would hurt him if they ruined his joy in dancing by letting people outside the family ridicule him he could sense her pondering but the unusually strong guards around her mind made it impossible to judge how much his confession had repulsed her will you show me she asked he blinked confused show you what your dancing she relaxed against him if you have trained so much for so many years you must be very good saints above lily wasnt hiding her revulsion she didnt feel it that couldnt be true it couldnt be could it in a voice tight with his fear of rejection he asked does that mean you will still marry me she pressed her lips against his cheek i would marry you if you were a beggar in tyrole if we had to sit in the market pleading for food he tried to answer but his voice caught so instead he held her tight unable to speak uh vyrl her words came out strained i cant breathe mortified he loosened his grip hai what an idiot you fell in love with her laugh trilled rippling over him like water you are a force of nature vyrl sometimes stormy and sometimes sunny your moods changing as fast as the wind but you are most certainly never an idiot moisture threatened his eyes incredibly she had learned his darkest secret and still chose him a nicker came out of the dark something nudged vyrl and he realized the lyrine was nuzzling him its horn poking his arm he scratched its head again she still wants me he told moonglaze that night huddled against the wall of a cliff wrapped in a cloak he slept for the first time in the arms of the woman he loved he prayed it wouldnt be the last the storm had delayed their trip and tomorrow their parents would realize they had run away then the search would start bard of emeralds moonglaze loped through the meadows at the foothills of the backbone mountains the gray cliffs behind them wore cloaks of snow but down here only a few patches of melting blue remained swaying reeds sparkled in the sun topped with bubbles larger spheres dotted the meadows vibrant in blue red purple green and gold some floating off their stalks and drifting in the breeze every now and then one would pop showering the ground with glimmering rainbow dust the lyrine raced out of the hills and into the rillian vales stretching his long legs as if he would leave the ground and fly lily and vyrl held on exhilarated as fresh morning air rushed past their faces his cloak whipped back from his shoulders and rippled behind them a swath of blue in the sunshine that streamed across the land they thundered past the first villages unlike the dalvador plains where houses were whitewashed and had colored roofs here the entire structures were glowing hues blue green ruby or goldstalk although vyrl could have sought out the bard in any village he headed for rillia itself the largest city in the settled lands the bard in a small town might wonder why an unfamiliar young couple went to him rather than their own bard but in a large town with many visitors it would be more natural however going to rillia also carried risk lord rillia who ruled both the dalvador plains and rillian vales knew vyrls father as the dalvador bard vyrls father was the highest authority in the plains or at least as much an authority as their people accepted he not only served dalvador he also presided over the bards in the other plains villages but lord rillia held authority over all the bards including vyrls father the bards acted as judges and mediators performed marriages officiated at naming ceremonies and recorded the history of their people in ballads vyrls father had a glorious baritone a voice vyrl loved to hear every village also had a memory she recorded current events in her mind performed rites of celebration at festivals and served as a scholar in the womens temple where acolytes learned and stored knowledge together the memory and bard formed the government of a village this morning vyrl watched the skies constantly fearing to see a flash of goldandblack metal he had neglected to tell lily that before he had shown up at her house last night he had gone to the starport and sabotaged the shuttle lily would chide him when she found out but even so it had needed doing his tampering wouldnt hold off pursuit for long only until the port staff repaired the shuttle or the military sent down another from the ships in orbit but vyrl and lily didnt need long only today they reached the city of rillia in late morning it was large enough to need several bards none of whom vyrl had met he chose one who lived on the city outskirts in a greenstalk house that glowed like an emerald as moonglaze trotted into the courtyard lily twisted around to look up at vyrl her eyes as huge as a colt startled by a loud noise he cupped his hand around her cheek shall we go in she gave him a tremulous smile yes lets he swung off moonglaze his cloak swirling his booted feet landing with a thump on the ground then he helped lily off the powerful lyrine a towheaded boy came into the yard and waited to take moonglaze back to the glasshouse to be tended and fed vyrl gave the boy two turquoise stones for his trouble although the youth was only a few years younger than vyrl and lily he treated them as if they were adults moonglaze however nickered when the boy tried to lead him away then the lyrine nudged vyrls shoulder pushing him toward lily see vyrl grinned at her he knows she patted the animals head youre a good lyrine moon you go ahead we will be fine moonglaze snorted then shook his head and turned away he walked regally past the boy his horns held high his violet coat glossy in the sunlight the youth hurried after him and grabbed his reins trying to look as if he were leading the great lyrine instead of the other way around vyrl held his hand out to lily and she put her small one in his large grip together they walked to the bards door flames flickered within jade lamps and candles burned around the chamber filling it with radiance vyrl lily the bard and the bards wife had crowded into the circular room the memory stood by the curving emerald wall her green robe brushing the floor with her holographic memory she was recording the ceremony every word and promise and images as well vyrl stood facing lily holding her hands and gazing down at her face she filled his sight her pretty face tilted up to him a wreath of silverygreen fronds and gold bubbles braided into her hair the bard continued in his mellow voice may the love you share fill your lives and that of your children grandchildren and more keeping alive the line of your heart guided by his words vyrl and lily promised their lives to each other then the bard sang for them his lustrous tenor filling the chamber his words graceful in their evocation of love under the blue and lavender moons vyrls thoughts overflowed with lily no matter where their life took them after today he had found his home not in a place but in the heart of this girl he had loved his entire life the bard and his wife accompanied lily and vyrl into the courtyard while they waited for the boy to bring moonglaze vyrl scanned the heavens and was relieved to see nothing unusual no metallic glints just the normal lavender sky and blue clouds the bard pointed out a halffinished tower that rose above the roofs of the town the metalworks needs laborers for the new building they are raising he glanced kindly at vyrl a big strong fellow like yourself could earn a place to live meals for your family and stones for trade his wife smiled at lily the lines around her eyes crinkling theyre needing counters too always looking for a girl with a sharp mind to keep records it could be a fine start for a young couple their goodnatured concern touched vyrl we thank you kind lady and sir lily murmured similar sentiments vyrl wished they could lead the simple life these fine people envisioned for them setting up a home with no worries beyond food shelter and children perhaps when we return we will visit the metalworks boss the bard chuckled ah i am too old what newlyweds want to start work the day of their marriage eh he paused as the boy came around the house leading moonglaze then he asked where be you off to now we arent sure lily admitted were traveling moonglaze walked grandly up to them watching vyrl first with one large eye then the other turning his head to give himself a good view the lyrine growled deep in his throat what ho vyrl scratched him behind his horn are you angry with me moonglaze nickered mollified by the attention he butted lilys arm pushing her against vyrl the bard laughed then he slapped vyrl on the back off with you eh you two go have your time together my thanks good sir vyrl was pleased to find moonglaze had been well tended and the backpack was still secure in the travel bags excellent he swung up onto the animal relishing the motion his body thrumming with energy reaching down he helped lily up in front of him then he hugged her hard leaning his head around to kiss her cheek a safe journey to you the bard called up to them the bards wife started to speak then paused although vyrl couldnt pick up emotions from other people as well as he did from his family he sensed her turning over ideas much as he might glimpse a wisp of mist curling through glassstalk trees she spoke thoughtfully to her husband i have some concerns about our cabin with no one to look after it the place lies empty and unattended who knows what might happen ah so this is true the bard considered lily and vyrl up on moonglaze then again he continued as if speaking to his wife even though he was looking at his guests perhaps we may convince some nice young couple to spend a few days looking after the place vyrl hesitated his first impulse was to decline the future was too uncertain for them to take on new responsibilities but his empaths mind felt their intent like a meadow creek burbling with goodwill they were offering their secluded cabin so he and lily could spend their wedding night in safety and warmth instead of sleeping in the forest lily vyrl asked in a barely audible voice yes she murmured understanding his unspoken question vyrl nodded to the bard and his wife letting his gratitude show we would be honored gentle lady and sir to look after your cabin for a few days the woman beamed at him such good manners the bard tilted his head studying first vyrl then moonglaze a shiver of unease ran up vyrls back as he caught the mans mood the bard wondered at his visitors accomplished style and magnificent lyrine at home as a farmers son vyrl tended to forget he was the son of the dalvador bard and the queen of an imperial dynasty his background probably showed more than he realized whatever the bard thought he didnt say instead he gave vyrl directions to a cabin in the blue mountain dales deep within a wild forest of stained glass trees that spread their gembubbles over the hills vyrl thanked him and gave the couple a gold chain for the marriage service then he and lily rode into the hills headed for the cabin where they could complete the marriage that would sunder the plans of an interstellar empire flames crackled in the hearth vyrl leaned his arm against the stone mantel and stared into the shifting play of orange and red with only fire lighting the cabin shadows filled the corners handmade furniture covered with cushions warmed the room and a fourposter bed with a blueandgold quilt stood against one wall the door opened behind him and he felt more than heard lily enter her mood bathing him like sunshine he turned as she closed the door she stood watching him twisting her hands in her skirts smiling shyly a pretty girl with redgold curls tumbling around her body to her waist and tendrils curling around her face her lavender dress molded to her torso and swirled around her knees adorned with laces and slits in tempting places in the flickering light her face seemed to glow so beautiful to him that it almost hurt to see he didnt know what the morning would bring but tonight he had everything he had ever wanted lily spoke softly are you hungry saints im famished belatedly vyrl realized that wasnt the most romantic declaration an inspiration came to him for you lily laughed her melodic voice a delight hah you dont fool me you want dinner he grinned i need my strength her expression turned sultry yet with innocence he could tell she didnt realize her anticipation showed in her gaze or that it would arouse him well then she murmured let us build up your strength vyrl swallowed suddenly wondering if he wanted dinner after all he watched lily walk to the finely engraved table where he had left his pack her hips swayed with each step taking a deep breath he picked up a poker from beside the hearth and stirred the flames this high in the blue mountain dales the nights were cold it had taken the entire day to reach this cabin stars had been sparkling in an icy sky by the time they arrived hai vyrl lily admonished what did you put in this pack rocks he turned with a start to see her digging out the last of the trail rations she held up his pack in one hand and the food in the other her expression baffled reddening he strode over and hoisted away the pack its nothing it is so look it sparkles reaching past him she tugged the pack farther open see she brushed her fingers over the apparatus inside making yellow lights twinkle on its edges holos scrolled across its glossy black surface oh vyrl its lovely she beamed at him are those magic lights from your mothers people he winced knowing that when she found out what he had done she would scold him but he had to tell her the truth the symbols are from a language of my mothers people theyre warning you to stop banging the jammer jammer she took the pack away from him and peered inside whatever have you stuffed in here it hides us he explained it can trick radar sonar infrared uv visual even neutrino probes she regarded him dubiously you are making up these words im not really it means my parents will have trouble finding us lily took a moment to absorb his words i think you are very clever to hide us but are you supposed to have this it sounds she hesitated arcane arcane he tried to laugh but it came out scared rather than amused its military equipment you need a security clearance to use im not supposed to touch it her gaze widened are we in trouble not you but me yes although stealing equipment from imperial space command wasnt as bad as admitting to her that he danced it came close add to that the damage he had done to isc property at the starport and he was in it deep ah vyrl instead of rebuking him she did something even harder to deal with she came over and laid her palms on his shoulders looking up at him with trust we are together now if they take you away they must take me too resolve showed on her face where you go so do i vyrl sighed putting his arms around her i dont deserve you well thats true impudence filled her voice but nevertheless you have me he glared at her i swear you can sorely bedevil a boy her face and voice even her posture softened but you are no longer a boy my husband his chagrin vanished replaced by a more primal emotion holding her he let his mind melt into hers he could relax his defenses with her in a way he could do with no one else her mischief was a disguise behind it a nervous young woman faced her wedding night with uncertainty as well as anticipation he drew her closer forgetting the trail rations stroking her hair he savored its silky texture against his calloused palms no princes hands these but those of a farmer tentative she laid her palm on his cheek as her eyes closed he bent his head and let his lips touch hers she held a curl of his hair as she kissed him more confident in her response or so he thought until she began to pull his hair without realizing it he folded his large hand around her small one loosening her grip lily made a small sound half a sigh half a moan he kissed her deeply wishing he could lift her up and carry her to the bed a thought nudged his mind like moonglaze pushing him he could carry her off exactly the way he wished he slowly pulled away one hand splayed on her back bending he slid his arm under her legs and hefted her into his arms oh lily flushed goodness vyrl once he would have grinned maybe pulled her hair no longer he felt only tenderness tonight and a desire that he wondered how he would hold in check or if he should he carried her to the bed and laid her on the downy quilt she watched him her lips parted a rosy flush on her face the firelight dimly golden around them kneeling next to her vyrl pulled his sweater over his head as he dropped it on the ground lily reached for him her arms outstretched her expression trusting he lay next to her and his pulse jumped tingling through him it was so good finally to have her to himself as they nestled together he felt her heartbeat against his chest when he pressed his lips on the creamy skin of her neck her pulse beat there as well strong and vibrant she helped him with the laces on her dress for all that they had resisted his efforts they unraveled for her at the slightest pull he and lily explored each other while they undressed their touches sweet with the newness of discovery as they joined in the dim light from the embers of the fire together they moved in a rhythm more ancient than the ruby empire his heart overflowed he felt as if it were an airy hall filled with stained glass windows his love for lily poured like light through the windows turning many colors each window a symbol of another way he knew her the stained glass was so beautiful it hurt to imagine for he knew it could shatter under the reality of life but in this miraculous night the colors glowed within him bluecrystal shards the pounding dragged vyrl awake a booming noise bombarded his head hai he sat up groggily covers falling away from his body his eyes bleary morning light slanted through a window he hadnt even noticed last night across the room the door shook under the force of someones hammering fists lily rolled against him pulling the quilt around her shoulders seeing her that way warm and cozy in a nest of covers vyrl wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with her valdoria the bellow could have shaken a stone wall open this door you scum of a mushbog slime or ill break it down lily opened her eyes wincing that is without doubt my father with a groan vyrl grabbed his trousers off the floor and yanked them on he pulled on his shirt as he scrambled out of bed with the shirt laces untied its tails untucked and his feet bare he stumbled across the room he shot a glance at lily to urge her to cover up but she had already pulled on her dress at the door vyrl shoved out the bar that locked it and he barely had time to jump back as the door crashed open lilys burly father caul stood framed in the entrance vyrl had one instant to see lilys mother hurry by them before caul grabbed him hurled him around and slammed him against the inside wall no slimemold dishonors my daughter he roared swinging his meaty fist vyrl dodged in time to keep his face from being smashed but the blow caught his shoulder and pain shot through him although caul had neither vyrls height nor agility years of toiling on his farm had muscled the mans already husky build vyrl raised his arm up in time to block cauls next blow but then caul used his other fist to sock him heartily in the stomach vyrl grunted and doubled up with pain wrapping his arms over his abdomen lily was crying out and other voices filled the air from seemingly nowhere people crammed the small room his ears rang with the commotion suddenly caul was no longer pummeling him vyrl gasped but it was several moments before he could straighten up when he did he saw his older brothers althor and delkurj holding back the enraged farmer as hard as caul struggled he couldnt free himself althor was six feet six with a massive physique delkurj had a lankier build lean rather than bulky but he was still a good halfhead taller than vyrl and had plenty of strength caul finally gave up fighting them and glowered at vyrl as if his stare could incinerate his new soninlaw vyrl swallowed regarding his brothers thank you i wouldnt be so grateful althor said dryly youre in a load of trouble delkurj smirked at vyrl who would have guessed it i didnt think you even knew what to do with a girl vyrl scowled at him go blow del caul jerked his arms away from althor and delkurj and this time they let him go sensing his calmer state to vyrl he growled ill deal with you later behind the men lilys mother was holding her daughter she was an older plumper version of lily maternal rather than nubile still as pretty as lily seeing her vyrl could imagine his wife in twenty years and it made him love her all the more right now tears streaked lilys face making his heart ache as much as he wanted to go to her his brothers and caul had him penned in the corner from the look of lilys mother he doubted she would let him near her daughter anyway vyrl knew where lily had inherited her stubborn side althor had unhooked a palmtop from his belt and was talking into its com the house is about half a klick from where we landed the voice of eldrinson vyrls father came out of the com well be there right away caul fixed vyrl with a baleful stare if i were your father i would thrash you from here to the tyrole plains vyrl used his most respectful voice good sir i would never dishonor your daughter lily and i were married yesterday by a bard in rillia dont you give me excuses caul bellowed ill make you sorry he stopped blinking married you a prince marry the daughter of a farmer you expect me to believe that vyrl didnt think this was the best time to point out that caul was hardly treating him like a prince father its true lily was still trying to escape her mother just ask the emerald bard a deep voice spoke from the doorway apparently my emerald bard is conveniently off on a trip vyrl almost groaned as if the situation wasnt bad enough already the last person he wanted to face right now was lord rillia no make that the secondtolast person facing his father was going to be even harder hard or not however he had no choice both his father and lord rillia had entered the cabin the two men were well matched in build and coloring though lord rillia had darker hair and more height rillia was also older more austere with silver streaks in his hair and an aloof dignity that had always intimidated vyrl but when vyrl saw his fathers face he felt even worse dark circles rimmed eldrinsons eyes and lines showed that hadnt been there two days before his exhaustion seeped into the cabin sensing his fathers mind vyrl realized eldrinson had barely slept for the past two days thank the saints a woman said her voice catching vyrl turned with a start his mother roca skolia stood in the doorway her usual brightness dimmed like his father she looked as if she had been awake for much too long vyrl made himself speak i am truly sorry his mother considered him then answered gently for frightening us yes but not for running away vyrl winced living in a family of empaths had its drawbacks he couldnt deny her words as much as he regretted causing them pain he would run away again given the chance its not his fault lily said it was my idea everyone turned to her yours her father snorted i hardly think so he waved his hand at vyrl youve always had far too much sense for this boy this is his kind of fool stunt its true lily said earnestly i told vyrl i couldnt bear the thought of his marrying the queen from the sky i begged him to come with me she watched them with a wideeyed gaze really her mother sighed oh honey caul fixed vyrl with a hard look as if you hadnt caused enough trouble now you have my daughter lying vyrl met his gaze i love your daughter for trying to defend me sir but the truth is that im the one who urged her to come with me the idea was mine if a stare could have skewered a person cauls would have pierced vyrl straight through you better be telling the truth about marrying her lord rillia spoke the marriage is easily checked he considered vyrl did a memory record the ceremony yes sir vyrl realized the bard who married them must not have been the person who had revealed they were at the cabin odd that the fellow had chosen now to take a trip remembering the mans thoughtful consideration vyrl wondered if he and his wife had left deliberately to avoid having to reveal what they would rather not say your lordship vyrl began if i may ask go ahead lord rillia said how did you know we were here althor started to speak then glanced at rillia the sovereign nodded giving althor leave to continue in the balance of interstellar hierarchies vyrls family had far more power than lord rillia but here on lyshriol rillia held sway and vyrls parents treated him with the respect due that position althor turned to vyrl the ascendant finally broke through the jamming fields you set up vyrl blinked the who the ascendant a battle cruiser in the ods sensing vyrls confusion althor added in the orbital defense system roca frowned at her wayward son as opposed vyrl to the planetary defenses which includes the equipment you stole and the shuttle you damaged vyrl wondered if the military officers on the ascendant would feed him after they threw him into the brig he did his best to look repentant my apology for any difficulty i caused please lily said dont let anyone hurt him roca glanced at her new daughterinlaw her expression softening i am so sorry lily that vyrl involved you in this but why warmth radiated from lilys mind it is the most wonderful thing that could have happened sadness came from vyrls mother then i am truly sorry lily turned to vyrl her gaze questioning and uncertain even more uneasy now vyrl looked from his mother to his father eldrinson spoke quietly but in a voice that brooked no argument we have the shuttle outside we will leave now now vyrl tensed you mean lily and me no his fathers voice was firm not lily vyrl went rigid but before he could protest lord rillia addressed caul i would be pleased if you your wife and your daughter would be my guests for a few days i regret that this affair took place in my city i hope you will allow me to compensate you for your troubles caul bowed to him we would be muchly honored to stay with you your lordship wait vyrl cried everything was moving too fast i cant leave lily here his father crossed his arms you will do as we say i want no more argument vyrl protested anyway but it did no good his father and brothers marched him to the shuttle and try as he might he couldnt get past them lily strained to reach him but both of her parents were holding her back now with tears streaming down her face she called to him vyrl went wild then pounding at althor with his fists it was like hitting an immovable barrier neither his brothers nor father fought him they just held him back he felt everyones dismay no one liked tearing him and lily apart but it didnt stop them from loading him into the shuttle as the craft lifted off vyrl pressed his palms against the view screen it showed lily on the ground below her face turned up as she watched the ship rise into the sky sitting on the floor wedged in a corner vyrl pulled his legs to his chest and folded his arms on them then he dropped his forehead onto his arms and sat in silence he had come to this studio in the basement of the castle to work out but he couldnt muster the energy since his parents had taken him from the cabin this morning he hadnt even felt like speaking let alone moving he would have run into the plains but they wouldnt even let him outside the footsteps were so quiet vyrl didnt hear them until cloth rustled nearby raising his head he saw his mother a few paces away dressed in a simple jumpsuit with her hair pulled back she looked more like a farmers wife than an interstellar potentate he spoke in a low voice is devon majda still upstairs she nodded sitting gracefully on the goldstalk floor near him but the colonel who came down from the ascendant has left vyrl tried not to hide his fear will isc send me to prison no she spoke firmly but you will be expected to work at the starport until you pay off the damages you caused vyrl exhaled as much as he disliked working at the port his penalty could have been a lot worse he forced out the harder question and majda although he hadnt seen devon yet he felt the tension filling his home her voice quieted we may be able to mend the fracture between majda and the ruby dynasty but you and lily did great insult to majda vyrl had no excuses so he said nothing roca pushed her hand over her hair pulling tendrils out of the clip compared to her usual elegant demeanor now she seemed drained a split between our family and majda could destabilize the government why the ruby dynasty no longer reigns were just a bunch of farmers do you really believe that he met her gaze squarely yes his mother paused it is true that the ruby dynasty no longer rules the imperialate but we still wield a great deal of power with that comes responsibilities our actions policies and alliances have great impact on the assembly we and they are inextricably linked so is majda to us and to the assembly she brushed back the tendrils of hair curling around her face when we suffer discord it weakens the assembly and so weakens the imperialate vyrl thought of his father upstairs with devon so now we have discord with majda he knew that on an interstellar scale the union of majda and the ruby dynasty was far more important than the happiness of two young lovers but that knowledge didnt lessen the pain in his heart his mother lifted her hand as if to lay it on his arm as she had often done in his younger years offering comfort when he stiffened unable to accept her solace she lowered her arm gently she said devon is still willing to take you as consort after we annul your marriage no vyrl felt as if a cage were closing around him doesnt she know how you found me this morning roca nodded yes despite that she is willing to accept the arrangement he clenched his fists on his knees you cant annul my marriage his mother frowned young man we most certainly can you and lily are both underage even for lyshriol he scowled at her then i cant marry devon either you can with parental consent what my consent doesnt matter her anger disintegrated hai vyrl i am so sorry he blinked it was easier to be angry with his parents when they were angry with him sympathy and compassion were harder to handle in a quieter voice he said im not a political arrangement im a human being yes you are a special remarkable human being she indicated the room around them what do you see here her question baffled him and he couldnt tell from her mind what she was about the room looked the same as always large longer than wide and mirrors along one wall with a bar at waistheight his athletic bag hung on the bar the ceiling shed uniform light leaving no shadows the floor was goldstalk polished by years of use its just the dance studio he said she smiled when you children were small i practiced here everyday for some reason it affected you more than the others she indicated an area by one wall when you were a baby you would sit in your carrier there and watch me laughing and kicking your legs with the music vyrl had no idea why she was telling him this but it brought back wonderful memories he had taken his first steps in this room trying to mimic his mothers dancing which had seemed magic to him from that day on she had taught him what she knew until seven years ago when she had brought in offworld instructors including rahkil mariov he couldnt help but smile im glad you didnt tell me to stop following you around i was delighted she gave him a rueful look your father was less pleased to put it mildly but we could feel how much you loved it and he couldnt bear to deny you that suddenly he saw or thought he saw why she brought this up lily knows i dance she has accepted it a blend of emotions came from her mind relief at his news but also sadness im glad i can imagine how much that means to you but i wasnt thinking of lily she sighed youre a bright young man vyrl but in most things you have so little focus convincing you to do schoolwork is like trying to extract a tooth without benefit of modern dentistry he grimaced at the apt image school is boring i cant put my heart into it her voice softened three times in your life ive seen you pour your heart into something the results have been incredible although he felt her sincerity empathy could only tell him so much her specific meaning eluded him he indicated the studio do you mean this yes this she regarded him with a respect that startled him particularly now when he was in so much trouble i wonder if you fully realize what you do i know of few if any other dancers who have trained like you he spoke dryly given that im probably the only man on the entire planet who dances that doesnt say much i wasnt speaking of lyshriol puzzled he said but i thought you danced with the parthonia royal ballet her gaze remained steady i did her comments made no sense parthonia was a ballet company of interstellar renown didnt they train yes of course with that unrelenting compassion of hers she said but no one in their youth did what youve done a minimum of three hours a day all your life almost since you could walk and now what is it four hours five ive seen you spend the entire day dancing when you have nothing else to do its incredible he shrugged its fun in truth it was a great deal more so much a part of his life that to stop would be like trying to quit breathing but he didnt know how to put that into words roca regarded him steadily vyrl you are more than a good dancer rahkil mariov tells me you are the best he has ever worked with vyrl thought of his instructor if he only takes one student at a time he cant have worked with that many it surprised him he considered rahkil a truly gifted teacher before he came here he trained hundreds of dancers prodigies he was one of the most sought after masters his mother motioned skyward as if to encompass all settled space in his prime rahkil was also considered among the greatest male dancers in modern history vyrl could see why he had watched holos of rahkil performing he was magnificent and despite rahkils constant curmudgeonly disapproval vyrl thoroughly enjoyed his classes sometimes rahkil even forgot himself and complimented his young student but his mothers comments perplexed him if rahkil is so in demand why would he come here to teach one boy who will probably never make dance his career as soon as he spoke he saw the answer stiffening he said because im a ruby prince we didnt tell him who you were when we sent holos of you dancing vyrls anger fizzled but then why did he come she spoke with kindness because you have an incredible gift you could walk out of here today and win a place in any major dance company rahkil says you will someday surpass what he achieved in his prime vyrl gaped at her thats crazy ah vyrl her voice held a mothers pain shall you spend your life hiding this spectacular gift will you live ashamed of a talent and dedication that together could make you a legend in a profession you love more than almost anything else vyrl couldnt answer yes it hurt having to hide what he loved but lyshriol was his life all he had ever known he couldnt imagine anything else he spoke in a low voice you said you had seen me put my heart into three things dance is only one farming too i cant farm as the majda consort you could become an agriculturist a research scientist i dont want to do research i want to make my living from the land despite the betraying moisture in his eyes he found himself smiling working in the fields caring for livestock making a life out of golden days thats magic mother real magic softly he said and youve still only mentioned two things regret washed out from her mind they both knew the third dream that inspired his heart shes a lovely girl roca said in a different universe i think you and lily could have been very happy not could have been he whispered will be her voice caught i am so so very sorry with the grace he had always admired she held up her hand as if to offer him the studio we cant have all our dreams but we can have some of them vyrl struggled against the heat in his eyes he wouldnt cry not now not in front of his mother what made it so hard was that deep inside he yearned for the gift she offered the chance to follow his most secret dream even expecting it vyrl jumped when the knock came at the door he suddenly wished he hadnt chosen this chamber the circular room high in the tower when his father had asked where he would like the meeting to take place he had thought he would be calmer here but instead it felt as if his sanctuary was being invaded clenching his blueglass goblet he swirled its liquid inhaling the tangy fragrance normally his parents didnt let their children drink wine but today his father had made an exception treating him as an adult instead of a child although vyrl appreciated the gesture it didnt help he had never liked the taste of wine the knock came again taking a deep breath vyrl stood and walked across the blue chamber then he mentally steadied himself and opened the door devon stood on the landing outside instead of a uniform today she wore suede trousers and a gold shirt she even had on a gold necklace with a hawk design the emblem of majda she seemed subdued her face drawn and her eyes dark with fatigue she bowed from the waist my greetings prince havyrl so they were back to titles he nodded my greetings general majda moving aside he invited her to enter devon entered the chamber this is beautiful its calm he couldnt say more to tell her what this place meant to him would be a betrayal of a trust somehow though he wasnt sure to whom himself perhaps she waited until he sat on his bench then settled on another one nearby that curved against the wall with stiff formality vyrl spoke the words he had been practicing all day please accept my apology for my offense to majda i deeply regret any insult my actions gave your line i hope our house and yours may remain allies devon answered without delay majda accepts your apology we look forward to a fruitful alliance with the ruby dynasty vyrl exhaled there it was done so they sat when the silence grew strained devon said vyrl i in the same instant that vyrl said my father they both stopped and gave awkward laughs then devon said please go ahead my father told me what you and he discussed devon gave a tired nod perhaps it is best to do this soon instead of waiting as long as you live on lyshriol you will be she hesitated distracted he heard his bitterness by memories of my former wife devon said simply yes vyrl tightened his grip on his goblet so lets just marry off the recalcitrant groom now and get the whole business over with she shifted on the bench i am sorry you see it that way everyone is sorry he looked out the window trying to hide the pain he knew showed on his face lady devon you should marry the man you love not me startled tension snapped in her voice what are you talking about vyrl turned to see her sitting rigidly gripping the edge of the bench he said the handsome man with the dark hair and eyes she seemed to close up i have no idea what you mean i saw him in your mind for a long moment she remained silent just when he thought he had made a fool of himself with his assumption she spoke quietly if the matriarch of majda were to marry a commoner it would be a great scandal an outrage she would be stripped of her title and her authority nor would the children of any such union be considered majda heirs gods what could he say he and devon each had their duty and love had no place in it what did it matter if they died inside a little more every day as long as the pillars of the imperialate remained strong devon gentled her voice vyrl i wont ask for anything you arent ready to give we can live at whichever of my estates you prefer and you will have advisors people to help you learn your new role no one expects a youth your age to manage a palace with a staff of many hundreds you will have time to adjust adjust vyrl felt as if he were caught in a nightmare that kept going he would never wake up she spoke carefully it is true that majda has certain expectations for your behavior but this isnt the ruby empire those days are long in our past i dont expect you to stay in seclusion or cover yourself in robes you are free to pursue your interests if that was meant to reassure him it had the opposite effect what do you mean expectations for my behavior you will be a highly placed member of the imperial court certain protocols are required vyrl finished his wine with a long swallow trying to wash away the bitter images yes he knew court protocol he couldnt imagine living that constrained lifestyle always under scrutiny by the noble houses caught in their webs of intrigue and regardless of what devon promised about modernday freedoms he knew he would be viewed and treated as her possession he stared at his empty goblet then he lifted it and let the glass drop it shattered on the tiles blue crystal shards scattering everywhere that is what you will do to me if you make me leave here when devon stiffened he feared he had gone too far and destroyed the long hours of conciliation his parents had spent repairing the rift he had created what was wrong with him he had nothing to accomplish by antagonizing the person he would spend the rest of his life with but if this was any sample of their future he didnt see how he could bear it devon stared at the broken glass strewn across the floor then she braced her hands against her knees i cant do this i feel like a monster do what i dont understand she turned to him the betrothal it was his turn to go rigid surely he misunderstood his heart hearing what his brain knew was false what do you mean she took a long breath i cant force a child to become my consort against his will although she watched him with a guarded expression there was no mistaking the pain that came from her mind if you choose to end this arrangement i will accept your decision without rancor to your family vyrls heart lurched you mean i could stay married to lily devon exhaled yes yes yes he almost shouted it but he managed to hold back his exuberance aware of the insult it would add to the injury he had already done majda devon continued in her throaty voice but vyrl before you decide consider this if you choose to stay here you will never realize your dreams his joy crashed down again he told himself it was only his fear that she would withdraw her offer that was true in part but he longed for the freedom to dance to perform to explore the limits of his ability and to do it without shame or guilt admired instead of scorned the dream tempted him like a siren call a small cleaning droid whirred through the doorway it nosed around the shards of glass then began to vacuum them into its interior ive seen holos of your dancing devon said vyrl froze who showed you your teacher rahkil mariov he wanted to sink into the floor and let the droid vacuum him up too i hope it didnt offend you offend me incredulity washed across her face you really have no idea how you look do you yes i do i work out facing the mirror it showed every mistake again and again until he fixed the problem she spoke slowly i have often wondered what it does to a person to stare for hours into a mirror for the sole purpose of finding flaws your dancing seems a cruel art but it isnt he didnt know how to describe what was intuition for him it can be frustrating but when you see improvement its magic magic yes for the first time since she had entered the room her face warmed with a smile when you dance it is extraordinary mesmerizing with your gifts and your spectacular looks you could have an empire at your feet in her throaty compelling voice she added i can give that to you vyrl stared at her unable to respond he could barely imagine people tolerating his dancing yet devon promised him an empire of all the inducements majda could have offered she had chosen the single one that made a difference devon stood up ill wait downstairs take as long as you need to decide after she left vyrl pulled up his knee rested his elbow on it and gazed out at the rippling plains today his tower chamber offered no serenity he could have what he wanted lily and a farm but it would weaken crucial alliances built on the expectation of his marriage to devon nor could he perform if he accepted the marriage he would lose lily and lyshriol but he wouldnt have to give up farming completely and he could have the dance career he craved one almost beyond his imaginings the droid whirred around his feet cleaning up the last shards hiding the broken pieces inside itself once again the chamber was spotless and smooth like a polished box a tear gathered in vyrls eye and slid down his cheek he knew the decision he had to make he went to the door and descended the stairs headed toward majda maybe he could never escape the pain but he could hide it inside dreams vyrl tried the combination of steps again studying his technique in the mirror as he skimmed across the floor his reflection showed a young man with long legs and redgold curls in black pants and a black pullover all soaked with sweat frowning he tried the steps yet another time pah no wonder he kept stumbling on the last jump he was leaning to the side almost imperceptibly but enough to throw off his balance are you going to glare at yourself all day a voice drawled from the doorway vyrl refocused on the mirror looking at the reflection of the doorway his brother delkurj stood there resting his lanky self against the frame his arms crossed vyrl glowered at him via the mirror but he decided to be civil for all that delkurj could be a bogboil he had been remarkably decent lately even showing sympathy for his younger brothers melancholy vyrl turned to him has the broadcast started yet del nodded in the hearth room vyrl felt as if a lump was lodged in his throat the meditative calm of his dancing vanished he cleaned up and changed into trousers and a white shirt then followed del upstairs his siblings were already gathered around the hearth althor in an armchair his large size and selfassurance dominating the room chaniece fraternal twin to delkurj poised and regal gold hair spilling over her arms thirteenyearold soz with wild dark curls busily taking apart althors laser carbine trying to figure out how it worked twelveyearold denric smaller than his brothers with a mop of yellow curls and violet eyes eightyearold aniece also darkhaired small and pretty curled on a sofa by their mother and fouryearold kelric a strapping toddler with gold curls gold eyes and the kind of heartbreakingly angelic face that only beautiful young children could have their father was sitting in a large armchair his booted legs stretched across the carpet only tenyearold shannon was missing seeing his family together knowing this would soon all change for him vyrl wanted to hold this moment close like a treasure within a box he would miss them more than he knew how to say delkurj dropped onto the sofa next to chaniece and sprawled out his long legs on the other couch soz eyed vyrl dubiously as if she hadnt decided yet whether or not brothers qualified as human but then she moved over making room for him vyrl sat down with soz on one side and althor on the other as he settled in the room lights dimmed got dark kelric stated so it did roca picked up the small boy and put him in her lap a newsholo formed around the hearth encompassing the entire area it unsettled vyrl he suddenly seemed to be sitting in a balcony of the assembly hall on the planet parthonia hundreds of men and women packed the amphitheater rank upon rank of interstellar leaders dignitaries diplomats military officers and newscasters in the past vyrl had never had much interest in such broadcasts nor had he paid enough attention to his physics to understand how this transmission came to lyshriol many lightyears away except that the technology bypassed spacetime making light speed limitations irrelevant after a moment vyrl located devon she was standing on a dais in the center of the amphitheater by a podium seeing her he felt the proverbial shimmerflies in his stomach she made an impressive sight resplendent in her dress uniform tall and strong like an ancient warrior queen from the ruby empire people surrounded her aides and dignitaries more were seated at consoles below the dais probably minor clerks recording the assembly session an unfamiliar woman was speaking at the podium and many people in the amphitheater were talking as well it seemed like bedlam to vyrl but perhaps the meeting had an organization he didnt see finally the speaker finished and moved aside glancing at devon the general nodded to her then stepped up to the podium as devon tapped the com the newscasters zoomed in so that instead of being in a balcony vyrl abruptly found his virtual self only a few meters from devon it gave him vertigo suddenly vyrl froze at a console across the dais a darkhaired man was talking into a com heat spread in vyrls face he knew that man he had seen him in devons mind vyrl leaned toward althor and spoke in low tones trying to sound nonchalant do you know who that man is the one with the gray sweater and dark hair i havent a clue althor said why i just wondered althor pulled off his palmtop and flipped it open while althor worked vyrl watched people argue and yell in the assembly session after a moment althor spoke discreetly his name is ty collier when vyrl turned to him althor added hes a recorder for the imperial library thats it devon was in love with a clerk vyrl had expected more but perhaps that wasnt fair to collier althor gave him an odd look do you know him vyrl avoided his gaze i thought he looked familiar but i was wrong he could tell althor didnt believe him but his brother didnt push vyrl wondered how he would feel if he met collier right now devon showed no sign she even knew ty sat a few meters from where she stood when devon began to speak the amphitheater went silent vyrl could almost feel people leaning forward her throaty voice rolled over the audience a great deal of speculation has occurred in regard to my marital state she stopped while more newscasters zoomed in ty collier had stopped working and was watching her with poorly disguised pain rather than let rumors proliferate devon continued i have prepared a statement she paused it is true that i plan to marry what the hell vyrls father said the ruby dynasty and house of majda have long been allies devon continued strengthening ties between our houses offers many advantages to the assembly and its governing bodies she raised her head surveying the amphitheater the house of majda honors the ruby dynasty we esteem the imperial line and welcome the idea of joining our houses through the majda matriarch and a ruby prince vyrl felt blood drain from his face no no this couldnt be happening she told me she would accept my decision she gave me her word his father spoke tightly she certainly did we all heard her lights glittered as newscasters recorded devons next words and it may be that someday such a joining will grace our house if my sister corejida majda so wills corey vyrls mother said what the blazes voices rumbled in the assembly hall and devon paused waiting for them to quiet eldrinson gave his wife a puzzled look have we spoken to corey majda not that i know of roca spread her hands in a shrug then quickly brought them back to keep kelric from falling off her lap ive no idea what devon is about devon has a sister vyrl asked his mother nodded two sisters corey and naaj corey is next in line shes ten years younger than devon maybe shes making corey her heir althor said she has to do something or she will lose power within her house devon was speaking again a young man once told me something i found true words with a wisdom well beyond his age for all that our dreams bring meaning to our lives we cannot have them all what we give up may cause regret even grief but we must find a balance we can bear otherwise our hearts will shatter vyrl gaped at her she had just repeated the words he had spoken when he told her that he couldnt become the majda consort devon had an odd look now as if she were about to jump off a precipice in this matter of balance i too must choose her voice carried throughout the amphitheater for that reason i am abdicating my position as the majda matriarch gods alflamingmighty vyrls mother said has she gone mad eldrinson demanded the newscasters exploded with questions vyrl couldnt sort them out the session had turned into such a tumult devon stood calmly waiting for the clamor to subside why would she abdicate roca said corey is next in line eldrinson said saints roca shes making corey the matriarch thats what she meant corey said kelric snuggled against his mother vyrl absorbed devons words abdication it would create a far bigger furor than his refusing the marriage had he caused this when he had spoken with devon it had seemed everything would be all right had her house demanded she abdicate because her betrothal fell through that made no sense devon was a force to reckon with they couldnt just make her abdicate besides which she could arrange another marriage if not with the ruby dynasty then with a man from another noble house as the amphitheater quieted devon resumed her speech i do not make this decision lightly i have considered it for years then she held out her hand to ty collier in front of an audience spread across interstellar space she asked him will you join me ty stared at her with undisguised astonishment apparently the news had surprised him as much as everyone else when devon gave him an encouraging smile he visibly shook himself then he rose to his feet his movements uncertain as if he wasnt sure what to do but he didnt hesitate he climbed the dais and went to devon taking her hand he stood side by side with the general at the podium devon spoke into the com marriages of nobles and commoners are not unheard of among the houses but such has never been permitted for the matriarch dryly she added especially not majda still holding tys hand she said i cannot marry a commoner and retain my title so i release the title abdicating to my sister corejida majda exclamations burst out in the hall cries people calling out questions a rare serenity lightened devons face and ty stood with her looking dazed but happy vyrl had never heard of such a powerful sovereign giving up her title for love no doubt holobooks would be written about devon and ty scholarly treatises published holomovies produced beneath the din althor spoke to vyrl in a low voice you knew didnt you vyrl shook his head not that she intended this just about the man she thought about him a lot the lights suddenly came up in the hearth room jarring and bright blinking vyrl looked around his tenyearold brother shannon had wandered into the room im hungry shannon announced roca made an exasperated noise shannon where have you been with moonglaze i missed him vyrl sat up straighter moonglaze is back lilys family had agreed to bring the lyrine home with them after their stay with lord rillia if moonglaze had returned he realized everyone was watching him his father smiled go on son vyrl jumped up knocking althors arm off the chair he mumbled an apology then strode from the room within moments he was outside running through the winding streets of dalvador his feet pounded the blue cobblestones as he sped along the familiar route when he was halfway up the last hill someone came out of a house at the top and ran down toward him her redgold hair flying about her body and her blue dress whipping around her legs they collided in the middle of the street vyrl threw his arms around her hugging as hard as he could until she gasped for breath he pulled her into a kiss uncaring of the pedestrians around them lily was crying and laughing trying to talk and kiss him at the same time eventually they calmed down enough just to hold each other vyrl stroked her curls off her tearstained cheeks its so good to see you she took his face in her hands your fathers runner reached us in rillia he told us you werent going with the sky queen ill never go away never lily for all that he would always wonder what he had given up he could live with that loss he couldnt live without lily he touched her cheek my parents say that if we want we can live with them until we are ready to run our own farm but they will help us no matter what we decide she ran her hand over his arm as if marveling that he was real i dont think i would like to live with parents i neither he spoke earnestly but even with their help setting up the farm will be a lot of work and i must finish my schooling that was the only way they would let me stay married to you we can manage her mood shone with optimism lord rillia gave my father three lyrine and many crop cuttings as compensation my father says you and i can have it all to help us start out vyrl blinked your father said that she laughed softly actually what he said was if you intend to stay with the damn fool boy you better take this because youll need as much help as you can get dryly vyrl said that sounds more like your father he likes you really hes just worried about us vyrl pulled her close ill make you a good husband lily i swear he finally became aware that other pedestrians were watching them his parents were a few nouses farther along the road talking with lilys parents taking lilys hand vyrl drew her off the lane into an alley between two houses where a bubble tree hid them from view as they brushed the tree one of its bubbles detached and floated into the air then vyrl took his wife into his arms epilogue light sifted from the hall into the darkened bedroom vyrl stood with lily in the doorway watching their two youngest children toddlers of two and three sleeping on the downy bed theyre so sweet when theyre asleep lily whispered vyrl laughed quietly so he didnt wake the boys and terrors when theyre awake theyre angels she admonished when he didnt look suitably chastised she tickled him vyrl picked her up and swung her away from the door with lily struggling not to laugh or make noise it amazed him how light she felt he had kept growing after their marriage and his shoulders had broadened even more now at nineteen he had reached his full height of six feet two he set her down outside their daughters bedroom and they peered in at the fouryearold snuggled under her quilt then as quiet as mumblemice they walked into the living room of the farmhouse their families had helped them build rugs warmed the floor hangings brightened the walls and bubble plants in pots added touches of color lily tugged vyrl toward their bedroom but he shook his head i need to study he suddenly felt heavy sometimes the weight of his responsibilities seemed to sink into him he was so often tired working the farm raising the children and keeping up his studies even having delayed his entrance into parthonia university until this year he didnt feel ready if their families hadnt helped so much he didnt know how he and lily would have managed she laid her hand on his arm dont worry everything will be fine vyrl smiled at her dont worry how often youve said that to me and how often youve been right she made him want to dance he had less time to work out now but he managed to keep up his training with rahkil that he and lily had two sets of parents happy to spend time with their grandchildren meant more than he knew how to say it gave lily time to learn more about the farm while vyrl studied it astonished him that lily was so good at running the farm she could do sums faster in her head than he could on his palmtop but as much as he worried about his university work he liked the challenge lily settled him and now that he could pursue his own interests in agriculture and biology it was easier to concentrate on the subjects he dreaded and no matter how much the children exhausted him he loved them so much that sometimes he thought he would burst with it perhaps someday many years down the road he could think of dancing beyond lyshriol but until then this was more than enough vyrl pulled lily into his arms dance with me always she murmured they twirled around the living room moving to music they heard in their minds and vyrls heart filled with the stained glass colors of joy skin deep by deb stover after two years nick riley still wasnt used to the clean white fluffy kingdom sure the pearly gates and golden thrones were nice but he was a thirdclass resident stuck on the lower levels of heaven until he proved himself how the hell am i supposed to prove myself your language is more like a truckers than a lawyers though id rather deal with a trucker than a lawyer any day nick looked around for his evervigilant watchdog séamus a former new york city cop overblown with selfimportance as chief of the mortal watch division séamus crossed his arms over his chest and wore a stern expression on his notsoangelic face two years and still cant mind your tongue my father was a marine before he was a real estate tycoon i probably learned to cuss before i learned to walk nick shrugged and pointed at the monitor i saw margo again she doesnt look any happier séamus sighed dramatically of course she isnt nick didnt argue how could he she didnt love me but i made her think she did you were too busy trying to win at everything séamus said his tone filled with disapproval well you won margo yeah and now shes alone down there and youre up here though i still cant figure out how you slipped through the gates i wish i could go back and fix things for her nick meant every word he regretted his selfish shortsighted lifestyle and shortlived maybe you can he glowered at his superior chief dont believe me it wasnt my idea séamus looked upward for emphasis a higher authority wants you to go back and help margo get on with her life nicks thoughts exploded with possibilities return to fast cars expensive vacations and séamus cleared his throat i keep forgetting you can read my mind nick said sheepishly and glanced at the monitor again tell me more when now but only to help margo what will she think i mean seeing me séamus grinned a mischievous twinkle glittered in his eyes she wont see you youll have a different appearance now that had possibilities hed always wanted to be taller im ready what are we waiting for close your eyes nick obeyed but he saw images anyway similar to when hed died first thered been the car crashing into the brick retaining wall pain blackness then bright lights a tunnel and images of people and places hed known after the pain it had all been rather pleasant until he saw margos misery soon hed see her in person could tell her he was sorry a chorus of male voices greeted nicks arrival in the sauna at his favorite health club at least séamus had seen fit to send him somewhere hed enjoyed when he was alive but he didnt feel right something was different missing and new nick glanced down at what he thought was his body but it couldnt be séamus wouldnt have did you catch the playoffs last week a gruff male voice interrupted nicks thoughts blinking in the steamy environment nick tried to discern the identity of the other occupants the last thing he needed was for someone to recognize nick riley with boobs nick pulled the towel up from his waist to cover his chest an area of his anatomy hed never seen a need to conceal before séamus if you werent already dead id kill you myself he muttered is that my voice that silken drawl couldnt be his who what a familiar voice sliced through the steam hey this is the mens sauna nick tried to make out the face through the steam that had to be his former law partners voice warren is that you theres that weird voice again whistling filled the small tiled area hey warren one man yelled does your wife know about her dont be ridiculous warren growled lady you should go to the womens sauna before you cause any more trouble uh right nick agreed in his new timbre a woman séamus had sent him back as a woman what a sick sense of humor he clutched the towel across his voluptuous chest and beat a hasty retreat knowing his lower extremeties such as they were and werent were uncovered feeling more exposed and vulnerable than he had in all his life nick jogged through the blessedly vacant mens locker room down the corridor and into the ladies facility stunned he stood frozen in the center of the once forbidden sanctuary women of all assorted shapes and sizes walked around in various stages of undress now this is heaven then he caught sight of the most gorgeous redhead hed ever seen a natural redhead she was built like a tall marilyn monroe with shapely legs he wouldve given almost anything to feel wrapped around his body in a clinch of whoa perspiring he lifted his hand to touch the reflection his reflection nick riley was a dropdead brick shithouse babe i cant believe i let you talk me into this margo riley sank even lower in her chair at center stage any moment now the runway in front of her would fill with nearly naked sweaty men what in the world had possessed her steph giggled and drained the contents of her glass admit it sis she said youve always wanted to do this now you have an excuse unconvinced margo shook her head and took another sip of club soda maybe she should have ordered something stronger anything to take her mind off where she was and what was about to happen this is so crude steph ordered two more drinks from the passing waiter hey cmon margo its a story this is work your job remember simultaneously nodding and grimacing margo looked up at the still empty stage i always wondered what men saw in watching naked women undulate their bodies in places like this she shrugged now i guess ill find out sort of steph paid the waiter and pushed a drink that looked suspiciously unlike club soda toward her sister maybe it was the fruit and little umbrella that gave it away just imagine what momll think steph whispered with a wink margo sucked in her breath you wouldnt dare steph arched her delicate blond eyebrows and pursed her full lips in a feigned pout the innocent look vanished as quickly as it had appeared maybe maybe not wrinkling her nose at her sister margo took a tentative sip of the tropical drink after removing the paper umbrella she took a second taste and nodded in satisfaction not bad what is it something yummy steph flashed her a grin so what made that old prude boss of yours give you such a sweet assignment sweet is a matter of opinion i suppose margo sighed and leaned back in her chair i know what he wants for this story but id rather tackle a more important issue steph covered her face not the first amendment why not write about the guys especially if thats what your editor wants and the reason women like to come here she looked around the nightclub in case you havent noticed the place is packed margo glanced around amazed to discover that every table in the club was taken i had no idea thats my point and ill bet it was your editors too steph said in her sarcastic getalife voice she leaned forward elbows on the table a shock of blond curls fell across her forehead women come here for one reason to look at hunks take notes journalist stunned margo studied her sisters expression what makes you such an expert steph reddened laughing ive been here lots of times no yeah its fun its embarrassing margo whispered looking around again why were so many women here she bristled hating to admit her sister was right okay so theres a story here but thats all it is to me shrugging steph pointed to the stage showtime margo moaned in selfchastisement how had she gotten herself into this mess she should have suggested that her new editor take the assignment himself though looking like ernest borgnine might have been a liability in the studfinder here we go steph whooped and cheered with the other insane women while margo groaned again music with a heavy disco beat reverberated through the small club varicolored lights rotated and flashed as the emcee announced the first performer good evening ladies and welcome to the studfinder he said dramatically and i guarantee you will find more than a few studs the women roared with laughter and applause a few wolf whistles rose above the din now get ready for tarzan tarzan the ultimate male domination fantasy margo suppressed a shudder of revulsion its a story get a grip removing a notepad from her purse she leaned back and started writing down everything she saw heard felt in the dim room this was freedom of speech and expression in action she had to remain focused if people wanted to watch exotic dancers of either gender that was their business government had no business dictating morals satisfied shed found the proper mindset for this assignment margo glanced up at the stage oh my god a man an almost naked one stood directly in front of her smiling very slowly his hips undulated to the music displaying his wellendowed physique in intricate detail he wore only an exotic leopard print breechcloth oh my god you said that already youll be all right sis steph squeezed margos hand in reassurance him tarzan you jane chill margo averted her gaze from the grinning god and jerked the umbrella and fruit from another drink she drained the contents in one smooth gulp refusing to look again at the wriggling pulsating male in front of her whyd we have to sit so close steph for your story of course ignoring her sisters laughter margo turned her attention back to her notepad she made more notations about the subject in the breechcloth leaving out certain details regarding his anatomy her editor wouldnt consider that newsworthy though margo couldnt help wondering if perhaps the guinness book of records might be interested the dancer released what could only be described as a tarzan yell one that would have had cheetah jane and boy running to the rescue whoa baby her sisters reaction made margo look up god how she wished she hadnt the man chose that particular moment to shed most of his skimpy attire leaving only a gstring between the ogling women and his family jewels the crowd went wild margo went into shock im out of here this is disgusting she stood and the contents of her open purse rolled onto the floor damn the dancer seemed to think her upright position had other implications he moved closer to their table lowering himself in front of her until his pelvis was within reach steph obviously far more astute than margo in such situations rose to the occasion she held a folded bill toward the man and deftly tucked it into his gstring still staring in horror margo tried to swallow but her throat was too dry you need another drink sis steph calmly suggested as the music faded and tarzan returned to his jungle the waiter made rounds during the brief intermission uncertain how or when margo found her spilled belongings back in her purse and herself back in her chair with another drink immediately removing the fruit she sipped steadily some of her tension vanished beneath the heady power of demon rum her limbs felt warm and heavy this was better much better when the music again increased in volume margo was still uncertain why women paid money to be embarrassed like this but she was considerably more willing now to investigate the possibilities the alcohol had numbed her somewhat and loosened her inhibitions which was probably why she rarely imbibed steph had always accused her of being a control freak this is the show with the eroticops its great i heard they have fresh meat er dancers steph sighed dramatically if all cops looked like these guys id run stop signs on a regular basis eroticops steph seemed awfully familiar with the studfinders performers just how often did she come here margo cast her sister a cursory frown just as the lights dimmed again the announcer along with police sirens and flashing red and blue lights signaled the beginning of the next set pencil and paper readied she looked across the table at her sister whered they find him steph asked in undeniable awe curious margo sought the catalyst for her sisters reaction and spotted him instantly her pencil fell from her grasp and rolled impotently across the table her notepad dangled unproductively from the fingertips of her left hand this man was built even better than his predecessor and at the moment he was still fully clothed a blue policemans uniform hugged every bulge and hollow of his body to perfection the bill of his hat shadowed part of his face and eyes dark hair curled at his temples and neckline for some imprudent reason she wanted to know what color his eyes were she felt her sisters gaze on her and jerked her attention away from the man on the stage but only for a moment a very brief moment nice huh steph asked in that infuriating way she had of knowing what someone else was thinking four other police officers joined the first flanking him in pairs to mimic his seductive movements margo could only nod despite her best intentions she turned her gaze back to the stage discovering that the lead dancer had moved to the front of the runway and seemed to be dancing just for her in your dreams silly his stare never left her as he gyrated his hips and bent his knees lowering himself for her inspection her face was hot and the rest of her body wasnt exactly cool come to think of it the man still hadnt removed any of his costume even though hed been on stage for several minutes some members of the audience were suggesting loudly that he should proceed as expected after all the other four men in uniform had already shed most of their attire for some unexplainable reason margo wanted to see what this beefcake looked like unwrapped flustered she reached for her glass and drained the contents her head swam as he tossed his hat into her lap in one smooth motion the smile he broadcasted was deadly and familiar margo couldnt speak it couldnt be he peeled away his shirt and now wore nothing but his trousers she swallowed hard unable unwilling to drag her gaze from the mesmerizing specimen on the stage she had to know much to her dismay he blew her a kiss it headed straight for her as if it had dna and free will planting itself right on her lips she felt it really she did a strange fluttering sensation commenced in her belly and spread she stole a peek at steph her sister was riveted as were the other women in the audience margo glanced quickly around the room but her gaze was lured back to the dancing figure as if her optic nerves had a homing device a blue spotlight suddenly bathed him illuminating his features clearly realization hit home with trembling fingers she retrieved her pencil and made notes though she knew her scribbles wouldnt make any sense later jared why now after all this time she felt his gaze boring into her as he danced and swayed on the stage he must have recognized her too commanding herself not to look she bent her head over the tablet scratching away as his shadow passed to and fro across the table amid the flashing lights oh but she wanted to look the hammering in her chest was almost as distracting as the heat inside her body shed gone two years without even wanting a man let alone acting on it a trickle of guilt filtered through her but her natural instincts overshadowed it had jared removed anything else she had to know just one little peek garbed in nothing but a light blue metallic loincloth he thrust his hips toward her in a timeless movement that never went out of style and never would heat suffused her but she couldnt tear her attention from his gorgeous glistening and god help her achingly familiar body dark hair fell across his forehead in disarray his jaw was square and strong of course she didnt have to see his eyes to know they were blue see mar go this is what happens when youre celibate for two years of course her reaction was reserved for this man and only this man she drew a deep breath trying to ignore the twisting squirming dazzling male displayed for her simultaneous pleasure and torture but she couldnt lifting her gaze she found him staring he gave her a slow sexy smile when their gazes met oh yeah he definitely recognized her it was magic just like in the movies this is a raid vaguely aware of chaos erupting all around her margo watched jared retrieve his discarded clothing much more quickly than hed jettisoned the garments oh this must be part of the show she whispered suddenly wishing shed skipped the third tropical drink she giggled at the absurdity of her situation but jared appeared at her side and gripped her elbow turning her knees to rubber after all this time and everything that had happened here he was touching her you dont know me he whispered through clenched teeth wha he tightened his grip and leaned closer no matter what happens you dont know me she met his gaze searching for answers to questions left unasked since college for now thanks i owe you and margo knew exactly how she would exact payment her boss wanted an interview with a male stripper well now there was no doubt in her mind who would grant her that interview yes you do another uniformed man definitely lacking a strippers physique approached them youll both have to come downtown with downtown margo blinked when they started toward the front entrance are we under arrest i thought this was just part of the show not hardly the officer said shaking his head margo glanced at her sister who was being politely but firmly escorted to the door by a pair of uniformed officers with a sigh the apparently legitimate police officer gripped margo and jared by the elbows and escorted them through the door outside with both of you suits me i seem to have worked up a little sweat jared shot margo a lethal smile one that rivaled the wattage of the parking lot lights yeah ill say margos gaze dipped to the open vee of his unbuttoned shirt if he expected her to act like she didnt know him then she would treat him the same way any other patron at the studfinder might as a side of meat prime of course swaying slightly when the officer stepped from between them and released her arm margo clutched jareds muscular forearm for support he was without a doubt the most wellconstructed male shed ever encountered of course he always had been despite his incredible physique she still had trouble believing hed chosen exotic dancing as his career not jared carson even so she remembered that hed studied broadway jazz in college apparently hed found a use for that talent the chilly evening air was like a bucket of ice water on her rumblurred senses she squinted looking around for steph in the parking lot menagerie suspicion nudged its way into the foggy semidrunken fringes of her mind are you really arresting me margo asked her mouth dry and sticky not unless you give me a good reason the policeman pushed his hat back on his head then nodded toward her companion the dogs are going in dogs drugs maybe there was another angle to this story after all she fished through her purse until she found her wayward pencil and opened her steno pad to make a few notes what reason do you have for believing there are drugs at the studfinder officer the man released an exasperated sigh a reporter i shouldve known he shook his head and aimed his thumb over his shoulder youre all going downtown until we finish searching the place then there may be some questions thats all i know margo shot jared a questioning look but he was staring beyond her his expression intense a muscle twitching in his jaw just the way she remembered when his gaze met hers a mask dropped neatly into place and another dark curl fell across his forehead he smiled but it didnt reach his eyes a stage smile but why now more important why for her still his grin waged a fullscale attack against her composure and almost won why couldnt he be a little less handsome and a lot less memorable im sure youll be out so fast youll hardly have time to read the graffiti in your cell the policeman said in a mocking tone we usually dont hold you yuppies long pencil poised in midair margo swallowed hard cell just kidding lighten up hey margo you got the cute one way to go sis groaning as her sister was escorted away margo rubbed her eyes with thumb and forefinger moms going to kill me when she hears about this the policeman chuckled she looks old enough to drink shaking her head in selfloathing margo released a sigh of surrender arrest me officer lets get this over with chuckling again he led her and jared to a car passing two women singing i am woman at the top of their lungs they were being dragged down to the police station and there was more to this than a night of exotic dancing she could use this situation to her advantage margo tried to stay close to the door as the car rolled out of the parking lot though knowing jared sat mere inches away made it difficult to concentrate until she found out exactly what was going on it might be better if she maintained a safe distance she turned her attention to scratching a few more notes about the atmosphere the way it felt to be incarcerated in the back of a squad car though not under arrest and trying to ignore the heat of jareds gaze as he sat staring at her through the darkness heaven help me not a moment too soon the officer parked behind the police station they climbed out of the car and went through the rear entrance in better times margo had used the front entrance she was mortified though she reminded herself they werent being arrested it could be worse much worse in the bright squad room light she couldnt help noticing that the other women from the studfinder looked quite ordinary they looked like mothers i want to call my attorney she said quietly the rums numbing effect abandoning her i already did that steph said from across the room there you are margo breathed a sigh of relief you and your bright ideas about how to do my job thanks a lot steph flashed her a sheepish grin as margo slumped into a chair beside her with difficulty she ignored jareds eyes on her from across the room none of this made sense the jared shed once known and loved would never have put on the show shed witnessed this evening and what a show her face heated at the memory of his bare skin rippling beneath the flashing lights with a sigh she planted her chin in her hands and peeked at steph from the corner of her eye grateful her family had never met jared in person you called warren then steph nodded yeah but hes out of town of course hes out of town margo straightened and allowed her head to hit the wall with a soft thud the perfect finale to a perfect day i wish nick margo smiled sadly when her sister left her comment unfinished if nick were alive hed have had them out of here by now i know me too theyre sending a new junior partner to spring us oh that figures margo sighed again physically mentally and emotionally drained whos in charge here a feminine voice demanded from the doorway glancing up at the redheaded woman margo noted she was welldressed and built like marilyn monroe i am the officer at the desk looked up at the newcomer may i help you maam the woman grimaced slightly then smiled im raquel eastwood from riley and gray i mean warren graysons office oh thank goodness youre here steph stood and grabbed the womans hands in both her own can you get us out of here done the womans smile took margo aback and there was something about her eyes so were free to go margo asked rising to stand beside steph ms eastwood nodded and snapped her fingers you bet i have a couple of forms to sign then were out of here there were others margo began her gaze inexorably drawn to jareds slouched figure against the other wall his expression was so intense it stole her breath she needed to talk to him to learn why he was here and why hed been at the studfinder somehow she sensed he wouldnt welcome her questions now and she needed a hot bath and a couple of aspirin maybe more than a couple but there was a story here more of one than shed originally thought jared knew something frowning she dragged her gaze from jared to ask the attorney something but ms eastwood was staring at jared too of course she was jared was the kind of man any woman would ogle and he wasnt margos anymore she had no right to feel jealous but she did i guess youve all had enough excitement for one night jared said with a chuckle gaining margos immediate attention the expression in his eyes was no longer intense nor was it for her alone again the mask was in place what was his game narrowing her eyes she reminded herself that no one else here knew who he was hed shushed her back at the studfinder for now she would play along however she reserved the right to collect payment later for keeping his secret excitement her voice dripped sarcasm and she mentally patted herself on the back when his eyebrow arched ever so slightly the only exciting thing that happened this evening was watching you parade around in front of a bunch of screaming women halfnaked more than half ill say steph said ms eastwood shook her head slowly her gaze riveted to jared another surprise she cast a sidelong glance at margo after margo and steph finished answering a few questions about the studfinder and signing some papers the attorney offered to drive them home they walked by jared who stood and flashed them his stage smile again nice meeting you ladies very nice steph giggled shake it dont break it man ms eastwood said in a sultry tone margo couldnt prevent herself from giggling along with steph though her reasons were far different from her sisters shed only known one person who wouldve had the guts to say something like that to jared carson and he was dead jareds eyes sparked and one corner of his mouth quirked upward lawyers who needs em he turned his gaze on margo reporters lawyers and women hey watch it buster raquel placed one hand on her curvy hip margos a reporter anything for a story the expression on jareds face now could only be called a smirk margo elevated her chin and took a deep breath sensing this was part of his secretive role you bet she noted a wink of approval from ms eastwood just how had warrens new partner known she was a reporter well it didnt really matter this nightmare was almost over except for dealing with jared later nick stripped off his dress and infernal high heels the minute his apartment door closed behind him thank goodness he and grayson had seen the wisdom of opening their offices in an old victorian the upstairs was a furnished apartment the perfect place for the new junior partner to hang out for a while the perfect halfway house for a halfway angel he had no idea how séamus had managed to create a position for raquel eastwood in the firm but it was like magic from the moment raquel had walked through the door everyone treated her as if shed gone through a normal hiring process and theyd been expecting her amazing even mrs brown the old bat receptionist hadnt suspected a thing this divine intervention stuff had its merits raquel had a drivers license a social security card a diploma hanging on her office wall and she was a member of the bar she was as real as anyone else walking down the street yeah and she looks a lot like a streetwalker for that matter nick muttered trying unsuccessfully to unhook his bra aka torture band he gave up and yanked it over his head he used to be able to do it with one hand of course it hadnt been behind his back then he grimaced as his breasts were freed from the confining garment it was bad enough being in a womans body but why had séamus felt compelled to make nick so wellendowed raquel was at least a ten and a half he glanced down at the lush breasts attached to his once flat once hairy chest okay maybe a twelve after pulling on an oversized tshirt he flopped into a chair in front of the televisions blank screen séamus i dont know what got into you oh stop your bellyachin nick it was hard to get used to hearing voices in his head especially when that voice belonged to a former new york city cop who sounded far less than angelic i saw margo nick whispered on a sigh margos a good person and she deserves better than you scowling upward nick scratched in a manner a lady wouldnt be caught dead doing but then he was already dead and he sure as hell wasnt a lady whered this body come from nick asked is this an invasion of the body snatchers deal dont worry about it the bodys owner lived and died in another time and place okay so how do i go about finding margo a new husband he chewed a long manicured nail it was damned strange trying to find his own wife another man but youre not a man anymore yeah thanks for reminding me and shes already found the right man already found him nick rubbed his chin still amazed at how smooth his skin was now when do i get to meet him you know exactly who he is no i realization smacked nick between the eyes oh hed considered the possibility earlier in the evening but had denied it repeatedly even séamus couldnt be that cruel then again what about this raquel gig nick swallowed hard remembering all those years of lurking in jared carsons shadow all his life nick had struggled to stay one step ahead of jared and failed until margo so im being punished nick sighed rubbing dried mascara from his eyes and pondering the merits of the entire pint of dark fudge ice cream lurking in the freezer no youre being given the opportunity to fix your mistakes séamus made a tsking sound in nicks head an opportunity most would welcome nick closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the chair i guess pride is something we arent allowed to have even after we die depends why him a shudder crawled through nick from the top of his stylish tousled hairdo to the tip of his perfect pedicure jared carson has always kicked my ass his new voice dripped sarcasm like battery acid star in baseball football basketball track and field class president and ill bet you already know who ran against him gee thanks séamus thanks a lot bitterness tasted vile on his tongue the ice cream would help nick kept his eyes closed but that couldnt block the memory of his fathers lectures fred rileys kid was never the best at anything sure nick had been close many times but second place was never good enough for his old man especially not second to jared winning isnt everything in fact it really isnt important at all in the big scheme of things easy for you to say nick opened his eyes and looked up at the ceiling halfexpecting to find a certain angels ugly mug smirking from the plaster besides hes a male stripper get a grip think real hard nicholas does that ring true no nick sat up straight remembering football hero jared from college not a bit so use your brain red but if he isnt a stripper then nick covered his face and sucked air between his fingers hes a cop i shouldve known hes a frigging cop why huh why not a nice stockbroker a banker or even another lawyer she tried that once you have to remind me every chance you get dont you nick closed his eyes and groaned a cop who happens to have been a lifelong pain in my ass shouldnt dying get me a reprieve from that guy no way ill find her someone else nick you said this is my job what are we going to do with you beats the he nick bit the inside of his cheek sorry i cant i wont let margo take up with a cop especially not that cop i see yeah im sure you do are you forgetting i was one of new yorks finest nick slumped lower in his chair the guilt youve carried around about how you won mar go is only one of the reasons youre here now nick stiffened his gut twisted into a violent knot séamus is that why you picked carson to punish me i didnt pick him hes margos destiny you interfered if its going to happen anyway then why do i have to be around to witness it they need a catalyst you and jared were rivals besides you know secrets that will explain the past secrets what secrets you must remember what your father no way buster we arent going there nick punched the arm of his chair and clenched his teeth determined to change the subject so im supposed to help her get over me how sweet his voice grew hoarse and tearstears pricked his eyelids this is perfect now im going to cry just like a woman too thanks a lot séamus crying might do you some good thats a matter of opinion nick dabbed at his eyes with the hem of his tshirt visualizing himself with the chocolate ice cream and a spoon but im telling you right here and now i can find margo a better man séamus sighed in nicks head not a pleasant experience by any means will you stop that nick rubbed his temples with both thumbs youre giving me a headache jared is the right ma over my dead body no problem jared carson stared at his reflection in the appropriately warped bathroom mirror a neon sign flashed vacancy outside the window less than ten feet away this hole away from home left a lot to be desired but it served his purpose after popping two aspirin into his mouth he washed them down with tepid tap water then raked his fingers through his hair tonight had brought a few surprises that drug raid for starters why had the locals raided the studfinder how much did they know bracing himself on the sinks edge he stared at his reflection as if the answers were hidden in the glass fat chance he had to face the possibility of a leak his cover seemed intact though so far but if the local boys interfered again jareds investigation would fall apart too soon way too soon and as if he didnt have enough complications there was margo why now hed known lake view was her hometown but he figured riley would have moved his bride to the big city for a life of wealth and glamour so why was she back here working for a small newspaper married to a successful attorney margo would shine at the country club and shed never have to hold down a paying job a far different life than he could have offered he slammed his fist against the edge of the sink immediately regretting it damn hard porcelain couldnt take the place of a good punching bag for working out his frustrations a human jaw on the other hand flexing his bruised hand he padded barefoot to the window and stared out at the night if hed known margo and nick riley had settled in lakeview he never would have accepted this assignment but it was too late to back out now his cover was in place and hed just have to explain that to margo and her husband god the last person in the world he wanted to face right now was nick riley the man whod stolen the only woman jared had ever loved two weeks before graduation nick had arranged for margo to catch jared in the arms of another sorority sister somehow the girl had managed to get into his room and his bed without him knowing it in retrospect he realized nick must have paid her to set jared up for a fall nick hadnt let a moment pass before hed moved in on a vulnerable margo shed refused to listen to jareds explanations which angered him enough to allow his pride to get in the way big mistake easy enough to say now with a sigh he shook his head in disgust swallowing the bitter bile frying his throat he trudged to the lumpy fullsized bed and flopped down on top of the tattered bedspread he had a job to do an important one margo would keep his secret once he explained why he was here but nick jared rolled to his side and stared at the flashing sign hypnotized by its rhythmic display when hed seen margo sitting in the audience tonight his initial reaction had been embarrassment then joy hed never forgotten her gray eyes her honeybrown hair her lithe young body or the passion shed shown so openly during their college years no other woman had insinuated herself into his heart since margo and he wasnt sure if it was because he wouldnt allow it or because no other woman could take her place or both and how could he forget nick the rich kid whose real estate tycoon father had owned or held the mortgage on everything and everybody in his small town except for carsons garage jareds uncle and guardian had been an independent cuss who never borrowed or loaned a dime his entire life everything theyd ever owned had been paid for with hardearned cash a cold draft seeped in around the cheap aluminumframed window and he shivered taking refuge under the blankets he continued to stare at the flashing sign what a sorry excuse for a bed the floor would probably be more comfortable but colder too and no amount of physical discomfort could blot out his memories not tonight if nick had gone to some posh private college instead of the state university so many things would be different by now jared would be married to margo he knew that without a doubt theyd probably have a baby or one on the way and he definitely wouldnt have taken this cruddy jobnot a chance he would have gone home and worked as a deputy until sheriff bob was ready to retire then he wouldve run for the office himself but fred and nick rileys obsession with winning and jareds own stupid sense of pride had ruined it all ah margo he squeezed his eyes shut and remembered that night in the woods behind her sorority house when shed given herself to him completely the night theyd both declared their love for each other no other woman had ever touched him or drained him so completely physically or emotionally sure hed had sex with more than a few women in his life but hed only made love with one margo sweet margo forget it chump she was a married woman and the last person she needed messing up her life was the likes of jared carson hed had his chance it was over he punched his pillow and sat up in bed between worrying about this case and strolling down memory lane hed be up all night since he couldnt sleep maybe hed get some answers instead grumbling he reached for the phone and dialed his contacts number jareds body tensed thoughts of margo pushed aside by duty this better be important a sleeproughened voice said after one ring what the hells going on is there a leak beats the hell outta me charlie sighed into the phone and my cover silence that did nothing to bolster jareds confidence charlie is my cover blown nah im sure its fine jared stood and paced well continue as planned for now but you let me know in advance if anything else crops up got it i dont like surprises sure get some shuteye jared disconnected the call and dropped the receiver into its cradle no he didnt like surprises one iota like seeing margo again margo winced as her alarm clock blasted through her brain no not her alarm clock the phone what had she done to deserve a wakeup call this morning steph is a dead woman without opening her eyes she fumbled for the receiver anything to keep it from ringing again some party animal three four tropical drinks had given her a hangover meet me for breakfast a woman definitely not steph said before margo uttered a syllable what who is this she shoved a pillow behind her head and opened one eye her tongue was glued to the roof of her mouth with something resembling wallpaper paste breakfast her stomach threatened immediate mutiny yeah how about the little diner she and nick had eaten dozens of breakfasts in that downtown restaurant during their marriage who is this raquel raquel eastwood no longer groggy margo opened the other eye and scooted herself into a partial sitting position why suspicion slithered through her was there a complication from last nights trip to the police station am i in some kind of trouble a nervous laugh sounded through the phone no i just thought wed chat over breakfast how about it margo rubbed her forehead and nodded then remembered that wasnt terribly effective over the phone sure i suppose she swallowed and grimaced itll take me at least an hour to get my act together too much silver oaks the mere thought of anything alcoholic made margos stomach lurch no i wish that was she swung her legs over the edge of the bed wait a minute how did you know my favorite wine uh you must have told me last night another nervous laugh tell you what bring steph too ill meet you there in about an hour later she had not mentioned silver oaks last night margo shook her head immediately regretting the sudden movement someone at the law firm must have mentioned margo to raquel how else could the woman know so much dismissing it for now she called steph and tried to sound semicoherent her sister was disgustingly alert and cheerful fortunately the call lasted only a minute or two and she dropped the phone shower she muttered pushing to her feet while holding her aching head coffee she froze in midstep suddenly remembering what rather who had plagued her dreams jared she would find him today interview him then forget him forget him the lie of the century exactly seventy minutes later she slid into an oldfashioned booth at the little diner amazing what hot water hot coffee and aspirin could accomplish in so little time steph looked as if she hadnt been out last night at all and raquel eastwood still had bombshell written all over her not only did she boast a mane of curls nicole kidman wouldve envied but she had a body that wouldnt quit margos shortcropped light brown hair and small breasts suddenly seemed more inadequate than usual shed had more than her share of coffee already this morning so she ordered tea and toast so youre warrens new law partner and why the chummy breakfast invitation uh yeah raquel took a sip of coffee and looked from margo to steph warrens out of town i know steph shuddered dramatically when the answering service told me i was afraid wed be stuck in jail all night but you know it was all kind of fun until we got to the police station a strange expression entered the attorneys blue eyes as she turned her gaze on margo then looked quickly back to steph it couldve been a lot worse raquel said steph giggled and winked at her sister did you see the gorgeous dancer margo got i didnt get anyone margo grimaced shed had him once upon a time definitely past tense her memory of last night was like a scene from a bad soap opera shed stayed out almost all night gone to a male strip show and been arrested er taken in for questioning to punctuate the event her college flame had barged into her life and her dreams mmm the way he was looking at you sis oh raquel tugged on her bra as if it were uncomfortable and her face reddened you mean the guy at the station when the attorney peered over the rim of her coffee cup margo was struck again by how much raquel reminded her of someone for some reason she just couldnt determine why déjà vu he was dancing at the club before the real police came steph wrinkled her nose at margo if you ask me he was dancing for my sister stephanie margos face flooded with heat beneath raquels stunned expression it was really nothing like that i just happened to be sitting right in front and dancing raquel asked quietly so tell me what he was like what was he like hot fudge sundaes my most erotic dreams and the worlds fastest roller coaster flustered margo stared at raquel the woman was awfully nosy well you saw him too uh yeah right raquel laughed nervously as she added nondairy creamer to her coffee even though there was real cream on the table i guess i really didnt get a very good look at him thats funny steph smiled at margo i thought nick was the only person who preferred that powdered junk to the real thing me too margo tried to smile but found a lump in her throat she couldnt swallow must be a prerequisite for the law firm oh really raquel shrugged that must be the real reason warren hired me oh i doubt that steph grinned tilting her head to the side i imagine it had a little something to do with your legs and a couple of other things raquel coughed into her napkin as steph dissolved into laughter but margo didnt join her sister there was something really strange about raquel then again maybe it had a little something to do with margos lack of sleep and her hangover hey sis look steph leaned forward pointing toward the door is that who i think it is dragging her attention from raquel margo looked toward the door and froze larger than life jared carsons impressive physique filled the doorway this couldnt be a coincidence shed called in and told her editor where she was having breakfast in case anyone needed to reach her jared must have called to track her down like a fist her stomach pressed upward against her heart her throat clenched well this would save her the trouble of looking for him later after all she still had an article to write and he owed her a favor the thought of jared repaying a favor sent tendrils of desire stretching through her veins seeing him again was dangerous but by seeking her out hed left her no choice steph reached out and grabbed margos wrist oh it is him and hes coming this way great not again raquels reaction made margo glance in her direction the attorneys eyes glittered dangerously she looked angry why good morning ladies margo jerked her head toward the sound of jareds unforgettable voice though it seemed impossible he looked even better this morning wearing jeans and a soft gray tshirt muscles rippled in his tanned arms and coarse dark hair accentuated every bulge and hollow hey look whos here steph feigned surprise badly i dont think we caught your name last night im steph knutsen she thrust out her hand jared shot her a crooked grin and took her hand in his jared carter he said pleased to meet you releasing her hand he looked expectantly around the table carter carson very smooth jared was lucky shed attended college away from home so her family had never met him margo tried to avoid his gaze and turned her attention to raquel the womans nostrils flared slightly and her lips looked as if theyd been glued together no doubt about it raquel eastwood had some pretty strong feelings about jared when no one else made an effort to introduce themselves steph took it upon herself to do so margo sighed wondering how two sisters could be so different this is raquel eastwood our attorney steph said raquel looked up and nodded but made no effort to extend her hand and this is my sister margo riley margo nice name margo mumbled something polite and allowed him to take her hand the feel of his warm rough skin against hers sent a jolt of awareness through her flooding her mind with memories vivid memories the things hed done to her with those hands the interview margo she had to remain focused on her assignment jared meant nothing to her not anymore she couldnt let him mean anything to her now she was too vulnerable after losing nick though it had been two years two centuries probably wouldnt be enough besides everything she and jared shared had been destroyed forever even acknowledging that simple truth seemed disloyal to her dead husband guilt pressed down on her hard and fast jared released her hand and stiffened slightly riley and knutsen he kept smiling but the familiar twitch in his jaw revealed his internal struggle to hold his feelings tightly in check guess one of you sisters must be married then margos a widow steph supplied earning a groan from raquel surprise registered in jareds eyes the expression he turned toward margo was a blend of sympathy and astonishment without a trace of the malice hed once held for nick im sorry he said sounding sincere tears scalded her eyes but margo blinked them into retreat sympathy from jared was more than her raw emotions could take right now part of her wanted nothing more than to have a long talk with him while another part of her wanted to run fast and hard facing jared alone would resurrect it all the pain the joy the hunger and now here he was expressing genuine sympathy about nicks death too much she couldnt breathe they were all staring at her expectantly waiting somehow she had to get away shed find another stripper to interview jared was too dangerous too memorable too desirable uh i really have to get to the office i have a million things to do today resisting the urge to sniffle she pulled some bills from her blazer pocket and thrust them toward her sister this should cover my check you all have a nice day and thanks for inviting us to breakfast raquel without looking at anyone or responding to stephs objection margo slid from the booth and headed toward the back of the diner the room was nothing but a blur of moving colors and shadows as she made her way toward the rest room she was running away damn straight and she would hide in the bathroom all day if she had to whatever it takes the bathroom was blissfully empty and margo leaned her flushed cheek against the closed door sanctuary her breathing gradually calmed and the tears ceased to threaten her composure she blew her nose and splashed her face with cool water then reapplied her powder and lipstick after running a comb through her hair she stared at her reflection shame ebbed through her margo knutsen riley was not a coward oh yes i am no no im not she drew a deep fortifying breath damn it i am not a coward later today just before the studfinder opened shed go find jared and conduct the interview and face all her ghosts past and present nick riley was dead jared jogged out to the studfinder trying to digest that shocking information unbelievable hed had no idea margo was available he paused across the street from the nightclub his breath catching talk about tacky he didnt even know how long nick had been gone and here he was thinking aboutpast tense why would margo want anything to do with someone in his insane career field either his current fake one or his real one not to mention someone her late husband had hated and that she believed had been unfaithful to her with a sigh jared crossed the street he had to put margo out of his mind though he still needed to talk to her again to ensure she would keep his cover the margo hed known would never break a promise but theyd both changed a lot since college knowing the other dancers wouldnt be there yet jared slipped into the dressing room and ran his usual search coming up emptyhanded again so far hed seen no proof of drugs coming into or out of this establishment though he needed to get back into the office again and check out the computer the mucketymucks had been sure enough to set up this crazy assignment all jared could do was keep his eyes open for anything unusual besides local police interference he shook his head still pondering charlies words of assurance last night theyd sounded weak uncertain if the studfinder really was a front for a drug cartel and jareds cover was blown his ass was toast the door behind him squeaked open and jared slid between two lockers waiting to identify the intruder none of the dancers had a reason to be here this early the only other living thing around this time of day was the resident cat if the owner caught him hed come up with some kind of excuse but not being discovered at all was an even better idea he held his breath as the person emerged from the dark hall margo alone she stood peering around waiting she was looking for him why else would she be here jared stepped from his hiding place and just stared all the feelings hed carried in his heart for so many years punched him in the solar plexus it was a miracle he could remain standing at all for a few miserable moments he couldnt even draw a decent breath she started toward him and he dragged in a shaky breath preparing himself seeing margo again was amazing and agonizing damn thered never been anyone else for him never would be we need to talk she said quietly shed been crying over nick jared gritted his teeth and nodded not here fine she cleared her throat my office is only not there too public he gripped her elbow and steered her toward the side entrance do you have your car yes but lets just get out of here first he struggled against the urge to stop and pull her into his arms to murmur words of love and comfort to kiss her until they both forgot everything that had happened since the last time theyd kissed then well talk she remained silent but managed to free her arm without looking over her shoulder she marched toward a red bmw with a vanity plate that read lovenick perfect just frigging perfect she punched her remote and the locks clicked jared reached in front of her and opened her door she glanced back at him her eyes wide and filled with questions her lips slightly parted and beckoning he cleared his throat and pressed his hand to the small of her back urging her to enter the car before he did something stupid like kiss her besides the sooner they were away from the studfinder the safer hed feel having margo here where she could be in danger if his cover was blown made jared nervous a nervous cop is a dangerous cop remembering those words from his training didnt help put him at ease once she slid into the drivers seat he slammed her door and hurried to the other side within seconds he was in the posh leather interior buckling his seat belt margo locked the doors and started the engine backed the car out of the parking space and pulled toward the exit the engine purred the ride like skating on butter where are we going she asked your place i dont think thats wise he looked at her big mistake trying to ignore the lick of lust that damned near made him groan aloud he said you have questions for me and my answers arent for public consumption she set her lips in a thin line very well but this is just business whatever you say he flashed her a grin enjoying the leap of her pulse in the side of her neck and the color creeping upward from the neckline of her blouse nice car except for the license plate nick bought it for me she sighed and the vanity plate jared didnt want to talk about nick but they had to dead or not nick still lurked between them he always would iim sorry margo he waited a beat and bit his lower lip about nick i didnt know you must not go back to rileys crossing very often she turned the corner keeping her gaze on the traffic sparing jared those devastating gray eyes of hers the whole town was in mourning because fred riley still owns the place no not once since college my uncle moved to florida no reason to go back thats right you didnt have any other family you were the only family i wanted margo stopped at a wrought iron gate and inserted a card the gates swung open for her and she drove into the complex posh condos sat in a parklike setting among immaculate gardens fountains and trails jared kept expecting to see nick rileys gloating expression and every time the thought struck guilt answered margo punched a button and a garage door opened she steered the car inside killed the engine and lowered the door only a small light overhead dispelled the darkness she punched yet another button on her handy remote and a brighter light filled the garage so this is the good life nick had always known how to appreciate the finer things nice place its all right she opened her door and jared unfolded himself from the passenger side just all right he asked over the roof of the car she lifted a shoulder nick wanted this but i wanted a little victorian fixerupper across town he met and held her gaze so move she looked nervous as she slammed the door no not yet anyway this is fine shes not over nick remembering the way shed left the breakfast table this morning why did that surprise him because he wanted her to be over nick damn jared followed her up a flight of stairs where she keyed some numbers into a control panel and opened the door they emerged into a huge kitchen where everything gleamed a blinding white from the ceramic tile beneath their feet to the cabinets and appliances the place was so contemporary it almost made his eyes ache there was nothing homey about this kitchen nothing margo surprised he wondered what kind of kitchen would suit her the victorian shed mentioned of course he could picture her surrounded by wood some of it a bit scarred or distressed ruffled curtains oldfashioned copper pots hanging from hooks and friendly pottery sitting all over the place and if that wasnt the most unmanly thought jared carson had experienced in his adult life he didnt know what was he shook himself banishing the image dea agents didnt think about kitchen decor a smile curved his lips damned good thing no one could read his mind margo turned on the flame beneath a white kettle tea she asked over her shoulder sure jared never drank tea but for margo hed have said yes to battery acid she arranged white cups on a white tray with a white carafe the white thing was really getting ridiculous a few minutes later they were sitting at a small table off the kitchen that overlooked the fancy gardens below jared felt uncomfortable as hell the tabletop was glass and the base was wrought iron white wrought iron he had to ask is the whole place white margo smiled and a distant expression flickered in her eyes pretty much nick liked the sleek modern look he almost fainted when i mentioned painting one wall in the den red ill bet the last thing in the world jared wanted to discuss was anything about nick but he didnt want to rush margo he still had hours before he was due at the club red huh he managed a smile just for her good chi she laughed at herself and poured tea into both their cups milk white uh no just sugar white not that jared knew enough about tea to be sure of his answer he liked black coffee with sugar so tea was probably the same she leaned back in her chair and took a sip well i suppose weve delayed this long enough jared met her gaze hoping his eyes didnt reflect his churning emotions i suppose she set her cup down with a clatter reaching out to steady it with both hands they trembled making the china clatter even more finally she bit her lip and clutched her hands together on the glass surface im sorry nothing for you to be sorry about he took a sip of tea and remembered immediately why he was a coffee drinker he set the cup aside congratulating himself for not shuddering until he saw margos hands on the table unable to stop himself he reached over and covered her hand with his own she flinched slightly and her eyes widened a moment later she blinked and turned her palm upward into his it really is good to see you again her voice trembled a little you look well you look ravishing he followed the comment with a smile hoping he wouldnt scare her away this margo seemed uncertain and frightened very unlike the selfassured loving young woman she had been in his arms had nick done this to her no he shoved the thought aside nick riley had been selfish and competitive but he never would have harmed margo at least not physically it felt good to hold her hand he wanted to do a lot more but sensed that margo wasnt ready meeting her gaze he had to wonder if shed ever be ready i really am sorry about nick he gave her hand a squeeze there wasnt any love lost between us but he sure didnt deserve to die so damn young she released a breath as if shed been holding it thanks for that i wasnt sure how i would react to the news he shook his head you know me better than that margo she lowered her gaze for a moment then looked right at him yes i do and last nights performance was definitely out of character a gleam entered her eyes and she pulled her hand out from under his do you mind if i tape our interview our what she rose and grabbed a leather briefcase beneath the breakfast bar interview she repeated did you forget she withdrew a small recorder and a notebook then returned to her seat you owe me remember so much for her being frightened and uncertain carson is this a defense mechanism he asked quirking one corner of his mouth upward is what a defense mechanism she gave him a confused look the lois lane treatment haha margo grimaced and arranged the tools of her trade so can i record the inter no his answer came out harsher than hed intended sorry but hell now he was the nervous one he raked his fingers through his hair and released a breath in a whoosh margo this has to be off the record i promised you an explanation but i have to make sure you wont blow my cover first cover he saw reporter instincts flashing behind her baby grays off the record margo she held his gaze for a few moments then popped the cassette out of the recorder all right off the record for now as long as you give me something for my article whats your topic she rolled her eyes and sighed my editors brilliant idea for a human interest piece uh okay he lifted one shoulder what human interest piece margos eyes danced with mischief and she waggled her brows what would make an intelligent man resort to bump and grind as a career basically heat flooded jareds face not by choice if we arent taping this we might as well talk in the den with her notepad and pencil in hand she led him into a room with white walls white pleated shades gleaming whiteandglass tables and white leather furniture weird she sat on the couch and he sat beside her all right so he probably shouldve taken the chair across from her but the urge to sit beside her had stolen his common sense what do you want to know clearing her throat she set her notepad and pencil on the glasstopped coffee table then halfturned to face him before we get to my interview i want to cover the offtherecord stuff why are you pretending to be an erotic dancer a grin tugged at his lips pretending does that mean im not any good at it he pressed the flat of his palm against his chest im wounded male ego aside her expression was serious why jared it stays between us she crossed her heart right between her lovely breasts jareds gaze followed her movement riveted to the outline of her nipples showing through her thin sweater the heat that had filled his face earlier now did an about face and settled one hell of a lot lower why she repeated her voice low but intense i work for dea he held her gaze watching for any sign of a reaction im undercover the cover was pretty skimpy from what i saw last night he held his head in his hands if id realized anyone would recognize me i can guarantee you i wouldnt have taken this assignment im sure but you had a background in broadway jazz from college and the uh body to pull it off so margos giggle crawled into a special corner of jareds heart one that had missed her more than any person in his life he still cared about her no he still loved her admitting that to himself left him breathless for a few miserable moments logic intervened reminding him that it didnt matter how he felt shed married nick and still mourned him end of fantasy i always knew you wanted to go into law enforcement but dea he lifted a shoulder just gullible i guess very funny her expression grew serious again so dea thinks someone at the studfinder is dealing drugs were still off the record jared directed his most solemn gaze toward her if my cover is blown i could be in danger i dont think you want that fear flickered in her eyes no of course not the sight of her tongue sweeping across her lower lip sent jareds blood supply down and dirty in record time she still turned him on but that was the least of his problems the fact that he still loved her was considerably more dangerous than his libido yes we have reason to believe the studfinder might be a front for distribution i lost the toss he smiled hoping to ease the fear hed planted in her eyes it sounds dangerous not if im careful he struggled against the urge to pull her into his arms and i intend to be careful all right she released a shaky breath ill keep your identity and your role a secret if youll give me the dancer interview my boss wants but im not really a dancer jared flashed her a grin enjoying the crimson flush that crept up her neck and bloomed in her cheeks you looked like one last night her answering grin almost drove him to his knees i dont think youd get any argument from the rest of your admirers in the audience all right now youve done it he chuckled and shook his head im embarrassed are you happy she grew sober and reached for her notepad with trembling fingers but she knocked it to the floor instead he reached for it at the same time she did and they bumped foreheads before he could draw his next breath he pulled margo to her feet and covered her lips with his a tremor trickled through her body and he feared she might pull away but instead she molded herself against him parting her lips for his oh god he never shouldve let this happen because hed forgotten how sweet she tasted memories swirled through him of the first time theyd made love augmenting his desire even further he pressed his hand to the small of her back and laced the other through the silky hair at the nape of her neck this was margo not a dream hungry for her he deepened their kiss swallowing her moan with an answering growl that came from a place hed believed no longer existed when hed lost margo hed buried a part of himself now that neglected part of him clamored for release the vault where hed locked these feelings away cracked open a tiny bit even that small portion of emotions long denied were potent enough to make him crazy he wanted her needed her loved her this was so right the years fell away he kissed the corner of her mouth her cheek her jaw jared she whispered and he kissed her mouth again hey sis what margo jerked herself free of jareds embrace her face flushed her breathing labored steph what are a tall redhead stepped from behind margos sister jared met raquel eastwoods gaze and saw murder in her eyes margo straightened her skirt and drew a desperate breath when had she stopped breathing and why she was single so what if her sister and a virtual stranger had just caught her kissing an equally single man big deal nothing wrong with that picture then why did she feel like crawling under the nearest rock nick is dead she struggled for another breath and though logic demanded she accept her husbands death and his rivalry with jared she couldnt traitor steph extended the key card that had belonged to nick toward her want this back she flashed her a sheepish grin sorry dont be silly margo cleared her throat and noticed the fury glittering in raquel eastwoods eyes why would she be angry about this it made no sense at all of course raquels early morning breakfast invitation hadnt either looks like we arrived just in time raquel said her voice sounding deeper than it had before thats a matter of opinion jared said quietly raquel took a step toward him yeah mne what thesteph looked from raquel to jared then back again you may be tall but i think jared could take you with one hand besides whats it to you as usual steph had the courage to voice margos thoughts im interviewing jared for an article margo retrieved her notepad and pencil as if she needed proof ridiculous sorry for interrupting raquels apology came through gritted teeth and was clearly not genuine however at least shed unclenched her fists interview huh stephs eyes twinkled and she waggled her eyebrows suggestively raquel needed a ride to the office and i remembered i need to borrow your purple dress so she shrugged still smiling margo would never hear the end of this one ill get the dress ill help you margo hurried into the bedroom shed shared with nick which augmented her guilt she hadnt kissed a man since his death and the first one had to be the one who would have hurt him the most steph came in behind her and put her hand on her shoulder dont you dare feel bad about kissing that sexy hunk of man its about time you dont steph margo drew a shaky breath reeling in her emotions she turned and faced her sister theres a lot more to this and i cant go into it with you right now oooookay steph gave her a quick hug then flung open margos closet im starting to wonder about raquel starting to margo shook her head shes very strange steph retrieved the purple dress in question and draped it over her shoulder she was the one who mentioned we were passing right by your place how margo paused to contemplate that she probably saw my address at the office or something or maybe from the police station last night maybe why didnt it seem that simple to margo because raquel had shown an inordinately strong interest in her that made it personal you thinking what im thinking steph tilted her head her expression contemplative im sure shell take no for an answer margo wouldve bought her sisters sincerity if not for the gleam in stephs eye as she grabbed the doorknob youre rotten she muttered to her sisters retreating back i love you too sis steph giggled all the way back to the den raquel and jared were still in neutral corners at least that was something cmon raquel lets give these two some privacy im not sure thats wise raquel said her murderous gaze still on jared after all margo is still in mourning steph coughed and grabbed raquel by the elbow hon nick was a really cool guy but its been two years life goes on raquel paused at the door and faced margo the glower shed directed at jared was gone now the expression in the redheads mascarad eyes could only be described as sad rejected get a grip margo i see you kept the painting raquel said quietly as she shifted her gaze from margo to the painting in the entryway before margo could ask the woman how she knew about the painting nick had purchased while on their honeymoon steph had dragged raquel eastwood out the front door that was interesting jared said more than you can possibly imagine margo turned slowly to find that he looked as bewildered as she felt yes interesting is one way of putting it crazy wouldve been more accurate had raquel been here before ridiculous after giving herself a mental shake she grabbed her notebook and pencil again now where were we jared touched her shoulder gently turning her to face him dont you remember he took a step nearer his warmth closing the short distance between them as he cupped her face in both hands and brushed his lips across hers her knees quaked and her heart pressed upward against her throat she still wanted this man with the same intensity she had in college he had the ability to reduce her to little more than crazed hormones with no effort at all problem was he seemed hellbent on exerting a lot of effort she was in serious trouble jared a simple whisper shouldnt have ignited the flame in his eyes she saw now he obviously knew her resistance to his charms was practically nonexistent i we cant do this oh i definitely can he exhaled very slowly resting his forehead against hers but im a gentleman remember yes margo swallowed hard and wished more than a little that jared carson would forget he was a gentleman and that she could stop feeling as if she were betraying her dead husband back to our interview margo sat in a chair across the room from jared this time and he took the couch alone better this way really i cant tell you much about the life of an exotic dancer since im really not one he held his hands palms up looks like a duck cute i thought so she scribbled down a few comments what are you writing i havent said anything yet just that the subject seems ashamed of his chosen profession embarrassed you can say that again once will suffice warmed to her subject margo scribbled more notes just a thought she looked up trying to ignore how delicious he looked sitting on her couch what arent you doing the real dancers a disservice how by putting my embarrassment in the article maybe some of these guys like this job oh what had she been thinking very unprofessional and very unlike her youre right i cant do it dont want me to see you wiggle up there again she grinned but could tell he was serious jared i have a job to do here tell me what you want to know from the other dancers and ill ask them she studied his expression the worry in his intensely blue eyes and almost surrendered look as you pointed out ive already almost blown this assignment she stood tossing her notepad onto the coffee table if im going to write this story im going to do it right that means interviewing a real dancer lakeview only has one studfinder he rolled his eyes heavenward and sighed the real margo knutsen has returned stunned she waited for him to meet her gaze again whats that supposed to mean his eyes softened i didnt mean to insult you but you havent exactly been yourself one corner of his mouth quirked upward except for when i kissed you her cheeks flamed and she cleared her throat i well its been hard losing nick and all i know he sighed and walked around the coffee table come here margo hesitated but she saw compassion in his eyes instead of lust between two beats of her heart she found her head nestled beneath jareds chin and his strong arms wrapped comfortably around her shoulders he made no attempt to kiss her this time and that made her want him even more i dont believe this nick kicked off his high heels and put his feet on his desk who cared if the hem of his skirt slid all the way up to the crotch of his god save him panty hose to make things even worse this really had been his desk once upon a time séamus i just want to know one thing what is it this time nicholas were you a sadist when you were still alive i know you dont mean that youre just upset noooooo what was your first clue nick raked his slutred fingernails through his hair i told you id find her someone else jared is margos destiny its not your place to not my place nick stood wishing he had pockets to ram his fists into wishing his punching bag was still hanging in the corner hed draw séamuss face on it and take out his frustrations how thoughtful nick scowled up at the ceiling then closed his eyes resignation coiling through him with all the ease of a rattlesnake margos destiny my ass he clenched his fists struggling against the urge to put his fist through the wall do you have any idea how it felt to he bit back what threatened to become a sob nick riley didnt blubber but as raquel its hard nick i knew it would be but you sent me here anyway knowing he was the one remember this order came from higher up the chain of command nick barked a derisive laugh so god really is that cruel you have to figure it all out for yourself nick have you ever really loved anyone but yourself thats bull i loved margo i married her didnt i but you didnt love her the way a man loves the woman hes meant to spend his life with did you i hell he punched his fist into the palm of his other hand just hell i think youre starting to see the truth though you dont like it now now you think ill ever like seeing jared carson manhandle my wife widow and what i think isnt important but you will come to accept what must be and perhaps you shouldnt carry your fathers secret to your grave either maybe its time to learn something about sacrifice nick dropped his gaze to the floor scowling at the runner in the toe of his hose a soggy tear landed on it as if to punctuate this entire sordid mess if i accept what you call destiny he drew a shaky breath and forced the wordsthat means i also have to accept that margo was never really mine only silence answered him but he knew his rivalry with jared carson and his marriage to margo were the reasons he hadnt made it all the way into heaven he was dead dammit margo wasnt his mission was to see her happy for the rest of her life but why the hell did that have to make jared happy for the rest of his life too sacrifice nick pulled a sheet of stationery from the drawer and scribbled a short note words hed buried deep and sworn he would never reveal even so one of the things hed regretted after his death was taking this knowledge with him instead of leaving it here for those it affected he stared down at the written words reached for the sheet fully intending to rip it to shreds sacrifice truth instead of tearing it he swallowed hard and drew a deep breath the date he wrote at the top of the page was from the week before his death two years ago he signed nick at the bottom seeing his real name in his own hand again gave him pause hed made so many mistakes had so many regrets maybe séamus had a few points maybe this one was easier than margo he folded the sheet and sealed it in an envelope very neatly he wrote a name across the front and slid it to the back of his top desk drawer someone would find it when raquel was gone and think it had been missed after nicks death the receptionists voice scratched over the intercom henry millman on one ms eastwood what does that son of a bitch want are we having pms the old woman asked her voice dripping sarcasm eat sh nick clenched his teeth rather than complete that remark i dunno maybe fine thanks ill take the call nick blew his nose dabbed the tears from his eyes grabbed the phone and punched line one after he reiterated his refusal to accept the owner of the studfinder as a client nick hung up the receiver that snake made the need for sexual harassment laws way too frigging personal someone knocked and simultaneously opened nicks office door mrs brown the firms loyal receptionist whod adored margo and hated nick in his natural life entered with a small brown paper bag the little grayhaired woman pulled a gigantic chocolate bar from the bag and slapped it into nicks hand i ran downstairs to the drugstore this first to sweeten your mood she said weve never had a female attorney in the office and im well beyond all this nick blinked staring from the bar and back to mrs brown but shed never given him chocolate the woman made an annoying tsking sound with her tongue and removed two more items evening primrose for your pms she slapped the pill bottle down on the desk and removed two small boxes one of tampons and one of maxi pads and these for later nick sputtered unable to contemplate the horror of what shed just proposed he stared at the diagram on the side of the tampon box no way not even séamus would youll feel better soon mrs brown said take the primrose start now she opened the bottle then pulled a slip of paper out of her pocket and a phone message from steph knutsen mrs brown moved to the office door wait nick sniffled and tore open the chocolate thank you i think you dont know it yet but you already did dear dear he shifted the glob of soothing chocolate to one side of his mouth i did steph included me in her invitation mrs brown flashed a wicked grin and left the room nick grabbed the phone message and simultaneously bit off another chunk of chocolate maybe there really was some truth to that serotonin business he felt better already raquel meet us at the studfinder around seven mar gos on assignment and we may need our attorney bring mrs brown a smiley face was drawn at the end oh my god nick riley was going to watch male strippers revulsion slithered through him until he remembered that jared carson was a main attraction he broke off another chunk of chocolate liking the idea of watching old jaro humiliate himself if only jared carson knew who raquel really was that could make it all the more satisfying get serious he dropped the unopened boxes into the wastebasket and looked at the digital clock on his desk it was too early to call it a day but he didnt have any appointments besides he didnt feel like himself well even less than usual since his new appearance maybe mrs brown was right about the pms heaven forbid he almost laughed i know what im gonna do to lift my spirits hed have raquels long red hair cropped off into something more manageable and get rid of these manicured claws too the more he contemplated it the more he liked the idea he pulled a pair of fingernail clippers from his desk drawer right where hed always kept them and rendered raquels red nails into nice neat stubs hed have to ask mrs brown what women used to remove this gunk then he went into the bathroom and scrubbedoff the makeup when he looked in the mirror again he noticed something for the first time since this journey into nevernever land raquel had nicks eyes behind all that eyeliner and mascara he hadnt noticed maybe if hed actually washed it off at night like the instructions said he wouldve realized sooner ill be damned maybe the eyes really were windows to the soul séamus might have changed nicks body but he hadnt changed his eyes or his handwriting even mrs brown had commented how much raquels handwriting resembled nicks knowing that part of him was still here made him feel better than he had since his arrival back on earth well for a few moments he felt better after using the facilities he marched back into his office and retrieved the box of maxi pads from the wastebasket he slammed the bathroom door behind him tore open the box and read the directions thanks a lot séamus jared had a hunch and he didnt like hunches he liked facts hard evidence a local big shot named henry mllman owned the studfinder along with at least a dozen other small businesses in the county in the two weeks since jared had started this assignment tonight was the first time mllman had put in an appearance why tonight and had last nights futile drug raid been timed accordingly the rotund cigarsmoking owner strutted through the dressing room about half an hour before showtime he made a few ribald comments about entertaining women not giving any dancer more than a cursory nod except one millman directed a glare of suspicion that shot right through jared hed seen that look before the asshole knew something or at least suspected it jared forced himself to return to the task of closing all the velcro tabs on his costume ignoring his sweaty palms and the alarm bouncing through his brain something big was going down tonight he felt it smelled it and margo would be in the audience damn whats up the dancer with the locker next to jareds asked his tarzan performance opened every night tough day jared searched his gray matter for tarzans real name and came up blank i was just noticing the fat guy he slid a glance toward millman who was now deep in conversation with his emcee at least he wasnt watching jared anymore hes the owner right yep thats the big man himself tarzan tucked something that looked like a rolled sock into his gstring padding the fantasies jared managed a chuckle and patted himself on the back for not cringing i was just curious havent seen him here before oh he comes in around the first of every month tarzan pulled his loincloth on and fastened the velcro he never watches the show though spends all his time back here doing something in the office hmm seems like he could hire somebody to do his payroll jared lifted a shoulder feigning disinterest tightwad eh tarzan rubbed oil across his shaved chest i figure the studfinder is a tax shelter or something or something jared had to find a way to get into that office tonight anybody ever meet him here tarzan didnt seem suspicious of all the questions he appeared thoughtful for a moment then nodded yeah come to think of it ive seen a tall bald guy with him a few times bald guy the acid level in jareds gut hit nuclear his contact with the local pd was tall and bald seems an odd choice for a bookkeeper or a boyfriend tarzan chuckled millman could probably take his pick in here being the boss and all jared coughed well millman couldnt have his pick of every one that bald guy is one scrawny sumbitch too that did it charlie the tall scrawny bald guy had to be jareds link to the local police that raid the other night had been arranged to rattle jared charlie was obviously on the take and jared was in deep shit his blood turned frigid and his breath caught and held fear shot through him for margo break a leg tarzan flexed his muscles and headed toward the stage door yeah trying not to stare at the small door at the end of the dressing room through which henry millman had disappeared jared headed for the bathroom and made a call on his encrypted cell phone within a few moments hed notified his boss about his suspicions by the time he took the stage tonight there would be three more agents on site and more on the way turned out the feds already had millman under investigation for various financial dealings this case could be wrapped up a lot faster than anyone had hoped a few moments later he stashed his phone and took his place in line with the other eroticops with any luck this would be his last performance he was more than ready to hang up his gstring jared carson had other things on his mind now he couldnt deny the truth from the first moment hed seen margo sitting in the audience hed known this was destiny or fate or whatever he would pursue her as he should have before she ever married nick he should have swallowed his pride back in college and told her he was sorry that he loved her and wanted to spend his life with her loving her then he would leave his life with the dea and pursue his original career goal of smalltown law enforcement he wanted to buy margo her old victorian fixerupper and to make babies with her lots of babies he wouldnt take no for an answer either not because he was a jerk but because hed felt her response hed seen love in her eyes in her smile and had tasted it in her kiss they belonged together and they always had if only nick jared released a slow breath no he couldnt blame nick any longer losing margo had been as much jareds fault as anybodys nick was dead and jared planned to let him rest in peace their old rivalry had been stupid when nick was alive and continuing it after his death was doubly stupid margo mattered the future mattered he heard tarzans yell and barely suppressed a shudder damn margo and steph occupied the same table they had last time center stage except this time margo wasnt a bit reluctant to watch the dancers knowing that very soon jared would be there she couldnt stop thinking about that kiss everything hed meant to her in the past had come flooding back as if they hadnt been apart all these years as if nick no she wouldnt think about nick now i wonder whats keeping raquel and mrs brown steph said as she slid a drink across the table toward margo im still trying to figure out why you invited her here tonight margo wasnt looking forward to seeing the unusual woman again so soon i called to invite mrs brown and she said raquel had pms and would probably enjoy it steph grinned and waggled her eyebrows hmm margo glanced at her watch again maybe they changed their minds about coming mrs brown said raquel had a hair appointment i guess those gorgeous locks take longer what gorgeous locks margo stared past her sister as mrs brown and a very different version of raquel approached the table between sets steph looked over her shoulder then turned her wideeyed stare on margo yikes she got scalped a more subdued raquel slid into the empty chair next to mrs brown raquel wore jeans a blue sweater and very little if any makeup her flaming hair curled around her face she didnt look a thing like the fancy woman shed been this morning look what she did just because of a little pms mrs brown kept looking at raquel and shaking her head shame what a shame such beautiful hair i donated it to a charity that makes wigs for kids on chemo raquel caught their server and ordered a glenfiddich single malt scotch i dont miss that mop a bit nicks favorite label margo shook off the memory of nick and smiled i think donating your hair to charity was a very nice thing to do raquel shrugged and her cheeks pinkened i hope they put it to good use you missed tarzan steph told mrs brown but the eroticops are next and they are to die for especially one of them margo had to stop mooning around about jared and concentrate on her job tonight her notes would make sense and jared had promised to find a likely dancer for her to interview so margo what did old fred want when he called earlier just letting me know hes passing through town tomorrow and wants to have lunch margo drew a deep breath her fatherinlaw had never been particularly fond of her especially after nick decided to settle in her hometown instead of returning to rileys crossing he doesnt have any other family with nick gone raquel made a choking sound and steph patted her on the back all the color had drained from raquels face are you all right margo asked a pained expression crossed the redheads face yeah sure why wouldnt i be the server delivered her drink and raquel ordered another before she took her first sip i uh take it you were talking about your fatherinlaw yes exactly but how did raquel know that nick was his only son and i think hes lonely he misses him will minor miracles never cease raquel downed the scotch with one smooth flick of her wrist do you know fred riley steph asked not bothering to hide her curiosity im not sure i ever really knew him at all raquel rested her chin on her fist her expression wistful i well never mind were here to have fun right talk about avoidance did raquel know nicks father or not margo exchanged glances with her sister knowing steph was also confused by the ambiguous answer and how had raquel known about the painting or where margo lived did did you know my husband she asked uncertain how or why the question had left her lips i raquels gaze shifted around the table yes yes i know er knew nick i thought you just moved here steph said i lived here until two years ago but now im back raquel flashed a nervous smile two years ago raquel had left town about the time nick died she studied the womans guilty expression and a sinking sensation struck no she couldnt accept that nick had never given her reason to believe he was unfaithful the lights and sirens signaled the beginning of the next act and the crowd went wild forcing margo to shove her suspicions aside nick was dead and thinking ill of him was wrong still how did raquel know so much once the dancers entered the stage mrs brown leapt to her feet and gave a wolf whistle that would have put the most sexist construction worker to shame steph laughed and margo turned her attention to jared he was dancing for her again now she knew that for certain no one else in the room knew his real identity or why he meant so much to her tears scalded her eyes but she blinked the liquid traitors away focusing instead on holding jareds gaze watching him reminded her again of his kiss her body softened and heated hungry for him and why shouldnt she indulge her desire after all she was single and it wasnt as if jared was a stranger hed been her first lover her first love her only love guilt shoved its ugly face to the forefront of her mind again if any other man had attracted her attention would she feel this way the answer came swiftly a resounding no oh but she had loved him and she still did her heart raced ahead as she gathered that knowledge about her like a protective cloak she wanted to invite jared home with her tonight could she find the courage and could she forget the past enough to think of a future with him nothing ventured a smile curved her lips and she blew jared a kiss before she lost her resolve well isnt that special raquel muttered margo girded herself and faced raquel a myriad of emotions danced in the womans eyes regret sadness and something more hes margos steph told mrs brown lucky girl mrs brown laughed if my hormones were thirty years younger id give you a little competition raquel extended her glass toward margo her eyes misty i wish you the best in every way her voice broke and she drew a shaky breath thank you margo wasnt sure what else to say why did this strange womans words mean so much why was margo relieved to hear her say them it was almost as if she needed raquels approval to seduce jared ridiculous of course what margo really wanted with jared was a lot more than merely a night of sex her face flamed and her heart did a pirouette nick is dead margo she didnt need anyones permission to do whatever she wanted with jared or any other man shed been a good wife to nick hadnt she wouldnt he forgive her now knowing she was still in love with jared no probably not though shed loved nick in her own way she hadnt been blind to his faults hed been pretty selfcentered and competitive to the extreme she sighed especially with jared somehow she had to come to terms with all this because she couldnt let jared just walk out of her life again she needed this needed him in her life give me strength determined she turned her attention back to the stage watching jared do things with his hips that set her insides ablaze she bit her lower lip and sighed ooops margo glanced over to find steph shoving napkins toward raquel who had spilled her drink when margo met raquels gaze a jolt went through her the womans eyes had disturbed her before and now she knew why without all the makeup raquels eyes were just like nicks impossible raquels expression grew solemn and she gave margo a sheepish grin as she pushed to her feet be right back raquel left the table to weave her way toward the rest rooms shes wearing sneakers steph said amazing transformation kind of like a butterfly in reverse pms mrs brown sipped her tropical beverage her gaze never leaving the stage can i take one of them home with me steph laughed now what would mr brown think of that he wont care hes been dead ten years he wont care hes been dead mrs browns words echoed through margos brain she was alive she had a right to lead a happy and fulfilled life with anyone she pleased would nicks ghost always lurk between them would his memory always create this surge of guilt in margos heart and mind did jared feel guilty about nick and who the hell was raquel eastwood deciding to focus on the present for now she looked at the stage gain the set ended and jared blew margo a kiss as he followed the other dancers offstage somehow she would find a way to come to terms with everything right now though margo had to find out why and how raquel eastwood had looked at her with her late husbands eyes and how she knew so many things about him running to the rest room without giving her sister a chance to respond margo rose and made her way through the crowd on wooden legs had she lost her mind this was crazy whatever this was reincarnation margo didnt know much about such things but it seemed to her that people werent reincarnated back into the same lifetime theyd left were they wouldnt that disrupt the spacetime continuum or something gibberish she squared her shoulders and turned down the dark hallway leading to the rest rooms a movement at the end of the hallway caught her attention another door opening and a redheaded woman slipping through it margo didnt hesitate she shoved open the same door and realized it was some kind of storage area with another door leading outside what was raquel doing back here come on séamus raquel said to the stacks of boxes cut me some slack here shes on to me was raquel talking to herself whos séamus and whos on to you raquel slowly turned to face margo she drew a deep breath and held her hands out at her sides palms up hes an angel margo looked around the deserted room again her heart pounding so loudly in her ears she could barely hear anything else your guardian angel i guess you could say that with the emphasis on guard never gives me a moments peace who are you raquel stared at margo for several seconds i think you know margo shook her head no i dont she backed toward the door this was insane you have nicks eyes and you know things nick knew but hes dead raquel nodded and resignation filled her expression and hes going to stay that way who are you margo repeated reaching behind her for the doorknob séamus let me be myself now raquel glanced toward the ceiling please margo needed air and raquel needed a good psychologist im going back to watch the show now she said carefully not wanting to upset raquel how about you raquel just stood there staring at margo taunting her with her dead husbands eyes are you nicks sister she finally asked though she knew nick didnt have any siblings raquel shook her head her smile sad im the door behind raquel burst open admitting a gush of chilly evening air the door obviously led to the parking lot mens hushed voices and lots of grunting and groaning followed raquel shoved margo behind a stack of boxes they waited while the men hauled several boxes into the room and piled them beside the door boss says we can retire on what this shitll bring one man said im ready for that the door margo and raquel had entered through opened and two more men entered this all of it one man asked yeah boss margos reporter antennae twitched was this the drug operation jared was investigating she peered around the edge of a box two of the men wore suits they could have been doing a laurel and hardy imitation one overweight one tall and thin all she had to do was keep quiet until they left then she could give jared at least a partial description maybe that would help his investigation and then she would deal with raquel whoever she was margo swallowed the lump in her throat remembering those eyes nicks eyes how could it be something soft brushed against margos legs she knew from its purring that it was only a cat so she forced herself to relax shed always had a cat as a child but with nicks allergy she hadnt had one since maybe shed get a cat now raquel less than a foot away from margo glanced down at the friendly furball and sneezed nick tried to toe the cat away from his shapely leg before he sneezed again but when someone knocked away the box in front of him he figured the cat was the least of his problems the walking allergen scurried away leaving the scene of his crime the man knocked another box aside and made a grab for them but nick dodged him grabbed margos hand and dragged her out of their brief sanctuary and toward the door we were looking for the ladies room wrong turn sorry an iron grip stopped raquels hand just shy of the door knob shit nick said that aint very ladylike the man taunted he shoved nick and margo toward the center of the room got us a couple of problems here boss henry mllman had been in raquels office just yesterday and he had called earlier this afternoon raquel and margo were in big trouble here unless the lecherous old fart didnt recognize the attorney hed tried unsuccessfully to proposition getting rid of raquels hair and makeup had been brilliant nick had turned down the retainer mllman had offered and what hed called his magic in bed weasel millman narrowed his already beady eyes and shoved the omnipresent unlit cigar into the corner of his mouth dont i know you nick shrugged but mllman took a step closer jabbing his cigar toward raquel for emphasis ive seen you somewhere before he turned his attention to the two men whod hauled in the boxes tie em up for now after the place closes take care of the problem nick was supposed to be here to help margo not get her killed what a mess hed made of things again waitaminute here he said desperate all we did was get lost on our way to the bathroom is that a crime around here a tall skinny guy stepped into the light nick recognized him immediately hed always suspected charlie fritz was on the take and now he knew hed had more than a few runins with the guy in court as nick never as raquel at least that was some consolation séamus get us out of this nothing now that they were in really serious trouble nicks guardian had pulled a vanishing act just perfect sly you stay here and guard these two charlie said eyeing margo closely reporter nick shouldve realized margo might be familiar to these bastards too to her credit she didnt utter a sound nick prayed for a miracle hed screwed up margos life once and now hed put her in danger the one called sly put two chairs backtoback and the others forced margo and nick into them sly wrapped a nylon rope around them both securing it under the seat of a chair completely out of reach cmon séamus charlie left the room and millman stood back from the dirty work staring at nick his gaze dropped to where raquels overblown breasts jutted out between the ropes perfect just perfect humiliate me all you want séamus just dont let them hurt margo millman shoved the cigar between his flabby lips and said to his goons you got a delivery to meet come back and take care of these two during the last act no one will hear them over the music and screaming dames let us go margo said her voice strong her worry undeniable well forget everything that happened here yeah nick added remembering how and why hed convinced himself he was in love with margo knutsen all those years ago she was brave honorable and beautiful what wasnt to love but he hadnt loved her enough let us go in your dreams millmans eyes widened suddenly i got it now youre that bitch lawyer who was too good for me nick sighed not bothering to answer good for you margo whispered now i dont feel so bad about havin to shut you up sly you and harry need to move the truck before somebody gets suspicious millman chuckled as he waddled through the door that led into the club sly obviously the brains of tweedles dee and dumb pointed upward at the sprinkler in the ceiling gotta move the truck before millman pisses hisself over it they locked the door leading back into the club then left through the outside door nick heard the keys rattle and the dead bolt slide into place isnt this just perfect nick shook his head and sighed disgusted with himself margo kept stretching toward the bottom of her chair can you reach the knot no as nick he might have been able to but not as raquel cmon séamus the music fell silent suddenly help nick even tried a shrill whistle and margo shouted as well the music resumed within seconds drowning out their combined efforts were going to die anyway margo said so tell me who you really are nick swallowed the lump in his throat you arent going to die trust me why they both kept twisting and squirming trying to work their arms free of the ropes why should i trust you if you wont tell me the truth margo nick stopped squirming i dammit séamus tell me margos voice trembled i have to know nick squeezed his eyes shut hoping for some kind of guidance hearing nothing but the infernal music and the customers cheers he sighed im sorry for hurting you damn this is killing me he gave a nervous laugh again a tremor rippled through her who are you her voice sounded wretched nick hated himself for hurting her but he had to finish his mission séamus had known and nick could no longer deny it jared carson was the right man his throat clogged and he cleared it several times it hurt but margos happiness came first seeing her happy would relieve his guilt and hed be able to watch her be happy for the rest of her life wouldnt she love him more for that he searched his memory for something only nick could know do you remember your twentyfourth birthday of course what does that have to do with any your husband dressed up in a clown suit and delivered a singing telegram he cleared his throat and sang the opening lines of good ship lollipop at least raquel wasnt a soprano that wouldve been too much margo made a choking sound how did you know that why do you have nicks eyes my eyes not nicks im raquel remember so he had blue eyes too end of coincidence you know too much the condo the painting sacrifice would sacrificing his widows memory of him be enough would that end this nightmare so she could get on with her life with jared nick sighed knowing the answer it would hurt her at first but in the long run it would set her free you only loved yourself okay if you insist tell me i was in love with nick riley the truth sorta and he loved me margo was silent for several seconds while sweat trickled down nicks face intimating to his own widow that hed been unfaithful to her was sickening especially since it wasnt true his gut clenched and his eyes burned raquel bawled more than anyone nick had ever known séamus had said nick never learned to make sacrifices destroying his widows memory of him might make up for all his other failures as a husband as a man so so youre saying you had an affair with my husband margos voice sounded surprisingly strong and thats how you knew about my condo the painting my fatherinlaw and nick nick drew a shaky breath he was committed to this selfsacrifice shit now no turning back what was pride anyway an affair if thats what you want to call it his male ego would never be the same after this besides nick always said that you really loved someone else i dont remember the name now okay so thats a lie im sorry ive hurt you his voice fell to a whisper i margo released her breath in a loud whoosh i dont know what to say well now hed done it margo was crying and there wasnt a thing he could do about it but that was the least of their problems right now first he had to make sure she survived this nightmare lets stop reliving the past and see if we can get out of this mess he said with a lot more cheer than he felt on three try to stand and move us toward the door youre facing it took several attempts but they finally managed to move their chairs next to the door nick tried using his chin to turn the knob but it didnt budge okay jared best nick riley one more time and save margo please jared slipped into the empty office and hit a key on the computer keyboard the screensaver of a naked woman in various poses cleared and he ran a search for a few keywords nothing of course that would have been too easy millman might be sleazy but he obviously wasnt stupid a thumping sound came through the wall jared released the safety on his gun and eased toward the closet door he heard muffled voices more thumping cautiously he eased the closet door open and peered inside he glanced back over his shoulder and flipped the overhead light on to illuminate the inside of the closet several file drawers occupied the closet hed need more time to search them tomorrow before the studfinder opened hed be back unless the music fell silent suddenly and he heard the voices through the wall again female after closing the closet door behind him jared examined the wall between him and the voices there was a small door about three feet high behind a stack of boxes he turned off the overhead light in the closet and crouched down to open it just a crack expecting to find a safe or a cabinet instead the door revealed an adjoining storage room something weird was going on here a door to the outer office closed and he heard footsteps over the muffled music from the club jared weighed his options the footsteps came closer to his hideout and he stopped pondering and slid through the small door closing it behind him a stack of boxes shielded him from the rooms occupants with both hands wrapped around the barrel of his gun he rose to his knees edged closer to the nearest corner and saw raquel eastwood her eyes grew wide when she saw him then one corner of her mouth curved upward in a grin that unnerved him its about time jared thank god the other woman said in her unforgettable voice margo he slid his gun into his shoulder holster and pulled a knife out of his pocket within a matter of seconds hed freed both women what the hell hap no time for that raquel said theyre coming back to kill us after the last set she aimed her thumb toward the stack of boxes beside the door drugs were the unfortunate witnesses jared pulled out his agency phone and hit one number his backup should be in place by now the man who answered eased his mind gary was one of the best and he was in the parking lot watching a pair of men whod left by a back entrance jared told gary where they were and what they assumed was stashed there knowing the local pd wasnt trustworthy garys partner would detain the two thugs in the truck freeing him to join jared very nicely done raquel said im impressed in fact i you two get back to your table they wont try anything in front of all those witnesses jared be careful margo kissed him quickly on the mouth she always did love you more raquels voice cracked take good care of her jaro jar jareds blood turned to ice only one person had ever called him that later get back to the club now trust no one not even the cops especially not them raquel snorted charlie fritz is in this up to the last hair on his pointed head margo bit her lip and nodded be careful promise he unlocked the door and made sure the hallway was vacant charlie fritzs pointed head a man repeated from behind them did you hear that charlie sure did jared wanted to spin around and unload his clip but common sense reminded him that the others were probably armed as well by the time he took one down another would fire he couldnt risk it hands in the air mr dea and close that damn door jared complied and met margos gaze he saw her fear and hated that she was in danger what the hell had she and raquel been doing back here in the first place turn around real slow he obeyed hearing margos sharp intake of breath cmon gary let the women go jared tried to remember his training but knowing the woman he loved was right behind him didnt help matters theyre no threat to you cmon séamus raquel whispered reminding jared how odd she was no threat millman walked toward jared he didnt have a gun at least not in sight like hell charlie stepped from the shadows he of course had a gun his face was expressionless his eyes cold always wanted to best one of you fed hotshots guess i get my wish not necessarily raquel stepped forward the place is crawling with agents your asses are toast jared cringed uh thanks raquel but shut up charlie shouted he waved his gun around losing every iota of cool hed shown earlier the guy was freaked and dangerous musics stopped someone will hear you if you fire that thing raquel took another step showing no fear and no damned sense millman rolled his cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other he gave his partner in crime a sidelong glance shes right wait for sly and harry oh but they arent coming back raquel folded her arms standing at an angle between jared and charlie margo crept up beside jared whose hands were still in the air get back he whispered whatcha mean they arent coming back millman asked narrowing his eyes whatd you do to em raquel gave a throaty laugh wouldnt you like to know shes bluffing charlie swallowed so hard his adams apple climbed the length of his throat and back the door to the outside rattled millman glanced at his watch bout time the shows over and the club closes in six minutes now we have three mouths to shut up permanently the door burst open but no one was there jared managed to shove margo behind a stack of boxes then dove in with her he peered around the corner readying his aim charlie grabbed raquel who didnt put up any fight at all watch the hands curly she said her tone sultry as ever that woman had grit or she was insane either way she was now a hostage and that presented a brandnew set of problems come out with your hands up a voice called from outside by now gary probably had enough firepower to blow the studfinder to mars all jared wanted was margo out of here safely drop it fritz jared took aim on millman and stepped from behind the box tell your partner to let the woman go oh let him shoot me jaro raquel said jared swallowed hard resisting the compulsion to look at raquel just now he had to watch millman for any sudden moves drop your weapon gary called from the open doorway his gun pointed at charlie and raquel dammit charlie they got us let the bitch go sweat poured down millmans face and his cigar hit the floor dont move or shes dead im already dead go ahead make my day something that sounded like a sob erupted from margo he couldnt comfort her now but he understood her concern about raquel jared had seen some agents with death wishes in his day but raquel eastwood was either the bravest person hed ever met or else certifiable the door leading into the club swung open behind them and charlie started shooting gary took him out in one shot jared had millman pinned against the wall before they even knew whod opened the door and raquel eastwood was lying in a pool of her own blood margo bolted out of her hiding place and dropped down beside raquel jared still had his gun on a cowering millman until someone relieved him he couldnt help raquel or hold margo oh my god an elderly woman wielding a bathroom plunger like a sword said from the open doorway steph knutsen armed with a mop stepped in beside her paramedics are on the way gary said two other agents entered the storage room and cuffed millman then dragged him outside gary inclined his head toward charlies body that ones dead the moment millman was out of there jared dropped to his knees beside margo dont let me be too late raquel had risked her life to save him he had absolutely no doubts about that god only knew why dont go yet margo said dont go jared supposed she meant dont die steph stooped on the opposite side of raquel and helped margo and jared apply pressure to the gaping wound in the womans chest at such close range it was a miracle shed survived this long it didnt look good is she going to make it the elderly woman asked parting with her plunger im afraid raquel opened her eyes it isnt pms now dont go not yet please margo left the first aid to the others and grabbed raquels limp hand who all is here raquels smile was weak jared steph mrs brown me thats all jared looked around gary stood right outside the door talking with other agents what the hell was taking the paramedics so damned long they wont get here in time jaro raquel turned her gaze on him i have that on the highest authority margo gasped im so sorry dont be raquel grinned again im really not in any pain you know this is my oscarwinning performance besides somehow you know dont you margo nodded tears streaming down her face to jareds amazement raquel winked what the hell séamus since shes on to me anyway after a moment a solemn expression crossed raquels face hey jaro wanna see something really scary jared watched raquels flaming red hair fade to blond her face changed from soft and feminine to hard and masculine blood stopped pumping from her wound and her breasts became flat he jerked his hands away meeting stephs gaze for a brief instant as they both realized there was no longer a wound to tend he looked at raquels new face again and recognition made him sway nick in the flesh so to speak jared couldnt speak a dead man was talking to him margo nick said mr honesttoafault here didnt cheat on you back at the university i set him up he sighed remorse evident in his eyes im sorry for that margo remained silent still holding nicks hand after a moment jared realized there was something he needed to say something nick needed to hear though he never would have believed the need was there before this i i forgive you after all who wouldnt love margo nick smiled for a moment he reminded jared of the smartassed kid whod given jared hell most of his life not much time nick patted margos hand and looked at her i love you but not the way he does but if he screws up im going to find a way to come back down here and kick his ass margo nodded you know i didnt buy into that affair garbage ah well nick shrugged thanks for that jared shook himself im losing my mind steph took nicks free hand and kissed the back of his knuckles ive missed you ah ive missed you too but dont be sad nick placed margos hand in jareds youll get to break in another brotherinlaw make him suffer just a little though will ya you bet i will steph sniffled and smiled at the same time how about you mrs brown nick looked at the older woman have you missed me too i i bought you tampons and evening primrose steph leapt to her feet to catch mrs brown but the woman shook her head and righted herself nick managed a weak smile and ill never forget it either and you nick turned his gaze on jared his expression solemn theres a letter for you in my desk you wont like it what nick blinked our father shouldve told you but i figure hes living his own kind of hell now the air whooshed out of jareds lungs were brothers he took jareds hand and gave it a firm shake their gazes met and held after a moment he looked upward i hear you séamus nick looked at margo again name your first daughter raquel okay hey if its a boy name him after his uncle nick nicks face transformed back into raquels the blood returned though no longer flowing her eyes closed and she released her final breath jared remained at raquels side with margo until the paramedics arrived nick his brotherwas already gone back hed said do dead lawyers really go to heaven mrs brown asked echoing jareds thoughts margo smiled this one did epilogue i never thought id say this to you but im impressed séamus said upon nicks return still numbed by all his experiences nick blinked several times before he realized it was all over raquel was dead and he was back where he belonged resignation eased through him and he gave séamus a nod thanks séamus patted nick on the shoulder well done your promotion is in the works good to hear nick walked over to the monitor and peered down at the scene hed left a few moments ago seeing jared and margo together didnt upset him now instead it made him smile this was as it should be fate destiny more not only did you learn about sacrifice but also to forgive nick turned to face séamus again oddly at peace the trouble with heroes by jo beverley refugees a dead word from the earth history books had shockingly come to life jenny hart first heard it at the print shop as she was closing her station ready to go home a queue of refugees that goes out of sight and beyond because the gates of anglia are closed for the first time during the day in living memory the office screen ran angliacom most of the day and jenny was used to treating it as background noise it took a moment to register but then she turned to stare at the wall the screen was split into max cells but sam witherspoon the manager had the volume pegged to the picture of a line of crowded vehicles on the road buses lorries even farmvees of one sort or another refugees sam echoed blankly like from plague famine and war jenny asked and they looked at each other shed asked a question but she knew he probably knew too the blighters she said he turned and picked up his case id better get home lock up all right sure jenny was still staring at the screen but she knew why he was rushing away he had a family children probably her mother would be fretting about her she picked up a phone and claimed a screen cell for it her mother liked to see her children when she was worried her younger brothers face came on first he took one look and yelled mum jenny madge hart appeared red hair wild eyes flashing are you all right of course i am mum im not outside you know but isnt it awful those poor people we should take them in but they say theres more and more and room elsewhere but theyll end up out in the dark i dont know it makes no difference mum blighters dont care whether its night or day all the same gaians didnt like to be outside at night its all panic her mother said clearly remembering her maternal duty to reassure her children if there was real trouble wed know thats right are you coming home for dinner not right now i want to see if i can find out whats really going on thats a good idea ask dan hell know bring him home for dinner as long as its not too late hes been looking peaky right mum jenny clicked off before she smiled her mother had fussed over dan since hed been a toddler long before hed been spotted as a fixer and sent off to the gaian center for investigation and control of the hostile amorphic native entities generally known as hellbane u now he was back and living on his own in the fixers flat she acted as if he might be starving to death it wasnt as if he didnt have a family of his own here she powered down the screen and checked the place over then went out coding the lock where to go for news the merrie england pub no she wanted to go up on the walls to see for herself god knew why a camera did a better job than human eyes but she was sure the walls were crowded with gawkers the olde english battlements and turrets had always seemed like a pleasant whimsy but as jenny hurried toward the nearest steps she wished they really could keep an enemy out they couldnt in nearly two hundred years anglia had only experienced one blighter attack but one was enough to show thick walls and drawbridges were no protection at all sixtyeight years ago in the lovely public gardens a blighter had killed a child in front of her horrified mother rendered her into a pile of greasy ash amid her pink pantsuit there were photos a statue in the gardens depicted a beautiful little girl holding a posy of flowers quite likely shed been a pest but she hadnt deserved to die in terror like that no one did hostile amorphic native entities that was how the exploratory services had labeled the one puzzling problem on an otherwise perfect settlement planet hanes technically accurate but it hadnt captured reality within a generation they had become known as hellbanes and some settlements had their own name as well anglia with typical wry humor called them blighters no coincidence that back on earth blight had been a disease that turned plants to slime but the frankland terreurs was perhaps a better word jenny could feel it now in herself and in the people all around milling in gossip heading to the walls or hurrying home to protect or be protected fear deep formless fear as if something terrible were blowing on the winds from the south an arm snagged around jennys waist and she whirled gyrth gyrth fletcher was thin longfaced with blond curls and beard that made him look as if hed stepped out of a medieval manuscript want to come down a dark passageway with me pet he asked in mock villain voice she winked at him depends what youre offering dont it a better view from an arrowslit lead on he worked for wall maintenance so hed know those passageways but the main appeal was company thatd blow away her creepy feelings she couldnt help stating theres no real danger to being outside in the dark right he didnt sound any happier than she was about it perhaps we should go and look for dan hell know whats going on hes probably in a stuffy room with the witan oh i suppose strange to think of dan as official like that theyd been born within weeks of each other three houses apart and according to her mother been stuck together like toffees until they reached that age when the other sex suddenly seems alien before theyd had time to get over that hed tested positive for fixing and been sent to hellbane u bloody fixing his three fortnights home each year hadnt been enough to keep the closeness over eight years especially when jenny had known hed not come back in the end fixers didnt they went where they were needed and they always seemed to be needed far away anglias fixer before dan had been from cathay you all right jenny sure wheres this arrowslit perhaps well be able to hear what people are saying out there they held hands so they wouldnt be pulled apart in the crowd but jenny was thinking about dan her childhood friend anglias fixer the one whod be expected to deal with any blighters who invaded here sure fixers trained to fight blighters but there werent any not here at least or anywhere far from the equator so they fixed other things broken machines broken bones broken hearts if the break was physical things that didnt fight back if theres trouble in the south do you think danll have to go to fight blighters there she asked gyrth stopped and shook his head at her hellbane ull deal with it theyre not going to leave the towns without a fixer are they not short of something desperate and it cant be desperate didnt dan say that blighters are so rare they have to hunt them to find one for the graduates to zap in their final test yes but then why the refugees youre such a worrier what did that old earth politician say we have nothing to fear but fear itself come on jenny went but asked have you ever thought its strange that dan came back here fixers dont he said once that he asked apparently most dont he grinned youve got to admit that a lot of times the town wishes he hadnt hes a right change from quiet miss lixiao that he was when dan had left hed been mischievous and thoughtful and hed come back wary and wild it was a good wild though making him the burning heart of a group of lively twentysomethings jenny wasnt sure she fit in with all the group but she spent time with them because of dan she and he werent toffees anymore but they were still friends friends enough to worry they reached high wall street and the width of it meant she could let go of gyrths hand thirty feetwide it was edged on one side by railings overlooking the lower street and on the other by shops pubs and cafes that backed onto the wall so how did they get to an arrowslit from here gyrth headed toward the space between porters pies and castlemans ironmongery down there jenny asked dubiously its safe but then he stopped waved and shouted jenny saw his sister polly and pollys husband assam who waved and walked toward them or rather polly waddled she was pregnant and bigger every time jenny saw her it didnt seem she could swell any more and not burst but she still had a few weeks to go were going to get a better view from a slit gyrth told them want to come ill stick polly protested but let herself be persuaded there was no real danger of polly getting stuck but it was definitely single file rubbish crunched under jennys shoes some of it stinky and despite the fact that the ginnel was open to the sky two stories above she began to feel trapped or perhaps the faint pulse of panic was because of refugees blighters and war it couldnt be true but then why all the people on the road she was ready to give up turn back when they reached the maintenance passage wide enough for two or three as a bonus it was either cleaned regularly or the rubbish didnt drift this far gyrth led them to an arrowslit directly above the gate from here the amplified official voice was clear though the response was indistinct driven by her strange urgency jenny wasnt her usual polite self she climbed first into the embrasure and worked forward to the slit it was six feet high but only about a foot wide even so she felt as if the world was spread before her and all the voices outside were clear whats going on gyrth asked someones asking distances to skanda jenny wished she knew how far back the queue stretched but it wove out of sight between a coppice not far away didnt they used to keep the space around castles clear she asked polly a history teacher so they could see an enemy coming certainly but its not as if anyone could see a blighter or stop it if they did shame i see how these work i could fire out at the enemy and they wouldnt be able to hit me seems a bit unsporting to me assam said clearly teasing polly frowned at him war was not a sport gyrth jumped up into the space let me have a look jenny she gave way and climbed back out thered been nothing out there to settle whatever was bothering her i dont know about that she said joining the other two tournaments and things and didnt they have what they called war games even in recent times probably still do polly said rubbing her belly they still have war though mostly robotic thank heavens for peaceful gaia jenny hugged herself suddenly cold in this dank shadowy space i wish our ancestors had chosen a more peaceful design all part of good old merrie england assam said merrie they used to pour boiling oil down on the attackers didnt they polly well probably not oil would have been expensive but boiling water and sometimes pitch which would stick ugh and the attackers would hurl dead cows back with catapults said assam clearly enjoying himself ugh again stop it assam it was bad enough learning about all this in school but very necessary said polly in her best teacher manner lest we forget then jenny heard the gates opening beneath her are they letting someone in gyrth yes must be an anglian in the family they cant keep native anglians out or their families then i suppose ill be able to go to erin if things get bad here not unless your mothers with you polly pointed out she was always precise about such details and would you really want to leave of course not it was just a thought jenny said it lightly no one else seemed seriously concerned but something was pressing on her mind a kind of foreboding that defied words as a halfremembered dream does assam was still teasing polly about castles he was probably trying to amuse her but jenny thought she was getting upset talking of hurling cows she interjected do you still show that film the grail one though i suppose they were hurling cows from inside monty python and the holy grail polly said of course its a key work to understanding ancient earth warfare the words fetchez lavache illuminating the strife that arises out of separate languages and the consequent misunderstandings and also the instinctive desire for union in the creation of a blended language franglois i got an aplus on that paper mainly by paraphrasing the textbooks if you got an aplus you must have done more than that jenny shrugged i liked the film even though i didnt really understand it it is deep i dont think weve truly grasped the meaning of shrubbery the dark warriors need for healthy beautiful plants rather than destruction assam stated that certainly was straight from the textbook i feel theres more polly said after all weve only just made the connection that explains monty which is jenny was glad for the distraction even though she felt as if she was back in sixthform history someone recently found a film in the archive called the full monty monty polly said with the air of one sharing an exciting treat turns out to mean naked naked snake no no the snake is obvious its the serpent in the garden of eden and that connects to shrubbery of course and holy grail is the ultimate freedom from strife to which all humanity aspires but nakedness builds powerfully on the concept of eden dont you see nakedness in eden honesty and openness threatened by the python of deceit ah said assam but what about the rabbit jenny wanted to kick him polly merely gave him a look we dont quite understand the rabbit yet i think it warns that the threat to the grail to eden can trick us by appearing harmless well that rules out the blighters weve known they were bloody nasty since first settlement i dont know jenny said i think wed have mostly forgotten about them if they didnt show schoolkids that film of the scout being ashed thats a crucial part of gaian history polly protested perhaps but it gave me nightmares for weeks assam moved closer to the embrasure anything new going on there gyrth not really gyrth turned and climbed out lets go to the merrie see what people are saying there no one argued they headed out but jenny carried gloom with her remembering the film of the scouts death settlement was always preceded by exploration and the first wave the scouts wore full recording equipment that sent realtime data to the ship new worlds are unpredictable after all and corpses dont tell what killed them in this case the data told the tale but left a mystery even though the suitsys recorded degrees it had shown nothing absolutely nothing of what had attacked the various sensors had recorded no change in air pressure temperature or radiation the body system readouts however had charted extreme stress a racing heart rapid breathing and skyhigh adrenaline and blood pressure the scout had gasped and expressed terror but she had screamed only once at the point of death the oblivious suitsys had kept on recording even when the person inside had become a pile of ash but it had registered as little after the event as before hostile amorphic native entity jenny could imagine how often that data disk had been viewed and reviewed but in the end gaia had been approved for settlement thered been no further attacks and in all other respects it was the best epp earth potential planet ever found it had the rarest of rare earths to provide an economic base and needed little amendment it had even been free of anything close to a sentient species that might complicate ownership the perfect place but when they emerged into the light and bustle of high wall street jenny sucked in a deep breath shed not thought she was claustrophobic does anyone smell something funny she asked just the chip shop fat gyrth said look theres dan jenny turned suddenly breathing more easily dan and he looked normal not worried at all everything must be all right he was in his fixer uniform of brown shirt and trousers with assorted badges and braids of significance to those who understood them but there was nothing special about his looks average build average height brown hair and blue eyes in an average face like her really but not anymore something drew people to dan fixer like flies to jam a fizz in the air a brighter light an energy that meant there was never a dull time when dan was part of a group jenny thought she could feel the fizz now even though he seemed relaxed as if this were just another evening in anglia work over time to play i wondered where everyone was poking around down cracks between buildings peering out through arrowslits jenny said hooking arms with him as they all turned to go down the circular staircase to ground level and reanalyzing monty python polly tell dan about the monty stuff that kept things light and away from blighters for a while now with dan by her side and showing no sign of concern jenny wanted to forget about it all but it wasnt so easy despite the chatter and laughter that something grated on her like an off note in music when she and dan ended up together behind the others she had to ask are there really more blighter attacks near the equator his look was quick and perhaps guarded yes but dont worry its all under control leave it leave it but she couldnt then why are people pouring north she thought he wasnt going to answer but he pulled a face youll hear soon enough central has recommended that everyone in the affected areas leave until the hellbanes are stamped out after all one person ashed is one person too many he declared it as a trite motto but assam caught it and turned back damn right but the problem wont reach here will it polly cant travel now polly and gyrth stopped to listen blighters have always been more active near the equator dan pointed out there are plenty of fixers there and hellbane u as well with the most skilled and experienced of us theyll deal with it jenny relaxed and polly said she was too tired to walk assam suggested a tram and gyrth went with them jenny and dan strolled along in comfortable silence for a while but she had questions and this seemed the time to ask them fixers can feel blighters cant they thats how you hunt them i wouldnt exactly call it hunting just stand around and they come i thought you had trouble finding them true but the only way we know is to bait a trap with what cow pig then you zap it thats the idea ideally before it ashes the poor beast do fixers ever fail i mean die very rarely they paused to let a tram pass and jenny thought about that shed never imagined that fixing might be dangerous what does it feel like he pulled a face it cant really be described its like a nightmare it evaporates if we try to describe it as they crossed the tracks she asked can nonfixers sense this at a distance i mean his look was quick and sharp youre sensing something now no maybe im not a fixer dan dont even think it i dont but some people have a trace what are you picking up she tried to explain but it was as hed said like trying to tell a dream she didnt like the fact that it seemed to make sense to him so youre feeling the same thing but much stronger i assume so so they are coming she asked no seriously theres no need to worry jen the action is all in the hotter lands she stopped what action the blighters and the fixers dealing with them he grabbed her hand come on the others will be there long before us but three steps later he stopped and put his hand to his ear he muttered something but pulled the fine wire from his earring round to his mouth fixer after a moment he pushed it back kid fallen off high wall near watling luckily only a broken leg want to come of course she rarely got a chance to see him work and it always delighted her hand in hand they ran across to the nearest tram line and dan waved one down his uniform his authority he seemed to have a map of the lines in his head they jagged rapidly across town to the west wall where they found a boy on the ground with two nurses in attendance and a small crowd of gawkers the patient was about thirteen with freckles and ginger hair a tubby darkhaired lad hovered looking more shocked than his injured friend it turned out that the patient had already had something for the pain right leg said the nurse who was kneeling beside him tibia and fibula i think might be spinal too names jeff bowlby thought you could fly jeff said dan sitting crosslegged beside him just fell will it hurt dan smiled at him not at all relax he put his hands on the boys leg which was still covered by his jeans jenny knew the rules everyone did in case of an accident do nothing except pain relief until the fixer comes unless its necessary to prevent death the youth tensed anyway but then his eyes widened it tingles dan didnt say anything there really was nothing to see of what he was doing except a stillness that was very undanlike but this time jenny realized she could feel something tingling that was one way to put it what she felt was in the air or in her mind or rather in a part of her mind she hadnt known was there oh she didnt like this she didnt like it at all she wasnt a fixer a man rushed up jeffy jenny and the second nurse took an arm each before he could interfere hes fine said the nurse his voice steady mr bowlby is it no great harm done and its being fixed well just need some details from you the young man led the father away to comfort him with record taking and sting him with a bill copayment for foolishness all right dan said jenny turned back to see a slight shudder pass through him as he raised his hands from the boys leg thats good as new but take care of my work okay jeff lets see if youve done any other damage he passed his hands over the boy pausing for a moment in one spot then rose easily to his feet all clear the boy started to sit up but the nurse beside him held him down oh no you dont well help your father take you home and keep an eye on you until the shock and medicine wear off she looked up at dan good job fixer dan gave the nurse his tally and she typed the code in that would authorize his payment from anglias health program jenny let him guide her toward the tram stop thinking about fixing really thinking about it for the first time does that take a lot of your power not particularly a string of those and id be wiped for a while normally she thought about querying that but he went on as it is i welcome the work if i dont use the energy it tends toflare flarings bad it can turn me a bit wild wilds your greatest charm dan rutherford and you know it he laughed i like it when you call me that i know people like my energy but theres an edge there that put her worry into words she thought he danced along an edge flaring good word for it flaring high spirits that led to exciting times but that threatened a conflagration perhaps mostly of himself though fixers could fix so many problems they rarely lived to a hundred its the magic he said putting an arm around her a shiver rippled up her back at his touch not particularly unpleasant but a shiver and for a moment she thought that was what he was referring to but then she realized he meant the flaring you mean fixing magics a better word a more realistic one realistic it doesnt exist who knows why so many earth stories if it never existed and they show it as dangerous stuff magic creatures who lurk in dark places and trick people to their deaths or seduce them with gifts and feasts then keep them prisoner forever or make them dance themselves to death for amusement that fits she eased out of his arm thats superstition and its nothing to do with what you do with fixing isnt it she didnt want this not now with her stomach queasy and her mind jangled by his touch and by an illusion of ashes on the wind but his silence demanded something and friends should be friends so in the end she asked well is it he leaned against the tram shelter theres no way to compare is there they say it doesnt work on earth but im not sure when they tried ive thought of going back to find out but who can afford it someone once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic thats another way of looking at it the tram glided up and they climbed on he led the way to the back where they used to sit as kids but he talked quietly even though there was no one close fixers arent normal jen you have to see that they warn us to be solitary that its safer not to return home to keep aloof wherever we go aloof it pulled a laugh from her failed that part of the course didnt you abjectly and i insisted on coming back home a fleeting grin faded but sometimes i think theyre right no theyre not bad enough that you had to go away for years people marry out your mother did or in in that case thats different thats love and i wonder how people can love enough to do a thing like that so do didnt like it jen it was the first time hed said that and hed been back two years the tram stopped in market square then however and they got out and crossed to the merrie england pub gyrth polly and assam were at an outside table with a bunch of the others everyone hailed dan as if he was rain in midsummer asking where hed been chairs shuffled yas who looked like a princess from the arabian nights snagged dans sleeve and towed him down beside her jenny went to a seat at the other end of the table between gyrth and rolo she needed space things were shifting and she didnt know what to do magic seduced with gifts and feasts driven to dance to death for some reason dan had wanted to tell her about that and now it was scarily easy to imagine when she remembered some of the wild times often here at the merrie england not tonight though beneath chatter the mood was definitely not merrie and it wasnt just her group the tavern even the square seemed subdued thoughts of war returned to trouble her people didnt flee their homes for no reason a quarrel started behind them then yas complained about some bitch whod stolen a promotion from her and the means shed used back in the tavern a crash suggested someone had dropped a whole tray of glasses raised voices but then it changed being so aware of dan jenny saw him do it saw him open his gifts and set everyone alight saw him create a wild dan fixer night yas laughed and let her complaints drop the shouting stopped someone called for music jenny went with rolo and tom to fetch the instruments from the back room and started rollicking folk songs that wasnt unusual three nights a week they did it for pay it went beyond that though market square was ringed with taverns and restaurants all with tables outside on two levels soon everyone was joining in thumping hands and feet with the rhythm fiddling into a sweat jenny glanced at dan there was no way to tell whether he was still making it happen but she knew he was dancing to death other musicians joined them and the crowd urged the group of them out into the center of the square jenny ended up on a precarious spot high on the central statue of the first ship to gaia leaving earth perched up there surrounded by singing and stamping she felt like the heart of a brightburning bonfire that shone out on hundreds of faces at tables in windows and crowding the open space as well she realized people were being drawn here from all around like moths to a flame or like a firestorm sucking everything into infernal destruction and what became of those at the center of such a storm where was dan she found him leaning against the base of the ship singing along with the rest this couldnt be bad dan wasnt bad he was just flaring burning off his whatever and creating light against the dark at the same time but why tonight did dan the fixer need so much light laughter and song why did he have so much energy to burn even after fixing that boys leg what did it say about the blighters jenny escaped that by diving back into the music tom called an end to it at midnight weve got to stop ill get fired if my mates turn up he was a policeman last song he called in his strong voice despite protests they huddled trying to come up with the best piece to wrap this up without a riot gaia jenny said tom looked at her the anthem you can sing it cant you i think its right no one argued which was strange they werent in the habit of singing the planets syrupy anthem based on a bad poem by one of the first settlers each settlement had its own anthem but gaia was dragged out at any planetarywide event usually to groans jenny wondered where the idea had come from and glanced at dan but he was sitting now an adoring woman on each arm she didnt even know them flies to jam shed better watch it she wasnt going to ruin a friendship by turning stupid over dan but if he wanted the anthem he could have it she struck up a chord and tom started to sing in his deep strong voice what a wonder it is to find a planet like this in the limitless oceans of space where the air is pristine and the oceans are clean oh gaia you sweet blessed place though hellbanes may ash our dream will not crash we will cherish our new home forever the crowd was singing along by then and in the chorus the thunder of it seemed to rattle the windows all around with the gates closed and blighters attacking the words had new meaning power crept up jennys spine almost making her hands fumble on her fiddle she glanced down at dan again he had his head back and his eyes closed as if he was absorbing something from the air we come from an earth under burden of birth its beauty long gone and turned rotten but here it is new a rich gift to the few oh gala here pain is forgotten though hellbanes may ash our dream will not crash we will cherish our new home forever with a treasure so grand with such beauty to hand what can we be but peaceful and giving never strife never war we will spill blood no more oh gaia you were made for blessed living though hellbanes may ash our dream will not crash we will cherish our new home forever it was the crowd rather than tom that repeated the chorus one last time almost softly despite the hundreds of voices though hellbanes may ash our dream will not crash we will cherish our new home forever like a lamp turned down the roaring energy settled to a glow and everyone began to drift peacefully away jenny sat in the convenient dip between ship and earth because her legs had turned weak the others looked pretty shocked the power tom said the magic she thought and she might have a bit of it dan stood waiting to help her down but she jumped down by herself then hurried back to the tavern with her fiddle the publican ozzy rooke shook his head youre supposed to get the customers drinking not out there singing the planetary anthem he was joking though and he gave them all a free round of beer dan sat beside jenny at the bar she made a business of picking up her glass because it let her move an inch away she probed the air around him nothing nothing more than the usual aura that was dan had he burned it all up in that singing by the time ozzy threw them out and locked up the city was quiet a soft quiet that seemed infinitely safe they set off home together but rolo and tom split off not far from the square jenny dan gyrth and yas carried on in a group singing teasing and even tussling sometimes like kids again or like teenagers dan kept apart a bit and jenny remembered that hed missed most of these nights the singing the horseplay the maneuvering for possible bedmates she noticed yas maneuvering for dan thatd be nothing new but she was glad he wasnt responding tonight in chestnut copse yas went into her building alone with a last hopeful look gyrth turned off at the next corner leaving jenny and dan alone for the last little way nothing unusual in that except that for the first time she was nervous it was just that it had been a strange day but she hoped he wouldnt touch wouldnt even want to talk perhaps he felt the same because he walked beside her in silence and by the time they came to his place that silence was comforting as a lambswool blanket it said that everything was all right the fixers flat took up the whole ground floor of a large house they held parties there sometimes because no one else had such a space to themselves jenny still lived at home they paused at the bottom of the steps night then jenny said ill walk you to your place she stared at him you expect a blighter to leap out of the pavement you never know but then he smiled im just not ready to go to bed tension ricked her shoulders but she said oh okay then thanks he touched her arm youre feeling the effects of the music arent you no yes but it was okay it was good she might as well tackle it did you make it happen i helped he turned her and they walked on i am the towns fixer after all what were you fixing the closing of the gates upset a lot of people how often did he do things like that could he did he fix peoples moods fix hers they were on her street now a tall terrace facing a small park called surrey green its a brightburning night and im not ready for sleep he said do you want to walk around the park and talk some more it was the dead hour on a chilly night and jenny felt drained but she couldnt not go something important hovered here they walked through a gap in the hedge but as soon as they were away from the sparse street lights she couldnt see what was in front of her feet she stopped im likely to break a leg dan put an arm around her then youre with the right person come on itll still hurt it came out light as shed hoped but her entire skin was jumping as she let him lead her forward night vision too right and what else there was talk about fixers and sex yas spoke about dan in a way that suggested things but this was dan theyd played in the sandbox here together say something jenny something light and normal the anthem really is terrible isnt it awful but you know that used to mean full of awe and terrible might not be a word to toss around these days no talking about terror or awe perhaps we should write a new one i dont think you can do that with an anthem it has special powers no talking about special powers do you think yasll resign over not getting that promotion no shell sabotage her rival and get her way in the end poor rival some people are forces of nature jenny knew then that he wanted to talk about forces of nature about powers about blighters was it because shed admitted to sensing things revealed that she might have a bit of whatever made up the fixers shed rather bury that in the surrey green sandbox distant streetlights glinted on bits of the playground and she grabbed on to the past remember the hours we used to spend on the swings here and the high slide you certainly kept the fixer busy i sometimes wonder if that caused it if its infectious she stiffened on the edge of pulling away really he laughed and snagged her tight no i could always do weird stuff mum and dad tried to get me to hide it but testing sniffs it out anyway remember that time you caught the cricket ball funny and thought youd broken your finger yes you had jenny remembered the horrible pain that had suddenly eased so that when some adults came running they thought shed been making a fuss about nothing theyd been what eight dan hadnt even touched her hed just stood there saying stupid things like are you all right jen she knew he didnt glow or anything but shed thought he had to touch she tried to remember whether thered been a tingle shed probably been in too much pain were lucky arent we she said you and me she bumped him with her hip gaia the perfect planet healthy fruitful rare earths to pay our way and fixers to mend almost everything and blighters he pointed out perhaps every grail has to have a python id rather have the fluffy bunny but blighters arent too high a price to pay jenny thought of the refugees still could the price become too high when theres no choice the price can never be too high can it earths recovering but its still trying to ship people out rather than take them back even spread around other colonies wed be an unbalancing factor so its gaia or nothing thats all right i cant imagine leaving they wove through the playground where the swings the slides and the roundabout sat still as if waiting for ghostly children a vision swept upon her of the whole of gaia like this the blighters didnt destroy things only animals and people theres no real danger is there from the blighters i mean to gaia he didnt immediately answer and chill seeped into her bones he was going to be honest and she wished she hadnt asked theres danger he said at last grabbing a bar of the roundabout and spinning it as if doing so might whirl something away people are being ashed a lot of people and even more animals but the local fixers and teams from hellbane u should be able to control things especially now that people are leaving theyve been told to kill all the large animals before they leave so the blighters wont have anything to feed on feed on she moved out of his arm spinning the slowing roundabout as an excuse where else do the victims go theyre consumed so it has to be a kind of feeding of energy we assume the blighters are a form of energy jenny shivered even though it wasnt really so shocking it was more that shed not thought much about blighters before why should she they were nasty but they hardly ever popped up even near the equator and if one did a fixer got rid of it before it could do more damage like pimples of a lethal sort the roundabout had slowed again she gave it a running spin and jumped on so youre going to starve them and thatll be an end of it thats the plan he caught it spun it again and joined her but on the other side for balance the world whirled but they were steady inside this circle what are the blighters doing dan what are they what do they want we dont know despite generations of study we know grot all theyre not easy to study until recently they were hard to even find thereve always been people who thought they were an hallucination or a neurosis brought on by bad air or by planetary contamination of our food food we brought in earth plants but they feed on gaian soil as we do the roundabout slowed and slowed and neither of them spun it again blighters cant be imaginary jenny said what about the ashes thats the rub isnt it but apparently theres something called spontaneous combustion its been recorded on earth people suddenly burst into flames and burn up leaving acrid ash it doesnt fit because blighters cause no flames or smoke but we humans hate something we cant measure and explain like magic she said stepping off the still roundabout like magic he agreed joining her on the grass the late night and the chill were getting to her aching in her bones shivering over her skin especially now they were apart how do you zap a blighter we sense them coming and instinctively fix them it seems to kill them its hard to explain we dont really understand what we do we just know it works so the fixers down south are fixing things but they need help from hellbane u there are rather a lot of blighters why so many now no one knows no one knows much do they he laughed but wryly no she was suddenly exhausted as much by a sense of helplessness as by the late hour and that helplessness came from dan i have to get to bed she said i have to go to work tomorrow music usually invigorates me but tonight it wiped me out without protest he turned to cross the soccer pitch toward the houses beyond the hedge but he put an arm around her and she found it too comforting to resist im sorry he said i dont need much sleep i sometimes forget that normal people do normal on the street beneath the lights she gently moved away from him trying to ignore a drag as if two sticky surfaces were pulling apart stuck like two toffees you dont sleep much because of your fixer abilities the energy of it yes he took her hand rubbing the knuckles with his thumb there are things that help all kinds of interesting muscles contracted but she knew perhaps had always known that her friend dan fixer was too strong a drink for her spontaneous combustion you should have gone with yas then the streetlight two doors down showed his smile i dont think so he raised her left hand and kissed the palm a lovers move designed to invite without words anytime youd like jen sleep tight she watched him walk away anytime she had only to ask she turned and pressed the lock her exhausted mind staggering around perilous possibilities she stumbled up the stairs and fell into bed thinking shed probably dreamed the whole thing for that and a bundle of other excellent reasons she couldnt imagine taking him up on the offer for a few days everyone spent time on the wall watching the stream of refugees but then they lost interest there was nothing new to see it was depressing and anglians were growing more worried about their own security the town was overcrowded but that wasnt the problem it was worry about whether they too would end up on the road north an occasional group of refugees had a citizen in the family and had to be let in those people told tales of whole families ashed angliacom showed charts and maps that tracked the hellbane wave though the announcers assured everyone that the fixers down south had everything under control and that the refugees should be able to go home any day however part of the screen constantly showed the warning that refugees must slaughter large animals before leaving it was presented as a kindness the animals would lack care and possibly be victims of a terrifying death but it was of course to starve the blighters jenny wondered how many people recognized that she also wondered how many saw how the news was sugaring everything and sensed the darker truth was she the only one to feel she could taste bitter ashes on the wind who sensed the peril in the earth thrumming stronger and stronger coming coming coming if the starvethemtodeath plan was working why did the pressure grow day by day attempts to contact settlements near the affected areas either failed or found people frightened and planning to move gaia central was having trouble keeping track of who was where just possibly the first settlers had made a mistake when theyd rejected earths efficient communication system and strong centralized government paradise didnt need that theyd said but gaia wasnt paradise anymore tension was making her jumpy and queasy drops got her through her workday but she stayed home at night watching the screen with her family dan came over once he checked her out but said there was nothing he could fix he looked worried and she knew then that the way she felt was to do with the blighters he looked fine however and she heard that every night at the merrie was a wild night she decided all that energy might help her and went there after work but it was nothing like the music night dan flared with too much energy edgy energy that screamed down her nerves and twisted up her spine giving her a crashing headache no one else seemed bothered but she fled for her own salvation and because she thought dan might burn himself to ash there was nothing she could do or nothing she wanted to do shed caught his eyes on her once hed held the moment before looking away there must be a hundred women ready to have sex with dan fixer especially now and she couldnt not now spontaneous combustion then pollys baby was born sick jenny was at the hospital with some of the others waiting for the exciting news she caught a glimpse of the baby being rushed from delivery room to intensive care in a red pod incubator it looked tired of life already a word came into her mind blight a tightfaced nurse came out of pollys room jenny stepped in her way has the fixer been called its not a problem that can be fixed the nurse walked away and jenny turned to the others there must be something dan can do yas gave her a look this isnt a broken bone or a gash jenny you think he walks on water the sharpness of it took jenny back it wouldnt hurt to ask if you want to chase him down jenny controlled an angry retort i do she strode to a wall phone and punched in his code nothing she left a message then tried ozzy dan wasnt at the merrie she tried three other possible places nothing nothing nothing if only she had his buzzer code but that was for official business shed always thought gaias ways right but on earth and most other worlds everyone had a buzzer they could phone and be phoned anywhere anytime a horrible thought but right now she wanted it she should give up but yas was looking at her with something close to a smirk so she went out to search she hopped a tram and rode it around low wall then took another in to market square where the hell was he he might be at the hospital by now she leapt off the tram at the next stop and ran to a phonepost he wasnt there and the baby was fading fast she turned from the post and found dan there she knew from his face but asked anyway you heard yes so what are you going to do theres nothing i can do what do you mean youre a fixer he looked worn not so much tired but fined down burned down i cant do anything jen do you think assam and polly want me there to toss out platitudinous comforts no they want you there to do something no matter how small think she jerked back feeling for a moment as if he might shake her my father died last year id have fixed that if i could do miracles wouldnt i he sucked in a breath and ran a hand through his hair this is why they recommend that fixers dont return to their homes too many personal pressures his resistance was like a hand pushing her away but she said since you do live here cant you at least try come on she took his hand and tugged after a moment he went with her but she felt his reluctance like a weight she pulled him onto the west street tram but stayed standing near the doors she couldnt bear to sit down are you all right of course but he looked almost as weary as the sick baby and she was going over his words hed said he couldnt do anything had he lost his powers had he blasted them away they got off at the hospital stop and she steered him toward the main entrance but then he balked and turned aside dan she hurried after dan stop please he turned down a side street and she caught him at a small door what are you doing he pressed a lock hand print not code he used this door often the door opened and she followed him in watched as he took a set of hospital grays off a shelf and pulled them on over his uniform jen think what happens if dan fixer walks around the hospital everyone wants you to heal them why hadnt she thought of that he added a stretchy helmet one designed for a man with a beard which left only his eyes uncovered he looked older harder or perhaps he was why dont you then heal everything for a start theres not enough of me to go round but i can only fix things to make them right which means mostly injuries disease is part of nature like death i cant fix nature he was angry at the limits of his powers or at her ill look at the baby he said but i doubt its fixable he turned and headed out of the room jenny followed wincing how arrogant to drag him here as if she knew better than the hospital she ached for polly for assam and for dan who must want to make their baby healthy as much as she did at the intensive care nursery he said something to a staff member and jenny was given a gray coverall and cap she didnt want to go with him but shed dragged him here she must they walked through the steriline into the gently lit room where soft music played with a beat that was surely that of an adult human heart it was so peaceful surely it couldnt be a place of death at least gaia accepted the latest technology for problems like this there were four redlaced incubator pods and two nurses moving between them constantly checking the sheath monitors on their arms dan paused at each incubator then stopped at one he signaled a nurse and she hurried over jenny saw the sudden light in the nurses eyes and tears pricked at her own dan had found something he could fix but the name card said smithers it wasnt pollys baby she went closer and saw a tiny baby under a multicolored mesh its chest labored and its legs and arms seemed grayish instead of pink dan pushed his hand through the mesh and touched the child the baby clutched his finger as babies do but to jenny it looked as if the mite recognized a lifeline the little chest still rose and fell but less desperately and the fingers and toes began to turn pink the mesh began to fade and retract heart said a nurse coming up beside jenny valve she went on i was hoping it would be fixable when dan came around im glad hes early its always special to see him work he comes every day or when we call we wait if we can he has to have a life yes he did jenny was ashamed that she didnt know his real life at all some friend she was he eased his finger out of the babys clutch then touched the round cheek smiling a little but the smile faded as he moved on to the last incubator he wont be able to help there the nurse said obviously surprised jenny trailed after to see the flaccid laboring baby it already looked ancient and withered dan put his hands on the shell and leaned there she tried to believe that he was doing something something miraculous but she knew it was simple grief she wanted to say sorry sorry sorry he turned and walked out she hurried after since im here i might as well do my rounds youll want to be with polly and assam it was a dismissal but he added if they ask tell them im sorry then he was gone and jenny fought tears for him as much as for the baby as she worked her way out of the hospital gear after that things only got worse polly and assam had been the first of jennys friends to choose pregnancy and the disaster appalled them all pregnancy was supposed to lead smoothly to a beautiful healthy baby the other babies in the pods had shown that problems happened that perhaps disaster was natural but it felt all wrong on top of so many other all wrongs she couldnt stop thinking that it was blight carried as spores on the wind polly and assam didnt blame dan but they avoided him jenny thought about telling them that hed visited the nursery but would it make it better or worse two weeks after the birth they decided to visit assams family in araby even though it was farther south the goodbye party was subdued dan attended but briefly jenny looked at him and thought his flame was dying was it drowning in the blighters growing power or was he as sick as she was of the bitter catch at the back of the throat the amorphic taste of ashes on the wind or was it simply the dead baby she couldnt fight off strange thoughts about that had dan struggled for a moment over that incubator hed talked about hard decisions hed used the word cant that didnt just mean able to it could mean allowed to she cornered him just outside the room could you have saved little hal he looked at her eyes guarded yes what he put fingers over her lips not here he grabbed her arm and drew her out of the house into the street there are rules jen we cant fix what shouldnt be fixed who says who says what shouldnt be fixed he shook his head as if it buzzed the rules theres a difference between something broken and something sick nature must rule in the end she stared at him you let your father die because of rules he didnt answer but she knew it was true she turned and walked away walked home to find her parents talking about it being too long since theyd visited cousin mike in erin obviously the soothing reports of progress and imminent solution werent working anymore or the soothing had stopped when she turned on the angliacom screen cell the announcer was talking about the blighters swarming it made them sound like maniac bees where then was the honey however we will soon see victory in the hellbane wars that was the first time shed heard it officially described as a war she knew war theyd studied it in school armies and battles diplomats and negotiations one side knew who the other side was knew what the enemy wanted if this was war what did the enemy want where were the negotiators with whom they could bargain for mercy then one day a news camera accidentally caught an ashing the camera was panning a deserted settlement but then switched to a person in the distance walking toward the road the woman in dusty shirt and trousers a knapsack over one shoulder waved and hurried forward probably hoping for a lift then she looked around as if shed heard something or caught something out of the corner of her eye and she became afraid jenny watched tasting that fear as the woman began to run calling for help but constantly turning and twisting as if trying to track an enemy she stumbled scrambled up then stopped frozen mouth wide in a scream of terror there was nothing to see of the blighter not so much as dust stirring in a breeze the picture juddered though showing the operators fear the mike caught his mutters along with the scream cant do anything cant help god help us gotta go gotta go but he stayed holding the camera as steady as he could to record the anonymous victims abrupt translation into empty clothing and that small pile of ash no explosion no fire no wind just dissolution jennys mother broke down in tears then declared that they were all leaving now jenny protested i dont even know cousin mike thats not the point and you know it her mother turned to jennys ashen fifteenyearold brother charlie grab some clothes not too many i have work to do jenny said gaia can live without another brochure or handbook no you cant take all those books bill she yelled to jennys father pack for charlie will you jenny love please you saw that film you want to stay for that i dont think we can run from it mum if the fixers cant stop them the blighters are going to eat us all not my family they arent her mother dashed around gathering little things photographs documents of course the fixersll fix it itll just take a little more time and during that time its stupid to stand in the way jenny helped stuff the things in a bag youre probably right mum but i cant go im sorry she realized then that part of the reason was dan she was still angry with him but she couldnt abandon him she helped everyone pack went with them to the station and bit back tears as she waved them off she didnt regret her decision only her mothers tearful despair she wandered back home because the house was so empty she started going to the merrie every night though it wasnt very merrie it was never more than half full and people often asked for melancholy songs rolo and gyrth had left yas was still around perhaps because she seemed to be attached to tom now and he couldnt leave being a policeman so who was with dan these days from the look of him the odd time he turned up at the pub perhaps no one he was anglias sole defense when the blighters arrived perhaps she should but she felt too fragile now she thought shed break under any pressure beyond even dan fixers ability to mend jenny was playing a scottish lament when she saw the urgent news line scrolling across the message section of the silent screen ozzy switched the sound up and she stopped playing in a new move to put an end to the blighters an announcer said all the fixers have been called to the front reports from hellbane u what the hecks the front someone asked old earth war term replied ozzy the place where one army meets the other dont reckon it can be far from here now as if in answer a map popped up showing the red tide lapping at anglias borders pap ozzy said muting the sound again but he added perhaps its time to close the bloody dismal england jenny could only think that dan was going to leave to fight blighters and gaia was losing the war any idea where dan is ozzy havent seem him in a couple of days luv perhaps hes on his way no could she sense him or was it wishful thinking she left her fiddle there on the bar and went in search stupid stupid to have kept her distance all these weeks he was probably right about nature hed told her hoping for understanding and shed walked away the pubs were quiet the music somber and dan was nowhere to be found not in the square not at his place not at the hospital not at his familys home his mother and brothers hadnt left but looked as if they already had news of his death jenny stopped outside the house fighting tears weeks ago hed mentioned the experts from hellbane u going to help the local fixers in the fight since then the blighters had only grown in strength if the experts had failed what could simple fixers like dan do die thats what she remembered another old war term cannon fodder perhaps he was already on his way but she wandered the streets looking for him hoping against hope that shed have a chance to say something do something to help before he left eventually she gave up stopping to lean against some railings then she realized they were the ones around the public gardens the place where the one solitary blighter had dared to pop up in anglia the perfume of herbs and flowers played sweetly on the night air and she thought how strange it was that all of this all the simulations of earth theyd created would survive when the people were ash she turned in through the wrought iron gates and followed the wandering path toward the lake and the statue of the little victim and there near the statue stood dan tossing stones into the lake jenny paused purpose tangling into uncertainty perhaps he wanted to be alone hed have no trouble finding company if he needed it then he turned and held out a hand jen there was welcome in it but there was more after a teetering moment she went forward and put her hand in his are you going to have to go i am going you havent been called im not sure theres anyone left to call me the news i gave angliacom that information he slid his hand free and went back to tossing stones into the glassy water plop plop plop each stone made a mesmerizingly slow arc as if the air was denser than it should be what do you mean no ones left to call theyre all gone plop the staff from hellbane plop the fixers down south plop a chilly emptiness weakened her and she sat where lawn met the lakes shingled edge dan stopped tossing the stones theres just the ones in the northern and southern settlements weve decided we might as well have a go as they used to say it was like listening to nonsense who used to say he turned to her and she thought he looked more relaxed than shed seen him in weeks but thin too thin men in war stories its usually men ive been checking out books and films about war lawrence of arabia the dam busters reach for the sky sirius v looking for suggestions did you find any be brave dont give up and have the right weapons tempting to think him mad or joking like the old dan but he was deadly serious bad adjective jenny whats going to happen then im going to die but he added with an almost dannish smile in the best tradition of english heroism im going to keep a stiff upper lip and take as many with me as i can jenny wanted to say no to deny reality but she knew it was the flat truth were all going to die i suppose is there anything the rest of us can do give us reason to try perhaps if you fail you die isnt that reason enough he sat on the grass facing her im worn out by the waiting in a way i want it over she shivered recognizing a reflection of her own state living and dying dont seem particularly important anymore he said but gaia is i mean us the people whove made gaia home im going to fight for that as long as i can perhaps i can make a difference she reached out and touched his hand i know what itll cost though jen you probably know too why it seems easier to die now get it over with it was the ashes in the wind put into words praying she read him right she moved close and grasped his tense hands then raised one for the lovers kiss as he had done to her so long ago his hand flexed slightly against her jaw are you preparing to sacrifice yourself for the cause no if he could face the blighters she could face honesty just hoping he closed his eyes then drew her hand to his mouth i called you tonight bad form when youd not taken up my offer but i need you jen you now breathtakingly she didnt doubt it thered been no reason for her wandering search and in fact she hadnt wandered but had drifted here like a feather on the wind how how did you call me he drew her close and his lips traced her cheek her ear her jaw im practicing rusty skills if im going to fight im going to fight dirty i dont understand you dont need to and she didnt there was nothing rusty about his lovemaking skills and she sensed the something extra it was little to do with her no matter what he said but everything to do with magic with death with more than death it sprang from hovering annihilation fear of it surrounded them and played in the magic of their minds fear of a void which he fought with fire she let him undress her because he wanted to and because each incidental brush of his hands on her skin was like liquid pleasure it flowed over her and into her and she pushed off his shirt to get to his skin to give back to draw more when she was naked she stripped him stroked him cradled him then he was in her slow relentless eternal building a dizzying power she might have been afraid of dying if things like that mattered anymore all that mattered now was the cauterizing conflagration and the drifting postapocalyptic dream she came back to reality to find that she was lying on her back on soft grass with dan half over her his head cradled on her breasts he seemed relaxed replete and she felt the same way what a fool shed been they could have been easing each others bodies minds and souls like this all along so much wasted time and now he was going off to die rusty skills she said playing with his shoulderlength hair longer than he used to wear it is that a complaint she heard the smile in it so didnt answer shed rather not think at all but her mind was coming back to life protesting fate the stones what were you doing controlling matter he lazily pulled a handful of grass and tossed it in the air she watched it hang there then suddenly shower down on them sorry he said brushing it off her still rusty the fire was in his touch though and brushing led to nibbling nibbling to kissing and kissing to another apocalypse an easy way to mindless pleasure but reality returned he couldnt die she had to save him someone must have sent for help she said weeks ago but it wont arrive in time and anyway what do federal bureaucrats know about blighters but he sat and pulled her up to face him any response might arrive in time to take some survivors off go north tomorrow jenny and keep going north try to survive it was good advice but jenny doubted shed take it she couldnt imagine fleeing north while dan went south to die and she didnt want to leave gaia perhaps it was the scrap of magic in her that mysterious gaian part but she felt shed wither and die away from here i didnt know you could do things like that the grass hows that fixing his grimace showed that hed noticed her lack of promise but he didnt pursue it perhaps he understood too well it isnt he collapsed onto his back hands beneath his head beautiful enough to distract perhaps that was his purpose it wasnt going to work so what is it his eyes swiveled to hers wild magic she knew he was about to tell her something important but this time she wanted to know whats that the elemental force i think fixers are born with magic no one knows why it doesnt go in families no amount of effort can create it or increase it okay so she was weak she leaned up on her elbow to trace the contours of his chest what about the training thats not to teach us how to do things thats to teach us how not to do things heres the truth jen hellbane u makes such a fuss about finding fixers because they darent leave a single one unchecked we cant have wild magic i dont understand remember when i fixed your finger but there was nothing bad about that what about the baby shed pushed that to the back of her mind would it really be so terrible for fixers to heal like that yes yes it would in that the trainings right we cant fool with nature thats what drove earth to the brink deaths natural without orderly cycling of the parts the whole will rot then what are you doing with stones and grass she couldnt stop a sharp edge in her voice looking for a weapon what if wild magic is more useful than tame against the blighters she stared at him tell me he rose and pulled her to her feet if im going to be coherent wed better get dressed i have tea he picked up his shirt and found her bra and knickers underneath with a grin he tossed them to her she resisted the urge to make a performance of putting them on they needed to find a way to survive she noticed his small campfire tucked behind rocks where it wouldnt be easily seen from outside the park she dressed and went to sit there with him holding her hands out to the warmth though the night was not particularly cold now tell me im not sure i have my thoughts straight yet he moved a metal pot onto a trivet over the flames steam began to curl out of the spout talking sometimes helps yes he poured the tea into two cups had he always planned to draw her here talk she said how do you suspend something in the air and what use is it i dont know he picked up a stone and released it in midair it hung there but then fell we dont understand what fixers do any more than we understand the blighters but i think our energy comes from the same place negative and positive perhaps but perhaps not he put his cup aside look assume that the blighters are not just energy but a species undetectable to us but following the same patterns as other species they are born they reproduce they die and they need to take in nutrients do they i have no idea this is a working hypothesis it would mean that they ash animals to feed transforming them into the same kind of undetectable energy that they are like water transformed into steam by heat or like green plants transformed into our ungreen bodies thats a kind of magic if you dont know how it happens any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic she said remembering his words he pulled a face i cant see anything about the blighters we could remotely call technology perhaps that comment should say that everything we humans dont understand we classify as magic and thus unreal until the unreal starts to eat us jenny swirled the stewed tea in her cup swirling what hed said in her mind if the blighters are eating us theyll have to stop wont they otherwise otherwise theyll be like people on earth and the cod good point but they recreated the cod stocks from dna and the blighters almost certainly cant do that so what are you saying that theyll eat us all then die of starvation thats not much comfort ive been reading up on it there are creatures that eat almost all their food source then go dormant until the supply recovers pieces of the puzzle clicked into place thats why gaia was so perfect for us fertile lush plant life but no large or sentient animals the blighters had eaten it down to a nub how long would they be dormant probably as long as it takes but instead she said almost breathless we arrived like a delivery dinner but its been centuries perhaps theyre not programmed to stir until now perhaps their life cycle is naturally measured in centuries perhaps its something to do with base energy stores or perhaps she said they were waiting for the dinner bell he nodded my guess is that the occasional blighters have been checking things out like the drones combing the universe for usable planets fairs fair i suppose and survival is survival he broke a twig off a nearby bush and began to strip the leaves off it something hed done as a boy when fretting interesting isnt it gaia was the perfect planet settled with extreme care to ensure infinite harmony and balance but it all comes back to the jungle in the end perhaps we had a good run because we developed fixers and learned to zap the blighters screwed up their system a bit he tossed the bare twig into the fire where flames licked at it perhaps perhaps perhaps this is all crazy speculation you know but it makes sense jenny looked from the spluttering twig to the statue of the little girl ashes to ashes somethings told them dinners ready and theyre rushing to the table what do we do thats the question when we humans find a planet we like the native lifeforms cant stop us from cleaning them out to make things right for settlers perhaps we cant stop the blighters from cleaning us out for food some small animals will survive and one day who knows how far into the future itll be dinnertime again jenny pressed her fingers to her head as if that might somehow make her brain sharper but you can beat the blighters the fixers i mean so why cant you beat them now numbers a fixer can beat a blighter oneonone with power to spare a fixer might be able to beat ten or even more its never been tested blighters being rather rare he shook his head that sounds so crazy now we arent efficient killers its a real case of using a hammer to kill an ant but it hasnt mattered before now if we have to zap one after another were soon drained and then they eat us if the fixers had concentrated to begin with we might have stopped them but by the time hellbane u woke up to it there were too many too widely spread around the equator its been like trying to drain a swamp by standing in it with a bucket with the swamp eating the bucket how many have you zapped one to graduate thats all no wonder the wars not going well he shrugged i assume some of the fixers near the equator saw more she sipped the tea then pulled a face at the bitter taste and put it aside what was it like we dont have words for it blighter is too mundane even hellbane doesnt capture the sense of the alien that screeches against everything we know to be real and tries to latch on to parts of our brain that shouldnt be there but are jenny shuddered in recognition then theres the awareness of ravening hunger of a blind need to consume us that we are nothing more to it than a food source like a cow or a fish or a loaf of bread she saw the shudder shake him and thats just a start you have to be there no she said i know exactly what you mean i can feel it now his look was quick and sober then im sorry she pushed back the sick feeling lets look at wild magic again what can it do he reached toward the fire she saw him hesitate but then he grabbed a glowing end of wood and held it flames licking through his fingers she gaped but then he hissed and dropped it to blow on his hand good job im a fixer jenny wanted to laugh and cry she wanted to hug him and keep him safe she wanted someone to hug her and promise her that everything was going to be all right pathetic he agreed but this is all we have to fight with im sure its the way its at the heart of gaia she turned it around in her mind so youre magic and blighters are magic and when a fixer pushes magic against one of them its gone not quite the energy comes into us ahha so you get stronger from stopping them and they feed from eating us ergo you need to kill more of them than they kill of you two problems one we get a lot less energy from one zap than we use two i assume it works the other way for them because theyre feeding im not sure i follow that imagine i carry ten units of power i use them to zap a blighter and get five back with a bit of recovery time i get back to ten again these days fixers are having to fight one hellbane after another in theory they should be able to use the energy gained from a kill to destroy the next but its not working as best i can tell we become exhausted so there must be leakage when a fixer is drained a blighter eats but if dinner is exhausted is there any energy there there must be since they mostly feed on nonfixers and even cows and pigs something was teasing at her mind she caught it but you said zapping one didnt take all your energy so why dont you use less half a unit a quarter then youd be ahead he tossed the remains of his tea to hiss on the fire because we dont know what the bloody hell were doing we just swing that hammer as hard as we can if we could gather a bunch of them we might be able to get a lot with one blow but they seem to hunt alone what are you going to do i dont know yet ive suggested that all the fixers left gather to work on it there has to be something you have no one else seems to be in charge she took his hands im proud of you for doing that im groping in the dark jen no youre not youre finding lights he rested his head against hers you give me strength jen when things were tough at school i used to think of you that protecting gaia meant protecting you tears filled her eyes im not worthy of that she unfastened the few buttons hed done up im sorry for not doing this sooner i was scared so was i i mean of you of your magic he slid his hand under her top why not it terrifies me they kissed and love came slowly gently this time not hard wild and desperate but like a secret flower in a winter garden unexpectedly discovered and to be guarded from a killing frost until it bloomed they lay together afterward talking over their lives as dawn touched the sky she said can i come with you god no go north she thought of lying but shook her head win or lose id rather be here youre a stubborn woman jenny hart theres more to life than living dan rutherford ill be here to meet you or the blighters whichever comes first they dressed then sat holding hands within the glow of the fire ive never been one for the old earth religions jenny said but perhaps ill pray pray for a bouncing bomb then what he shook his head just something from an old film when the sun rose she helped him kill his fire and pack then walked with him hand in hand to the southern gate she cradled his face and kissed him determined not to cry come back thats an order he smiled yes maam ive coded my place to let you in keep an eye on it for me he hesitated only a second more then walked up to and through the small pointlessly guarded postern gate jenny watched the gate close then turned back into the quiet town she walked to the old building and put her hand to the plate the door opened despite the night theyd shared she felt like an intruder in dans flat or perhaps she was afraid that people would realize what had happened she wasnt ashamed of it but it was delicate not yet for public attention hed left everything neat nothing unnecessary out in the kitchen nothing in the fridge or the larder that might go off his bed was made his clothes all clean and put away the meticulous preparations for a future tenant for death she flicked her way along the hangers just to touch things that had touched him enjoying the hint of him that lingered even after laundry soap at the left side almost out of sight she found some clothes that stirred memories she dragged them forward a yellow shirt a pair of striped trousers and a red jacket gaudy fashions of ten years ago now outgrown dans favorite clothes from before hed left anglia tears escaped then because the clothes showed how much he hadnt wanted to leave hadnt wanted to be marked as different she pulled out the red jacket and huddled into it wearing it she wandered into the living room where she ran her hand over his bookshelves looking for a way to share his thoughts had he left his system open to her too she sat on the sofa and switched on his system he had hed mentioned films he must have downloaded those from the archives she pulled up his menu and found them the war films hed talked about but the last thing hed used was an audio sir winston spencer churchill the title read speech on dunkirk june radio with sim she clicked on it and a gravelly voice began dan had switched off the sim and she left it like that hearing it as it had been heard originally when radio had been all they had at first the flat delivery seemed ponderous but then it began to shiver down her spine we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender the man spoke as if surrender was not an option and death a strong possibility did she hear the tone of one who tastes the ashes on the wind hed won his war had dan found hope in that when that finished she scanned the list of films and clicked on one from that war world war ii a concept that had boggled her until nowreach for the sky she watched it hugging the jacket closer watched the pilot be victorious watched him lose his legs then take to the air to fight again and without fixing she understood what dan had drawn from that she didnt like it but she understood when the file ended she clicked on the next lawrence of arabia she didnt move into dans flat thered be too many questions but she spent most of her spare time there she watched the films seeking what hed found in them using the lessons to keep going as the town emptied around her and the blighters came closer on the wind keep going during the blitz dont let the enemy get you down keep a song in your heart well meet again wave a white feather she even made herself a red poppy to wear no one knew what it meant and she wasnt sure herself red for courage red for blood she stopped running the angliacom cells of the screen because even though the news was grim it wasnt nearly as grim as the messages in her mind she used her drops and went to work for something to do paperwork it seemed never entirely stopped then one day she awoke to realize that something had changed a lightening a lessening of pressure she clicked on angliacom there was no reporter there hadnt been one for more than a week instead the screen showed a still touriststyle picture of hellbane u up in the mountains on a perfect skyblue day across the bottom of the picture ran new in from our brave fixers at the front the spread of hellbanes has been halted repeat the spread of hellbanes has been halted the wave has been turned and ultimate victory is in sight jenny watched it five times joy building then dashed to the merrie to see if anyone knew any details they didnt but they were all close to delirious anyway there would have been another wild night if anyone had been there to spark it as it was it was wild enough tom and yas were still around and he and jenny played rollicking songs they even played the anthem again and some people sang it in tears most of these people were packed and ready to flee not just anglia but gaia now they had hope they drank round after round of toasts to the fixers especially to dan fixer their own hero jenny had not heard from dan but hed not called his family either she didnt think the blighters could knock out comtowers so there must be some other reason he could of course be dead it was a fact she lived with day by torturous day consoling herself that no news was good news surely the families would be told like in the old movies whatever the fixers were doing must make it difficult perhaps impossible to send any kind of message but that would surely change now she slipped away slipped home to sit in front of the screen on max showing ten different things maps on most tracking where the blighters had been stopped the blighted area was still an appallingly huge belt around the planet and the closest edge was only fifty miles south of anglia talking heads but when she flipped between them none had solid information she muted the system setting it to alert her to mention of dan fixer then fell asleep with no new information she woke to sunshine and the screen still on one section was flashing partial match an excited woman was mouthing silently an exhausted man behind her sallowskinned and haggard a fixer jenny hunted cursing for the clicker finding it down the side of a cushion and turned that section onto max and sound here at the front as they call it my friend here assures me im safe the stocky reporter grinned but she looked tensed to run at a word for some reason she was wearing a dull green shirt and trousers that looked vaguely like the army uniforms in the old films jenny snorted fat lot of good that would do her if a blighter came along the woman chattered on not really saying anything because there wasnt anything to say behind her lay peaceful normal countryside so she said turning to the man flabby middleaged grimyou think this is the turning point of the war jit fixer were getting the upper hand it was direct but the flat tone made jennys heart pound no jubilation at all can you tell gaia how youve managed to turn the tide jit the mans eyes shifted for just a moment its very technical he said then went on about concentration of powers of nodes and impacts and strategic distributions of forces was she hearing dans theories put into practice if so jenny couldnt follow it and by the look of the reporter she couldnt either even so jenny sat glued praying for a mention of dan even though she knew it was unlikely there had been what more than five thousand fixers before the war but dan had said hed been the one to gather the remaining fixers he might be important enough to get a mention no such luck the reporter glassyeyed brought the technical ramble to an end wished the fixer success in the fight and returned the screen to the your local station jenny slumped back in the chair that hadnt even been angliacom it could have been anywhere around the world on sudden impulse she clicked on the directory and found the numbers for hellbane u scrolling down to information she clicked on that after two rings a message flashed we regret that due to the current emergency the gaian center for investigation and control of the hostile amorphic native entities is unable to respond to enquiries please call back when normal conditions resume jenny went back to the regular screen and lay there watching the maps and charts then a string of interviews with displaced people community administrators even artists sharing their thoughts about victory no mention of dan if he was dead wouldnt she know it she staggered up to go to the loo grabbed some food then collapsed again to watch shed had to switch the prompt to search for dan fixer only which stopped the constant flashing and replaced it with nothing a string of fixers gave interviews and she learned to spot them simply from their debilitated look all the fixers young and old seemed to be exhausted and it was more than physical it was as if something vital had been sucked out of them what a terrible struggle it must be but now they were winning slowly jenny began to hear something in their voices an echo of the war films one of them even said we will never surrender in a flat tone almost identical to winston churchill was that anything to do with dan then one of the fixers cried he was a darkskinned man perhaps by his accent from one of the african settlements first affected partway through his technical description tears began to well in his large dark eyes he blinked and kept going but then suddenly choked he covered his face and turned away from the camera the reporter another young black man but speaking meticulous earth standard english took over talking about the exhaustion of the noble heroes who were fighting the terrible battle jenny watched not hearing the reporter but the sobs of the man off screen shaken by that deep and desolate grief was the talk of victory lies or did the fixer weep for the price the victors had to pay in the past weeks shed become an expert on war all kinds of war now she remembered the words of the duke of wellington after the bloody victory at waterloo nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won if dan was alive was he as melancholy as soulshocked as the weeping fixer oh to take him in her arms and comfort him shed have walked out of anglia to find him if shed had any idea where to start all she could do was her bit to keep the home fires burning she had a shower went to work and even suctioned dust out of the idle presses she kept part of the office screen on to angliacom as she worked set to alert her to any mention of dan fixer the parade of fixers stopped however replaced by a middleaged woman called helga with gray hair and a stony unreadable face helga flatly reported daily successes giving details on areas that were cleared and safe she did not take questions news readers returned jenny phoned angliacom asking for news about dan a short time later she heard back theyd put in a request for a report on him and received no response anglia itself was perking up like a spring flower after a frost people were pouring back in and jenny finally had enough work to distract her enough that she grew impatient for her coworkers to come back reporters ventured out with cameras but apparently the fixers had ordered everyone to stay away from the front so they could only send back pictures of peaceful countryside and occasional closeups of heaps of clothing and ash even they were rare war hadnt changed the weather so most remains had been scattered by wind and rain daily helga reported progress and the red tide on the map ebbed then she began to announce places that were now safe inviting people to return there was never a trace of joy or triumph jenny had learned to distrust the news but shed come to believe in helga the woman reminded her of jowly churchill someone who tamped down emotion and simply got the job done anyway jenny knew in other ways that what helga said was true the pressure of sick fear in her mind was easing the bitter taste was less she actually had some appetite and began to put back the weight shed lost sometimes she had to probe for the unreal parts of her mind instead of fight them off with victory clear it was like christmas she could have gone to ten parties a night but instead she spent every night in dans place she didnt watch the war films anymore instead she wandered through his sys music poetry games comedies she saw monty python and the holy grail listed but skipped over it she didnt think shed find it funny now then she came across his family album and some film from when they were kids a group of them running around screaming in the park under water jets a birthday party with dan wearing a sirius v helmet a milkshake mustache and missing his front teeth had they really once played at war dan and her building something out of robotrobot then cheering as their construct poured juice into a glass without spilling any she thought about earth where apparently war was mostly waged by robots lucky earth helga stopped reporting and jenny missed her stony solidity but the good news kept coming the red swath around the equator shrunk thinner and thinner and jenny linked it to dans return he was working hard to his limit destroying hellbanes when that shrinking stain disappeared dan would come home then one day she realized that her magic had gone no no that wasnt quite it that strange bit of her brain that shouldnt be there was still there but it felt alone as if the rest of the magic had gone as if the fixers had gone she clicked on the screen heart pounding more jubilation more stupid speeches say something about the fixers you berks after an hour or so of nothing she phoned the station she managed to talk her way through to the newsroom and asked why there were no interviews with fixers i thought you were offering to set up an interview with a fixer a woman snapped its hard the woman cut the connection with the screen on mute jenny closed her eyes and tried to sense dan she probed for him hunted him blanked her mind so something could come on its own eventually she opened her eyes defeated it was as if the magic didnt exist anymore as if dan didnt exist anymore surely if the fixers were gone someone would say so stomach churning she watched ten screensectors at once she stilled on one that showed people returning to their homes the camera was like a predator itself seeking the moments of horror the faces of loss even while thinking that jenny couldnt move on the continuing scenes of return were made weirder because all the buildings and machinery were intact simply waiting for the inhabitants to return but often coated with ash a camera swooped in on a woman scrubbing weeping saying over and over who am i cleaning up here who am i cleaning up soon it was almost as if the hellbane wars had never been and yet and yet it seemed to jenny that people held their breath as she did not really able to believe that the terrible things were gone for good and no one mentioned the other terrible thing that they might have to carry on without fixers eventually jenny had to return to life she cleaned dans place one last time and moved into her own home her family was coming back anyway so she had to stock the house with basics and restart the energy sys she went back to work and found that the manager sam witherspoon was back her family returned for a tearful reunion and told her dans family was back too jenny hurried over there and her last hope died theyd heard nothing and they assumed he was dead a hero but dead someone designed a poster of dan fixer hero and it hung everywhere heaven knows whered theyd found the shot to start with but it didnt look much like dan in the end squarejawed and rugged he looked resolutely into the distance against a flaming red sky jenny bought one and kept it knowing hed be amused hoping hed be amused her last hope wasnt really dead then angliacom announced that in view of the lack of response from the fixers a team of mayan reporters was on its way to the gaian center for investigation and control of the hostile amorphic native entities they would carry the thanks of the world and report back on the situation needing privacy jenny watched on dans screen watched through the cameras eye as the reporters approached the pale rock walls that looked like part of the mayan mountain the gates stood open but no one waited to welcome them with the benefit of topreality technology she wandered empty streets and peered into deserted buildings the mikes picked up only silence broken by breezeblown dust and rubbish at least the dust seemed ordinary dust sandy and dry were any of the houses places where dan had been had he shopped at that bakery drunk at that tavern a reporter was droning on about hellbane u in former days jenny made herself listen new students had been housed in dormitories in the central buildings ahead later they could board with families in the town most of the citizens of hellbane u were fixers teachers or researchers but some had been family and descendants of fixers without special powers then jenny realized that the reporter was such a person that he was a refugee from hellbane u returning to his former home and shocked by the desolation he was a professional however and his voice stayed steady as the team progressed through the ghostly town but she could hear the thickness of tears in it tears were falling down her own cheeks where have all the flowers gone eventually the camera reached the central buildings it panned lecture halls libraries and rooms that defied general descriptions the tour continued and jenny watched it all but hellbane u was a dead place the inhabitants gone she remembered an old earth term for it a ghost town where have all the flowers gone she found the song in the system and set it to play another war song damn war she listened and watched and wept for all the heroes who werent coming back from the war they held a parade renamed bond street dan fixer way and life went on doctors had to learn how to mend broken bones with splints and plaster but the latest technology was on the way apparently they had bugs and bots now to do just about anything the fixers could do the minister for postfixer adjustment moved into the fixers flat dans things were sent to his parents who turned most of it over to a committee planning the dan fixer museum jenny managed to sneak the red jacket out and take it home no one knew what the fixers had done but they were heroes for sure yet it seemed to jenny that other than dans family and friends people didnt seem deeply affected by the loss her pain was beyond words or expression so she hid it glad that no one knew about that last night then as she wandered out of work at the end of another meaningless day a woman in the street bumped into her did you hear dan fixers back jenny stared at her they found his body but then she answered herself no blighters leave nothing but ash alive as you and me outside the southern gate he is alive outside the words didnt make sense theyre keeping him out till they figure out what to do the gates would be shut yes they were still shut and guarded though now she thought about it she didnt know why then it cant be dan jenny said hes a citizen and a fixer citizen of all citizen of none a sort of glee in the womans voice shattered the blankness in jennys mind you dont want him back how can you not want him back hes a hero he saved the world we had a parade and named a bloody street after him dont you at least want the fixing back the woman backed away then turned and hurried off jenny stood frozen dan was back alive she was already running toward the nearest tram stop she needed to get to the gate get to dan then she realized it would be on screen if it was true she stopped made herself look calm and walked into the nearest pub one of the big screens faced the door split between a cricket game comedy and a dim sunset landscape she saw a fire and a figure by it she moved into that line of sound having to squeeze up against two men in business clothes claiming to be dan fixer an announcer was saying the witan is meeting to discuss this development and assures everyone jenny stepped into the cricket commentary so she could focus on the picture the camera must be up on the wall looking down at the road on the grass verge a small fire burned and a man sat beside it reaching for a kettle pouring boiling water into a pot memory staggered her then hope swept in as weakening in its own way she grasped a chair to hold herself up creepy if you ask me jenny blinked and looked at the two young men in office wear drinking pints one was blond with a sharp face the other darkhaired and heavy theyve always been a bit strange havent they fixers the blond said no one knows how it works the heavy one replied no one knows what they did to win either one minute the blighters are all over us next minute theyre gone fixers were supposed to be gone too so it cant really be him can it or theyre playing silly buggers with us more faint hostility was this a dream it wouldnt be surprising to dream that dan was back but why would she dream this she wanted to ask what the hell they were thinking if dan was back it was wonderful they had stories on earth about this sort of thing the heavy man said about what his friend asked about people who come back from the dead ghouls vampires zombies ghosts monsters jenny couldnt keep quiet monsters the man turned to her cant know for sure can we perhaps she looked alarmed rather than angry because the other one said its probably not even him luv some berk thinking he can impersonate a hero thats all and not even good at it i saw dan fixer not long before he left and his hair was no longer than mine look at that he pointed at the screen and jenny looked the camera wasnt on zoom so details werent clear but it did look as if the man had a rope of hair down his back she didnt realize how much hope shed gathered until it drained away like a trojan horse jenny looked at the darkhaired man in disbelief bringing what into the town who knows thats the point isnt it jenny couldnt entirely fight off the idea the fixers and the blighters had fed off the same force what if in the end the remaining blighters had taken over their enemies she opened that neglected part of her mind trying to detect something was the faint tingle real or wishful thinking was her churning stomach and throbbing head a sign that the blighters were back or just shock and nerves the screen picture changed to a stocky man alderman higginbottom she sidled over so she could hear him have to take the cautious road here we were given to understand that all the fixers had died in their gallant victory weve been in touch with other major centers and none of them have heard from their fixers none of them have one on the doorstep so to speak the camera shifted to the reporter an eager young woman but dan fixer has explained that some survived hasnt he he can explain all he wants but we cant just take his word the message bar on the screen began to scroll alderman jack higginbottom talking to angliacom reporter alinda brown subject arrival at the southern gate of a person claiming to be daniel rutherford fixer our hero of the hellbane wars gates are currently being kept closed to everyone while a committee of the witan reviews the situation committee jenny had to bite back laughter it was a standing joke that when anything unusual happened in anglia the response was lets form a committee now they were doing it and as always it was a way of passing time in the hope that the problem would go away but given the heroic victory brown asked doesnt it seem wrong to leave someone outside for the night well now theres no saying how long it will be the committee may come to a rapid decision as always all citizens of anglia are welcome to observe the discussion and make presentations either at parliament hall or from screen phones but why not let him in to speak for himself brown persisted alderman higginbottom shed his official veneer and looked older and more strained because we dont know whats come back from the war and nor do you this is a time for cautious thought not impulsive action the screen abruptly switched to the angliacom desk we have reporter nell raiseby now with dan fixers mother jenny turned away she couldnt bear watching that should she go and support annie rutherford or to the witan to speak up for dan but was it dan if dan was alive wouldnt he have contacted his family or her especially her worse than that deep inside painful as a fatal wound she too had doubts if it was dan what had come home from the war but he is a hero when she realized shed spoken aloud she glanced around no one was paying attention thank heavens she slipped out of the pub she needed to go up on the wall but dark was settling soon even the zoom camera wouldnt see much and she didnt need to see she needed to think she longed to have dan back in her life in her arms but even if that figure by the fire was dan he could be changed shed seen that too in war films people who returned not just with physical wounds but with mental ones driven crazy by the things theyd had to do destroying those theyd fought to save how did she find that out how did she do the right thing with her heart yearning to have him back she stepped back into the pub to see the screen part was covering the committee meeting now another section showed the huge basement pub in parliament hall with its fully screened wall that made it a popular place to watch official proceedings an illusion of being close to the action as the camera scanned the attentive crowd jenny saw tom rolo yas a bunch of dans friends at a table they would be coming up with some way to help him she ran to catch a tram aware that shed made one decision the man by the fire was dan and that meant she had to help him no matter what the situation she was soon pushing into the crowded room looking for the others but keeping an eye on the screens she paused a moment to listen to the committee surprise surprise they werent getting anywhere fast where were the others then someone shouted jenny and she saw gyrth standing and waving she made her way over and those on one side wriggled together so she could squeeze in on the end of the bench the mood was grim its not going well she asked gyrth poured her a beer who knows at this rate theyll probably talk until the next blighter attack the blighters are gone whatever jenny took a deep drink are they going to let dan in probably not then what are we going to do everyone looked at her blankly what can anyone do rolo asked argue protest they cant keep a hero out when sillitoe argued that alderman potts came up with the bright idea that we cant welcome home a hero of the hellbane wars without adequate preparation he wants dan to go away until were ready jenny groaned lets form another committee no one laughed jenny eyed them all we could sneak him in instead of approval eyes and bodies shifted that wouldnt be right gyrth said it would be undignified its not very dignified to leave him sitting out on the grass is it she stared around lets do form a bloody committee dont take that tone yas leaned forward poking a long beringed finger onto the table its not a simple matter and if you think it is youre naive none of us know what dan is now perhaps he is dangerous you know better than that its because i know better that im wary theres more to him than the laughing friend you know jenny was shocked by her own outrage at yass claim but none of them knew what had happened that last night perhaps she should tell them but she couldnt do it perhaps they wouldnt even believe her hes bound to be different jenny tom said gently i suppose then rolo said something about there being more point watching cricket and yas turned it to office politics in moments three different conversations were going on around the table none of them about dan if his closest friends didnt care what could she do especially when she knew better than any that dan could be changed would be changed not into a vampire or a ghoul but in power hed begun the shift before he left wild magic then a screen section closed in on the long severe face of alice cotrell jenny rolled her eyes mrs cotrell was a great one for drawing up petitions and addressing committees i speak for more than a hundred citizens of anglia the names are here alders if you wish to verify mrs cotrell waved some sheets of paper we wish to make it clear that many anglians do not wish to see dan fixer back within our walls while duly grateful for the service the fixers have done we believe that his home the home of all the fixers is the gaian center for investigation and control of the hostile amorphic native elements how interesting that she used the full and formal name it is intact mrs cotrell went on and suitable for habitation as dan fixer claims there are only a small number of fixers left there is plenty of accommodation there are others alive jenny whispered to gyrth apparently it might be best for them to gather there to figure out what to do in the future true jenny said but dan wanted to come in he wanted she suddenly realized to come home alice cotrell was listing the many possible dangers a fixer might now present to normal people normal thought jenny how very interesting alderwoman sillitoe interrupted he seems perfectly normal mrs rutherford and he was born and raised here alice cotrell stood straighter we do not understand his sort any more than we understood the hellbanes who is to say that the fixers themselves wont turn wild on us one day a murmur rolled around the room but jenny couldnt tell if it was shock or approval shed never thought of that when a predator is eliminated the prey often takes over as pest she followed the debate no longer certain what was right in the end she grabbed on to one thing listen she said they all stared at her if everyones afraid of what dan might be then someone has to go outside and find out yas oh no yas raised a hand we werent that close what not when he left i dont know who he was rumpling with then jenny turned to tom hoping the dim lighting hid her blush youre a good friend he turned his beer glass in his hands i dont know jenny its not that im afraid of dan he added quickly i dont think hed deliberately hurt any of us tom you know better yas demanded why has he pretended to be dead for weeks that was the overwhelming question i dont know jenny said i just know that someone has to go and find out why hes here and what he wants the resistance around the table dragged her words to a halt all right how many here want dan back home eyes shifted perhaps some hands twitched but none went up it depends we cant decide yet i need to know my my the committee really is in touch with the mood of the voters isnt it if youre so set on this said yas why dont you go and find out whats come home from the war it was a challenge one jenny knew yas didnt expect her to accept she turned her attention to the screen hoping for something that would save her no they were consulting some expert about the place of hellbane u in gaian society she didnt want to do this but she had to shed remembered what shed said when shed parted from dan come back shed said thats an order and hed replied yes maam she took a deep breath then looked back around the table i will then on one condition after a stunned moment tom said you dont have to if no one else will i will but on one condition im your representative if i come back and say dans safe you all support that what good will it do rolo asked if necessary we smuggle him in and carry on the fight from here once people see hes just dan theyll change most of them want the fixing back medical technology doesnt fix machines and earth china are we agreed she thought for a terrible moment that theyd chorus no but then yas of all people said yes fine after all youre such a careful sort if you think hes safe hes probably comatose it hurt but jenny hid it and waited until theyd all agreed then she stood all right lets do it the easiest way out was through the storage basement of gyrths uncles grocery theyd used it as teenagers when sneaking outside had seemed like an adventure it didnt take long to move the stack of heavy boxes then work out the loose stones that blocked the tunnel through the thick wall wriggling down the rough dusty hole wasnt jennys favorite thing but right now it seemed a small challenge she went backward so her feet went out first hung on with her fingers a second longer than necessary then dropped the six feet or so to the grass she was committed now jenny waved at gyrth whose blond head was sticking out of the hole to make sure she was all right then turned toward that glowing fire she shivered under the swamp of chill air and dark infinity once again she couldnt see the ground beneath her feet and dan wasnt guiding her she made herself step forward she knew this was smooth grass but she still felt for each step as if an abrupt crevasse might pitch her into destruction then light shimmered forming a silvery path across the grass a path to the fire to that figure by the fire even though he hadnt moved she froze he could do this what else could he do then he turned hello jen he was still just a shape against the glow but it was dans voice for sure just the same as before except for the tone she searched that tone for welcome for warmth and found none something inside shrank wanting to run away what if he didnt even remember the night that was so important to her combat stress caused neural damage that could show in many ways dont be afraid i wont hurt you she walked forward picking that apart i wont hurt you not i cant hurt you shed known that that he was controlled not by what he could do but by what he allowed himself to do yet she was suddenly crushed by the mission shed so carelessly chosen who was she to decide the fate of a town of a world even who was she to assess dans capacity to harm and destroy when she arrived close to the fire and was touched by its light and warmth she finally saw him clearly changed very dan still she realized what made him look harsher his hair was drawn back in a plait into that rope of hair hanging down his back hair didnt grow that much in the time hed been away would you like to sit he said or did you just come to stare she flinched at his tone but then he added i have tea and two cups its not stewed she sat suddenly on the grass on the opposite side of the low fire he remembered how are you it was a stupid question but it had to be asked better he poured tea into a cup she remembered so well and passed it to her better than what she wanted to ask but she was groping through the dark here afraid of rocks and crevasses have the governors sent you any message she asked sipping it was perfectly made tea delicate and fresh it made her want to laugh and cry i thought perhaps you were it unlikely sometimes messages are judiciously indirect it was a subtle point made with a cynicism that was strange from him so he asked whats going on theyve formed a committee his lips didnt even twitch he might as well know the truth theyre afraid of you dan grateful mind but afraid thats fair im afraid of myself well there was the answer to her question she put down the cup because her hands had started to shake then why do you want to come back its my home a person doesnt bring danger to their home why are you here then truth a group of us tom yas you know thought we needed to find out about you before doing anything and you drew the short straw she sighed i was the only one willing he suddenly smiled a flickering hint of the old dan ah jen thats part of why ive come back for your doubting friends for you her heart missed a beat why do you have to ask yes he looked down perhaps because you commanded me to coward that she was she didnt want that burden really partly she realized then that he was being as painfully careful of truth as she was he looked back up faced her i need you jen to have a chance of survival you have survived the wars over isnt it im not sure wars are ever over the repercussions rumble on and on you dont need me she meant it to be cheerful bracing but truth tumbled out after it i dont want to be needed that way dan i dont want to need you that way sometimes we run out of choices he reached into the fire and grasped a burning brand he lifted it flames licking his fingers she waited for him to drop it but he didnt i can hold a burning brand jen you can hold me she tossed her remaining tea over the flames they hissed but then burned on undaunted burning what he released the brand in midair and it hung there as he showed her his unmarked hand youll survive too i think when hed left a small piece of glowing wood had burned his fingers sharp as a knife jenny knew everyone was right dan was more dangerous than shed ever imagined too dangerous by far for a peaceful town or for her you cant force me dan i can in fact but im trying not to abruptly the brand fell back into the fire scattering golden sparks ive learned many things jen and one is that we do what we have to do to win suddenly he lowered his head his fingers digging into his bound hair im sorry i shouldnt have put it like that ive not talked to real people for a long time rusty skills oh if he was looking for a weapon hed found a good one it was as if she were back by the lake again with dan facing death and the ashes gritty in her mind she longed to reach out and soothe those anguished hands but she held back she had taken on a greater role had accepted the responsibility of judge and she was scared she felt a lick of fear that might be what a hellbane victim felt and a pull toward him that was almost as bad i need you yes he said with the kind of calm that takes great effort but theres more to it than that he looked up eyes densely dark in the fires shadows the world needs you needs both of us you say you cant you dont have that choice you must she blocked that he was powerful and he was wounded he might be very dangerous indeed but he needed her and she knew what she must do im yours dan forever if you want me ill come with you to hellbane u a ghost of a smile touched his lips thank you for that love but it isnt so easy i need the town the word love collided with the rest of it the town doesnt need you same argument as before they have no choice then why are you sitting out here instead of going in she pointed at the closed gates blow them open the brand rose again without touch and began to whirl shooting flame into the dark she glanced at the wall was that damned camera still running put that thing back before someone sees it it stopped then settled with perfect gentleness into the fire bed better he asked her heart raced and tea and ale churned was that demonstration of control designed to reassure me because it failed what are you doing he inhaled and she thought she saw impatience frustration anger an army of dangerous emotions every bit of her flinched but she made herself meet his eyes all right i hoped if i just turned up theyd let me in before they thought about it once in i knew it would be a different game i didnt expect the guard on the gate now its over its become a habit a bad one once i was stopped i could only try persuasion nothing would work if i stormed my way in its like that night in surrey green he said and you i need welcome jen the towns not going to fall in love with you it was an indirect response to his declaration of love and she saw him note it and put it aside as she had their feelings were not the crux of this matter what do you mean nothing would work what are you trying to do he flexed his hands in a gesture of frustration i dont know i know i need the town and i need you i can pay my way he added almost pathetically im still a fixer more than a fixer true but i could do only what a fixer did his desperation tormented her whatever hed become hed done it for them all for the town for gaia they should be welcoming him but a wounded animal is a wounded animal no matter what the cause if you could pretend to be the old dan fixer she answered herself but you cant we all know or at least guess youre a hero of the hellbane wars mighty and to be feared do you know they renamed bond street dan fixer way thats ridiculous but youre stuck with it she eyed him why do i feel comfortable all of a sudden is it magic i dont think so the relief only lasted a moment are you saying you dont know dont know what youre doing no not that but i cant say there isnt any radiance from it if there is i cant do anything about it does it matter it was an anxious question and she didnt know the answer she raised her knees and rested her weary head on them explain dan please explain what youre trying to do he picked up a dead stick an ordinary one and poked at the fire the remaining fixers are all more or less as i am now in power hellbanes are a powerful potion is that why you let everyone think you were dead he nodded we had to decide what wed become before we could decide what to do we could have disappeared let everyone think us dead the thing is some of us are out of control mad i suppose but mad with great power were guarding them but it takes nearly all our resources perhaps theyll heal if not youll kill them she was proud of her calm voice well have no choice we cant spend all our energy on them why not we miss fixers but we can cope he shook his head gaia needs fixers we have to rebuild the system what with a handful of you perhaps alice cottrel had the right idea and you should stay at hellbane u and come when called for important things only im not talking about that kind of fixing what then if the blighters come back we have to be ready and we have to find a better way blighters back but her mind fixed on the pain at the end of the sentence what happened dan what did you have to do you dont want to know she gripped her hands together tell me anyway he tossed the stick into the fire and it burst into wild flames making her flinch away all right it was my idea clever lad that i am fixers were dying one by one and the blighters only grew stronger we all wanted to rush out and fight but i persuaded everyone to play with their magic like id been doing to find the stuff training had locked up in us his eyes brightened for a moment it was amazing what some of us could do jen the power we could draw on it became clear that the presence of so many blighters was making us stronger day by day but what to do with it any light in him died do you remember what i said about power gained and lost we figured out that we could act in a group and have even greater destructive force but we still couldnt modulate it what we needed was blighters bunched in huge numbers and that doesnt seem to be their way jenny was trying to follow his logic but mostly she was following something that ran beneath his words something terrible so we baited a trap her mouth dried with what he leaned back on stiff arms it might have been a relaxed posture but it wasnt they like people more than animals but they really love fixers like i love walkers spiced meat pies and you love those big strawberries your father grows a solitary fixer draws blighters from all around perhaps they fight over the prey i dont know she stared at him but apart from that betraying pause his tone was flat so we formed troops of the ideal size about forty as it happens wed form a circle and put the bait in the center when the blighters rushed in to feed we cleared the area wed get thousands sometimes and the juice would flood into us making us stronger still then the troop moved along and did it again and again and again troops had to merge of course in time after a moment he said it was mostly my idea and it worked she was still trying to form words when he added we drew lots my name was never drawn after three swallows she managed how how many of you were there in the beginning more than a thousand like a violently untethered spring he curled forward hands over his face one thousand two hundred and twenty three and eighteen came home day after relentless day numbers dwindling lots drawn goodbyes said we all wanted to be noble sacrifices but the fears too strong so we used magic to hold the bait right in the middle its most efficient that way she scooted around the fire and gathered his pain tight into her arms you dread being chosen he whispered you dread not being you dread living dan dan dont dont think about it oh how crushingly stupid he turned to her and clung and she did the only thing she could and held tighter still she wished hed cry but hed surely drained himself of tears long ago you dont want to be here where youre not wanted she murmured rubbing her face against his hair stroking him tears escaping if its me you want ill come with you anywhere he turned his head against hers to brush lips its you i want jen its you i need you i thought of you dreamed of you when i wanted to throw myself into the blighters because it would be easier i thought of coming back to you he kissed tears from her cheek dont cry love dont cry how can i not but youre home now dan home then she realized what shed said she drew back cradled his face looked into his eyes its important to you that you come home i dont think i can carry on without it but theres more im the only one with a real home to come back to to heal i need you to live i need you but i need the town too to do what needs to be done to be what i need to be i need my family your family our family our friends those arc the roots of the tree that i am the tree that magic is the tree of the future she remembered then what hed said when the blighters might return i dont think we destroyed them jen we zapped a lot of them millions maybe but i think in the end they retreated we were down to eighteen and though we were each bloated with power we were close to the end yet they went if this is their life cycle perhaps they retreated with enough energy to reproduce or whatever they do the last time must have been a thousand years or more ago but thats because they ate this place almost to extinction weve survived if we slacken birth control we could build the population again in a generation even without that itll probably be back in a century or so or earth might send more settlers jenny pressed her face against his shoulder eighteen left all crippled in some way yet they had to be teachers for a new generation of fixers who might be needed within decades needed to sacrifice themselves again he was right there had to be a better way dan and the few other sane fixers would have to come up with that better way while training new ones and theyd have to train them in the wild magic as well as the old sort she remembered pollys baby she knew now hed been right they shouldnt interfere too much with nature but that meant the world must change so that it could accept that accept that no matter the personal suffering the magic must be restrained unless the blighters returned to feed again to lead all this dan needed his home and above all he needed her she turned to touch her lips to his brow i am home i am yours always lips joined and she tasted need and lingering ashes no need was too frail a word starvation a gaping hollow in the soul hed tried so hard to hide from her she could not deny him the feast no matter what the cost gathering him into her arms she deepened the kiss took the ashes held him close until she felt the first desperation diminish come love come she pulled his shirt loose and put her hands to the hot skin of his back already rolling him out of the fires low glow into some privacy they tore at clothes and he thrust deep within seeming to burn her in the surging connection with those alien places only he could touch she climaxed quickly but he went on pounding into her until she wanted to protest to cry out to him to stop she braced herself and bore it knowing he was far away seeking something deeper and stronger than mere orgasm something healing for those invisible terrible wounds he drove her through two more mechanical annihilations before he shuddered and stopped limp as the dead she winced as she bore his weight knowing it symbolized some of what was to come his need was great but she would grow strong enough to bear it his healing would draw on her but she would be a deep enough well his thoughts would not always be centered on her but that was as it should be he was a hero and a heros intent is always on the greater goal dan had become what he was in order to save them all she could do no less for his sake and the worlds shed feed and nurture him and tomorrow she would bring him home they dressed as the sun began to rise and breakfasted on stale bread and stewed tea they laughed about that remembering the park and the horribly boiled tea there they talked of the future gently he thought there might be many people like her with a little fixing ability that could be developed so they could take on some of the load perhaps everyone on gaias that way she said it could explain why its such a flourishing stable world he met her smile which it is and will be when the sun was up they extinguished the fire packed his bag and walked up to knock on the postern gate the wideeyed gatekeeper opened it and put the formal question what business brings you to anglia jenny answered im jenny hart citizen and this is my chosen partner dan rutherford fixer were returning home the rule was ancient and absolute any citizens partner had freedom of the town jenny looked at dan trying to see him as others would see him she thought he looked as he always had hed done something magical to make his hair short again and he didnt think it would grow so fast anymore some of the stress was fading from his features theyd made love again with the dawn that time for her when she murmured about cameras he said hed blocked them she knew for sure now that she wasnt bringing wildfire into the town but winter fire and she would be its hearth the gatekeeper returned to open the gate for them holding hands jenny led dan through to face the bewildered hastily assembled alders the trouble with heroes is that they want to come home but home needs its heroes and home is also their just reward shadows in the wood by jennifer roberson awareness stirred then stilled stirred again weakly was like a weary man struggling to open eyelids grown too heavy for his will opened closed awake then asleep he had lived in darkness so long he did not at first believe such a thing as light existed but it sparked at the edges of awareness kindled fitfully into life a very quiet life it was timid and halting but incontrovertibly life he recognized it as such and in that recognition he acknowledged sentience victory at last over the enemy at last for all he knew it had been no more than the day before now this moment that he had been defeated enspelled entrapped but with sentience and awareness came also understanding that such imprisonment as his had been conjured to last a lifetime or a hundred lifetimes of men older than he for time out of mind but he was not man that he knew the body the soul remained imprisoned only the mind the barest flicker of awareness bestirred itself out of the long enforced lethargy he wondered what had awakened him here there was no scent no sight no sound he tasted nothing because he had no mouth he merely was when before for time uncounted he was not was not now again all unexpectedly he was astonishment relief exultation alive not as men marked it for he in this place was nothing approaching human he had no heart to beat no mouth to speak no eyes to see neither ears to hear nor nose to smell no body answered his will no pulse throbbed in his neck but for now it did not matter something in him sensed something in him knew release after all was possible someone is coming no more than that someone is coming it was his comfort it was his joy it was the light against the darkness the shield against the spear someone someday for now it was enough england she felt the morning fog drift down and settle a cool caress of dampness upon her face and hair insinuating itself beneath the peaked hummock of roughspun blanket draped across one shoulder she burrowed closer into the blankets and hides to the warmth that was male to the crusadescarred body grown precious years before beloved before even they met in carnal congress beneath the roof of the tiny oratory built onto her fathers manor at her mothers behest all dead to her now father mother brother even the manor which now was held by the crown embodied by a man she knew as heartless john lackland john softsword john king of england who refused to return to her the hall into which she had been born in which she had found a worthwhile living even after she knew herself the only one left of her blood a man a king who listened instead to another man she named enemy william delacey high sheriff of nottingham the warmth the body beside her sensed her awakening and began its own he turned toward her drawing her nearer wrapping her in his arms and legs one spreadfingered hand cradled the back of her skull tucking her head beneath his chin he stroked the black strands escaped from her braid cold she felt more than heard the words deep in his chest and smiled not now the prickle of unshaven jaw snagged her hair as he shifted closer twill be winter soon too soon she murmured twining her limbs more tightly with his one hand wound a strand of her hair through his fingers i had hoped to offer you more than a rude cave and a bed upon the ground of course he had and would have wealth beyond imagining power title castle but he as she was denied that legacy stripped of all his father had labored to build even as hers had labored even as hers was stripped albeit in death her father had been a mere knight his a powerful earl but it mattered little to sheriff or king knight and earl were dead and the heirs of both through royal decree lacked such claim as would put them beneath the roofs their fathers had caused to be raised she gazed upward blinking against moisture the only roof now they called their own was the canopy of trees arching high overhead their hall made of living trunks rather than hewn pillars windows not of glass but built instead of air where the leaves twined aside and permitted entry to the sun such little sky to see here in the shadows of sherwood where their only hope of survival lay in escaping the sheriffs men she and robin formerly sir robert of locksley knight and honored crusader companion to nowdead lionheart took such privacy as they could find in the depths of the woods laying a bed some distance from the others friends and fellow outlaws screened by the latticework of limbs and leaves of bracken and vine a pile of small boughs uprooted fern an armful of hides and blankets spread upon the hummock some would call it rude a peasants crude nest but so long as he was in it she would call it home yet robin was right already autumns leaves fell cloaking the ground and everything upon it including themselves they would soon have little warmth and less foliage to hide behind it was close on time to go to the caves but not just yet his hands were upon her and hers upon him finding eager entrance into clothing beneath the blankets of cloth of hide of fallen leaves as dawn broke upon them sluggish behind the fog they affirmed yet again beneath the vault of tree and sky what had been obvious to their souls obvious to their hearts from even before the beginning that night in the oratory with illumination banished save for lightnings fitful brilliance robin set his shoulder against the bole of a broadcrowned oak and gazed down the road one hand wrapped around the grip of a strung bow that stood nearly as tall as he a leather baldric crossed from left shoulder to right hip from a quiver behind the shoulder sprouted a spray of goose feathers and a sheaf of straighthewn shafts a full clothyard long he wore hosen and tunic as any peasant woven of crude cloth but also boots upon his feet once fine now scuffed and soiled and a brigandine taken from a man he himself had killed once accustomed to weighty armor he found the shirt of linked rings to be no burden in the holy land on crusade stealth had not been an issue he had ridden with an army headed by three sovereigns and many high lords but sir robert of locksley had returned to england a very different man and that man now stripped of his knighthood his earldom and his home by the lionhearts brother lived among the shadows in the company of outlaws instead of kings and queens robin in the wood robin in the hood robin hood whose entire life now was defined by stealth he listened for hoofbeats then knelt pressed a palm against the beaten track and felt for the same he heard and felt nothing there was no prey upon the road once awake awareness did not slide again into sleep the tiny spark he recognized as himself in spirit if not embodied continued to glow brightly slowly gathering strength until he had no fear it might be snuffed out he remained bound bodiless with no recourse to escape but he was awake aware and alive he understood this too was a part of the spell that to know oneself trapped for uncountable days was as much a torture as a lash upon bare flesh as if betrayal such as he had known were not torture enough but he rather thought not these happenings seemed unplanned and unforeseen by the enemy who had enspelled him he recognized something nebulous yet wholly unformed but his senses comprehended what his body could not feel someone is coming awareness coalesced compacted then spasmed in recognition in comprehension of opportunity he lacked a mouth but the words the plea formed nonetheless oh come come soon come now marian had grown accustomed to living among the trees naming the forest her hall she had arrived at a compromise with the results of such surroundings the damp soil that worked its way into her clothing the stains of vegetation the litter of crumpled leaves the occasional thorn punctures and scratches so long as no true hurt came of such importunities she could suffer them in silence except when a broken thorn stuck fast beneath her flesh in which case someone usually robin or much with his quick deft hands dug it out for her she had three years before cast off the binding skirts of a ladys embroidered chemises and went now clothed more like a man in heavy woven hosen tunic and boots over it all she wore a surcoat belted around her hips the sleeveless opensided length of cloth invented on crusade to beat back the blow of the holy lands sun on metal armor but hers was not made of fine cloth with the red cross of crusade on her breast or shoulder hers was leather cut to her size and offered more maidenly modesty than hosen and tunic alone though at that marian smiled she was no more a maiden being too often titled whore despite the fact she and robin had married a few years earlier and her modesty had been shed years before in the oratory but the part of living as an outlaw among the trees and deadfall that she most detested was packing to move the camp they had all taken to heart the lessons learned of keeping safe from the men who would capture them they claimed no true home except what they made for a day or a night though occasionally they settled some few days longer in a place deemed safe no tables no stools save for the trunks of fallen trees a tumble of mossladen stone but there were such things as iron pots a tripod for the fire bowls mugs bedding not to mention the swords the staffs the knives and the invaluable bows robin had taught each of them to use with frightening accuracy from much the simpleton boy and the giant little john to will scarlet and the minstrel alan of the dales even poor brother tuck preferring to trust to god rather than to the bow learned it nonetheless an english longbow robin had explained was a more powerful weapon even than a norman crossbow with its deadly quarrels for a clothyard arrow could punch through armor from long distances with the archer wellshielded behind trees and brush marian had cause to know she had herself learned how to use a bow years before but now knew also how to fletch the shafts with goose feathers to tie on and seal the deadly iron broadheads with sinew and glue a few of the sheriffs men had been wounded by her arrows by the accuracy of her aim that might have could have killed them had she chosen to do so one day she knew she would choose would be brought to the choice she did not wish to make it but so long as such men as the sheriff set upon them desired the lives of men she cared for marian would not shirk the task of preserving those lives at the cost of their own now robin came back from the high road linking nottingham to lincoln a byway that afforded them opportunity to improve the lot of the poor while inconveniencing the lords and wealthy merchants who protested the loss of coin and ornamentation he slipped through the trees and foliage as if born to the life making almost no sound when he saw what little was left to do before departure he smiled at her in accord they knew each others thoughts knew each others habits anyone coming will scarlet asked picking idly at his teeth with a green twig any rich norman rabbits for our stewpot robin shook his head with its cascade of pale hair no one little john reached down for his pack gives us time then to make some distance alan of the dales was making certain his lute case rode easily against his shoulders well have to take a deer once we reach the caves or go hungry tonight and tomorrow tuck put in patting his ample belly no doubt i could go without but but we dare not risk it scarlet interjected or well be hearing your complaints all night tuck was astonished i never complain your belly does little john clarified pointedly oh the monks expression was mortified oh dear never mind robin told him grinning well take our deer and feast right well marian swung her own pack up and slid her arms through the straps it was a matter of less effort now to arrange pack bow and quiver about her person without tangling anything outlawry and privation had trained them all much grown taller than when he had joined them but still thin and hollowfaced doused the small fire he could not fully hide its signs or that people had gathered around it but his job was to make certain none of them could be identified the sheriffs men might find a deserted clearing but there would be no tracks to follow no indication of who had camped there sherwood housed innumerable outlaws not every fire nor every campsite hosted robin hood and his band robins hand fell on muchs shoulder thanking him in silence next he glanced at marian she nodded drawing in a breath then they turned as one to the trees and stepped into the shadows fading away as if their bodies were wrought of air and light not formed of flesh and bone in such meager human sorcery lay survival he sensed impatience emotions that had been dead to him for days years decades he sensed urgency and yearning he tasted the promise of power the ability once again to make a difference in the world kingmaker widowmaker reviled and beloved but he knew only one path impediments upon it were to be overcome hurry he wished he wished it very hard the outcry echoed in the trees robin spun around gesturing sharply to the others strung out behind him on the deer track even as all of them dove into foliage separating to make more difficult targets a second cry rang out a different voice now followed by shouts in norman french he held his breath listening now it was possible to also hear the threshing of men running through the forest and the louder crashing of horses in pursuit robin grimacing as he dropped flat behind a downed tree swore in silence poachers likely or even known outlaws had been spotted by one of the sheriffs patrols it was sheer bad luck that those pursued were heading straight toward him and his party he raised his head slightly and searched over his shoulder save for the last fading movement of stilling branches and waving hiphigh fern there was no hint that a woman and six men were hidden close by he wished he could see marian but if she were invisible to him neither could the norman soldiers see her more crashing through underbrush now he could hear panting and wheezing and the blurted broken prayers of a man who would do better to hoard his breath not far away another man cried out and then a triumphant shout went up from the soldiers underbrush broke apart in front of robin the second outlaw was abruptly there his arms outstretched his batting hands attempting to open an escape route through hanging vines and low sweeping branches robin briefly saw the scratched agonized face the staring eyes the open mouth and then the man teetered atop the very trunk locksley took shelter behind growling oaths behind gritted teeth robin reared up grabbed the mans tunic and yanked him off the tree the outlaw came down hard and loose limbs splayed a knee caught robin in the side of the head hard enough to double his vision stay down he hissed as the man lay sprawled bellydown on the ground sobbing in fear and exhaustion a soldier on horseback broke through blue cloak flapping he wore the traditional conical norman helm with its steel nasal bisecting his dark face robin ducked as the horse gathered itself and sailed over the tree sailed too over two men seeking protection in its meager shelter robin turned on his knees shouting a warning to the others more soldiers were crashing before him now spreading out the norman who had jumped the log was calling to his fellows in french wheeling his horse even as he raised an already spanned crossbow quarrel resting in its channel but robin had had more time his own arrow was loosed flying and took the soldier through the throat now he focused on anotherhow many are there as he deftly nocked a second arrow so many there was no time to think to plan only to react he stood pulled the bowstring back to his chin sighted and let fly the norman flew backward off his horse as if a trebuchet stone had struck him in the chest but others had broken through they had spotted other game now shouting positions to one another even as robin nocked a third arrow someone clutched at him dont let them catch me the rescued man cried theyll cut me and off his aim spoiled the arrow went wide cursing robin caught a glimpse of flared equine nostrils the gape of equine mouth and the flash of a sword blade swinging down at his head get off he blurted diving for the ground but the blade sheared through hair and flesh and the sharpened tip slid across his skull marian was wellhidden until robins arrow took the first soldier through the throat the norman tumbled limply off his mount but one booted foot caught in the stirrup long enough to spook the horse who responded with great lunging leaps sideways marian directly in the animals path attempted to scramble out of the way but the panicked horse wheeled around and the body coming loose at last was swung out sideways in a wide arc the impact of the mailed body colliding with her own knocked marian off her feet she was aware of weight disorientation her own startled outcry and then she went down hard against the ground sprawled on her back pinned by the weight of the soldier she had heard the term dead weight before she had not truly known what it implied now she did breath was gone she gulped air as fear crowded close she could not breathe panicked she shoved at the body trying to dislodge it her struggles did nothing but waste what little breath remained in her lungs a dead man could not kill her the thought stilled her calmed her permitted her to draw a normal breath again air came in with relief and then she became aware of more than the soldiers weight of his stench bladder and bowels blood blood in her mouth running into her throat she choked coughed felt the spray leave her mouth she turned her head and spat not knowing if it were dead mans blood or her own the body muffled sound but she heard shouting and then abruptly the terrible weight was lifted dragged aside someone was grunting with effort lady lady marian tuck his hands grasped one of her arms dragged her up from the ground theyre distracted you must go now she was dizzy blinking at him woozily as she put a hand to her mouth blood filled it again youre swifter than i tuck wheezed you must go on take robin and go that got through robin injured tuck yanked her to her feet can you stand good here he pulled her to a downed tree she saw robin then slumped against the tree as blood sheeted down the side of his face go both of you tuck pushed her the others are leading them away waste no time tis robin they want more than any of us she knelt beside robin he was conscious but clearly in pain she put a hand to his face and realized they both bled badly up tuck insisted he helped marian back to her feet then pulled robin from the ground go on get as far as you can caves robin said between gritted teeth weaving in place tuck nodded we shall meet you there when we can marian spat blood again hers she realized not the dead mans she had cut her mouth can you walk she asked robin through the blood he managed a twisted smile given a choice between that or hanging he closed her hand in his own say rather i can run robin pulled her over the fallen tree and then both of them were running awareness encompassed more than he had expected ever to sense again to know to feel it was nearly tangible now coming closer closer if hands were his to use he could nearly touch redemption nearly know release come robins lungs were afire but even that pain did not match the pounding in his head his right hand clutched marians left otherwise he would have pressed it against his temple in a fruitless attempt to dull the pain to halt the blood head wounds he had learned on crusade how badly head wounds bled even if they were not serious and he believed his was not the pain was immense but no worse than anything he had felt before he remained conscious and on his feet albeit those feet were clumsy marians breathing matched his ragged and whistling together they stumbled through the foliage attempting to put distance between them and the normans tuck had done them a huge service robin knew it was possible he and the others were captured by now some of them even killed but the monk had gotten them away from such danger and if they were careful they might yet be worthy of his sacrifice he did not know where they went merely that they ran they left behind the deer trail and fought to make a new one raking aside with outstretched hands impediments such as vine and undergrowth wait it was barely the breath of a sound expelled from her bloodied mouth stop he halted catching a hanging vine to hold himself upright marian released his hand and bent over sucking air noisily her long black braid was disheveled strands pulled loose by branches as they ran a bruise was rising on her face blotching one cheekbone she wiped her mouth free of blood studied the slick hand dispassionately then looked at robin still panting head she asked attached it was all he could manage clinging to the vine marian nodded vaguely attempting a smile she straightened then turned and staggered toward a great old oak roots thick as a mans thigh where they broke free of the soil in a tangle akin to celtic knotwork she drooped against the trunk pressing her forehead into bark robin loosed his grip on the vine and made his way across to her wincing against the renewed pain in his head with care he avoided tripping over the oak roots but when he reached the trunk he nearly fell he caught himself with one outstretched arm then turned and set his spine against the trunk sliding down until he sat on the ground cradled between two twisted roots with gentle fingers he explored the side of his head fortunately the sword blades motion had mostly been spent it had sliced into the flesh above his right ear but had not cracked the skull beneath that skull would no doubt house an abominable headache for a day or two but he was mostly undamaged robin shifted his position to a more comfortable one breath came more easily now marians surcoat swung as she turned then like him she sat down amidst the roots she looked aside spat blood then blotted her mouth against her tunic sleeve she studied the soiled sleeve critically stopping i think robin stretched out his arm slung it wearily across her shoulders and pulled her close i think we are out of danger he paused for now marian didnt answer she was staring around frowning where are we robin glanced into the shadows noting the trees seemed almost uniform in size shape and placement mistletoe clustered in branches foliage crowded the ground but the huge trees took precedence over the rest of the forest he felt at his head again when i was a child my mother told me there were oak groves planted by druids in sherwood that they were the oldest part of the forest and sacred but she was always telling me stories i never knew which were true these are oaks marian said and she broke off sharply robin there are faces alarm chilled him he sat bolt upright preparing to gather his legs under him until she waved him back down no not normans at least not living ones look do you see she gestured look at the trunks he looked and saw nothing marian got to her feet and crunched through fallen leaves to the oak closest to the one robin leaned against look here her bloodsmeared hand touched the massive trunk tracing a shape here are the eyes the nose and the mouth see it she looked back at him waiting expectantly he rolled his head in negation a trick of light and shadow on all of them look around robin marians outstretched arm encompassed their surroundings this is an oak grove one far older than you or me or even i daresay our fathers fathers just as your mother told you she moved to the next tree intent once again her hand traced a shape eyes nose mouth and here is the chin he made a noncommittal sound marians expression was sympathetic but clearly she was certain of what she saw he closed his eyes and rested as she walked from tree to tree murmuring to herself he was nearly asleep when she reached his tree circling it he heard her stop heard her startled blurt of sound and then abruptly she was attempting to haul him to his feet come and see she ordered his remonstration made no headway she dragged him around to the backside of the huge old tree took his hand in hers and pressed his fingers against the wood feel it she moved his hand tracing something here see the brow the bridge of the nose the cheekbones this one is much clearer than the others do you see it he did this time he did there in the bark no longer merely a trick of light and shadow was the shape of a face it was more defined than those in the other trunks sightless eyes stared its a man marian said quietly and then beneath their bloodied hands the wood began to move the spell attenuated began to shred broke he felt it fail felt the last minute particles attempt to bind themselves together once more in order to also bind him but it was too late awareness melded with spirit merged with comprehension joined with the power that had been held too long in abeyance he tapped it called it welcomed it felt it bound joyously back to him like a hound to its hearth one moment it was absent the next present with a roar of triumph he ripped himself free of the tree wood chips flying banished the clinging aftermath of the long dreamless sleep and stepped into life again into the world again into his body flesh blood and bone and power incarnate the empty tree screamed as the body tore itself free of the massive trunk shredding strips andchips of wood marian blurted a sound of shock and hastily backed away a root caught her and she went down hard even as robin bent to help her up he halted arrested in midmotion both stared at the stranger who had wrenched himself out of living oak he was wildeyed breathing hard from the tree he went to his knees as if in supplication or perhaps weakness splayed hands pressed against the layers of leaves elbows locked to hold himself upright shoulderlength hair dark save where it was frosted with the first touch of gray tumbled around his face marian could not see his expression now as he knelt but she heard the rapid uneven breathing saw the shuddering in spine and shoulders for all she and robin were stunned the stranger seemed more so she let robin pull her to her feet they put a cautious distance between themselves and the man but did not flee instead they stared at each other in blank astonishment then turned as one to the stranger robins sword chimed as he unsheathed it when the man looked up marian saw gray eyes clear as water blacklashed and pale unblemished skin his beard was short and welltended he wore a blue robe of excellent cloth and pinned to his left shoulder was a redandgold enameled brooch dragonshaped of celtic workmanship when he brought his hands out of the loose powdery leaves she saw he wore a gold ring set with a red cabochon stone she believed might be a ruby robin she kept her tone carefully casual is this a trick of light and shadow equally casual he replied this appears to be flesh and blood we are awake are we not as far as i can tell we are awake he tugged her litterstrewn braid sharply feel that yes she said crossly putting a hand to her scalp and i still bleed a little so this must be real he paused my mother apparently told me the truth marian was amazed at how calm he sounded she didnt feel calm she felt oddly detached somehow distant from what she had witnessed and what she was witnessing now and yet every noise she heard sounded preternaturally loud should i not be running or if she were a proper woman fainting but then she had not been proper since meeting robin still marian wondered why she felt no urge to run it wasnt fear that the stranger might harm her if she tried she wasnt certain a man who had been trapped in a tree trunk moments before could harm her but she found herself immensely curious to know what had happened to him and to be quite certain she had truly seen him tear himself out of a living tree still on his knees the man looked over his shoulder at the tree except for a hollowed gouge in the trunk the oak appeared no different it was simply a tree but a glance at other oaks still bearing likenesses of other men emphasized the truth of his own presence he turned back to face them with hands now grown steady he pushed heavy hair away from his face and bared a narrow circlet of beaten gold he was marian realized only ten or twelve years older than she she wondered what robin was thinking a quick glance at his face showed grimness his skin drawn taut beneath the golden stubble and smeared blood he seemed at ease but then he always looked relaxed wholly unprepared to strike when but a moment later the enemy was down they had lost their bows along the way as they ran but were not unarmed they had a meatknife quiver and arrows and robin the sword oddly she wanted to say do not harm him which made no sense she knew nothing of the man save he had to all appearances been a resident of a tree a resident in a tree the strangers eyes fixed themselves on robins sword a sudden light came into them an expression of sharpened awareness and understanding he stood up abruptly sharply he asked something in a language neither of them knew robin said something in fluent norman french the stranger frowned plainly impatient and tried several different languages in swift succession in each there were words that sounded vaguely familiar to marian but he remained a cipher until a final try latin marian exclaimed oh where is tuck when we need him this time when the stranger spoke his words though twisted were in an accented english they could understand when is it robin began to ask a question of his own something to do with a carved man turning into flesh and stepping out of a tree but the stranger overrode him when is it when not where perplexed marian said the year of our lord the gray eyes widened so long i had not thought so his tone took on bitternesswhen i had mind again to think at all he looked more closely at marian then at robin inspecting them marian became aware of her disheveled clothing her braid half undone bits of leaf and twigs caught in her hair and the loose weave of her hosen beneath the surcoat her chin itched from drying blood and her face stung from scratches then the stranger turned to the tree again and put out a hand feeling the bark when he brought it away smeared streaks of red crossed his palm blood he murmured surely she did not foresee this or she would have prepared for it but who would have expected the blood of two sacrifices to commingle in the holy grove let alone upon the walls of my prison sacrifices robin demanded are we meant to die here when somehow all of your companions are let out of their trees the stranger ignored the question and looked at marian the year of our lord you said she nodded you mean the man christians called the nazarene marian blinked of course of course he sounded rueful then his expression altered his eyes were once again fixed on robins sword there is a task before me it was mine to do before the enchantment and no less mine to do now that i am free of it regardless of how long it has been will you aid me aid you robin echoed perhaps you should aid us by explaining what just happened the stranger smiled i see power is no more understood now whenever this time may be than it was then absently he touched the brooch on his left shoulder vortigern meant me to be the sacrifice when his walls would not stand instead i gave him news of the dragons under the water when the red defeated the white his pupils had swollen turning eyes from gray to black he is dead the red dragon of wales and so the task lies before me his eyes cleared and he looked at them both as if seeing them for the first time forgive me perhaps it will all explain itself upon introductions i am myrddyn emrys he gave it the welsh pronunciation tonguetip against upper teeth men call me merlin merlin robin blurted the stranger nodded the task is to find a sword and give it back to the lake merlin robin repeated and this time marian heard adult disbelief colored by a young boys burgeoning hope merlin had spent his entire life beingdifferent people feared him for it distrusted disbelieved some of them were convinced he should be killed outright lest he prove a danger to them but that life that time was done he faced a new world now a different world and far more difficult challenges in his time magic at least had been acknowledged if often distrusted here clearly no one believed in it at all which somewhat explained the inability of the young man and young woman to accept what had happened an enchantment he had told them as they knelt to wash their bloodied faces at a trickle of a stream a spell wrought by nimtie the great sorceress he did not tell them his own part in the spell that he had allowed himself for the first time in his life to be blinded by a womans beauty and allure to permit her into his heart once she had learned enough of him enough of his power she had revealed her true goal to imprison him for all time and thus remove the impediment he represented to the new power in britain a britain without arthur he grieved privately letting no one not even nimüe recognize the depth of his pain arthur he had wrought out of the flesh of britain herself a man destined to unite a world torn awry against the threat of the saxon hordes and so he had for a time but then other forces took advantage of a childless king and a queen in disrepute dividing arthurs attention when it was most needed to settle an uneasy court by the time the saxon threat became immediate arthur had lost too many supporters among the noblemen and too many knights the advent of a bastard got unknowingly on his own sister had sealed his fate merlin in retirement had done what he could but arthur died and britain was left defenseless a britain without arthur could not survive as merlin had meant her to safeguarded by the one man empowered with the natural ability to keep her whole hundreds of years had passed since arthurs death and even now merlin had only to look at the man kneeling at streams edge with his fall of whiteblond hair and pale greenishbrown eyes his height to see that the saxons had triumphed and so the man agreed when asked explaining that britains people were now called english born of england that once had been angleland the land of angles and saxons marian however was not it was clear when merlin looked upon her she was small slight and blackhaired bearing more resemblence to the people of his time in her features despite the blue of her eyes she called herself english but her blood was older than robins and now england britain had fallen again to a people called the normans robin explained who refused even to learn the language of the people they conquered a people who had a king whose excess of temper was legendary along with the greed and turbulence of his reign then we should waste no more time merlin told them arthur is dead but his legacy may yet be realized by finding the sword marian said dubiously rebraiding her hair robins smile even as he felt at the clotted slice in his head was very nearly fatuous excalibur the sword belongs to the lake merlin said now that arthur cannot wield it britains welfare resides in it arthur with excalibur drove away the saxons once but mordred and his faction kept him from completing his task you have told me of other invasions to keep britain from ever being invaded again we must find the sword and return it to the lake that will be enough marian asked no one ever again shall invade england no one you are merlin the enchanter robin said what use would we be to you you will recall it was you who got me out of the tree he reminded them dryly they exchanged glances still perplexed you are the sacrifices merlin explained gently just as arthur himself was and as he saw the confusion deepening in their eyes he realized that with the years had disappeared the knowledge that was beginning to die out even in his time he gestured back toward the way they had come that was a holy grove sacred to the druids it was nimües conceit to imprison me there and apparently others as well his expression reflected regret that he marian and robin had been unable to free the others there are men and women born into the world who are meant to be sacrifices for their people for their times to keep the land strong and whole they need not be killed upon an altar though that was done once but merely die in defense of their land and ideals to die serving the greater whole we are outlaws robin said we are fortunate if we can feed ourselves each day what service can we offer england hope merlin answered have you not told me you give over most of what you take to peasants because the king is taxing the poor to death marian declared merlin nodded and so you steal from those who have wealth to spare and divide it fairly among those who have none his eyes were unwavering at the risk of your own lives he had made them uncomfortable neither of them fully understood what they represented to the folk they aided perhaps they never would it was the nature of sacrifices to do what was required without acknowledging the selflessness of it because they saw only the need and simply acted arthur had not been raised to be a king per se but to be a decent honest fair man of great ability capable of leading others to the goal he perceived as worthy because it served the people arthur had come into privilege and kingship because it was the position needed to guide britain robert of locksley and marian of ravenskeep had been stripped of their privilege because that loss led them to the position of aiding the poor when no one else in england appeared willing to do so who else was worthy of aiding him in his task we had better go merlin said wait robins brows were knit beneath raggedly cut hair do you even know where the sword is merlin smiled do you expect a quest to be a knight of the round table searching for the grail but the answer is disappointing i fear nimtie told me as my body was turned to wood robert of locksley born the son of an earl albeit last and was thus inconsequential wanted very much to say he disbelieved the nonsense the stranger told them he recalled too vividly the beatings meted out by his father wishing to purge what remained in his sons of anything fanciful such as stories of arthur and his enchanter merlin but robins mother had told him to believe as he wished that stories were good for the soul as well as the heart and so he had learned the stories and loved them and believed them until he grew up and joined a crusade that took the lives of innocents as well as warriors he could not say when he had come to understand that there were stories and there were truths with a vast gulf between the two but he knew that merlin arthur and all the others of the legend were not real except that merlin washere the part of him that wished to believe wondered why merlin did not simply conjure a spell that would move them to wherever it was he wanted to go without benefit of walking the rational part of him believed in no such ability that the stranger was nothing but a madman but he remembered all too well the sight of the tree disgorging a man still merlin did not do so he said he could not they slept little ate less and followed whatever it was that guided merlin the enchanter pronounced himself stunned by the changes that had overtaken england no britain and yet admitted there was much that had not altered he seemed unimpressed by the fact that he had been entrapped in a tree for hundreds of years if anything he considered it quite natural such things as sorcery were expected by merlin while robin found it impossible to accept that fanciful stories no matter how beautiful no matter how entrancing were grounded in fact but when at last they walked out of the forest and saw the wooded hill rising before them surrounded by a ring of grassy lowlands and merlin sank down as if in prayer murmuring in a language neither he nor marian understood robin knew more was at work than fancy or folly from his knees merlin said avalon robin started no it was an island merlin persisted look you and see how it might have been the shore here the water there and the isle beyond robin looked upon it an expanse of land stretched before him and a high hill above it swelling out of turf there was no water no shore nothing to cross save grass it is much changed said merlin but not so very altered that a man of my begetting may not recognize it a man of his begetting a chill prickled robins spine marian gazed upon the hill women ruled there for time out of mind merlin agreed it was the goddesss place and that of her servants men were occasionally tolerated but never truly welcomed you she asked his tone was dry tolerated and the sword robin inquired merlin seemed to have drifted away from them there is a grave upon the island he said a man sleeps in it but also an ideal he and others embodied and yet embody it the sword is there he looked at robin come nightfall you and the goddesss daughter must climb what is now a hill but once was an island marians brows rose goddesss daughter in your blood he answered in your bones but those who remain will attempt to stop you regardless he smiled as they exchanged a concerned glance just as the sheriff attempts to stop you from robbing the wealthy and poaching the kings deer that put it in perspective robin sighed what do you want us to do find the sword merlin answered i am known there even by the stones that outlive us all i cannot go it is for you to do i am a man robin said will i be what did you say tolerated merlin inclined his head in marians direction because of her yes marians tone was implacable we go nowhere and do nothing without knowing what we may expect resistance merlin told her suspicious robin inquired what kind of resistance the enchanter spread his hands that i cannot say it may take many forms robin remained suspicious but you will not accompany us merlin shook his head if i go the task cannot be completed and it must be for arthurs sake and the welfare of britain robin laughed you have a way with words myrddyn emrys perhaps that is the secret of your sorcery you convince others to do the work for you merlin said so long as the work is done it matters not who has the doing of it marian continued to gaze upon the hill how will we know to find the sword is it standing up from a stone robins laughter rang out the enchanter was mystified until the story was explained merlin frowned it was not like that at all there was no such drama it was marian halted him with a raised hand please let it remain as we know it tales and legends are akin to food when there is little hope in a poor mans life merlins smile twitched this is as much as i know the grave and the sword are on the isle where i cannot say it felt like a challenge or even after all a quest marian looked at robin the moon will be full tonight shall we go ahunting he put out a hand and brushed a strand of hair away from her eyes smiling let us make a new legend moonlight lay on the land as marian and robin crossed the grass merlin claimed had once been a lake she wondered if it might possibly be true as its appearance was so different from that of the forest behind them and the hill before there were no great oaks beeches and alders no tangle of foliage no stone outcroppings merely grasslands hollowed out of the earth a faint wind blew teasing at their hair robins was awash with moonlight nearly silverwhite the metal of his brigandine glowed and sparked the light was kind to his face for all his expression was serious she wanted abruptly to stop him to kiss him to vow again how much she loved him but something in the night suggested such behavior would be unwelcome she felt urgency well up into a desire to find the sword for merlin and return to him as soon as possible nothing in her wished to tarry beside her robin shuddered he felt her glance and smiled ruefully someone walked over my grave fear sent a frisson through her say no such thing not here he glanced around rubbing at the back of his neck perhaps not he agreed before them lay the first incline of the hill a ragged seam of stone curving into the darkness and a terrace of grass above it here vegetation began clumps spreading inward ascending the hill the trees stood higher yet forming a crown around the summit she and robin climbed steadily upward until he stopped short just as they entered the outer fringe of trees the look on his face startled her what is it i am not supposed to be here he worked his shoulders as if they prickled with chill merlin was right men are not wanted but he broke off feeling gingerly at the cut on his head but she prodded but i in particular am not wanted or so it feels he studied his fingers bleeding again let me see she moved around to his other side turning his head into the moonlight a little yes she peeled hair away saw where fresh blood welled moment by moment it ran faster thicker until even her fingers could not stop it perhaps we should turn back robins expression was odd he said there would be resistance marian frowned as she drew her meatknife and commenced cutting a strip from her tunic you believe you are bleeding again because of that i believe that on a night such as this it may be possible he winced and the ache is returning bend your head marian tied the cloth around his head do you believe what he says that there even is a sword and if we find it it may guard england robin sighed fingering the knot she had tied in the makeshift bandage i am not certain what i believe but if there is truth to it he shrugged what harm if we try an aching head ah well i daresay i can stand that robin looked at the vanguard of trees springing up around them the stories say arthur was taken away by nine queens and given secret burial rites if this is avalon what remains of it in any case it is possible his grave is here and what else is there to do but bury the kings sword with the kings body give it to his son marian answered promptly save that no one of arthurs court would wish to see a bastard a patricide carrying it merlin was not there when arthur died robin went on thoughtfully he may have meant to give it back to the lake on arthurs death but if the women of avalon took it away with the body they would have brought it here marian gazed up the hill to where the trees thickened choked with undergrowth but all of it is merely a story is it robin asked stories are changed over time embellished the way alan embellishes his ballads but what if the kernel is true what if that man back there whom we witnessed come out of a tree no matter how much we wish to deny it truly is merlin then arthurs grave is up there and the sword robin said excalibur he reached out a hand to her shall we find it marian put her own in his alan would make a fine ballad of this robins teeth gleamed in a wide grin oh that he would he would have us being beset on all sides by unseen enemies battling evil spirits making our way up a hill that crawled with the shades of longdead men well marian said dryly of such fancies are legends born with every step he took ascending the hill robin felt oppressed heavy as if his body gained the mass and weight of stones ancient under the sun breath ran ragged his head ached it took all of his strength to put one foot after the other and continue climbing he knew marian was concerned he saw it each time she halted a step or two above him looking back to find him toiling behind her expending effort merely to keep moving the bandage around his head stilled most of the blood but a stubborn trickle dribbled continuously down beside his ear his shoulder was wet with it where the blood had fallen they were nearly to the crown of the hill when he drew his sword he could not say why it was necessary save to know it was in his years upon crusade and more years yet as an outlaw in sherwood he had learned to trust his instincts just as they crossed beyond the last line of trees and stepped out onto the rocky summit marian stopped short her eyes he saw were stretched wide unblinking trembling hands moved to cover her ears the sound she made was like nothing he had ever heard from her a combination of whimper protest and astonishment he reached out to touch her to put his hand upon her shoulder but found such resistance in the air that he could not his hand stopped short of her body unable to go farther marian i hear them she said robin heard nothing she drew in a breath their souls are still here whose souls the women the women who lived here those who worshipped the goddess she closed her eyes then intent upon something he could neither see nor hear they knew peace here in life and death not christians but reverent in their own way following their faith she removed her hands and looked at him merlin was right he could not come here nor do they wish you to be here and you he asked marian smiled crookedly i may or may not be descended from women who lived here in merlins day the power has faded but there is memory here i will not be chased away she closed her eyes again he could see the lids twitching as if she slept her mouth moved slightly the words she quoted were nothing he had ever heard from her or anyone else marian this time it was she who reached out to him resistance snapped he felt her hand on his smooth and warm as she led him to the center of the hilltop he is with me she said and the world made way there were voices in her ears nothing she could make out not words she understood but voices womens voices calling out was it her help they desired or her absence marian could not tell what it was they wanted merely that they existed that they filled her mind with sound and her heart with yearning his hand was warm in hers but she was barely conscious of it she led him without hesitation to the center of the summit to the place where stacked stone had tumbled into ruin from graceful lines into disarray most were lichenclad mossgrown buried in soil and ground cover some had cracked wide open broken into bits by frost and sun nothing here resembled a place to live but live they had she could feel it in her bones sense it singing in her blood here she said robin stopped beside her the grave she turned her face up to the moon squinting at its brilliance no the women worshipped here he was silent marian sensed his unease she turned to him to reassure him that she was welcome here that so long as he was her consort he would be tolerated but she forgot the intention as something came down between them a hissing line of light lanced out of the sky so cold it burned they broke apart and fell back guarding their eyes in the flash of illumination marian saw robins drawn and hollowed face the grimness in his mouth the bared blade of his sword glinted in the darkness she was christianborn and bred not a goddessworshipper but something within responded to the place she a woman had a right to be here none of the women of avalon had ever turned away one of their own though not all had remained what remained of them would not turn her away still she was uneasy resistance merlin had said robin had spoken of unseen enemies and evil beings marian sensed neither here merely the memories of women who had left the world of men to make their own way to find their own faith that memory could make itself tangible did not somehow strike her as unusual not here not this night nor that the souls of the women tied to the stone and soil of avalon would be present still they had not known a heaven such as christians did they had worshipped another way blasphemy the priests would say heresy it was not marians way but she could respect that women before her might seek another road a womans life was difficult with or without a man her man stood beside her marian looked into his eyes blood yet ran down his jaw to drip upon his shoulder she reached up touched his face felt the warmth of his flesh beneath the beard felt the stickiness of blood in her heart welled a strange strong fierceness we have come at merlins behest she said within not to disrupt not to dishonor but to set to rights what has been perverted england britain must prevail but she cannot without your aid allow us to be the vessels of this aid let us have the sword a moment later the answer was given marian smiled i know the way his brows arched to the grave she gestured look she waited for him to see it to find it to remark in satisfaction but he did none of those things he looked but he was blind here she took his hand again led him to the stone beneath a scattering of dirt encroached upon by ground cover lay a flat crude plinth of weathered stone half the length of robins height this he asked this is nothing the answer was immediate if men knew arthur slept here they would come and if they came they would undoubtedly expect a monument to the king but that is not what the women or avalon wished only peace and that they offered arthur he was dubious how can you be certain this is his grave surely others have died here she shrugged i can give you no explanation i just know because they have told me robin closed his mouth on his next question and squatted down he set aside his sword then leaned forward one hand went out to the stone to touch its surface he ran his fingers over the stone and stopped his expression abruptly stilled what is it marian asked he traced the stone again feeling more carefully this time she saw the pattern down the length of the stone then across tis carved here robin said he motioned her to kneel down then took her hand and pressed it across the stone do you feel it marian shook her head wait he guided her hand up then down then across do you feel it she frowned some kind of carving i agree but i cannot make it out robin retrieved his sword from beside the stone and set it atop the pitted surface and marian understood she said merlin came out of the tree out of wood robin nodded and this is stone with the touch of our blood she stared at the sword as it lay atop the plinth then slowly she bent and took it into her hands her right she curled around the leatherwrapped grip her left she closed upon the blade closed and closed then slid it the length of the blade marian his hands were on hers freeing the sword he swore under his breath as he saw the blood flow no she said as he searched hastily for something to stop the blood wait she reached up touched the side of his head with its soggy strip of cloth brought her other hand away carefully she pressed both against the stone in the wake of her touch she left bloody handprints marian he caught her now trapped her hands wrapped around the left the cloth he had cut from his own tunic she allowed it watched his eyes as he tended her in this moment he thought only of her not of what they wrought atop arthurs grave when he was done she looked at the stone there she told him robin barely glanced at it more concerned with her welfare but when he looked again his eyes widened he stood up abruptly stiff with shock of utter disbelief marian smiled through her tears take it up robin excalibur was never meant for a womans hands any more than avalon was meant for a man but for a long time he stood atop the hill moonlight bleaching his hair and did not touch it smiling marian rose in her hands she carried the other sword the blade that knew its home in the sheath at robins hip she began to walk away back to the trees cloaking the shoulders of avalons crown marian she held her silence when he joined her when he came down the hill to walk beside her through the trees to the shore on the verge of grass not water he carried arthurs sword the enchanter saw it in their faces as they came up out of the grasslands below the hill he had seen it many times before hundreds of years before in those who served arthur the acknowledgment that they were a part of something greater than any man might name though he could not explain it goddesstouched godtouched godtouched the name did not matter what mattered was that they had this night become a part of the tapestry others long before merlin had begun to weave a tapestry made of living threads dyed in the blood of the sacrifice he smiled the nazarene too had been a sacrifice he waited in silence as they came up to him marian carried robins sword the other the one merlin himself had been given by the lady rested in the hands of a man who would have had he been born in an earlier time aided arthur with all the loyalty in his soul well he aided him now merlin smiled it is well done robins expression was solemn what would you have of us now your part is finished merlin answered this is for me to do he took the great sword from robin held it almost reverently in the morning you will go back to sherwood to the life you have made i thank you both for your time and your aid i promise you this much in recompense because i have seen it you will not die for years and years no one so petty as the sheriff of nottingham will cause your deaths time will take its toll but where i go now i go alone to the lake marian asked we could follow you robin threatened mildly merlin laughed but you are there already he turned then put his back to them took three steps away from them even as he heard each begin to ask what it was he did he sent the sword spinning into the air moonlight sparked and glinted not meant to fly eventually the weapon came down it struck the ground soundlessly too far for them to hear now merlin murmured beneath the sword the earth opened from it swelled water bursting free to spill out onto the grasslands between forest and hill satisfied merlin watched as it ran and ran as it filled and filled more rapidly than a man could clearly see until at last the water stilled lapping at his feet were the wavelets of a lake floating upon the waters shrouded in mist and moonlight was the isle of avalon lady merlin said i give it back to you i give him back to you so both may guard britain after a moment he turned to them both he marked the pallor of their faces the stillness of their bodies the blood upon their flesh smiling he stepped close he set each hand to the backs of their skulls and such as it was in him to do blessed them both even as he healed their hurts robin said baffled it was on avalon already merlin nodded the women safeguarded it not knowing it was the lady who entrusted it to me until arthur came of age but it was never of earth it was for no one to keep not even the well intentioned why us marian asked why not you in the old ways the old days a woman ruled but never alone she had a consort she made the great marriage and it was sealed with blood he smiled at them both the times have changed no need for the consort to die but the blood of the great marriage remains sacred i had none to offer he saw the frowns in their eyes the uneasiness with the idea of ancient rituals go home he said gently you have served britain well she will not fail for time out of mind tears stood in marians eyes what about you the same he answered i go this is not my time this is not my place i belong elsewhere where will you go robin asked merlin smiled he indicated a shadow upon the water stretching out from the island they are sending a boat for me but you said you were not wanted there marian said i am tolerated merlin answered now and again he looked over their heads at the forest beyond make a bed among the trees there is an oak grove there that will serve you well and i promise there are no faces in the trees nor captive enchanters they were reluctant to leave but did as he bade slowly walking away he watched the man reach out for the womans hand watched the woman reach out for the mans their fingers entwined then locked and they walked together toward the trees the boat bumped quietly against the shore dark shapes were in it shrouded in such a way he could see no faces he stepped into the boat found his balance nodded the boat began to move merlin looked back at the shore in the moonlight he saw them and then they stepped into darkness became shadows in the wood he turned away and took his seat in the boat he stripped off the circlet the ring and the dragon brooch without regret he tossed them over the side into the water payment rendered for want of conversation he said to the wraiths of avalon they will be legend themselves one day just as arthur is then the mists came down around him as avalon disappeared and the lady took him home about the authors lois mcmaster bujold lois mcmaster bujold was born in columbus ohio in she now lives
