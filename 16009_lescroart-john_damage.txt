john lescroart damage prologue felicia nunez saw him standing up against a building across the street from the stop where she normally got off her streetcar with her heart suddenly pounding in her ears she turned away from the streetcar door as it opened and sat down on one of the sidefacing benches just at the front across from the driver as the car started up again passing him she caught another glimpse of him out of the corner of her eye or maybe it was him it looked very much like him his hair maybe a little different longer from the last time shed seen him in the courtroom but the same attitude in the way he stood he had one boot propped up against the building his strong white arms crossed over his chest she knew why he was there he was waiting waiting for her back then she used to see him everywhere even when her mind had known that he could not find her shed been in witness protection no one even knew where shed lived so there was no way in reality that it could happen and yet for a year or two she thought she saw him every day but today this time it was exactly him most of the other times whoever she saw reminded her of himthe hair the arms the set of the body but today was all him not a collection of similar parts that in her terror she could imagine into the monster that he was at the next stop she descended out into the neighborhood and heard the streetcars door close behind her and then the brakes release and then the scraping sound as it moved ahead and left her standing alone at the curb she did not like to spend extra money and knew she could make a cup of coffee for free at home but he might still be there lurking and if he saw her he might or he would she could not imagine no she could imagine she went into the starbucks and ordered a coffeehalf an hours work at the cleaners where she was lucky to have a job but she needed to sit quietly and to think and also to give him time to leave if he was really waiting there to see her how could he have found her she took a seat at the front window where she could see him if he suddenly appeared among the pedestrians passing by the first sip scalded her tongue and the pain seemed to break something within her she put her paper cup down and blinked back the wave of emotion that threatened now to break over her bastardo she thought the lifedestroying bastard in her mind she was eighteen again the sun shines in her eyes as she leaves the school building where the curtlees were letting her take the english classes two times a week paying for her tuition as part of their deal she comes all this way to work for them they provide documentation and help her learn the language she is going to become a citizen one day in the us where her children can grow up educated and free it is almost too much for her to believe after her poverty in guatemala and then her mothers death leaving felicia an orphan at seventeen but now it is actually happening she has been here for five months now and in spite of her initial fears of slavery and bad treatment nothing bad has happened the son with greedy hands is someone to avoid but the curtlees are clearly just what they seemgood people wealthy beyond measure who bring young latinas here to work for them out of the goodness of their souls and god for some reason had led their man in guatemala to felicia now she walks with her eyes down against the sunlight it is a warm autumn evening and she wears a white cotton dress and red rope shoes that are so comfortable to walk in especially on the hills here in san francisco she says goodbye to the last of her classmates and turns uphill again and enters the forested area they call presidio that she has to cross to get to the house she is halfway through when he steps out from behind a bush in front of her here in the trees it is darker than the street but light enough still to see that he is confident and smiling as he steps up to her hola she says with a tiny false smile hoping he will leave her alone and she goes to move around him but he steps to the side with her you are so beautiful he says still smiling he is breathing very hard he makes some motion with his head that makes her look down and she sees that he has let himself out of his pants no por favor she says she repeats it por favor and always smiling though his eyes are deadly cold he moves quickly now both hands at her waist pulling her toward him holding her against him dont fight he rasps out dont fight me ill kill you she struggles and he slaps her face hard never letting go of her dress with his other hand he now grabs her by the throat with the one free hand hed slapped her with up against her he pushes her back and back until she falls and then he is on top of her holding her throat opening her legs under him forcing himself against and against and against and finally inside her and she screams out and he covers her mouth with one hand and tells her again that he will kill her and she believes him with all her heart and she takes it in silence and then it is over and he stands up and smiles down at her tucking himself in and tells her that he likes her shoes and hes glad that she kept them on for himthat was sexy he says the fact that she couldnt even wait to take them off she wanted it so badand then he tells her that he will see her around and maybe they will do this again her coffee had gone cold shed been sitting here now for twentyfive minutes outside the fog advanced in bleary wisps if he was waiting for her he would be very cold by now she would wrap her coat up tightly and walk by at the end of the block to see if he was still there and if he was she would keep going and decide where she would hide but when she got there he was gone she crossed the street and continued past until the next corner she came up around the block and at it from the opposite direction he was gone still she kept herself bundled into her coat her head down and the collar up as she passed first one building and then the next darting quick looks into the doorways where he might be hiding at her apartments front door recess she stopped to make sure that the door was locked it was turning around she chanced another look out to the street the asphalt shimmered in light rain seeing her name nunez clearly labeled under the mailboxes as the resident in number six she clicked her tongue not careful enough inside the door she began the trudge up the three steep flights of stairs finally making it to the top and through her door to safetya bedroom a tiny living room a kitchen she closed the door and threw the dead bolt going to the front window she again looked down at the rainglistening street turning she wondered if she had pulled the bedroom door closed behind her this morning she didnt specifically remember doing that but then finally she allowed herself a small smile it might not even have been him to begin with shed let herself get all worked up again over something that had happened so very long ago the paranoia the memories the relived fear had happened before and would happen again she couldnt let it dominate her life she had to get over it maybe there was still time to change and not live in the shadow of that one moment of horror and despair people had survived worse and gone on to do great things she let out a long breath and crossed the three steps over to the bedroom door gently gently she kicked it open see she told herself no one is here her apartment door was locked when she came in just now the front door was locked downstairs what could he possibly want with her out of all the women in the world anyway she was no longer the beauty shed been at eighteen she didnt want to be pretty and mostly avoided the temptation of trying to be pretty had ruined her life she walked through the bedroom door on the morning of what was going to be his first day at his new job a goodlooking wellbuilt man with his hair trimmed to just over his ears stood in front of his bedroom closet in a pair of jockey shorts he pulled a tshirt from the top of a large pile of them on their special shelf putting it on he checked himself in the dressers mirror sucked in an imagined gut then turned around with a small flourish the tshirt read shotgun wedding a case of wife or death no his girlfriend sat up against the beds headboard absolutely not i like it he said wes you like them all true its a foolish man who buys a shirt he doesnt like its a more foolish man who goes to work as the district attorney of san francisco wearing a shirt that can only be misinterpreted and will be by who everybody and all for different reasons sam wes walked across the room sat on the bed and put a hand on her thigh nobodys going to see it its not like im wearing it outside with my tie and besides if i have a heart attack and they have to rip open my dress shirt and somebody sees it so what its not exactly inflammatory its just a pun for gods sake its not just a pun its a political statement saying what that youre in favor of shotgun weddings that getting married isnt sacred that you dont think women are equal pick one that youre not sensitive enough in a general way well we already know that you laugh but its nothing to laugh at everything you do innocent or not is going to be a political statement from now on dont you see that i thought you would have learned that during the election nope i guess not and might i remind you i won sam made a face wes you won by ninety votes out of three hundred and fifteen thousand after your opponent died the week before the election as though its a bad thing no listen its proof that god wanted me to win he wouldnt have taken mr dexter back into his bosom if he didnt want me to win its selfevident maybe even cosmic its hopeless well i hope not that its only my first day im sure ill be way more hopeless as time goes by he got up and crossed back to the closet but if you really think its going to matter he said ill consider going with tomorrows tshirt instead youre wearing one tomorrow too sam i wear a tshirt every day it provides clues to my secret persona not so secret the press is going to start wanting to see it if word gets out good thatll just make me more je ne sais quoi quirky and lovable but if you want for the inaugural ill trade out this one with tomorrows he turned and held out the next shirt on the pile heavily medicated for your safety much better no really i mean it her head fell forward and she sighed never mind she said never never never mind hey sam he said if you cant have fun with all this whats the point four days later the fun part wasnt much in evidence wes farrells office on the third floor of the hall of justice looked more like a janitors space a couple dozen unpacked moving boxes lay stacked by the windows that looked out on bryant street his predecessors comfortable and elegant furnishings were gone meanwhile farrell had commandeered a desk and several chairs from some offices down the hall hed also brought the nerf ball basket from his old office and mounted it on the bookshelf sitting in two of the folding chairs across from farrell cliff and theresa curtlee had already congratulated him on his election victory now they exchanged glances with each other owners of san franciscos numbertwo newspaper the courier the curtlees had a lot of experience getting what they wanted in several different businesseswaste management towing importexportand their tagteam approach had a long history of success for this current campaign their expectations were high because they had been large donors to farrells campaign additionally the courier had run some flattering profiles of him before the election and in the end had endorsed him farrell had done as much homework as he could the curtlees son ro had spent the past nine years in prison serving a twentyfivetolife term for the rape and murder of one of their housekeepers dolores sandoval on the day before farrells election the us supreme court had refused to review the decision of the federal ninth circuit court of appeal that had sent the case back to san francisco for a new trial the ninth circuit had reversed the conviction overruling both the california court of appeal and the california supreme court cliff evidently gave theresa the green light to begin her face rigid with botox twitched in a semblance of a smile and she cleared her throat we wanted to talk to you about our son roland as you may have already guessed farrell grinned to make himself look amicable i thought that might be what it was what it iscliff came forward for emphasisis that hes innocent this whole thing has just been such a travesty of justice theresa added and we were hoping that with someone new at the helm here together we could find a way to make up for some of the time weve all lost over his case and possibly give us all a chance for the healing to begin i can appreciate that farrell said but i dont think too much of what happens next is within my power but it is theresa said you dont have to try him again thats within the das discretion yes well but i hope you both understand that i can hardly do that the victims family alone theresas voice was low pitched almost soothing but she wasnt his victim wes thats the point he didnt hurt her in any way if you could make the family understand cliff huffed and interrupted what family youd have to find them first wherever the hell theyre hiding out in guatemala and good luck with that theres no family to concern yourself over but there is my son farrell cleared his throat i understood that the appeal wasnt based on the evidence presented at the trial farrell was referring to the two other women who testified theyd been raped by ro farrell knew that the successful appeal had been based on the fact that several members of the victims family had worn a button with a picture of a smiling dolores sandoval on it in the courtroom during the trial this the ninth circuit had ruled must have hopelessly prejudiced the jury against the defendant it was as wacky a decision as farrell had ever heard even from a court renowned for its bizarre rulings cliff curtlee waved off farrells objection the evidence wont hold up in a new trial you read the old transcript youll see the two other socalled victims who are they they shouldnt have been allowed to testify at all and ro admits he had sex with the girl but she wanted it too theres no case anymore there wasnt any to begin with well theresa cleared her throat again but whatever you decide on the trial and im sure youll come to the right decision at the very least you can recommend a bail figure here farrell shook his head i dont want to seem unsympathetic to your sons situation but i cant do that theres no bail in a special circumstances case ah the muscles in theresas face couldnt get traction andperhaps to compensate for the lack of expressionshe held up her index finger but thats the whole point its not a special circumstances case its never been one farrell showed his confusion im sorry it was sharron pratts one concession to us after all wed done for her cliff obviously didnt harbor any warm feelings for the former da whod prosecuted their son well practiced possibly even rehearsed theresa picked up the thread the charges were rape and murder not murder in the commission of rape farrell noted the logical impossibility if her son did it the crime had to be rapemurder but evidently this hadnt bothered sharron pratt so it wasnt special circumstances wes said in other words it wasnt a nobail case theresa bared her teeth slightly exactly so he was eligible for bail and will be again this time and last time was he in fact released on bail no cliff said that fascist thomasinoa highly respected superior court judgedenied the bail anyway he was prejudiced against ro theresa added all through the trial every decision he made it was obvious to everybody and so this time this time cliff said since bail is legally permissible wed just like to make a personal appeal to you wes to step in if you catch wind of any early sign of judicial activism at the very least keep it away from thomasino or maybe even put the word out that youll allow a reasonable bail before the matter even gets inside a courtroom it wouldnt have to be a public statement theresa said the important thing is the result and then shifting into a less strident tone she added now that hes out of prison wes wed just love to have our boy back with us at home farrells own personal idea of hell was to have any of his own three grown children come and stay with him and sam for more than a long weekend but here was a chance to sound cooperative if not conciliatory and maybe bring this uncomfortable interview to a close i understand how you can feel that way he said and i promise you ill review the case closely and do everything i can to address your concerns which he knew would be precious little but the finality in his tone conveyed his intended signal theresa smoothed her skirt and stood up thats all we ask wes really cliff stared disconcertingly into farrells eyes for another second or twothreateningbut then he too got to his feet its good to know who your friends are he said and you know that the couriers been good friends with a lot of politicians in this town well im not much of a politician as the election made pretty clear wes said but i do hope i can keep trying to do the right thing theresa took his proffered hand and gave him a prim little nod thats all we can ask for thanks for sharing so much of your valuable time my pleasure to both of you my doors always open just down the hallway from his own office farrell knocked on the open door of his chief assistant amanda jenkins despite a long history togetheror maybe because of ittheirs was an awkward relationship the conflict might have been purely endemicjenkins was historically prosecution and farrell was dyedinthewool defense more personally in the sensational murder case that had made his bones in the city farrell had gone headtohead against jenkins and beaten her in court getting a clean acquittal for his client then last year jenkins had been considering a run for district attorney herself but the powers that had eventually settled on wes farrell as their candidate made it clear that they felt that she was a bit too much a onetrick ponyher issues were womens issues period she was insufficiently left wing in other respects believing for example that a period of house arrest was probably not the answer to violent crime but in the immediate aftermath of farrells victory those same power brokers had promoted jenkins cause as chief assistantshe had the prosecutorial chops the administrative experience the indepth familiarity with the das office personnel and at least in feminist circles the correct politics so now they were four days into their respective new jobs and this was the first time farrell had seen her since his inauguration ceremony jenkins looked up from the pile of work surrounding her on her desk and straightened in her chair sir farrell half turned as though looking around behind him theres no sir here amanda its just me wes i was wes when we were colleagues at the bar and even running against each other remember yes sir yes wes she took a breath okay wes good at ease he came into the room got a sec mind if i get the door jenkins was a career prosecutor always professionally turned out with the possible exception of the trademark short skirts she wore to accentuate her truly showstopping legs now she threw a slightly harried look at her new boss and shrugged indicating her workload but then pushed her chair back a bit and linked her hands on her lap at his service whats up farrell closed the door and pulled a chair around i just had a chat with the curtlees both of them that was fast she said her eyes suddenly alive and let me guess they wanted you to decline to retry ro and failing that then let him out on bail you got a bug in my office jenkins was deaf to humor i hope you told them to take a flying not in so many words i said id look into the matter and try to do the right thing theres nothing to look into their boy ro is a monster farrell held up a hand waiting while she huffed out a breath or two ive already done some looking since you prosecuted that case i thought you could catch me up quicker than reading the transcript all the way through jenkins smoldering blew out again you see what they let him out on those lunatics the victims family wore badges with her picture on it so quote federal constitutional error must have permeated the proceedings unquote have you ever heard such horseshit i mean even for the ninth circus this is out there farrell let her rave and she went on i hope one of those judges has a daughter and ro gets out and finds her and no no i dont hope that but jesus christ the guys got to stay in jail what did you tell them the curtlees nothing really i wanted to get your take my take she sat back closed her eyes briefly keep him in jail get him back at trial as soon as you can this is a nobrainer wes the guy raped at least eight women beat three of them and finally succeeded in killing one eight at least eight wes at least all housekeepers brought up from guatemala or el salvador by the company who screened the curtlee familys entire workforce all of them here on a work visa all who originally said theyd testify and then six of them got bought off to the tune of like a hundred grand each you know this for a fact one hundred percent they were honest about it in our lovely state you know you cant make a rape victim testify if she doesnt want to she can just refuse to get on the stand and all these women preferred to take the hundred grand there was nothing we could do and all these women reported rapes with ro jenkins mouth closed down to a thin line these were women who were raped by ro wes i dont doubt it farrell kept his tone nonconfrontational but i was asking if any of these women had reported these rapes when they happened no answer amanda her eyes flashed they were scared to death of ro wes to say nothing of the curtlees who had absolute power over their lives plus they didnt think anyone would believe them so im taking that as a no nobody reported is that right jenkins gave farrell the thousandyard stare her face set in stone i really hoped we wouldnt be having this kind of conversation what kind of conversation temporizing over violent crime just because of the political climate this criticism knocked farrell back in his chair shaking his head adjusting his bearings he came back at her so i ask one question to clarify if these women reported their rapes and suddenly im the enemy i spoke to these women wes i know them no question they were raped all right farrell said fine lets all agree on that lets also all agree since were being honest here that the curtlees were pretty big fans of yours all through the campaign and that maybe you feel you might owe them a little cooperation thats just not true amanda i made no promises of any kind to the curtlees as far as i know ros in custody and should stay there until he gets his new trial certainly im not planning to do anything thatll let him get back on the street thats the truth amanda and regardless of what you might think i dont take orders from the curtlees or anybody else except sometimes sam he took a breath to calm himself shaken at how far this had already gone and with so little warning thats just not how i operate all right im a pretty upfront guy actually she took a long beat pursing her lips now theyve hated me since i sent their fairhaired little boy off to prison its a miracle i have any kind of a career left after all theyve tried to do to me and yet here you are at number two appointed by the very guy they supported so whos the winner in that picture number two isnt number one true but its not hardly a dead career either is it and youve got more years left on the planet than i do so i wouldnt give up hope and if i were you i certainly wouldnt get mad at your boss for something hes not going to do she hung her head for another second i didnt believe youd be able to resist them or even want to im sorry i was out of line this one time only farrell said ill forgive you farrell had a gap in his appointment schedule providing time for him and his administrative assistant treya glitsky to unpack more boxes treya was a strong attractive woman of mixed ethnicitymostly black with a hint somewhere of an asian bloodline she was married to the citys head of homicide abe glitsky and had three childrenraney off at college and rachel and zachary six and three at home farrell sat on the edge of his desk not being particularly helpful on the moving front no im serious he was saying i really shouldnt be here im not cut out for this job maybe i ought to resign before i do too much damage treya stopped moving books from the packing boxes onto his bookshelf and turned around looking at her watch that could be a record i think it took clarence a week before he thought he ought to quit she was referring to farrells immediate predecessor and her own previous boss clarence jackman and he wound up staying nine years thats not me farrell said i only ran for this thing to keep the nazis from taking over mostly as a favor to sam and her women friends and the latinos and the gays okay some of them too and dont forget those crucial votes from a hundred straight old white guys my margin of victory farrell swung his legs kicked his heels back against the side of his desk is that true clarence really wanted to quit too at first every day for a couple of months but dont worry you still hold the record for least days in office before expressing the famed desire to retire thats a relief but why didnt he quit then clarence treya paused he got addicted to the naked wielding of power no really you asked me thats my answer power farrell chortled well thats not me that couldnt be further from me no treya chortled right back at him no of course not she leaned over and grabbed another stack of books that of course not sounded a little sarcastic its the acoustics in here placing the books on their shelf she half turned back to him so would you like me to go talk to amanda no i think we got it worked out im not going to stab her in the back on this ro curtlee thing or anything else that ought to be clear enough lets hope treya said our town by sheila marrenas justice took a big leap forward in san francisco yesterday when roland curtlee the son of this newspapers publishers was released on bail mr curtlee whose conviction had been reviewed and reversed by the ninth circuit court of appeal has served nine years in prison for the rape and murder of a housekeeper from his parents home dolores sandoval during the trial many of the victims family members and their supporters had appeared daily in the courtroom sporting large buttons with sandovals smiling face it was an effective and as the court has ruled illegal technique to elicit sympathy for the victim at the expense of mr curtlee during the trial mr curtlee never denied that he was involved in a relationship with ms sandoval this explained the dna evidence taken from ms sandovals body after her death but never explained were allegations that ms sandoval had a large dance card of suitors who were never pursued by police although he was legally entitled to his freedom via bail during his last incarceration before his trial nine years ago mr curtlee had been denied bail by judge oscar thomasino a conservative judicial activist whose decision was widely decried in legal circles mr curtlee said one stanford professor was denied due process in the bail proceedings and was subject to a prejudicial review by judge thomasino that assumed his guilt and denied his basic civil rights in a hearing today at the hall of justice superior court judge sam baretto set bail for the recently remanded mr curtlee at million though this figure is on its face exorbitant the curtlee family had no serious objections any amount that allows our innocent son to reclaim some of his life as a normal citizen is worth whatever it might cost said mr curtlees mother theresa after the bail figure was announced we are looking forward to his second trial and are confident that this time justice will prevail and ro will walk away a free man amanda jenkins was talking to her lunch partner and boyfriend an investigator for the das office named matt lewis farrell loves to play the awshucksimnotapolitician game but he knew damn well that if he didnt put some pressure on baretto that there was no avoiding bail look im not saying he should have backchanneled baretto and threatened to challenge him out of the building but we both know elected officials in this town who would have done exactly that at the very least farrell should have been in court and stood on counsels table and screamed if he had to so baretto got the message loud and clear instead it was the curtlees and all their power against a lowly assistant da me who did farrell think was going to win that fight still lewis said ten mil its ten mil only if ro skips and thats never going to happen they just put up their house as a property bond written before they left the building so farrell lied to you at least he deliberately misled me also jenkins went on farrells leaving out that were talking a couple of years here before ro gets his new trial if even then a couple of years whos going to be pushing for it she asked ros lawyers dont want it for obvious reasons farrell isnt going to press since none of the victims family is around anymore so this way he can keep the curtlees happy so they can write nice articles about him that fucking sheila marrenas which leaves guess who as the only party interested in putting this scumbag back on trial within the decade well maybe there are two of us whos the other one glitsky perhaps well if youve got to have an ally you could do worse especially with his wife just outside farrells office i dont know maybe maybe lewis reached a hand and rested it palm side up on the white tablecloth after a moment of silence jenkins put her own hand on top of his farrell doesnt understand how bad they can be she said these guys the curtlees not just ro although he is in a class by himself they are truly evil the thought of going up against them again it scares the shit out of me and might glitsky for that matter hey you both already did it once and barely survived at his skeptical look she went on if thats an exaggeration its a small one you know why i got yanked off trying homicides all those many years ago was it because i wasnt good at them no it was because i succeeded with ro i put him down and his parents spent the next few years trying their damnedest to ruin my reputation i drank too much i slept around i withheld evidence in the end pratt had to send me down for the good of the team you probably read all about it trying to lighten it up lewis asked that was you but jenkins wasnt laughing and glitsky too amanda hes head of homicide and used to be deputy chief nobodys ruined his career they came close you know what he was doing before he got appointed deputy chief this was after he had already been head of homicide give up payroll head of homicide to payroll the trajectory there isnt up so what happened howd he get back frank batiste became chief of police thats how he and glitsky go way back but without batiste glitsky was done and he was done because the curtlees and marrenas never let up behind the scenes i dont think even he knows exactly how far they went but he must have seen at least some of the articles as head of homicide glitsky tolerated sloppy detective work that was the real reason we had the worst conviction rate in the country he routinely told his men to plant evidence his guys kept andor sold the dope they found serving their warrants you name it if it was bad he did it oh and my favorite he actually took part in the ambush that killed barry gerson a previous head of homicide glitsky maybe even killed him himself yeah but nobody believed that still the courier printed it and dont kid yourself people did believe it people believe anything obama wasnt born in the us we never landed on the moon well lewis said smiling again everybody knows those jenkins blew out well you see what im saying the curtlees print whatever lies they find convenient and some significant percentage of the lunatic fringewhich in this town is very large as you knowbelieves it all so im stuck down in crimes against women instead of homicide and glitsky works ten years to get back to where he was when he arrested ro all these many years ago she drank off what remained of her cranberry juice and so thanks to mr farrell and the ninth circuit here we are back again with glitsky and me the only ones trying to get ro back to trial ill tell you what matt i dont know if im going to have the guts to do it i dont know if the curtlees wont try to stop me physically or ro himself might theyve never done anything like that before have they hey you dont have to believe me maybe im paranoid but i know what theyre capable of and ill tell you something else she lowered her voice and leaned across the table i almost hope they try something no you dont yes i do you notice im carrying a larger purse for the first time in my career since ros out i am packing heat amanda jenkins did not know that she had another ally besides abe glitsky in her quest to get ro curtlee back behind bars sam duncan was sitting at her kitchen table at about eight thirty when she heard the front door open and the sound of farrells voice as he entered their house on the periphery of buena vista park he was talking to their dog a yellow labrador named gert in a gentle singsong voice that bore no resemblance to the way he talked most of the time i know its a long long day baby but youre doing so good so so so good thats a good girl thats the best girl yes okay youre my very favorite girl man and dog got to the kitchen and farrell stopped straightening up actually he whispered as gert jumped across the room to greet sam shes my second favorite girl but she gets jealous if i dont tell her its her following the dog he leaned over and kissed sam on the cheek youre my very favorite no response female wes added gerts only three years old so i call her a girl which seems appropriate even if she is a dog whereas you are a mature and lovely human woman whom i would never under any circumstances call a girl she looked up at him i cant believe you let ro curtlee out on bail farrell stopped halfway to shrugging out of his coat and youre my favorite male he said with a little lilt meant to mimic sam human male i mean and how was your day honey he got the coat off and draped it over one of the kitchen chairs actually he said i didnt let ro curtlee out on bail judge baretto did that you were supposed to tell him not to i did my chief assistant made the argument maybe you didnt get that memo how could you not go down yourself and argue against bail youve told me yourself baretto was gutless why didnt you pass the word that youd challenge him off every criminal case for the rest of his life if he granted bail how do you know i didnt did you no farrell backed a step away silly me i thought that baretto being a superior court judge and all might have reached his own conclusion about whether or not bail was appropriate and it looks as though he did which for the record wasnt the conclusion i wished hed gotten to but you could have stopped him or at least headed him off actually probably not sam but you dont know for sure because you didnt try farrell stalled for a little time pulling one of the kitchen chairs out turning it around and straddling it listen sam this thing started back with sharron pratt who in her wisdom decided to charge ro with rape and murder but not rape in commission of a murder he held up a hand and i know if he did one he did the other the charge made no sense but that didnt stop pratt what it did do was leave it up to the courts to decide on bail the last judge thomasino denied it good choice baretto not so much now could i have threatened him somehow yes but it would have been unethical and he would have only resented the intrusion into what is properly his domain and ive got to work with these guys the judges for the next four years i thought it might be a good idea not to antagonize them in my first month so now weve got a convicted rapist out on the streets sad to say sam weve got a lot more than one rapes a bailable offense as we have seen it sucks but what am i going to do im supposed to enforce the laws not write em sam fixed him with a flat disgusted glare i dont know how this whole district attorney thing with you is going to work out you know that im starting to get an idea farrell replied since theyd been kids janice and kathy had worked harmoniously together in the kitchen today they were in kathys home in saint francis wood which was quite a bit more upscale than janices crowded threebedroom stucco twenty blocks north in the avenues but to hear the two women talking gossiping joking occasionally breaking into song only the keenest observer might sense that the disparity between their homes and kitchens was a little bit hard to bear for janice janice durbin was after all the elder by four years the better educated the harder working the more beautiful nevertheless janice often had to stifle the pang of envy that would lance her heart when she found herself confronted anew as she was today by her sisters material possessionsthe newly redecorated island kitchen the tuscan tile work the huge subzero refrigerator the viking stove brushed stainless steel everywhere you looked in her darker moments much more frequent of late janice sometimes found herself wondering why kathy had gotten all this what shed done to deserve it could it all be a matter of luck and it wasnt just the stuff although to be sure there was plenty of thatfurnishings clothes jewelry beyond that kathys life was so smooth so effortless so serene and why wouldnt it be shed gotten it exactly right in making the single most important choice of her lifethe man she had married chuck novio tenured professor of american history at san francisco state university was one of the most effortlessly gifted men janice had ever met kathy had snagged him soon after he transferred here from back east whipsmart tall trim athletic and funny he also possessed a calm strength and sensitivity that seemed to rub off on kathy and on their wellbehaved twelveyearold twin daughters sara and leslie it was only because of this comparison that janice sometimes let herself sink into selfpity that in turn primed the pump of her recurrent bouts of selfloathing she knew about these things about how they workedafter all she was a psychiatrist in reality in real life she was not any kind of a loser herselfshe knew that and neither were her husband michael or any of their own three children jon peter and allie its just that michael ran his own business a ups franchise on union street and the stress of that took its continual toll making him sometimes seem much older than his fortyone years and add to that the kids were all in high school now at the same time three teenagers in the home did not generally equate to much serenity janice stood in front of the sink with the cold water running over her hands and into the colander of peeled potatoes through the window chuck and michael and the boys were playing touch football in the lateafternoon sunlight she went still and sighed janice is everything all right fine she told her sister everythings fine just looking at them playing out there they grow up so fast the boys dont they thats funny kathy came over and stood next to her you see your sons growing up and i see our husbands staying young still boys themselves in a lot of ways thats probably a healthier way to look at it i dont know about healthier its just how i see it its healthier trust me she turned off the running water and put her hands on either side of the sink leaning her weight into them kathy touched her arm are you sure youre okay janice shook her head its just been a long week now she straightened up im sorry im just so glad were here getting this break out of our house and sunday night dinner is always great i dont mean to be a downer youre not well im not exactly pollyanna either she glanced outside again i should be happy michaels even out there with chuck and the boys at all this whole past week its almost like hes been paralyzed and in our house with everybody on top of one another moods tend to pile on up so everybodys been a little snappy she broke a brittle laugh did i say a little snappy i mean i know why its smart we dont keep guns in the house janice come on well not really of course janice dried her hands on a dish towel then handed it to her sister crossing over to the island she pulled out a stool for kathy then sat on one herself but lets just say its good for us all to be here and out from under each others feet for a few hours whats michael been paralyzed about work no works been good christmas was way better than anybody predicted crazy busy but good so what not you guys well janice paused weve been better i suppose but i dont think its that either does the name ro curtlee ring a bell kathy scrunched her face in concentration for a second no i dont think so who is he remember the jury michael was on like ten years ago vaguely although ten years ago i had twoyearolds and everything was pretty much a blur michael was the jury foreman or something right right and they found ro guilty and sent him away good right i remember now but then his parents came after you something like that exactly like that the memory was still all too clear to janice durbin when the newspapers did interviews with the other jurors after the trial it came out that michael had played a prominent role in getting the guilty verdict the jury had started out at only percent for conviction but michael kept at them in the deliberations and finally got the other six to go along with him and vote guilty when the curtlees realized this they set out to destroy her husband and nearly succeeded at the time hed worked for one of the citys big law firms as a word processing supervisor a daytime job that left him time for his painting the curtlees had connections with the people he worked for and durbin got accused of a lot of mischiefstealing supplies from the storeroom using the firms computers for his own workuntil he got fired he received no severance after seven years of employment and was told he was lucky they werent prosecuting him criminally finally after a courier article on durbin the hypocrite vigilante and now thief whod railroaded ro curtlee into jail he found himself blackballed in the legal firms and couldnt get work for almost a year couldnt find the heart to get back to his painting janice sighed i think having to abandon the painting was the hardest thing that was a bad time kathy said id almost forgotten all about it and his painting well michael hasnt hes never really come to grips with having to quit that three kids kathy said i know but still her mouth tightened at the memory its a miracle he eventually got the ups franchise somehow under the curtlees radar at least we thought they were more or less forever out of our lives theyre not they might be we hope so but maybe not why not because last week some idiot judges let ro out of prison on appeal and another moron of a judge here in town gave him bail while hes waiting for a retrial and now hes out ro the convicted murderer walking around free as a bird and michaels thinking its all going to start again that everything he went through everything we went through was all just in vain and the idea as i said just paralyzes him if ros out again then michaels stand with the jury basically made no difference it was all just a big cosmic joke out in the street michael durbin took the hike from his younger boy peter when theyd been choosing up sides durbin had almost as a matter of course chosen peter to be his teammate against uncle chuck and jon both boys were athletic but jon had an indefinable special something as well asmuch as he tried to deny and even hide ita special place in durbins heart though he loved both of his sons and tried to treat them exactly equally durbin and his firstborn shared a natural simpatico and deep connection that durbin knew might prove hurtful to his very sensitive younger son if he let down his guard and inadvertently revealed his instinctual favoritism it was a lifelong struggle so whenever he got the chanceas here choosing who would be his teammatedurbin leaned over backward to pick his younger son over his older he knew that jon intuitively understood why durbin did this why he almost always appeared to favor peter the insecure younger boy needed the overt signs the trappings of his fathers love and approval jon did not it wasnt something he and his dad had to talk about they simply got each other now durbin faded to his left with the football as his brotherinlaw chuck started counting to five at the scrimmage line and peter raced down the street cutting first right then left trying to shake his brother jons coverage when durbin saw peter cut back again gaining a step on jon he threw a high arching spiral that led his younger boy perfectly or almost perfectly jon jumped and with a cry of jubilation came down with the ball putting a move on peter he shook him and then sprinted up the street yelling for chuck to block him block him block him meaning durbin but durbin feinted right left right again and broke around chuck then got enough in front of jon to slow him down a step which in turn allowed peter to come up from behind jon and get him just as durbin reached him too even though they were playing touch football durbin threw his arms around his beloved son and held him in a hug for a full second maybe two contact all the kids having dispersed to the television room at the other end of the house the adults found themselves sitting around the novios nowcleared dining room table everyone drinking frangelico out of snifters you really think he still cares chuck was asking hes done ten years in the slammer michael said thats a long time to think about getting back at who put you there chuck sipped and nodded its also a hell of a long time to hold a grudge dont you think michael shrugged i dont think theres a statute of limitations on grudges yes but kathy said it seems to me that these curtlees did what they did back when all this was fresh in their minds and ro just recently convicted but now that hes out of prison who cares about anybody who helped send him there youre not a threat to him anymore janice threw a look at her husband across the table thats what i told him too michael looked from one sister to the other and i hope youre both right but even if you are right about his parents theres still ro himself chuck was shaking his head i dont see that hes not going to do anything except be a good boy while he waits for his new trial michael swirled the liqueur in his glass i dont think so he cant be a good boy he doesnt know how michael his wife said how can you know that i can know it because i heard him testify at his trial i mean heres this serial rapist on the witness stand trying to convince us that he was in fact in a normal relationship with the woman he killed they were having consensual sex what was the big deal maybe they were kathy said they were not i promise shes eighteen just off the boat scared to death and shes living under his roof on a work visa that the curtlees can pull anytime they want then ro wants to have sex with her so whatever it was it wasnt consensual still chuck said it might not necessarily have been rape right i mean she could have been coerced but felt she had to chuck kathy said thats still rape im just saying maybe not technically legally michael nodded dont tell that to the other two exhousekeepers who testified who said that ro had a thing about them keeping their shoes on thats just weird kathy said why did he have them do that chuck asked michael shook his head nobody knows hes a nutcase but they both said it and this means chuck asked it means ros guilty as hell if dolores sandoval was naked except for her shoes and she was so it wasnt consensual sex it was a rape and then when she started screaming he had to shut her up theres no other way to interpret it what about the other two women kathy asked the ones who did testify what about them i mean what did he say about them their testimony he just said they were lying hed never had sex with either of them much less raped them he was just being set up why who knew by whom he didnt know there was just a lot of prejudice out there in the world against people who had money but chuck came in again my point is michael this guy ro isnt going to come after you youre no part of his new trial right right if the new trial ever happens well even if it doesnt what kind of threat are you to him michael nodded maybe youre right i think i am why would he come after you youve been put in your place after last time youre not trying to get him thrown back in jail id be surprised if he knew or cared if you were still alive janice added i think chucks right here michael we dont have to worry about them anymore they took their best shot at you and it wasnt enough but pretty darn close michael said pretty darn close at on a friday afternoon almost three weeks later the man who ran san franciscos homicide detail picked up the telephone at his desk within the first half of the first ring at the same time he pulled his pad over in front of him tucked the phone at his ear and grabbed a pen glitsky lieutenant the female voice was metallic and without inflection weve got a female body at a probable arson fire scene at four twenty baker nearest cross street is oak apartment number six fire is contained arsons taking jurisdiction but local squad units precinct captain csi and paramedics are en route roger that glitsky was writing down the essentials ill get a team rolling out there four twenty baker number six thats it hanging up glitsky pushed back from his desk fiftyseven years old he stood six foot two and weighed pounds during college he had been a tight end for san jose state at the same weight though his eyes were blue his skin was dark his nose prominent and slightly hooked his father nat was jewish his mother emma long deceased had been african american his short afro had by now gone mostly gray a thick scar bisected his lips top to bottom at an acute angle today as most days on the job he wore civilian clothesblack cop shoes dark blue khaki slacks with a thin black belt a light brown ironed shirt and black tie no one had ever called him a snappy dresser on a whiteboard hanging on the wall directly across from his chair he daily kept track of the twelve inspectors in the detailtheir assignments and active cases today that board was filled it had been a busy winter for homicides in san francisco glitsky was around his desk heading for the door out to the large room that held the inspectors desks when he stopped for a moment to glance at the whiteboard he knew it by heart of course but now it struck him anew each of glitskys six homicide teams and his one solo inspector were currently working at least two murders he needed more people but what with budget issues he knew he was lucky to not have had his staff cut by the morons sycophants and cretins who controlled these things his second wife treya had worked since shed met him to no avail to persuade glitsky to try to temper somewhat his default expression a flat deathless and menacing stare he wasnt interested the look had served him well at work even if it sometimes terrified small children even his own glitsky thought this was a reasonable tradebesides it didnt hurt children to have a bit of a healthy fear of their father glitskys large intelligent brow jutted over intense blue eyes when he was thinking or daydreaming or actively scowlingall regular occurrencesthe scar between his lips stood out in relief when people werent calling him a snappy dresser they often at the same time werent calling him a sweetheart by the time glitsky made it out to the fire scene through rush hour traffic dusk had just about settled into night this is not to say that it was dark in the immediate vicinity between the flashing red and blue policecar lights the lamps on the firemens helmets the streetlights and the kliegs from the several tv vans that had converged on the block the place was lit up like a movie shoot glitsky parked in the middle of baker street next to one of the fire trucks getting out of his cityissued car he caught a gust of bitter cold wind heavily laden with the smell of smoke he flashed his badge and signed into the scene with the cop who was controlling access to the area a man wearing a white fire helmet the incident commander stood talking with another man in civilian clothes on the sidewalk in front of a stoop that led up to a threestory victorian as glitsky walked over to check in with them his shoes squished in the stillwet street stopping to zip his heavy leather jacket up against the cold he noticed that several pairs of uniformed precinct cops were standing around by their squad cars aimless he was tempted to go over and personally motivate them to get back in their cars and on patrol where they were supposed to be working but indulging this fantasy he knew would only come back to bite himhardass homicide lieutenant lording it over the serfs taking his job too seriously but that he had the fantasy at all served as a wakeup call he was seething the feeling had snuck up on him fullblown it was a friday night and he should by now be home with his wife and children he didnt resent the overtime never had but he did when the idiocy of the bureaucrats and politicians gave him no choicewhen he didnt have enough staff or the budget to get the job done so he had to step in and do it himself and he knew that he could have simply assigned an already overworked homicide team to take this case but that wasnt leadership and it wasnt his style fifty feet on down the street somebody was giving an interview to one of the tv stations and that had attracted its own small crowd looking up at the obvious site of the blaze glitsky saw that the fire itself was out teams of firemen were rolling up hoses sweeping the gutters cleaning up moving forward glitsky crunched along over debris and broken glass closer now he recognized the incident commander in the white helmet as norm shaklee and the man with whom he was talking the citys chief arson inspector attached to the bureau of fire investigations arnie becker putting his anger in its secret place he arranged his face and said hello to the men both of whom knew him and greeted him cordially and then becker said so theyre sending out the big guns on homicides now glitsky kept it loose i sent myself i was the only one in the office he shrugged what are you going to do so what do we have pretty definitely arson started on the third floor luckily and even better luck the neighbor across the hall smelled it early and called it right in therell be water damage and the usual mess but the residents can probably move back in in a week or so we only got a total loss on the one apartment out of six what about our victim we dont know too much about her yet the apartment was rented by a woman named felicia nunez glitskys brow clouded briefly do i know that name becker shrugged id bet theres more than one of them its common enough anyway thats probably who she is but we dont know that absolutely and nobodys going to identify her from what we got up there thats for sure well probably have to wait for dentals beckers eyes which in his career had already seen it all went a little dull you should know that whoever set the apartment on fire set her on fire first it looked like she was probably naked or close to it when he poured whatever it was on her genitals and lit her up and it spread from there so rape probably id guess and id imagine he killed her first although thatll be the mes call that and how he did it nobody heard any screams or struggling and there were people right below and across from her in the building we may never really know about the rape id be surprised if they get dna from her shes burned up pretty bad glitsky swallowed against his revulsion and nobody saw an assailant nothing lieutenant nobody saw a thing ive got a crew working the neighborhood but weve already talked to everybody in the building and the guy was lucky or careful or both and seems to have just disappeared its a pisser tell me about it he turned to shaklee are my crime scene people here the incident commander nodded i sent em up faro and his gang but from what arnie here has been telling me theyre going to have their work cut out for them what else is new glitsky looked up at the black holes where the upper story windows had been flashlight beams crisscrossed one another in the darkness he drew a heavy breath you mind if i go up now the incident commander has absolute control over access to a fire scene which was why glitsky asked now shaklee nodded and turned to his partner if arnies got no objection no becker said in fact ill go with you abe and treya glitsky had planned on going out to an early movie that night but he hadnt gotten home from the arson murder scene until nearly nine so that got ruled out still they had rita their housekeeper staying late to babysit anyway so they decided theyd just go out and drive around until fate led them to a destination which in this case happened to be davids on geary not really so random if one knew glitskys love of jewish delicatessens like treya did now glitskys eyes were focused out across the counter far away from the liverwurst and onion on pumpernickel the waitress had just set down in front of him i know i know that name he said treya was just picking up her hot pastrami and swiss on rye and the half she held was far bigger than she could get into her mouth in one bite so she stopped midway maybe one of your old paramours none of my paramours were old in fact now that i think of it you are my oldest paramour ever and even youre not that old well thank you i think did i mean former instead of old and by chance misspoke imagine my chagrin imagine it glitsky said but she wasnt a former paramour shes just in my brainher name anywayrattling around felicia nunez shell show up her and christmas glitsky bit into his sandwich chewed with a distracted air sorry he said after hed swallowed i know the rule is no work on dates so youre sure shes work related the one you used to know as opposed to the homicide victim you saw tonight pretty sure well ive bent the notalkingaboutwork rule on occasion she said i can give you one i appreciate that but i dont know if i want to talk about work in general in fact im pretty sure i dont starting with the fact that ive got no inspectors free to handle this latest case so ive got to go down and do it myself on a friday night when weve got a date planned thats the kind of thing i start talking about it i could get myself worked up and im betting this wont be the last homicide we see before too many of the others get cleared so this is just an ongoing problem thats only going to get worse because of the incredibly misguided priorities of the idiots who get elected in this city and why dont they seem to learn good treya said you really dont want to talk about that i can tell i dont i know so well leave that part out so now how about felicia nunez the current one or the one i think i remember maybe shes both maybe you arrested her before no i dont think so i remember people ive arrested okay then maybe she was a victim glitsky his sandwich forgotten was shaking his head arnie becker says its a common name but i dont think thats it maybe another cop maybe somebody you interviewed for a job or how about this on a case maybe a witness suddenly glitskys head went still he brought his hand up to his mouth and covered it his startling blue eyes scanning the corners of the ceiling treya knew to leave him alone hed picked up the scent oh dear lord he half whispered through his fingers glitsky rarely used profanity and only then under the greatest duress and his calling upon the lord in this context underscored the degree of his concern what is it abe he lowered his hand with an exaggerated calm ro curtlee no this was a name she didnt want to hear since it was so thoroughly continuing to roil the waters at the das office whats she got to do with him she was a witness against him at his first trial and was going to be one of the central witnesses at the next one but now obviously she isnt going to play much of a role being dead and all treya finally said this is just going to cream wes ive got to call him maybe ro didnt have anything to do with this felicia nunez treya said glitsky already punching numbers into his cell phone rolled his eyes in the middle of a speech he was giving at the immigrant resource fair on valencia in the mission district wes farrell felt his cell phone buzz at his belt and silently cursed himself for bringing the damn thing with him at all he didnt need distractions from the work at hand and he didnt think of himself as one of the great natural orators of history in any event nevertheless this speech he thought was a pretty good one about something he truly cared aboutprotecting crime victims in san franciscos immigrant community what weve got to avoid he was saying is the appearance and even more important the reality that immigrant crime victims do not fall under the protection of law enforcement if youre the victim of a crime in san francisco the status of your immigration is not repeat not going to be a factor a visit by this citys police enforcement arm is not a visit from the us governments immigration agencies in the meeting hall of the centro del pueblo the crowd broke into applause farrell pumped up by the response hazarded a glance over at his girlfriend heartened to see that she was taking part in the ovation he and sam hadnt yet figured out how his new job was going to fly within their relationship and hed take any sign he could that it could still work out the past few weeksfrom the day of ro curtlees bail hearing forwardhad been chilly between them and maybe this applause marked the beginning of a thaw glancing down at his notes he picked up where hed left off we take very seriously our status as a city of sanctuary for immigrants and nowhere should that commitment to immigrant rights be more forcefully implemented than when immigrants are victims of crimes and it is the policy of my administration that the immigration status of crime victims will nevernever everbe questioned in the course of a criminal investigation that is simply not going to be on the table if youre the victim of a crime you must feel free to call the police and report the crime and rest secure knowing that nothing bad is going to happen to you because of your immigration status another wave of applause broke over the room but farrell really had no time to enjoy the brief flutter of popularity because he took the moment to sneak a look at his phone glitskys name there creased his face with a sudden concern if glitsky was calling his private number after nine oclock something was up and if it could have waited until morning then glitsky would have waited which meant it couldnt wait so accepting the congratulations of the multitude he thanked his way off the podium and walked out into the hall where he could hear himself think he touched the cell phone screen to connect him to the head of homicide without preamble glitsky said do you know where ro curtlee is how would i know that so you dont you dont have a secret tail on him anything like that no of course not whats happened felicia nunez got herself killed tonight maybe raped first then set on fire you know who felicia nunez is right yeah sure weve got to get this guy off the streets like yesterday oh okay lets do that sarcasm dripped into the connection you got an idea how that gets accomplished you got anything implicating him at the scene no everything was burned up ro never occurred to me until i placed the womans name im going to go rattle his cage dont do that abe really anything remotely smacking of harassmentand that wouldand were sued from here to denmark if you arrest him even if you get him back downtown just to talk hes back out in a day or two anyway thats two days he cant kill anybody else glitsky was just venting and farrell knew it but he still felt he had to make his point no listen its going to be hard enough to get his new trial on the docket even without muddying the waters with harassment and a false arrest farrell drew a breath so has the press got ahold of this yet the connection there were tv vans at the fire i dont know if anybodys put this nunez woman together with ro yet but thats only a matter of time and probably not too much of that ive got to go talk to him and then what you think he wont have an alibi you think hell invite you in to have a nice talk you think you can get a warrant to search his place i can tell you right now the answers no to all of the above wes the guys got to be back in jail i hear you but i dont know how to make that happen rescind his bail i cant do that you need to find some evidence on this new one at a fire scene the place is gutted maybe therell be his dna on the victim i thought of that too but not a chance you didnt see her theres no place to get swabs from i didnt even know for sure that she was a woman arnie becker says well be lucky to get a positive id from dental records farrell took a moment youre saying youre not even sure it was nunez it was her apartment wes she was the only one in it but if its not in fact her then theres no connection to ro give me a break wes you and i both know its her which means its ro its got to be ro i know i know im just thinking about containment its not a containment issue well at least part of it is anyway it could give us both some breathing room and meanwhile he kills his last remaining witness maybe not hopefully not who is she another former curtlee domestic servant smack in the middle of the profile gloria gonzalvez do we know where she is not yet but i intend to find out meanwhile speaking of that whats the problem with getting his new trial on the docket get him back behind bars that way im working on that abe believe me but his lawyeryou know denardineeds to get up to speed on the facts of the case he told baretto its going to take him six months at least and over my strenuous objections he thought that seemed reasonable and continued the goddamn thing until august and thats just to set a trial date lord glitsky said the mans a menace in his own right a beat so what happens next we cant just let this go on farrell scratched his jaw with his cell phone somebody around the fire might still have seen or heard something tell arnie becker what this might be about and he can go back and recanvass the neighborhood talk to your crime scene people locate some dna somewhere you get anything real abe bring ro in and ill take the flak and hold him but get ready and make sure its real cause there will be beaucoup flak the curtlee mansion and its grounds took up the last third of vallejo street on the uphill side in the last block before it abutted into the abundant greenery of the tamed forest that was the presidio glitsky sat in his cityissued taurus drivers side window down and stared across the street at the imposing structure set back about sixty feet from the curb but otherwise surprisingly open to the street the vast white block of stucco rose three stories up into the trees on the escarpment behind it the driveway and its landscaping blocked an unimpeded view of the ground floor but on the two upper floors lights shone in six of the sixteen windows from where he sat glitsky could only just make out some flickering light and occasional movement behind the enormous bay window through the welltended shrubbery on the houses right side he didnt know precisely why he was there he might have told himself that he was investigating a murder in which a resident of this house recently released from prison was already his prime suspect and this was true as far as it went but it was also true that everything wes had told him was probably correcthe had neither evidence nor a warrant to search for it ro would have an alibi and would probably refuse to talk to him in any event the curtlees were not only wealthy they were by now experienced in dealing with and frustrating the efforts of law enforcement they would have a lawyer down here the minute glitsky showed his face and he would wind up having nothing to show for all of his trouble but he didnt care he wanted themthe whole familyto know that he knew and to remind them that in spite of their money and power hed won last time and that he would win again and that this timewith the nunez murder rather than the retrial of ro for murdering dolores sandovalhe would get his special circumstances and maybe even succeed in putting roland curtlee on death row where he belonged it was juvenile undisciplined visceral and glitsky was acutely aware of even somewhat embarrassed by all that but basically at bottom he wanted to put this dangerous and irresponsible family on notice that the damage theyd done to his career had not broken him and that in fact he had resurrected himself to the relative eminence he had enjoyed before in spite of the curtlees best efforts to ruin him through slander libel and innuendo he was back at his job in homicide he opened his car door and as the inside light came on he checked his watch it was ten fifteen much later than a san francisco policeman was authorized to pay a call on a citizen who was not actively involved in a crime or its aftermath either as perpetrator or victim glitsky knew that by ringing their doorbell he was giving the curtlees ammunition to claim that he was harassing them but he had a ready response the circumstances surrounding felicia nunezs death along with the role she had been about to play in ros new trial necessitated a swift early police interrogation if for no other reason than to eliminate ro as a suspect he could argue that if anything he was doing them a favor in a cathedral of oldgrowth cypress he stepped out of his car and into the hushed and imposing street the servant who opened the door was new since the last time glitsky had been to the curtlees home ten years ago they hadnt had a formal butler but now it seemed that had changed this guy was impressive with the build of a wrestler he looked to be in his late forties with a full head of perfectly groomed saltandpepper hair in a dark gray business suit and black tie the man exuded a quiet and coldblooded competence his frankly aztec face betrayed neither curiosity nor concern at glitskys arrival his request to talk to the curtlees if they were home or the badge he proffered he spoke with an exaggerated politeness in an exceptionally deep unaccented voice do you have an appointment no as i said im with the police department yes i understand do you have a warrant no i hope to get a few words with one of the curtlees to apprise them of a situation that has come up can you give me the message id prefer to speak to one of them personally the man took a long moment deciding and the name again lieutenant glitsky san francisco homicide yes sir one moment please ill see if one of them is available gently but firmly he closed the door on glitskys face glitsky turned around and distracted himself by looking down the driveway to the street beyond there was no gate hed been able to walk unimpeded up to the front door for the first time this struck him as unusual and he wondered what if anything it said about this family about its arrogance and its culture true this block didnt get much foot traffic and what there was of it wasnt particularly threatening in the mold of say the tenderloin district but every other domicile on this block had its fence and its gate maybe the curtlees figured first that everyone would know who lived here and second that no one would dare disturb them because to do so would be to invite the familys wrath and retribution so a fence wasnt necessary neither was a gate the psychic barrier was enough when he heard footsteps approaching from back inside the mansion glitsky turned back and was facing the door when it opened on ro curtlee the young man had filled out some in the years hed been away but with the milky blue eyes and the weak jawline he still had a bit of the look of a sullen child his light blond hair had grown out in the weeks that hed been out on bail somewhere hed acquired a scar that began high on his forehead and disappeared into his hairline the white tank top he wore tucked into his slacks revealed all of his arms now with welldefined biceps hed clearly spent a lot of time working out in prison seeing glitsky he let out a scornful note of laughter shaking his head in mock disbelief ez said it was you out here disturbing our peace so late on a weekend night and i told him you knew better than that so i had to come see for myself and here you are in the flesh you got yourself a giant set of balls ill give you that showing your face around me again so what the fuck do you want this time i hoped to try to eliminate you as a suspect in a murder that happened today sure you did who got herself killed glitsky paused who said it was a female ros face went blank for an instant before a cracked smile flittered back oh ouch got me with a little zinger there right out of the gate nice work i better get my lawyer down here before i incriminate myself you got your tape recorder going nope ro clucked thats a shame you could have used that moment in court i still can okay you got me shakin now and especially if it turns out it was a woman got killed you want to guess i dont suppose i do especially if i got it right how would that look you know what im saying yeah youre way too smart for a silly trick like that ro but what im really here for maybe you can tell me where you were this afternoon and who if anyone you were with maybe i dont have to tell you dick thats right you dont but you could save us both some trouble if you did thats my goal sergeant save you some trouble its lieutenant now i got promoted no shit well congratulations on that one i thought i heard your career had kind of gone in the toilet after my trial arresting the wrong guy and all glitskys lips turned up a fraction of an inch actually not so much you getting convicted and all you know so so what today this afternoon where were you out taking a drive alone you bet enjoying my freedom whered you go up to napa across to sonoma back down here by dinnertime you stop anywhere i got a burger and a milkshake at taylors refresher in napa you know that place awesome food none of that fancy shit they serve everyplace else up there yeah glitsky said its a good spot what kind of milkshake chocolate well there you go you think anybody up there maybe working at taylors would recognize you i got no idea how about your car how about it what were you driving the zfour the beemer you know top down what color is it purple so its pretty visible people notice it yeah its bitchin wheels that what you wanted to know its a good start so who got killed glitsky looked at his watch it ought to be on the news right about now you can check it out yourself ro a female voice from upstairs the mother theresa whos there at this time of night ro curtlee hesitated about a second before he allowed himself another dismissive half smile and looked glitsky straight in the eye nobody he said and closed the door glitsky could haveperhaps should havegone back home but his blood was racing and he knew hed keep treya up if he stayed in the living room and simply paced or even sat so he drove back downtown parked in the city lot and ascended back to the selfcontained little universe that was his office switching on his lights he crossed over to his desk high on his lefthand wall five grimedover identical windows provided a tenuous connection to the real world outside although when the room lights werent on even in the daytime his office was almost too dark to read in under his framed personal photographs and departmental honorsglitsky had been san francisco policeman of the year in among other accomplishmentslow shelves filled with bricabrac memorabilia his patrolmans hat a football signed by his old teammates at san jose state and random case files half filled his righthand wall behind him a floortoceiling bookshelf sported an array of reading material eclectic for a policeman hundreds of paperbacks a complete collection of patrick obrians seagoing novels along with their obscure reference volumes a set of the encyclopedia britannica an abridged but still enormous oxford english dictionary the compendium of drug therapy a couple of dozen sports books the translated librettos of the barber of seville and tosca one of glitskys older sons by his first marriage jacob was a rising baritone in the opera world the california penal code and many other legal tomes but tonight glitsky saw none of it hed already considered and rejected the idea of going directly to the night magistrate on duty somewhere down in the lower floors of this building and asking for a search warrant based on ros obvious knowledge that todays murder victim was female though glitsky took some solace in the fact that if it ever came to trial he would indeed be allowed to testify to the exchange and ros slip of the tongue for the moment it was essentially nothing as far as evidence was concerned it did however perhaps irrationally remove all doubt in glitskys mind that ro had killed nunez glitsky pulled over a legal pad and scribbled some notes he had to find gloria gonzalvez the last remaining witness in ros trial before the rapistkiller could get to her he needed to assemble a couple of identification sixpacksmug shots of five other people and roto show around other notes how had ro found nunez had he made an appointment with her might he have conceivably phoned her had one of his lawyers had she lived in the same apartment the last time shed testified against him now putting aside his legal pad he checked his rolodex picked up the phone and punched up arnie beckers cell phone number the arson inspector picked up on the second ring in spite of the late hour giving no sign that he was anywhere near turning in he knew who was calling him and started right in abe you got something couple of somethings maybe including a suspect that was fast you still at the fire just getting started really your crime scene just left ill be here all night so has anybody put together who nunez was no other than shes dead she was also a witness in a murder trial and was going to be one again before too long for the same guy whos that ro curtlee the guy farrell let out on bail actually it was baretto but yeah him shit and he went and killed her thats my bet a long sigh then why do they let these fuckers out anyway thats a great question arnie something to do with justice and the right to appeal ask your congressman or somebody assholes yeah well the point is he might have been driving a purple bmw zfour convertible and parked it somewhere nearby when he went upstairs somebody might have seen it also im making up a sixpack you can show around the neighborhood tomorrow anybody saw him we at least take him down here and grill him maybe even get a warrant to take his house apart you get anything at all down there maybe becker paused i dont want to get your hopes up but there might be a small something go ahead get my hopes up glitsky said small is good again becker hesitated well it might not be conclusive and i dont know what it means if anything but there were two almost identical burnedup pieces of what looks like rubber or plasticill know by tomorrowdown by her feet glitskys heart did a little flip in his chest hed already had one heart attack several years before and though this didnt feel the same at all now he moved his hand over his chest and sucked in a quick breath she was wearing her shoes when he killed her he said it was not a question thats what it looks like maybe does that mean anything to you glitsky still was finding it difficult to draw a breath thats what ro curtlee did to his rape victims he made sure they kept their shoes on why god only knows arnie why anything sorry about the time wes but i wanted you to know first i say they verify the shoes we get a warrant farrell breathed into the mouthpiece on his end cant do it abe we dont even know it was nunez for christs sake and we may never know for sure whether or not its her if she never went to a dentist in this country which i hear is a reasonable likelihood and without at least that id weve truly got nothing a jury could even chew on did any of that shoe stuff get admitted in his last trial i dont know wes but you can find out easy enough meanwhile though i went and talked to these women before they got bought off his rape victims all of them they all said the same thing about the shoes its what he did i believe you but he didnt kill any of them the others did he he killed one he beat up three okay but the dead one sandoval she was outside found in the park am i right he kept going over glitskys silence so my point is he didnt burn anybody not ever thats new right its not his old mo so wheres the argument that this has to be him i know its him somebody in prison told him it was a good idea when you rape somebody and kill her then you burn up the place and the evidence with it which is why what you got from becker earlier were not even going to get proof that this nunez woman was sexually molested are we not likely no okay so weve got nothing putting ro in her apartment no witnesses so far all right so far but still then no proof of a sexual attack so weve got a woman who died in a fire we dont even know cause of death yet do we i mean was she strangled shot stabbed tell me we might not get that either wes shes burned up pretty bad thats what im saying abe she might or no the evidence might not prove a damn thing she might have been carrying a candle on her way to the bath and had a heart attack and fell down and it set her and then the place on fire that didnt happen i dont think so either for the record i think youre probably right but probably isnt close to what we need and you know it so what are we going to do i dont know abe hope he screws up you mean while hes killing his next victim no farrell said before that farrell thought that the furnishing of his office was coming along pretty well it was a large area that didnt remotely resemble the workspace of his predecessor and never would thats what happens when you replace extremely highend conservative furnishings for your basic goodwillgaragesale style farrell had long eschewed the tyranny of the desk in the middle of the room and preferred a foosball table with room to play cleared all around it up by the door and then again behind the foosball table were two seating areas both of them anchored by a sofa in front of a coffee table with armchairs facing the couch at the corners one area was leather and chrome the other fabric and wood his working desk was in fact a blond library table against the bryant street windows with a computer printer phone and fax machine covering its entire surface another table against the long wall featured a fiftytwoinch television set with folding chairs arranged in front of it these could of course also be moved to augment the seating around either of the couches the finishing touch on the shelf underneath his nerf ball basket and law books was a bar of sorts with a jura espresso machine cups and glasses utensils a wicker basket filled with sweeteners and half a wall of spirits of varying quality now at ten fortyfive on the saturday morning after felicia nunez had died farrell sat on one end of the leather sofa across from him amanda jenkins and abe glitsky filled the corner chairs so im at a loss farrell was saying on the one hand i agree with both of you i think its likely that ro killed the nunez woman on the other were stuck with probable cause i dont really see a way out of that and dont believe either of you want to go that route either id consider it glitsky said farrell shrugged that off and continued but the main thing is that i cant have either of you thinking you dont have my support because you do ill be happy to entertain any concrete suggestions from either of you which is why i called you both down here but i cant just pull the guy in off the street for no reason jenkins sitting back with her legs crossed said yeah you can he gets pulled over and appears to be drunk hes acting suspicious in a high narcotics neighborhood he spits on the sidewalk we haul him in any cop worth his or her salt can find ten reasons to arrest anybody they need to before breakfast isnt that right abe generally generally is good she nodded at glitsky and came back to farrell but specifically wes matt says hell go out and bring ro in on anything we decide on anytime you want anything anytime weve talked about it im glad for you but whos matt jenkins just barely did not roll her eyes matt lewis she said with exaggerated patience one of our da inspectors not to mention my longstanding boyfriend not that thats important farrell looked chagrined i guess the politician in me should have remembered that he said or known it in the first place but im just naturally hopeless at that stuff i cant help it matt lewis ill remember from now on then with a smile whats he look like clark kent jenkins deadpanned without the glasses but the point is hell bring ro in on any charge we want and there you go no there we dont go farrell was shaking his head back and forth guys so we hold him ten minutes and look stupid in the process besides which wed get crucified in the press but thats not the point either bottom line we dont do that its not happening end of discussion youre going to need no were going to need a real offense murder ought to do it glitsky said farrell sighed get me any evidence and its done abe i promise glitsky looked over at jenkins and she took the lead wes hear me out okay this is where youve got discretion you can make this call on your own farrell suddenly showed his fatigue bringing his hand up to his head and rubbing his eyes before he pressed his fingers to his temple in fact feeling more than a degree of responsibility for felicia nunezs murder he hadnt slept much after glitskys call the night before how do i do that amanda make that call he asked you have abe bring him in on the nunez murder thats not harassment thats a real charge that a hes guilty of and b a vast percentage of the public will buy yes maybe but no buts listen youre worried because in the normal course of events theres nowhere near enough to bring him to trial right try nothing well not exactly nothing but even so so what thats not the point its not then what is the point is that it doesnt matter if youve got enough to get him on nunez youre never going to have to get to nunez at least weve got him upstairs behind bars while his lawyers gear up for the retrial however long that is meanwhile ros off the street and nobody else gets killed farrell slumped sitting back and let his head rest on the cushion behind him he sighed again did i actually expend energy to get elected to this job he asked and can either of you tell me why if i did then abruptly he sat up its a lovely idea amanda but weve got this oldfashioned notion called probable cause without which mr curtlees out again in fortyeight hours and ps lieutenant glitsky here gets sued for false arrest i think weve got probable cause jenkins said farrell gave her the bad eye all right lets be wildly imaginative and say you do next up as you know is a preliminary hearing maybe youve heard of it a guy gets arrested charged by this office makes it over the probablecause hurdle then theres a hearing in ten days to look at the evidence if its not there he walks wes come on jenkins came forward in her chair how many pxspreliminary hearingshave you seen where they let the guy go zero am i right maybe one in a decade it never happens standard of proof is again only probable cause a strong suspicion farrell patiently held up a hand please spare me i know the law the law reads that probable cause is defined as a strong suspicion in the mind of a reasonable person that the offense was committed and that the defendant committed it so think about it jenkins continued weve got ros past conviction the connection to nunez the threat of nunez coming up at his retrial the shoes my point though is that any reasonable personwhich includes most of our judgesis going to strongly suspect ro did nunez and thats all we need its a simple call wes and its all yours its an unacceptable risk farrell said its a small risk jenkins countered insignificant less than crossing the street but if its beyond your comfort level youve still got the grand jury farrell knew that this was true and in fact had already contemplated it though it too of course had risk associated with it if he went and sold his weak case and got a grand jury indictment on ro in the nunez murder then he could avoid the possible pitfall of a preliminary hearing a grand jury indictment obviated the need for a preliminary hearing by itself it was authority enough to bind a defendant over to trial but if farrell went that way ros attorneys as was their right would demand the trial begin within sixty days and there would be no continuance farrell could ask the court to join the cases for trial but the way things were going with baretto that motion might well be denied under those circumstancesthat is if wes prosecuted ro for the nunez murder onlya san francisco jury would never convict him hed be freed again within two or three months making his retrial for the rape and murder of sandovalalready hugely problematiclogarithmically more difficult but the grand jury glitsky said youre still looking at ten days two weeks before they could even get to the indictment ro could do a lot of damage in that time which is why our votes for an arrest and indict before the prelim jenkins said short and sweet take him out when the meeting broke up glitsky went back upstairs to his office with a couple of ideas rattling around in his brain both of them having to do with arnie becker he wanted the identification of the murder victim to be rock solid and also to be accomplished as soon as possible if the dead person was not in fact felicia nunez then the theory that jenkins and he were betting on would not flythere had to be an immediate connection to ro curtlee and they had to establish it quickly possible dental records were okay but glitsky knew that he could wait a very long time for dental records to say nothing of the fact that finding the victims dentist so that they even had a chance at a comparison might be flatly impossible so theyd have to try to find another way to identify her but when he reached beckerthe man apparently didnt need to sleepthe arson inspector was at least a step ahead of him the identification of the victims of fires was one of the inspectors most critical tasks and over the years becker had picked up more than a few tricks its her all right he said nunez when she cooked her hands closed up into fists like they do you noticed that im sure sure glitsky lied so i had the morgue pry em open and as id hoped we got four justaboutperfect fingerprints two on each hand so i hadem run them in the ins database on a saturday morning i got a pal i called in records so anyway he loads in the prints and bingo up pops felicia nunez you ever want a job in homicide glitsky said just give me a call ill keep it in mind thanks but im happy where i am i can see that getting to sleep in on the weekends and all like you do sleeps overrated becker said you said there were two things the shoes or maybe the shoes what about em do we know that the rubber or plastic near her feet came from her shoes oh yeah when you told me last night they might be important i brought em home to my own lab and checked em out this morning theyre the soles from an adidas tennis shoe the honey low retails around fiftyfive bucks size seven by the way the top burned away completely the fire scene was on farrells way driving back home from work he passed by once without really seeing it although the yellow police tape must have stuck somewhere in his preoccupied brain because half a block beyond the apartment building the location registered he checked his rearview in a double take hung a uturn at the next intersection and drove back down parking across the street in a space cleared by the tape glitsky and jenkins had kept at him for nearly an hour until in the end he had run out of arguments which was not to say hed made any decision other than to go home for the afternoon and lie around the house in comfortable clothes before he had to go out this evening and give yet another speech somewhere about something important maybe even get in a little sack time with his girlfriendstranger things had happened now at a few minutes past noon the weather had turned foul with a gusty wind blowing around a gauzy drizzle that might as well have been rain farrell rolled his window down and looked at the shattered glass in what used to be the windows of the upper lefthand apartment try as he might he couldnt get the place to speak to him he didnt go to crime scenes he was a lifelong defense attorney and that was a job for the police and the prosecution and yet here he was a prosecutor and top law enforcement person in the city of san francisco the job was bunching at him from every direction like an illfitting suit although before hed actually run for da he had been notorious for his oftstated belief that all defendants were factually guilty of whatever crime theyd been charged with his professional life had always been about getting these people off or more commonly getting them a plea bargain they could accept in the working defense attorneys world the objective rarely was to get your client off mostly you tried to reduce a charge or a sentence or a bail because it happened so infrequently if at all no one gave much thought to the idea that a client might actually be innocent so the fact that ro curtlee probably killed this nunez woman didnt make the impression it might have on farrell hed worked with murderers before as clients he would probably draw the line at saying that they were nice people in general but hed formed a sort of attachment with several of them based on their common humanity they often had relatives they cared aboutmothers girlfriends children they sometimes felt bad about why theyd done what they did they were not all irredeemable souls so the tectonic plate of farrells naturalborn inclination and culture was slamming up against that of glitsky and jenkins talking with them this morning trying to be accommodating and receptive to their arguments he could not help but be aware of the everest looming between them to farrell the law was a set of inflexible impersonal and objective rules that society adopted to settle disputes there was little room for discretion what you usually did was what you always did morality didnt much play into it and the law was specifically not a tool that you used selectively to arrest some people but not others who did the same thing both glitsky and jenkins apparently had no trouble being creative within the rules to get ro curtlee back into a cell farrell believed that if it couldnt be done in the normal course of business then by definition it was wrong and yet glitsky and jenkins clearly thought that they had the law and more important morality on their side and this farrell knew to be a very slippery slope and very dis turbing while he was losing sleep last night over the degree of responsibility he bore for the release of ro curtlee and the subsequent death of felicia nunez hed finally come to terms with his conscience because he knew that he had respected the law and applied it fairly that was what hed been elected to do that was his job but what about this suggestion that he use one of the legal tools at his commandthe grand jury or a preliminary hearingto get ro back behind bars surely that would be worthwhile but would it be right the man had already been convicted of rape and murder and his successful appeal to the ninth circuit never even addressed the actual fact of his guilt for those crimes which was never really in doubt and if he had come from a poor family farrell knew that he never would have been able to make his million bail and he would still be in jail awaiting his retrial the crux was that farrell knew that glitsky had no physical evidence on curtlee for the nunez murder he had a great motive true and probably no good alibi but farrell didnt believe he could charge ro or go to a grand jury on those issues alone forget whether they could adequately prove probable causejenkins was correct that this was an often elastic criterion evidence or no her suggestion could work that would get ro back into the system true and it might keep him in jail until his retrial or close to it but it would be cynically playing the system and that was to farrells mind where the morality came into it farrell knew he was not a saint he was flawed in many ways ask his exwife and his grown and mostly farflung kids but he was not a hypocrite he had sworn to uphold the law as he believed it to be and thats what he was going to do come what may looking back up a last time at the empty shell of felicia nunezs apartment he unconsciously set his jaw and put the car back into gear ro curtlee turned north off lake and pulled his bmw into a parking spot at the curb of a short deadend street that like his own much more highend block ended at the presidio on both sides of this street nearidentical twostory duplexes sat tight up against one another a row of garage doors fronted the sidewalk and next to each garage door a walkway led first to a side door on the flat at the ground level and then to a flight of stairs that led to the upper unit ro got out of his car he was wearing jeans and hiking boots and a heavy green slicker of some kind that hed buttoned against the weather his head was bare checking the address numbers on the fronts of the duplexes he started up the block walking with a purposeful stride down at the end he found the address he wanted it was the upstairs unit in the building and he climbed twelve steps stood for a moment in front of the door then rang the doorbell a female voice called from inside just a minute ro waited the door opened and he was facing an attractive black woman who was almost his own size yes can i help you ro could not believe she simply opened the door and greeted him if shed looked through the peephole hed missed it and there was no chain to offer even token resistance if he decided he was going to get himself inside he thought that this was either supreme confidence or idiocy she was wearing a purple sweat suit and tennis shoes just beside her holding her hand a young girl of about five or six stood looking up at him with an appraising and confident air that ro thought she might have lifted wholesale from her fathers playbook ro gave the daughter a fast glance and a quick shallow smile and then brought his eyes back to the mother i was hoping to talk to lieutenant abe glitsky he said hes not home right now she said i expect him in the next couple of minutes for a tantalizing second ro got the impression that she was considering inviting him in to wait instead she backed up a halfstep and put her hand on the edge of the door as though preparing to slam it although nothing changed in her eyes which remained friendly inquisitive if youd like to come back maybe in a half hour or so youll probably catch him thats all right im sure ill run into him downtown and ill talk with him then i was just in the neighborhood and thought id drop by unannounced and hope to reach him at home the way he did with me last night last night right he gave her a smirk if you wouldnt mind telling him that ro curtlee stopped by id appreciate it this time the womans eyes narrowed and her face went slack instinctively she moved farther back away from him pushing her child partially behind her as she did so her hand tightened on the edge of the door what are you doing here it was all the reaction of fear and anger that hed hoped for really just telling your husband that i know where he lives you know like he did with me she pulled the door around in front of her youd better leave right now she said youve got no business coming here with an exaggerated expression of disappointment he said and just when we were all getting along so well he pointed down at the little girl thats a real pretty little daughter youve got there at this the door slammed on him and from behind it he heard im calling nineoneone you dont have to bother he said through the door ill be long gone he started back down the stairs toward the street and his waiting car glitsky was sitting in jenkins cluttered office on the third floor drinking a cup of tea and filling her in on beckers informationthe positive id on nunez the soles of the adidaswhen treyas call came in on his cell as he listened to the sound of her voicequivering beneath the controlled lowpitched and calm recital of eventshe realized how close to panic she was how proximate the danger had been without realizing it he stood up and paced from the door and back to the desk while the scar between his lips grew more pronounced an angry white line he lowered a haunch onto jenkins desk and with his free hand pulled at the skin of his face abe treya asked into the extended silence im here is he gone yes youre sure i saw him drive away and youve got both the kids with you right were all okay a little shaky thats all glitsky let out a breath another one abe she asked again still here thinking you want to come home that would be good rachel wants to say hi to you before he could object he heard his daughters voice hi daddy mommys upset is everything okay everythings fine but that man who came to the house hes not a good man you should arrest him i know i think thats whats going to happen are you okay now just worried for mommy he really scared her are you coming home soon real soon can i talk to your mom again okay and then treya hey trey im sending a squad car by no i dont think we need well negotiate about that when i get there but meanwhile im sending some men if for nothing else to take a report ill be right behind them but when they knock check the peephole and make sure its really them first okay and keep the dead bolt on until then i never thought with ro its okay glitsky said you got away with it once now we know we check the peephole huh all right well be waiting for you ill be home in half an hour you just keep everybody close till then dont worry i wont i love you i love you too get home soon i will when he closed the phone he looked over at jenkins you heard that ro came by your house yes he did his shoulders sagged with the weight of this latest burden he made a point of saying that rachel was a pretty little girl glitskys eyes went to the corners of the room then back down to jenkins he let out a breath and shook his head what are you thinking she asked about what youd expect blow his head off i wouldnt blame you but youd probably get caught and go to jail somebodys got to stop him theres another way it couldnt be better than popping him no better for you though arrest him wes didnt seem too hot on that idea yeah but we didnt have anything to charge him with then and now we do what threatening an executive officer thats you or any member of your family penal code sixtynine or four twentytwo take your pick both felonies is that true glitsky should have been used to attorneys knowing sections of the penal code by heart but every time he ran up against it it impressed him jenkins unoffended spun in her chair closed her eyes and said sixtynine every person who attempts by means of any threat or violence to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer blah blah blah and heres four twentytwo any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person with the specific intent that the statement blah blah is to be taken as a threat and this is the good part even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out which on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal unconditional immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate familys safety et cetera youve got a good memory glitsky said jenkins shrugged comes with the territory you cant remember stuff dont go to law school anyway i think we go for four twentytwo what about wes wes said if we got something real hed charge it and thats what our boy just gave us ill be your witness to the fact that right now you are in a state of sustained fear for your safety and your familys is that about true true enough there you go so its textbook and its a felony plenty to get him back inside glitsky shifted himself off the desk then what am i sitting around here for youre sitting around waiting for me to clear this with wes hes going to want you to get a warrant and in fact hell want somebody else to take this hell think youre too close i could call matt and im sure he and a couple of his buddies would jump all over the opportunity now youre supposed to ask me who matt is glitsky stood by the door i think i vaguely remember but im afraid that this has got to be a police matter amanda this is a serious guy who threatened my family hes going into custody as soon as i can get him there but glitsky couldnt do anything about ro until he knew where his suspect was and more specifically that he was not still skulking around his own home treya had watched ro apparently walk away but that didnt mean he wasnt still parked nearby perhaps waiting for glitsky to show himself on his street an easy target for ambush so he called the precinct house downstairs at the hall and requested a team of patrolmen be sent to his home asap where they would remain with treya and the kids until glitskys arrival on the way there the team was to keep a lookout for a purple bmw z parked in the neighborhood and report immediately to glitsky if they saw one glitsky had a patrol woman place a call to the curtlee home she identified herself as a clerk concerned with his bail bond and said that she needed to speak to ro about his status at his earliest convenience when ro picked up with a what the fuck is this about now the patrol woman told him she just needed to confirm his resident address and having accomplished the calls primary objective which was to determine if ro was back home she hung up glitsky still in a high and glowing rage left her office at the word and out in the hallway broke into a jog there are three ways that law enforcement officers can make a valid arrest in california and glitsky had had a great deal of experience with all of them in the first instance the grand jury issues an indictment the court issues a warrant and a couple of officers are assigned to arrest the suspect and deliver him or her to the jail in the second case investigators conclude that they have enough evidence to satisfy the probablecause requirement and they bring this evidence to a magistrate one of the rotating superior court judges who then signs off on an arrest warrant after which again a couple of officers go out to effect the arrest the third type the socalled nowarrant arrest is both the most common and the most challenged because it almost always includes an element of subjectivityan officer or team of officers makes a unilateral decision that the suspect must be taken into custody immediately for any number of reasons usually because he was caught in the act but perhaps to stop him from committing another crime or to keep him from fleeing the jurisdiction glitsky didnt know offhand who was the presiding magistrate on this saturday afternoon but he did know two other things for sure that the magistrate might be sam baretto who would be very unlikely to sign off on a warrant and that ro curtlee needed to be in jail right now these were two possibly irreconcilable scenarios and the second one in glitskys mind was nonnego tiable so by the time he was on the elevator heading down to the lobby abe had made up his mind because of the overt threat to his own family he believed he had plenty to justify a nowarrant arrest wes farrell had already promised him that if he had anything substantive to bring ro in on the das office would back him up besides in police workas in so many other endeavorsit was always better to ask for forgiveness later than for permission before his duty was clear and glitsky was going to do it on reflection glitsky knew jenkins was right that it would be hard for him to make the arrest himself he was just too close to the case he also knew he couldnt go into any suspects house without an arrest warrant even for a felony but what he could do was put a bunch of officers in surveillance around the house who would nail ro curtlee the first time he set foot outside it only took him a couple of minutes to explain the situation and to pick up two pairs of uniformed patrolmen and another squad car from southern station the precinct that worked out of the ground floor of the hall of justice they would take the initial shifts around the curtlee home until glitsky could call in some of the detectives from night investigations to take over the surveillance now the five policemen had pulled up and parked at the curb down the street from the curtlee home glitsky in his cityissue and his troops behind him in their blackandwhite patrol cars with the wire mesh between the front and back seats they got out of their cars and gathered near glitskys back bumper the light drizzle continued and in the late afternoon limited visibility to about fifty yards the weather didnt seem to bother or even much register with any of the men glitsky liked the trim of these youngsterssolid guys all probably under twentyfive pumped up and eager to be working with the head of homicide they all looked like they worked out with some regularity the biggest white kidhis name tag read dalystood with his arms folded across his chest his partner monroe lean and dark black kept his hands in his jacket pockets and shifted his weight from foot to foot loose and easy the two others might have been their cousins all the men wore their beltsguns batons and handcuffs glitsky in plainclothes had no patrolmans belt just his service weapon in a shoulder holster underneath a dark brown goretex jacket what if he doesnt come out daly asked glitskys mouth turned up a fraction of an inch anticipating a smile that never quite materialized we wait till he does the mans going to jail the patrolmen exchanged a glance galvanized by the thought of real action oh glitsky added and there may be a butler large gentleman who has a carry permit and might want to make this an issue he interferes in any way we restrain him and bring him downtown as well clear no chances with either of these guys yes sir the four men said in unison all right lets go glitsky sent one of the squad cars beyond the house to the end of the block so that if ro came out whether he turned left or right there would be someone to cut him off in their enthusiasm the officers in this car turned on their overhead flashing lights to drive the fifty yards down the street glitsky flinched at least he thought they didnt turn on their sirens but it turned out that the red strobes were enough glitsky turned and had only taken two steps back toward his car when ro curtlee emerged from the house his drink in his hand striding purposefully down the walk looking up the street toward the patrol car with its lights flashing today he was wearing a gray hoodie with the top down new jeans new tennis shoes i dont believe this shit he yelled into the night still focused on the patrol car up the street he never even noticed glitsky until he and the other two patrolmen were almost upon him youd better believe it glitsky said ro curtlee im placing you under arrest for threatening a police officers family you have the right to remain shaking his head seemingly enjoying himself ro flipped glitsky the bird and turned to head back toward his front door daly on glitskys left blocked the line of escape leaving ro surrounded by police but ro hadnt spent eight years in prison for nothing his face actually broke a smile hey easy he said he held his hands up as though he posed no threat giving up taking a step forward he slashed out his right hand in a vicious karate chop that daly only partially blocked before it hit him in the throat staggered daly slumped enough for ro to block him into a tree by the drive still coming forward in the same movement ro got ahold of dalys belt and brought his knee up into dalys groin when the officer bent over ro reached around him and got his hand on the butt of dalys gun holding on to and pulling it out of the holster as he pushed him away then butted him with enough force to send him back out into glitsky ro came around with the gun but monroe was ready for the attack and came around with his nightstick hitting ro a solid crack on the elbow amazingly the blow had no apparent effect ro swung at monroes face with dalys gun a blow that monroe blocked with his own nightstick then came down with a counterstrike on ros arm following it with a fullon body slam ro brought the gun up in monroes general direction and pulled the trigger but daly hadnt chambered a round and nothing happened but a click this gave monroe just time to jab ro in the gut and to take a swing at his gun hand connecting and sending the semiautomatic skittering over the flagstones monroe then backed away just enough to get room for another swing but glitsky came up and blocked him grabbing his suspect by his sweatshirt throwing him to the ground ro went sprawling facedown onto the wet flagstones then used his momentum to flip himself over get upright and kick out at monroes legs with a guttural grunt the second cop let out a cry and went down but by now glitsky had dalys nightstick and he swung it once in a roundhouse backhand that ro tried to block with his forearm a crack as hard wood met bone and ro let out a yell of agony and almost simultaneously daly slammed into him with a football tackle taking him down holding on as ro continued to kick at him monroe scrambled over a few feet brought up his nightstick and hit ro in the head the shoulders and then in the head again daly yelling i got him i got him he tried to wrestle ros arms behind his back while reaching for his handcuffs the suspect kept up the struggle under him but by now monroe had come over and pinned his upper body while glitsky got down by his feet and held him there in a few more seconds it was over the two patrolmen jerked ro to his feet he was bleeding from his scalp and his mouth spewing invective all over glitsky whod by now drawn his gun you broke my arm you cocksucker you broke my fucking arm and your nose too daly said hitting him in the face as hard as he could im going to sue your asses ro screamed ill have your badges tell somebody who gives a shit monroe said jerking ro around daly now on ros other arm pulling him off into the street ro keeping up his abuse all the way following them glitsky took one last look back at the houses open door then sucking for a breath he fell in behind his two limping officers and his prisoner the whole thing had taken less than a minute the other two officers joined them and they manhandled ro into the patrol car and slammed the door behind him by eight thirty pm the drizzle had turned into a steady cold rain wes farrell was not the only new elected official in san francisco that year the twoterm previous mayor kathy west had moved out and by some accounts up to the state assembly in sacramento her successor as mayor was a fortyfiveyearold former public defender and supervisor named leland m crawford these two electoral changes also coincided with a changing of the guard in the police departmentchief frank batistes retirement had become official on the day before farrell and crawford had been sworn in and in his place hired after a nationwide search that ignored many candidates from the citys own pool of veteran police officers was vi lapeer a fortyeightyearold african american woman and the former assistant chief of police of philadelphia pennsylvania after hed received his call from the curtlees before ro had even made it down to san francisco general hospitalwhere theyd treated his injuries and where he was currently under guardmayor crawford had ordered an emergency confab in his ornate city hall office now crawford was going to get his first chance to assert his dominance and capacity for leadership he stood about six foot four his thick black hair was going gray at the temples he might have been handsome but for an overly toothy smile and a continual battle with facial rosacea unlike farrell crawfords general tendency was to use his enormous antique desk to separate himself from his visitors but tonight that was not his intention instead in shirtsleeves he sat on the front of that desk in front of a semicircle of folding chairs on which left to right sat farrell lapeer glitsky and amanda jenkins crawford was not a procop politician like farrellone of their few similaritieshe was a lifelong member of the defense bar he believed that excess and denial of due process was part of police culture the rule rather than the exception now he had a prime example of it occurring only a few weeks into his administration and from the curtlees reaction it looked as though he was going to be blamed for it at least to a certainly notinsignificant percentage of the electorate he wasnt inclined to sit idly by and let that happen so hed called this meeting youre telling me lieutenant he was saying to glitsky that even knowing what we know now youd pursue the same course of action in a heartbeat glitsky said the man threatened my family id do it again tomorrow if it came to it crawford spoke up heatedly youd do it again tomorrow without a warrant after the district attorney told you not to with no notice to your chief or my office are you completely insane lieutenant or merely totally out of control excuse me sir vi lapeer said but if ro curtlee hadnt come out drunk and attacked the officers none of this would have happened all the lieutenant was trying to do was to neutralize the threat while we went through the usual process thats not what i understand crawford was prepared for this and answered in clipped tones from what the curtlees explained to me ro didnt go over to the glitskys home to threaten anybody jenkins barked out a laugh right crawford fixed his gaze on her it is right ms jenkins maybe you dont know that lieutenant glitsky had gone over to ros house the night before apparently just to harass the man and ro just wanted the lieutenant to know how that felt lapeer squirmed in her chair even if she did not think that her lieutenant had acted correctly she would have felt compelled to stand behind him at least until she got him alone the fact that she actually agreed with the way hed proceeded underscored her words with a lowkey vehemence with all respect lieutenant glitsky went over there last night to question the suspect about his whereabouts when one of the witnesses in his upcoming murder trial was killed that was official police business crawford was shaking his head thats not how the curtlees see it the lieutenant didnt record the conversation barely asked any specific questions and in fact weve all just heard from lieutenant glitsky that the curtlee boy didnt make any overt threat at his home in so many words at all glitsky fuming not trusting himself to speak looked to his left and jenkins got his message and spoke up sir she said a convicted murderer coming to a policemans house and commenting on his children is de facto an overt threat what would you have had him do well thats a good question ms jenkins and heres a good answer id have had him step back and let more objective people handle the situation at the very least id have had him notify his superiors and apply for a warrant id have had him follow the goddamn rules and how about while hes following the goddamn rules his family gets goddamn dead sir jenkins asked then what thats melodramatic horseshit crawford showed off a lot of his teeth and frankly im just a little bit annoyed that were all having a discussion about this convenient threat when its entirely clear to meand dont kid yourselves it will be clear to most of the rest of the city tomorrowthat this is just an end run around the real issue here which is that you ms jenkins and here he pointed at her and you lieutenant another point at glitsky decided unilaterally between yourselves to subvert the courts decision to release ro on bail after he got released on appeal jenkins raised her chin with all respect thats just purely untrue your honor crawford drew himself up straight it is hardly that ms jenkins what it is in my opinion is prosecutorial and police excess in its most blatant form its a classic denial of due process and harassment and im not going to stand for it not in my city do you know how much the curtlees are threatening to sue the city for anybody want to take a guess it doesnt matter jenkins said they wont get whatever it is would you like to bet your job on that ms jenkins because thats what i have to do here thats the position youve put me in now i have to bet we can beat a lawsuit for a hundred million dollars do any of you have any idea how much money that is after a moment of silence glitsky found his voice the mans a convicted killer your honor and he threatened my family he needs to be in jail well thats sure as hell where youve got him now lieutenant against the express decision of the court and given that how long do you honestly think youre going to be able to keep him there suddenly the mayor shifted his focus and settled on farrell wes youve been curiously silent throughout all this are you really planning to charge this thing farrell still in his raincoat seething for his own reasons was sitting back with his arms and feet crossed after a small hesitation he said i read ros visit to abes house as a threat i think the court will agree with us at the arraignment on monday abe did what he had to do if ro wasnt a curtlee crawford could no longer restrain himself but he is a curtlee goddamn it thats kind of the point here dont you see he looked around the semicircle face by unyielding face then started back and stopped at his new chief of police at the very least chief id expect that youd want to remove lieutenant glitsky from an active investigating role in this latest murder this nunez woman clearly hes far from objective on anything thats got to do with ro curtlee lapeer drew in a quick breath then released it she was thinking she might be the shortestlived chief of police in san francisco history but she really had no choice about what to say the lieutenant is head of the homicide detail sir i respect his decisions to assign investigators to cases including himself as he sees fit now stymied crawford turned back to farrell and if they let ro off on monday wes then what then the courts will have spoken farrell said and what about his injuries ros crawford asked glitsky jumped in with the answer he resisted arrest he said strenuously he also injured two of our patrolmen were charging him on that too wonderful crawford said just wonderful farrell glitsky and jenkins had all come to the meeting in their separate cars and parked in the underground lot just across from city hall finally the meeting and dressingdown had ended and having jogged across the street through the rain they got to the parking lots elevator all shivering wet dogs anxious to get to their cars and back home glitsky in the lead went to push the elevator button but farrell came up from behind put his hand out and blocked him hold on a minute abe amanda id like a word its a little late and a lot cold wes jenkins said she was wearing her trademark short skirt and she had her arms crossed into her armpits can it wait you know actuallyfarrell was atypically brusquei dont think it fucking can he squared around on them i got both of you here now and i want to tell you both how much i dont appreciate the spot you put me in back up there glitsky and jenkins shared a glance what you dont know what im talking about dont give me that we talked about this very thing just this morning im sure you both remember glitsky started in that was before ro came by yeah yeah yeah your house i get it but heres the thing i dont get abe what i dont get is even assuming that it was a bona fide threat to your family which im not sure i completely buy it sure as hell was jenkins said maybe but why make the visit a threat if he wanted to hurt you why didnt he just do whatever it was he wanted to do when he was there treya answers the door whammo nobody knows hes there he hits and hes gone but he doesnt why not anybody got an answer to that one in the small space farrell made a half turn in agitation then came back at them and if it was a threat okay then why didnt you go get a warrant tell a judge make it official im willing to bet you could have found one down at the hall even here on a saturday instead you go flying off with a couple of starstruck rookies and basically just go in and kick some ass which is exactly what you personally abe wanted to do i did not dont bullshit a bullshitter abe dont even try and meanwhile you give the fucking curtlees everything they could ever need to make their case that youre harassing their precious little prick of a son did i get any of that wrong he was glitsky began again but again farrell cut him off so i dont give a damn what ros doing why cant you seem to get that the mayor was absolutely right in there when he was talking about the way its going to get reported and not just in the fucking courier im going to predict that youre not going to get flattering coverage in the chron either come on wes jenkins said its not about the papers okay its not about the papers but ill tell you what it is about its about both of you putting me in a position where ive got to back up what youve done when we had already discussed it and decided you werent going to do exactly what you did wait a minute wes glitsky was finally getting a little hot you told me if i had something almost anything i could arrest him and youd support me and i just did that upstairs in the face of the mayor dont forget farrell raised a finger but heres what i dont understand and it really really really fucking fries my ass abe if you must knowfarrell in a true rage now his voice ratcheting upis why in gods name you had this great reason to go and righteously arrest ro and you didnt see fit maybe to run the idea by me and you know how that strikes my cynical mind it strikes me that you didnt think your reason was good enough you thought id say no and you know i might have and why cause it still wasnt enough not given all the political ramifications and all the other bullshit were now going to have to be dealing with for the next god knows however many months and you knew it you goddamn well knew it and you just said well fuck wes thats what happened and both of you were in on it which is why when the first i heard about it is when fucking cliff curtlee calls meoh yeah he called me before he called leland demanding your badge abe how bout thatand im stuck defending both of you when i think you did just about everything completely backward and wrong im just a little bit beyond pissed off farrell did a full pirouette and came back at them for a last round just for the record i feel bushwhacked and betrayed by both of you and i dont know what the fuck is going to happen on monday all i know is that if the court lets ro out were in deep shit and if it keeps him in jail were also in deep shit and either way ive made an enemy out of leland crawford and id like to thank both of you for that too youve both put in a hell of a days work finally out of steam farrell did a kind of double take reached over and went to push the button for the elevator then stopped himself thats all right fuck it ill walk down to my car and turning on his heel he opened the door to the stairway glitsky pushed open the door to his home at ten fortyfive pm he had last called treya from the hospital when hed gotten the call three hours earlier from the mayors office that he was expected immediately or sooner at city hall no excuses at that time he thought and told treya hed probably be home in about an hour but then had come farrells outburst in the elevator lobby and another half hour of discussion with amanda jenkins after that and now the original hour had turned to nearly three the house was dark hed walked nearly four blocks from the nearest place hed found to park now closing the door behind him he shrugged out of his soaking jacket and hung it on the hook on the wall he stood still a moment listening to the rain then moved up to the front of his house where the bay window through his plantation shutters overlooked the block the streetlights reflected off the shining streets what are you looking at his wifes voice startled him he had assumed that she was sleeping but there she sat on the living room couch just the rain he said he stayed at the window then the thought just occurring to him where are the men who were watching you i sent them home after you told me youd arrested ro their orders were to stay i told them they could go in fact i ordered them to go glitsky sighed did your cell phone break she asked he looked over at her dont bust my chops woman im just saying all right noted but dont please im sorry if i would have thought of it i would have but there was no opportunity she patted the couch next to her come sit down he came over and lowered himself as though his body ached onto the couch have you eaten she asked no but dont get up he took her hand youre all right were all fine it was just scary hes in jail now i know the curtlees want my badge i think the mayor does too well hell learn and then theres your boss beside him he felt her go a little tense wes what about him he wouldnt have arrested ro yet he didnt think it was a real threat he wasnt here no i know that but he thinks i should have called him first before i went to pick ro up and maybe i should have anyway apparently ive put him in a squeeze poor wes hes really unhappy furious even because you arrested ro it was a real threat abe no doubt about it i wasnt making anything up nobody thinks you were except maybe wes no he just didnt think he thinks i should have cleared it with him or a judge and i probably should have i probably should have assigned somebody else to set up this arrest i thought your whole team was overbooked it is but still you cant win no thats not true you can win a few he squeezed her hand i just dont want to get in the way of you and wes you wont he was really upset like ive never seen him its the job she said hes just getting into it and doesnt want to mess it up more than that glitsky said he doesnt want somebody else to mess it up for him and i might have just done that you did what you felt you had to do didnt you yes it wasnt illegal or wrong was it no it was legal and right in fact well there you go how could it hurt you i dont know glitsky shook his head and im not sure i want to find out on the following monday morning michael durbin was driving downtown having visions for reasons he did not fully comprehend every time durbin had gotten into his car and started driving latelysince hed become aware of ro curtlees release into the populationhed found himself vicariously experiencing the drive that tony soprano took at the beginning of every episode of the sopranos complete with the soundtrack about getting yourself a gun you got yourself a gun it was weird he thought but also incredibly realistic as though he actually was making that drive through new jersey smoking a cigar noting the passing neighborhoods of san francisco through the side windows and the windshield as he headed out from his parking garage on union up through pacific heights where the curtlees lived then over the hill into the semighetto of the western addition and finally out on geary to the avenues the vision became especially acute when he turned the last corner before getting to his home he felt himself inhabiting the guise of the mafia boss the determined look on his face opening his car door and getting out clearly with an eye to doing someone grave damage and once he was in that unbidden imdrivingnow mindset a host of fantasies seemed to come along for the ride killing ro curtlee of course was the first and originally strongest of them he could in fact go out and get himself a gun although theyd never had one in the house he could remedy that in a few days and he did have a shotgun packed back somewhere in his garage with either his new pistol or his shotgun he could then drive up to the curtlees after nighttime had fallen wait for ro to show his face and simply blow him away would anybody put it together that it had been him a straight white middleclass smallbusiness owner with no criminal record he didnt see how he could actually do it and end all of his worries on that score but the fantasy wasnt just confined to ro curtlee as often as not no sooner had he dispatched ro in his makebelieve scenario than the fantasy rotated on some axis and turned his attention to janice he found this disconcerting not only because in his conscious mind and stupid heart he loved his wife but because she had been his rock and support during those difficult years after ros trial she had held the family together earned the lions share of the homes income counseled and stood by michael as he worked through his transition from promising young portrait artist eking by with a succession of day jobs to established and successful small business owner she had essentially guided him through the shoals of egobound angstridden artistic immaturity to the terra firma of real honest work and grownup responsibility part of him rather suddenly hated her for that he didnt understand why the catalyst for these negative feelings had been ros release from prison but thats what had started it michael had always tried to make himself believeand hed sold himself on the idea pretty wellthat the suffering hed endured because of the stand hed made to the other jurors had been worth it because at least theyd removed the vermin that was ro curtlee from society and all at once that had changed now he clearly saw his idealistic righteousness back then as an empty meaningless gesture that had accomplished no permanent good so why had he given up on his art and how was that in any way the fault or influence of janice well there was a reason even back then janice could have been making enough money from her practice to keep them afloat if shed gone fulltime but shed wanted and theyd decided that they didnt want day care for their children they would split their time at home as parents this was why the loss of michaels day jobs because of the curtlees meddling had posed such an unnecessary financial hardship but the plain factand it had always been a giant elephant in their living roomwas that they could have made it michael could have gone on painting working his art taking the occasional portrait commission and gone the gallery route growing his body of work by nowhe was certain that he had been good enoughthe painting would have paid off it might not have made him rich and famous but he would at least have a name and a reputation and he would be doing what he loved what he had always felt hed been born to do but janicesubtly to be sure but subtle was her metiersaw her opening and never let up on the pressure for michael to keep bringing in at least a token income whatever it took to prove himself a competent provider a good husband so for six or so years the prime of his life hed hauled and delivered loads as a parttime moving man hed painted houses hed worked as a bartender a landscaper a blowandgo gardener the art his painting had had to slide until it no longer had been even a hobby and janice had been his helpmeet during the transition weaning him away from a commitment to his art until it finally seemed like his own idea to get her father to invest in his ups franchise and because michael was smart organized and diligent that business had succeeded and now thrived and janice had loved him because hed become the man shed always wanted him to bedutiful hardworking mature and maybe honestly michael thought that would have been enough maybe he could continue to forgive her for that to realize that this was the tradeoff hed bargained for and eventually agreed tothe woman he loved and the family she wanted in exchange for his earlier vision of himself as a creative person an artist and in her estimationimplied but never statedsome species of flake he supposed maybe even believed that it would have all been worth it worth sacrificing his art and his essential self to keep janice happy just like it would have been worth all his suffering at the hands of the curtlees if ro had stayed in prison it would have been worth it if janice had stayed faithful to him now it didnt seem as if it was becausehe was surejanice was having an affair with one of her patients with the echoing refrain about getting himself a gun playing nonstop in his brain michael durbin pulled into the lot across the street from the hall of justice a dayno in amp out court wouldnt go into session for over an hour but in spite of the early time the parking lot was nearly full the curb alongside bryant street packed two deep with police patrol cars and other official vehicles and a caravan of local and national tv vans durbin got out of his car paid the attendant and buttoned his raincoat against the continuing mist across the street the gray stucco of the hall of justice showed as a deep bruised blue in the damp he stopped at the edge of a decent and so far peaceful crowd of perhaps a hundred souls on the steps out front many of them holding signs exhorting whoever it might be to free ro and let ro go and stop police brutality and so on somewhat more prosaically one sign read sf cops suck the big one free speech durbin thought aint it grand part of the crowd seemed happy to demonstrate outside but others were moving toward the entrance to the building albeit slowly reporters and anchorpeople with microphones were descending upon unwitting citizens all over the place with a shock that felt like a blow to his solar plexus durbin recognized the woman hed long ago nicknamed heinous marrenas on the crowds periphery and it suddenly occurred to him that these protesters had probably been bought and paid for by the curtlees everywhere he looked people were holding copies of the morning courier where ros arrest and demands for glitskys resignation dominated the front page durbin wanted no part of marrenas or any of them so he got into the portion of the crowd that slowly was snaking its way into the building five minutes later he had passed through the doors and then the metal detectors inside now he stood in the cavernous lobby his stomach churning with nerves and relief at having dodged marrenas part of himself was still wondering why hed felt the need to take the morning off and come down to see this spectacle for himself suddenly he turned and found himself looking at his brotherinlaw chuck novio had just turned his head and saw him at the same time and he raised a hand in greeting getting over to him durbin said okay chuckie boy ive got an excuse for my peace of mind i need to make sure they get ro back in jail where he belongs but what are you doing here novio wore his easy smile hello american history this is what i do and if this isnt history i dont know what is besides this is the kind of stuff my kids eat up makes em believe that historys happening all around them all the time which of course it is this isnt history chuck this is a scumbag novio said are you kidding history is just one scumbag after another muddling along in an endless chain thats why its so great i admire your enthusiasm durbin said but you should have told me yesterday at dinner you were coming down for this we could have driven together i didnt really decide until i got up this morning and figured i really should and i didnt know you were coming anyway i didnt say so last night maybe i hadnt made up my mind by then either durbin paused so how do you think its going to go he asked i think he stays in jail im hoping how can he not durbin cocked his head toward the rabble check out the crowd you ever hear of the curtlees novio shrugged the guys a convicted murderer who beat up a couple of cops while resisting arrest put any spin on it you want no judge in the world lets him back out lets hope youre right im right want to put some money on it no i want you to be right but if we bet and im wrong then you win anyway ill give you two to one durbin weary stuck out his hand twenty he said novio reached for his hand and they shook done department had hard theaterstyle seating for about eighty people and durbin and novio early as they were stood in a long line and as it was barely made it inside they took the only two seats left in the nexttolast row the story of ro curtlees arrest had not just been frontpage news in the courier yesterday in the sunday edition of the paper but it had also made headlines in the chronicle and been the lead feature on every television network news program throughout the day one of these broadcasts had been the last thing durbin had seen before going to bed last night alonejanice called out after theyd all gotten back from sunday night dinner at the novios to an emergency session with one of her patients durbin had a good guess which one it was although not his exact identity so hed watched the news and heard sound bites from the haggard unkempt district attorney wes farrell the outraged mayor leland crawford opining that perhaps it was time for a special commission to address the culture of violence and disregard of due process within the police department andof coursecliff and theresa curtlee bemoaning the injustice of it all and calling for the arrest of lieutenant glitsky rather than of their poor boy both curtlee parents were in the front row in the courtroom and seeing them so close durbins bile rose again those smug fuckers he whispered to novio i wonder if they actually believe ro didnt do any of this or if they just dont care i mean how do you go on supporting your son if you know hes a killer a literal killer novio enjoying the buzz in the room straining for a glimpse of them said maybe the person he killed shes so far down the evolutionary or economic scale you dont think she counts as a human being either that or he had a good reason good enough anyway durbin shook his head good enough right now several of the players had begun to appear in the courtroom through the back doorway that led to some holding cells and the judges chambers two bailiffs led the way followed by an elderly woman who took the court reporters seat in front of the judges bench and another younger woman the court clerk who sat at a table next to the court reporter when he saw the next people come through the doora man and a woman both in full police uniformdurbin leaned over to novio thats glitsky the guy with the hawk nose and the scar and vi lapeer the new police chief next came farrell his eyes still bloodshot but wearing a wellfitted and expensivelooking dark suit with a white shirt and red power tie just behind him was another woman whom durbin recognized whats she doing here he asked chuck who the one with the legs amanda jenkins how do you know her she was the prosecutor in ros trial i didnt know she was involved in this im starting to think everybody but the dogcatchers involved in this by now glitsky and lapeer had passed through the low railing that separated the gallery area from the courtrooms bull pen they took seats in the reserved section of the first row next to a pair of young uniformed police officersone white and one blackwhile farrell and jenkins got themselves settled at the prosecutors table just in front of them even from his relatively distant seat durbin fancied he could almost feel the chill between the two prosecutors at the defense table a welldressed elderly whitemaned man sat at some perhaps prearranged signal from one of the bailiffs the man got up and turning said something to the curtlees where they sat in the front row finally nodding he walked through the courtroom to the back door by the judges podium and on out showtime novio said durbin swallowed against a rising nervousness getting close behind them an energy shift rumbled through the gallery and durbin turned in time to see the mayor himself leland crawford come through the back door chatting in a serious vein with sheila marrenas he went up and after getting the attention of everyone in the courtroom sat in an empty obviously previously reserved seat next to cliff curtlee at this move amanda jenkins whispered something to farrell and the district attorney apparently startled half turned in his chair to see for himself the message couldnt have been clearer with absolutely no fanfare the curtlees lawyer reentered through the back door with his client the last time durbin had seen ro curtlee on the day of the original verdict against him nearly ten years before hed been a cleanshaven goodlooking young man with shortcropped hair wearing a threepiece business suit and tie now shackled hand and foot in his orange prisoners jumpsuit jail slippers and with a large cast on his slinged left arm ro was the picture of middleaged dejection and defeat his uncombed overtheears hair and general unshaven disheveled appearance added to the impression as did a stillswollen mouth a bandage over the bridge of his nose and a black eye as he shuffled through the courtroom with his lawyer on his way to the defense table the gallery first and briefly went silent and then broke into a low roar of indignant reaction novio smiling next to his brotherinlaw leaned over and his hand covering his mouth whispered good move going for the sympathy vote durbin started to pick up some antipolice slursnazis thugs bastardsfrom the other side of the gallery but before they got out of hand ro got himself seated next to his lawyer at the defense table and the bailiff came into the courtroom by the judges podium and bellowed all rise department eleven of the superior court of the state of california is now in session judge erin donahoe presiding at first glance donahoes diminutive size seemed of a piece with a lowkey even shy personality when she was thoughtful or amused her features were not unattractivea bobbed little nose light blue eyes fashionable rimless eyeglasses and shoulderlength light hair shining enough for a shampoo commercial when challenged or confronted by turbulent forces however the look changed quickly and dramaticallythe eyes squinted down the laugh lines around them vanishing into exaggerated crows feet the small mouth pursed into a disapproving button a flush tending to rise into her cheeks now as she ascended the podium it was clear that something had already compromised her composure she wore an air of defensiveness around her as obvious as her formless black robes as the gallery sat with her she cast a dark eye on ro curtleedurbin couldnt tell if it was in reaction to his injuries and general appearance or because she knew he was a rapist and killer but the look didnt soften as she brought her gaze to the prosecution table and then up to the gallery which hung quietlynow even more quietlyin anticipation let me state for the record she began in a low voice that barely carried to the bar rail much less the back of the courtroom that ive got eightyfive lines and thirteen preliminary hearings to get through today and i mean to get through them all cases in superior court are called lineseach defendant taking up one line on the computer printout prepared for the calendar courtroom at the request of mr farrell im going to call line twelve first i expect to get this circus out of my courtroom so i can get down to business would counsel announce their appearances please after theyd done so donahoe announced that she wanted to make it clear that this was an arraignment and bail hearing not a preliminary hearing were not spending all morning on this mr farrell understood yes your honor mr denardi clear your honor all right would the clerk call the line please from her desk the clerk didnt even look up line twelve the people of the state of california versus roland curtlee mr denardi does your client waive instruction and arraignment denardi on his feet yes your honor plea prompted by his lawyer ro curtlee stood up and said not guilty donahoe stayed with the logistics before discussing a time waiver counsel i take it you want to argue bail all sense of decorum and procedure immediately dissolved denardi still on his feet came out swinging if it please the court in the course of a bogus nowarrant arrest by lieutenant glitsky and two other officers my client was severely beaten on saturday night some of the results of which you can see here today your honor amanda jenkins jumped up at her table i object to counsels description of a bogus arrest defendant had gone to lieutenant glitskys home and threatened him and his family which under penal code section four twentytwo your honor if i may denardi didnt wait for permission to speak and donahoe made no attempt to stop him counsels characterization of mr curtlees personal visit to lieutenant glitskys home as a threat that rises to the level of four twentytwo is absurd and completely unsupported by any facts or evidence counsel are usually expected to direct all their remarks to the judge but they were already long past that and donahoe didnt seem inclined or even able to stop them jenkins turned and spoke directly to denardi youre denying he went to glitskys home the elderly defense attorney shook his head as though something amused him no he went to the lieutenants home all right but more or less to lodge a personal protest about the fact that the lieutenant had come to mr curtlees home just the previous night and for just as little reason just as little reason you cant be serious lieutenant glitsky was investigating the murder of a witness in mr curtlees previous case thats a compelling reason if you believe thats really what it was and not pure harassment well gosh maybe i wont just accept your boughtandpaidfor opinion counselor but thats what the evidence shows jenkins swung back to the judge your honor these allegations of harassment and police brutality are ridiculous on their face the witnesses in mr curtlees previous case are being murdered one by one any sane person has to know that mr curtlee is in this up to his neck ridiculous denardi exploded giving full voice to his rage just look at the man whats ridiculous has been his treatment at the hands of the police hes been battered half to death you call this suddenly donahoe seemed to realize that the giveandtake in the courtroom had gotten completely out of her control and she cleared her throat and lightly tapped her gavel ms jenkins mr denardi lets not get into a personal squabble here all right im sure well get to the bottom of this and resolve it to everyones satisfaction would you both mind sitting down please thank you now moving along mr farrell do the people have information for bail purposes after the near brawl that had been developing the silence that suddenly reigned in the courtroom was unsettling it took farrell a few seconds to get to his feet your honor he began the defendant is currently awaiting trial for murder and has been out on bail since his release from state prison within days of his release one of the witnesses in his murder trial has been killed after lieutenant glitsky went to question him about his whereabouts at the time of that murder the next day mr curtlee went to the lieutenants home and threatened him and his family denardi wasnt going to let this pass and again rose to his feet your honor weve heard this before and its simply not true farrell again ignoring protocol because donahoe didnt seem to care about it turned to his opponent its absolutely true tristan and you know it i know nothing of the sort wes you tell me one word of actual threat that mr curtlee said or even that glitsky alleges he said he pointed at glitskys daughter and made a point of saying she was a nicelooking child raising his hands theatrically denardi let out a laugh and turned to the judge i rest my case your honor calling a child nicelooking is hardly a threat now farrell raised his own voice losing his temper going to the house by itself is a threat mr curtlees a convicted rapist and murderer out on bail hes a suspect in the murder of the chief witness and he went to the house of the police inspector assigned to the case youd have to be crazy not to see whats going on here again finally donahoe lowered her gavel gentlemen she said please then mr farrell i believe you were talking about bail what was the original bail by the way on the murder ten million dollars your honor when officers tried to arrest mr curtlee in this case he took a gun and tried to kill one of them attempted murder of a police officer is a nobail offense nodding sagely she asked who set the bail on the murder judge baretto and what are the people requesting this time around we want the scheduled bail your honor no bail in light of the current offenses and the defendants history ridiculous denardi said thats insane donahoe simply nodded acknowledging the interruption but tacitly condoning it and what are the charges exactly this time she asked farrell looked down at his notes impassive in the face of what he knew to be more problems he and glitsky and jenkins were at least on relatively firm ground charging ro with the one count of threatening an executive officer that glitsky had gone down to arrest him for but the fracas during the arrest had overshadowed that original charge and now farrell was stuck with glitskys and jenkins egregious overcharging but there was nothing for it he had to brazen it through one count of threatening an executive officer four twentytwo one count of attempted murder on a police officer six sixtyfourone eightyseven three counts assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon two fortyfived one both of these latter two with firearm enhancement three counts farrell went on battery on a police officer two fortythreeb all charges with a twelveohtwotwo point one enhancement since the defendant incurred these charges while he was out on bail your honor denardi again on his feet there was no attempted murder one of the officers duty weapons fell out of its holster and mr curtlee picked it up and pulled the trigger jenkins said i dont think so amanda and beyond that your honor the alleged assault was pure selfdefense the police arrived at his house without a warrant and then attacked mr curtlee when he went outside to find out what was going on with more police presence out in his street this was a bogus arrest as ive said before anyone would have resisted it would have been justified resisting it even with force this speech got a little rise out of the gallery and yet again donahoe made no effort to control it but rather let it run its course your honor farrell said over the slowly subsiding hum all three police officers involved in the arrest are in the courtroom and are willing to testify about but here finally donahoe seemed to disapprove her mouth went tight and the flush came up in her face were not turning this into a preliminary hearing mr farrell i believe i made that clear during my opening comments the question is about bail and to be honest im tempted to send it back over to judge baretto and see what he thinks we ought to do your honor jenkins stood up next to farrell and tried with only minimal success to keep her voice neutral with respect as mr farrell has already said the people seek no bail at all not even at the tenmilliondollar level that the defendant has been allowed back on the street at all is a mockery of the judicial process now now donahoe said i dont know if thats a little too strong its a mockery all right denardi said again rising and getting into the act but its these charges that are a mockery not only fabricated and vindictive theyre all right all right mr denardi thats enough i take your point now just give me a minute here would you all the judge looked down and ruffled through some pages in front of her picking up her pen she made a few notes while the courtroom hung in suspense finally she looked up and offered a confident smile first to the prosecution table then over to the defense mixed signals everywhere it was possible to send them i think judge barettos set a bit of a precedent here due to the questions about the legality of the arrest itself and so forth i believe a reasonable bail would be five hundred thousand dollars at these words the courtroom exploded into applause that got interrupted by jenkins who could no longer restrain herself your honor she exploded oh counsel donahoe said theres no jury here you dont have to make a speech to impress anybody you know as well as i do that defendants have rights well get to the bottom of all thisapparently one of donahoes pet phrasesthe charges and so on after the preliminary hearing and at that time im making a note to revisit the bail question in light of the facts that come out during that hearing another wave of what was clearly approbation made itself felt in the gallery and donahoe smiled acknowledging that shed made a crowdpleasing decision now mr denardi donahoe went on i assume that youd have no objection to waiving time she was asking the defense counsel if hed agree to postpone the preliminary hearing of his client beyond the ten days that the law provided and of course it was to ros great advantage that denardi did this and then hed waive time after the preliminary hearing so the trial wouldnt start within the sixty days the law provided either in fact this was the beginning of the defenses orchestrated delaying tactics that could postpone a trial for a year or more your honor again jenkins stood although by now she was running out of steam the people object to waiving time donahoe looked not unkindly down at her thank you counsel but of course counsel is entitled to time to prepare mr denardi defense will waive time your honor were going to need considerable time to do a background check on these arresting officers two months from today to set granted thank you youre welcome donahoe looked down for one last time at farrell and jenkins and gave them a slight shrug of her shoulders as if telling them she didnt have much of a choice in the matter of her rulings then moving along she nodded to her clerk call the next line she said everybody was standing up clearing room for the next case durbin watched ro curtlee break into a smile and rise at the defense table with his attorney turning around ro reached over the bar rail nodded at the mayor shook his fathers hand and put an arm around his mother drawing her in with a hug no sign of pain now durbin noted no hint of hangdog what a travesty he whispered to his brotherinlaw im trying to believe this and i dont know if i can its a great country novio said you gotta love it durbin found that he couldnt keep his eyes off the man hed helped send to prison so many years ago ro broke from his mothers embrace and looked out over the gallery when his eyes got to durbin he stopped for a long beat could it be that he recognized him durbin quickly looked down and away avoiding eye contact his heart suddenly a pumping jackhammer in his ears when he felt it was safe that ro had moved on to someone else he again looked up sure enough ros gaze had now brought him back around to the front where glitsky and lapeer and the two younger officers had come up to the bar rail by farrell and jenkins all of them clearly dejected and angry durbin might have been afraid to have any eye contact with ro curtlee but that didnt seem to be glitskys problem when ros line of sight got to the lieutenant the two of them stared at each other for a long moment ro put his smile back on shook his head as though theyd all just enjoyed a good prank together and pointed a finger at glitsky then to durbins shock he cocked his thumb and shot him glitsky didnt react in any way his face a solemn mask the scar white through his lips he kept up his stare until at last ro looked away jesus durbin said what you see that yeah i did your ros a pretty ballsy guy he scares the shit out of me i think he might have just recognized me and what would that mean i dont know durbin threw a quick glance back up to the front where ro was still talking to the mayor and his parents and his attorney and one of the bailiffs trying to get them moving get him out of the jail clothes and get his new bail processed maybe nothing durbin said but if it is anything its trouble after all these years i dont think so durbin shrugged i hope youre right he breathed out heavily maybe i shouldnt have come down here to see this if hes going after people from his last trial and he sees me novio put a hand on durbins arm easy michael if he went after this woman from his last trial it was because she was going to be part of his next one you not the same at all okay i guess youre right why durbin wondered had he come down here after all probably he thought because he had wanted to see his work finished at last this criminal back in jail where he forever belonged and now that had not happened and he suddenly realized that he was very frightenedhe didnt want any part of ro or any of the curtlees even marginally aware of his own life by now the rows behind them had cleared and they started filing out with the crowd in a couple of minutes they were outside in the hallway durbin now anxious to be gone to be no part of this anymore but the hallway was a crush of humanity only a small percentage of it moving toward the stairway everybody else milling talking caught up in the drama maybe waiting for the opportunity to rub an actual elbow with the mayor durbin made a half turn into an opening before him in the throng and found himself shouldertoshoulder with sheila marrenas she had her microphone out and was interviewing some of the random people whod been inside the courtroom durbin had no sooner recognized her than she turned and stuck the microphone up into his face hello sheila marrenas of the courier quick comment sir in light of what we heard in there about the arrest of ro curtlee do you think that weve got a serious problem with police brutality here in san francisco before hed even thought about it he found himself answering not really no nowhere near as serious as the problem with judges continuing to give rapists and murderers a getoutofjailfree card obviously surprised at his answermost of the regular citizens shed quote in tomorrows article were ringers supplied by the curtleesshe stepped back and looked up at him studying his face while her own took on a questioning look dont i know you she asked i dont think so he said im sure id remember she kept looking at him if youll excuse me he said im trying to get to the stairs our town by sheila marrenas tyranny advances by small increments just last week as recounted in this column roland curtlee the son of the publishers of this newspaper was released on bail while he awaits a retrial for a crime that he may or may not have committed over a decade ago though convicted in the homicide of a woman with whom he admittedly had an intimate relationship mr curtlee was recently ordered released from prison citing prejudice against him in the courtroom during his trial by the ninth circuit court of appeal while his lawyers prepare for his new trial mr curtlee was released on bail and there matters should have remained and no doubt would have remained if not for the extra legal efforts of san franciscos police department and in particular its head of homicide lieutenant abraham glitsky glitsky had been the chief investigator in the original case against mr curtlee and a prosecution witness during the trial within days of mr curtlees release from jail another witness in mr curtlees trial felicia nunez died in a fire in her apartment although this death has not been ruled a murder glitsky took it upon himself to call upon mr curtlee at his home ostensibly to verify his alibi for the time of the womans death but in fact glitsky did not conduct a formal interrogation at all the visit then served no purpose other than to harass mr curtlee wishing to discuss this issue further with glitsky mr curtlee called on the lieutenant at his home the next day an act that glitsky quickly and spuriously labeled a threat to him and his family with this threat as his pretext glitsky again appeared with other policemen at mr curtlees home showing no warrant and in complete disregard for mr curtlees rights glitsky tried to place him under arrest when mr curtlee demanded an explanation officers attacked and badly beat him in the ensuing melee the police battered mr curtlee about the head and shoulders causing multiple lacerations on his scalp and face and breaking his arm before they manhandled him into their waiting police car for the trip downtown yesterday charged with several absurd criminal counts including attempted murder this farcical were it not tragic travesty of justice came to an end when judge erin donahoe once again released mr curtlee on bail and this in spite of the show of force orchestrated by police with the new chief of police vi lapeer in attendance along with district attorney wes farrell assistant chief da amanda jenkins and glitsky himself along with the two other arresting officers rarely have the police in our town so clearly demonstrated their utter disregard for privacy civil rights and due process as it has in this case the fact that lieutenant glitsky remains in a position of authority argues strongly that this unconstitutional behavior and police brutality in general is condoned by law enforcement and prosecutors at the highest levels and when the rule of law goes out the window as it so clearly has in this case we may be sure that tyranny has taken another step forward and a true police state is that much closer to becoming reality on the following friday morning glitsky came out of his bedroom at a few minutes after seven and stopped a minute at the kitchen door to watch his daughter work on her pancakes intent as a sculptor rachel was wiping a loaded forkful around her plate catching every possible drop of syrup humming quietly to herself finally quick as a mouse she brought the bite to her mouth and popped it in only now looking up and seeing her father having her mouth full didnt stop her from breaking into a grin and talking daddys up that he is hows my sweetie pie this morning good he came over and kissed the top of her head well continue after youve swallowed okay walking over to the stove only a couple of steps in their small kitchen he poured water from the simmering teakettle into the cup that treya had waiting for him on the counter when he turned around he saw that rachel had scrunched her face into a question mark is today saturday she asked nope a pause are you wearing your bathrobe to work sure really really i thought it would be fun what do you think i didnt think theyd let you who everybody you think somebody would try to stop me what if i gave them my look what look this one with his scar his hawklike nose and jutting brow glitsky had a fearsome visage when he frowned and now he leaned in close and gave his daughter his best shot accompanied by a threatening growl she broke into laughter hey glitsky said thats supposed to scare you what kind of a cop would i be if i couldnt scare people maybe you scare other people but not me i know when youre teasing i wasnt teasing i was practicing you better practice more then glitsky sat down sipped at his tea youre right maybe id better wheres your mom back with zack i think he wet again she went back to her pancakes for a minute and when her mouth was completely full she said youre not really wearing your bathrobe to work are you really no im just a little slow getting dressed this morning mom was too you know i didnt know that she had on her bathrobe too she did maybe well start a club glitsky rarely took a day off when hed had his heart attack and then not so long after that had been shot hed drawn down significantly on his sick leave his recovery from the shooting featured medical complications too numerous to mention and hed gone on longterm disability for the better part of two years in short during his career the city of san francisco had already paid him for five hundred and thirtytwo dayshed counted and kept trackwhen he hadnt gone in to work this bothered him he figured that was more than enough and he generally felt that it wouldnt be right to take any more especially when he wasnt sick likewise except for the births of rachel and zachary treya hadnt taken a day off for the whole time shed worked for wes farrells predecessor clarence jackman now she was only a few weeks into farrells administration and she didnt want to make an unfavorable impression on her new boss by missing work before he clearly understood that she wasnt the kind of person who took days off when it suited her now treya came into the kitchen and stopped when she saw her husband sitting drinking tea in his bathrobe she only had time to give him a quick questioning look before zachary barged his way in around her and over to the table their son had been hit by a car the year before and now wore a helmet against further brain trauma whenever he was awake and ambulatory he got into his chair and looked in disbelief at his plate rachel ate my pancakes you werent here i was too but you left hey hey hey treya came over to the table stop bickering ill make some more pancakes for both of you two abe how about you the batters all ready i could probably force myself thanks more pancakes coming up treya said hey zachary asked how come you arent dressed yet hay is for horses glitsky said and im taking a day off at the stove treya stopped ladling batter into the frying pan really glitsky nodded really what are you going to do nothing maybe go to lunch maybe see my dad think about things treya leaned against the stove her arms crossed over her chest howd you like some company i wasnt going to ask he said but if youre offering id like it a lot durbin got into work letting himself in through the back door about a half hour late he received an arched eyebrow from liza sato his assistant manager as she turned around and spotted him but he simply evaded the unspoken question with a wave and a stop at the coffee machine twentyeight years old personable supercompetent single and very easy on the eyes liza was in durbins opinion one of the main reasons that the business was so successful shed opened the place on time this morning as she had on the previous monday when hed gone down for ro curtlees arraignment the franchise handled ups fedex and parcel dispatch and was a registered postal service office as well and this morning by the time durbin got there customers stood in lines at every one of the seven workstations about a half hour later the morning rush just about abated durbins private telephone line rang in his office he walked back inside the halfenclosed glass cubicle and picked it up on the second ring he had barely finished saying hello when he recognized the voice of his neighbor from across the street mike thank god youre there youve got to get back home right away your house is on fire on the way out blowing through streetlights and stop signs almost praying hed be pulled over durbin tried janices numbers on his cell phone and got nothing but her outgoing messages he caught his first glimpse of the smokelots of smokeas soon as hed cleared the escarpment that ran from union up to broadway he was still two or three miles away and the dark plume had already risen in the still clear air to the height of the sutro tower this was no small grease fire in a kitchen tires squealing he finally turned onto his street rivera and immediately saw that he wasnt going to get within a couple hundred yards of his house which in spite of the presence of six fire trucks spraying water from at least four hoses still looked to be completely engulfed in flames janices sister kathy novio stood next to durbin by the incident commanders station near one of the trucks her arms folded over her heavy jacket she made no effort to conceal the tears that coursed down her cheeks i cant stand this she said i know me neither i keep thinking she might be in there durbin put his arm around her we dont have any reason to think that michael she wasnt at work after shed gotten durbins call immediately before shed come up here to the fire scene kathy had driven by janices office over by the stones town shopping center which was relatively near her own home and even though the lights werent on she wanted to be certain and so she banged on the door for almost a full minute to no avail i know you said that that doesnt mean shes in there she might be on some errand she didnt tell me about with her phone off durbin shrugged sometimes she forgets to turn it on sometimes she forgets it entirely why would she be in there anyway i dont know her eyes went back to the nowgutted house the flames were mostly contained by now although men still worked a couple of the hoses and a pillar of thick black smoke continued to rise into the sky her voice broke im just so afraid that she is durbin reached over put his arm around her shoulders drew her in next to him chuck came jogging up from where hed parked a couple of blocks away kathy threw her arms around her husband and he embraced her patting her back consolingly and whispering words of comfort then over her shoulder he said to durbin im sorry it took so long to get here i didnt check my messages until after my morning class his eyes went to the house god michael jesus then he paused in a kind of double take wheres janice kathy blotched and tearful made a mewling little noise and just shook her head against him we dont know durbin replied not at work not answering her phone chuck threw a glance at the smoldering ruins came back to durbin gesturing now toward the firemen do these guys know anything not yet the arson inspector couldnt get inside until like five minutes ago but even as durbin spoke the arson inspectorarnie beckeremerged from the front door hed stuck his hands deeply into the pockets of his coat and walked leaning slightly forward as though into a stiff wind with a slow deliberation his shoulders sagged looking up his eyes glanced over where durbin stoodthe incident commander had introduced them to each other soon after durbins arrivaland then quickly he looked away in a few more steps hed come up to the ics table durbin whod moved away from the immediate area when his brotherinlaw had come up now broke out of their little knot of neighbors and other onlookers and got back over to the table in time to hear becker say the word police what do you need the police for durbin asked the two men turned to look at him the expressions on both of their faces were so obvious that neither of them really had to say anything but becker reached out a hand and placed it gently on durbins arm im sorry he said but theres a womans body in there in one of the upstairs rooms kathy and chuck had come up directly behind him and now she split the air with a keening scream janice oh god no janice as chuck turned and held her she covered her face with both of her hands and broke down after they left messages at their jobs saying they wouldnt be in both leaving their excuses suitably vague abe and treya dropped the kids off together at their respective school and preschool then had come home and gone back to bed closing in on noon they had finally gotten dressed and now sat in a booth at gaspares this is the best pizza in the city you know that treya said i dont care about any of those newfangled places or even the other old ones tommasos glitsky said very good no question just not this good asixteen treya shook her head again delicious but too long a wait so let me ask you a question general category of pizza no okay hold it glitsky put down his pizza slice no wait its coming to me the battle of thermopylae wrong the what the battle of thermopylae and how can you say its wrong when you dont know what it is i know what it is or was it was a battle between the greeks and somebody maybe the persians i think correct very good what year what year im sure sometime around ancient greece close enough how about foureighty bc id say definitely yes what a relief to have that nailed down that sounds just perfectly right it is completely right and yet you said it was wrong it was wrong because it definitely wasnt the answer to my question which was going to be if i remember correctly if you felt as guilty as i did whats it going to be now whats what going to be your question she shook her head smiling that silver tongue of yours got to wagging so much i dont even remember something about if i felt guilty he reached over the table and put his hand over hers you really feel guilty she cocked her head sideways a little bit now sighing i feel like im letting wes down hes clueless enough about his appointments and his schedule as it is anyway if im not there to spoonfeed him hes a big boy not so much really and pretty much out of his depth ive noticed youre not the only one i know you dont read the courier but hes taking some pretty serious abuse there that papers a rag nobody reads it well thats half right the rag part but dont kid yourself abe people read it it swings a lot of votes glitsky shrugged votes were not part of his universe and his respect for those people to whom votes were the issue was minuscule i dont know you want my opinion wes deserves to swing in the wind a little i dont know how you can say that abe he came down on the right side with you last week only under great duress and lets not forget that the reason ro curtlees out in the first place and the reason we got threatened is because wes didnt step up and do the right thing the first chance he got he could have demanded no bail and got it now she covered his hand with hers i know that he was naive hoping to keep the curtlees happy he knows that too now and i know you did the right thing but i dont think ro would dare do anything to us now glitsky made a face well thats the hope id be a lot happier if wes pushed a little on getting his new trial date set but as to whether i feel guilty taking a day off i dont plan to make a habit of it but after monday and now hes out again and i still dont have enough inspectors or the budget to hire more he let out a breath i dont know trey i feel im a toxic presence at the hall and ive got to let some of this anger leach out before i poison my own troops if im going to do that i might as well quit altogether are you really thinking about that sometimes frequently in fact i dont know what the point is anymore same as its always been babe putting killers in jail yeah glitsky said but then they let em out not always not even often i know i know youre right but thats why i need a day off here get some perspective back speaking of which he reached down and pulled his cell phone off his belt if its the office dont treya said but glitsky was shaking his head its not downtown he said its arnie becker i ought to get this and he pushed the connect button arnie its abe whats up of course becker was saying we wont know for sure until arnie glitsky held up a hand and cut him off you got any doubt at all becker drew in a large breath through his mouth the stench of the burn was strong but a whiff of the pervasive scent of cooked meat could bring even a strong mans stomach up very little he said they were standing hands in their pockets on the second floor in the bright sunlight that shone through the collapsed roof of michael durbins home the temperature was in the midforties abnormally cold for san francisco in february the body was still in place in the burnedout shell of the upstairs bedroom itself pretty thoroughly destroyed the coroners van had just arrived out front but the crime scene unit with their surgical masks in place had been photographing and collecting what little evidence they could since before glitskys arrival about twenty minutes ago though the face was unrecognizable this body was in somewhat better condition than felicia nunezs had been neither of this womans shoes in this case lowheeled black pumps had been burned away completely one had come off possibly from the power of the hoses during the active phase of fighting the fire and had wound up under the bed about eight inches from the womans right foot but the other shoe still appeared to be a snug fit on her left foot there were no unburned scraps of clothing under the body no sign of a bra or other underwear and beckers conjecture from those facts was that the woman had been naked either at or shortly after the time she died and was set ablaze due to the relatively light amount of charring where the womans body was in contact with the floor becker told glitsky that if shed been wearing any clothes they would not all have burned away what about dna glitsky asked i mean if the burning wasnt really so bad well becker said its all relative you can see for yourself that not so bad doesnt mean not bad and its also pretty clear where the fire got started same as with nunez so all in all id say dnas not a good bet although of course were going to try becker glanced again over at the body so the similarities thats why i called you directly of course i appreciate it glitsky sucked carefully through his teeth turned away so the body was out of his line of vision although i cant say it makes much sense what has to make sense i mean if this was ro curtlee first the sheer balls of it after last week hes telling you to go fuck yourself glitskys mouth twitched at the profanity so he just picks some random woman becker shrugged maybe he knew her yeah but everybody else hes done has been a domestic howd he meet somebody out here a normal civilian im guessing right any word about whether this was the cleaning lady or somebody like that i dont think so abe the husband and some other family are down there he pointed out to the street theyre all wrecked and they all think its the wife shes the only female who would have been in the house the daughters still at school he called and checked glitsky looked up through the gaping hole in the roof above them dear god he said how old is she the daughter another shrug i dont know school age youre right glitsky said what difference does it make he took a last look at the body closed his eyes against the horror of it and shook his head so who is she if its the wife her names janice durbin her husbands glitsky put his hand on beckers arm and gripped it michael yeah howd you nodding verifying to himself the sudden and unmistakable clarity glitsky pulled in a last quick breath he was the jury foreman at ros trial i dont know why i agonize about taking days off glitsky said nobody else even seems to notice when i do maybe amanda jenkins said thats because youre actually physically here in the building talking about a case so to someone who isnt paying close attention it seems like youre on the job somehow and just for the record can you explain to me how it would be different if you werent taking a day off not too i guess you put it that way well there you go she pushed her chair back from her desk leaned back and put her feet up on its surface displaying a good percent of her extraordinary legs in the process you want to get the door certain people see us talking theyre liable to think were colluding to obstruct justice like we did last time glitsky turned and closed it jenkins crossed her arms gave him a flat look so what are you going to do i dont know thats why im here talking to you you might have an idea not any that im proud of well thats not true ive got one hit me before anything else id rule out arresting ro again glitsky allowed himself a small grim smile that was my thought too which of course leaves him free to go around killing other people whenever the mood strikes him but hey thats not my decision dont be bitter no why would i be bitter good for a minute there i thought i detected a trace nope bitterfree thats me a wooden chair sat along the wall next to the cabinets and glitsky pulled it around and straddled it backward but in actual fact ive pretty much decided that im going to pretend ro isnt any part of this durbin murder lower my own profile thats probably smart you show up around ro again its a circus before it even starts that doesnt mean im not going to be all over it no i didnt think it did so whats the plan the plan is i dont make the connection to ro not in public anyway and whats that get you time if nothing else maybe the curtlees back off meanwhile i go out and talk to people like any homicide inspector would develop a theory of the case maybe even a list of suspects i dont get near ro until something some solid evidence leads back to him which is what were going to need anyway if the good mr farrell is ever going to charge him with anything again in our lifetimes except youve already got that up front something leading back to ro whats that the shoe the mo the jury foremans wife take your pick the guy all but drew you a picture well thats the other thing what arnie beckers theory is that this is ro flipping me off actually flipping both of us off you and me im flattered glitsky shrugged so hows he going to feel if hes gone to all the trouble of killing somebody else and leaving all these clues to rub what he can get away with in our faces and i dont put it together instead i go barking up another tree and dont give him the satisfaction it took her a moment but then she nodded hes going to want to tell us what he did and dare us to try and prove it need is more like it its going to flush him or it might at least its a shot glitsky was thinking that treya was right about her boss without her organizational presence and staff sergeant demeanor hed be lost as an administrator so much so apparently that in her absence this afternoon hed simply closed up shop and disappeared the lights in the outer officetreyas domainwere dark when glitsky showed up no visitors waited for their appointments with the da himself and the door to farrells office was closed crossing the room and putting an ear to the door he heard no sound not expecting to get an answer nevertheless he rapped sharply on the door three times nothing and then just as he was turning to go the sound of footsteps came from within glitsky stopped and was all but at attention facing the door when farrell opened it the district attorney was in his shirtsleeves and the lights in his own office were turned off the blinds pulled against the bright sunshine outside glitsky thought he might have just interrupted a nap if this isnt a good time he began no its fine i was just meditating for a minute you ever do that abe not so much i dont get much free time twenty minutes a day thats all it takes everybody ought to be able to find twenty minutes i keep looking for them glitsky said i think the kids must steal em oh thats right your kids are still at home arent they only for another eighteen or twenty years but whos counting youre right i dont think i would either under those conditions probably wouldnt meditate either suddenly farrell seemed to remember not just where he was but who he was his face went slack for a moment then reanimated itself but here you are what can i do for you you want to come in and sit down for a minute is everything all right with treya hows she feeling better glitsky said shell be back in on monday i hope thats the plan good good well come on in farrell hesitated then moved back a step when glitsky had gotten past the door farrell closed it behind them he turned on the rooms overhead lights then walked over to one of his couches and sat on it motioning for glitsky to do the same but glitsky remained standing what do you got farrell asked ros done it again farrell dropped his head then slowly brought it back up youve got to be shitting me no sir janice durbin wife of the foreman of his jury set her on fire either before or after he killed her burned the house down around her naked with shoes on her feet might as well have left a business card sounds like he did farrell brought a hand up and rubbed the side of his face jesus christ abe what are we going to do i thought you might go back to baretto farrells shoulders heaved a spasm of bitter laughter he wouldnt touch this thing not after donahoe now two judges have ruled ros no danger to the community no way does baretto pull him back in so at what point do the shoes and the mo count as evidence honestly probably no point maybe i should go talk to him make the case farrell shook his head your credibility around ro is in the shitter abe this is all coming across as a personal vendetta he hesitated maybe i shouldnt mention this but i had vi lapeer stop by here this morning unexpectedly whatd she know its not what she knew its what she wanted she wanted advice about what about the fact that leland told her he wants you out not just out of this investigation but completely out the political heats just too much for him according to him half the city thinks you guys are the gestapo and youre the poster child thats marrenas the womans toxic glitsky finally took a seat across from farrell coming forward he let out a breath so what was your advice i told her she should stick by her guns and support you the mayor wouldnt dare fire her so soon after bringing her on of course i may be wrong i havent been right in so long i forget what it looks like but i told her hed look like a complete fool for making her his choice for chief in the first place he threatened to fire her i think it was more understood than stated but the message was clear enough so i should quit i wont lie to you abe thats an option though not a good one better would be to get something real on ro i thought i did that last time yeah well we saw how that played glitsky took that in silence for a beat then well in any event ive got my case file and notes from the original investigation which im reviewing for the retrial with nunez gone weve still got her testimony from the first trial but reading it to a jury is not going to be anywhere near as strong as hearing her would have been which leaves the one other witness gloria gonzalvez but shes disappeared too hasnt she i havent really started looking she may turn up plus i want to go see the other rape victims again the ones who got bought off if theyll talk to me why would they do that now after all this time glitsky shrugged i dont know maybe they wont but maybe its bothering one of them they didnt do the right thing he held up a hand i know long shot but worth a try its your time speaking of which were still looking at august for the retrial minimum unless you get something sooner on nunez or this latest woman if i do glitsky said as he stood up youll be the first to know from the early years of their social and business prominence the curtlees had staffed their homes and some of their businesses with guatemalan or el salvadoran help rather than gamble with undocumented aliens they could hire on site down in central america and provide work visas medical insurance and an almost unbelievable standard of living for those lucky enough to be chosen in return they found their employees from these countries to be honest hardworking loyal grateful andperhaps most importantfearful of being returned back to their homelands just at about the end of ros trial one of their talent scouts in el salvador had been approached by eztli in nahuatl the language of the mexica mehsheeka the people who white men call aztec eztli means blood as is also the common custom among his people eztli had only one name it fit him well thirtyfive at the time he already spoke excellent unaccented and idiomatic english courtesy of an american father whod disappeared when the boy had been twelve he had been in the regular el salvadoran army for a decade beginning when he was sixteen connections hed made in the service paved the way for civilian work as a majordomo for enrique mololo one of the countrys drug lords mololo unfortunately for himself had decided that he did not want to share his profits or contacts with mara salvatrucha one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the world this decision had proved fatal for mololo if eztli had not been on an errand to pick up one of mololos new cars when the militarystyle raid on his bosss compound took place he almost undoubtedly would have died that day too but as it was he had missed that party instead of going back home to mololos place he had called on the curtlees procurer for whom hed supplied the names of several young women over the years he needed to get out of the country he had skills he was willing to work and the curtlees were only too glad to have him now on an overcast sunday afternoon ro sat in the passenger seat of the runner while eztli drove south along the ocean on highway ros left arm was still in its cast but other than that he bore little resemblance to the man hed seemed in judge donahoes courtroom only six days before he was cleanshaven welldressed in khakis and a black silk tommy bahama shirt he wore expensive italian loafers with no socks hed lost the bandage hed been sporting over the bridge of his nose the swelling around his mouth had gone down and only a slight yellowing remained where the black eye had been ros idea when he woke up that morning was that hed go down to the ofarrell theatre get his ashes hauled by one of the girls in the boothscouldnt get too much of that after being inside nine years after that he didnt know the afternoons tended to drag as a general rule maybe hed go back to bed but then coming back home from the ofarrell he found eztli waiting for him the butler reiterated how hed been feeling terrible about not being there when the cops had come to get ro okay he had an excusehed been out with the parents doing bodyguard work but protecting the familyall of the familythat was his job he should have been part of it when glitsky and the other cops came by now eztli wanted to make it up to ro somehow show him a good time at least sunday was his day off and some gamecocks were fighting at a place he knew down near pescadero maybe ro would like to go it was a hell of a show girls watching it getting into it it made them hot given his prejudices and predilections ro normally wouldnt have gone out of his way to accommodate or hang out with one of the household help whom he generally viewed as stratospherically beneath him but eztli was different first of course he was a guystrong and experienced he could handle himself and this was always a plus second and much more important was the fact that while ro had been in prison eztli had suggested to cliff and theresaworried sick about their sons safety behind barsthat he network amidst the greater hispanic community and put out the word among the prison population particularly the violent mexican gang eme that ro wasnt to be molested that in fact protection for him would be rewarded the two menbutler and convicthad met in the prisons visitors room several times before ros release to negotiate rewards and payouts and in the course of these meetings had developed an easy bond if not yet a true friendship but in any event ro was inclined to relax his usual standardsfor a day at leastand see what kind of fun the butler could provide for him so here they were sharing a doob just passing half moon bay the golf courses the ritzcarlton there on the right no ro was saying im not going back in theyll have to kill me first eztli took a hit and passed the joint across your mom and dad believe it wont come to that thats what they keep saying anyway but i dont know they told me starting out they had that prick farrell on board with them that didnt work out so well yeah but look what happened what do you mean i mean youre out no thanks to farrell no eztli shrugged okay ro held some smoke in his lungs while he looked over at his driver suddenly now he got the strongest sense that hed intuited several times in the prisons visiting room that there was more going on inside the mans brain than might immediately be apparent behind the stony expressionless exterior his parents had kept eztli on for the better part of ten years and they were very smart and shrewd people who did not much let sentimental attachments get in their ways if eztli were just muscle he would have made some mistake and been long gone by now but not only was he very much still a presence he actually lived in the big house with the family clearly he had an agile brain and contributed on other levels as well to say nothing of the fact that hed probably saved ros literal ass in prison and maybe his life as well the young man blew out the smoke hed been holding you dont agree with me he asked about farrell eztli kept his eyes on the road took a minute before he answered i believe what your mother and father believe whats that that if farrell wants you in jail youre in jail but he eztli was shaking his head hes playing a game why would he do that because hes a politician hes playing both sides thats what they do eztli held out his right hand and ro handed him the joint which he sucked down to its last half inch letting the hit out he went on look dont kid yourself farrell makes the call he goes to a judgeany judgeand says you dont get bail period then you dont get bail but he didnt do that not either time its come up meanwhile he gives your lawyer half a year to get up to speed which wont happen in any six months either thatll go a year maybe two maybe forever and this makes farrell the best friend you got hes giving you time and times the main thing for what hey come on for everything eztli flashed him a look for doing what you have to do gloria serrano nee gonzalvez loved doing her own familys laundry she sometimes felt she could do it forever in perfect happiness so long as it was in her own house for her own sons and daughter and husband she loved the smell of itthe musky tang as she pulled the clothes from the hamper as well as the sweet detergent scent when it came out of the dryer almost too hot to touch she liked to separate the whites from the colors to take the shirts out as soon as theyd dried so that she could fold them so they wouldnt wrinkle she even loved the challenge of finding the lost sock that seemed to go along with nearly every load now sunday afternoon her one day off she had her piles of clothes stacked and folded on the wooden workbench next to the washer and dryer in the garage of the twobedroom house that she and roberto had finally managed to buy in sunnyvale today one of her husbands red socks had made itself disappear gloria went down to one knee and put her head almost inside the dryer then pulled back and reached in with her hand to turn the drum no sock she hoped it would not be among the clothes shed already folded the only other place it could be was the washer itself but she was usually very careful about making sure the washer was empty before she started the dryer because this was when she often found the coins and also very occasionally the bills that she hid to use for presents for roberto and the children since shed bought the last present for ramons seventh birthday in novembera lego battleship that hed loved and rebuilt so far about twenty timesshed amassed a new total of nearly twenty dollars including todays unusually large haul of two dollar bills and a quarter she never considered that she was stealing from her husband by keeping the money she found the money always went back to one of them she looked on it more as though it were a fine that fate imposed on her husband when he didnt check to empty his pockets before he threw clothes in the hamper but that sock was missing and she didnt really want to unfold all of her already folded clothes and check again maybe in the excitement of finding so much money earlier she hadnt been as careful as she usually was so she opened the washer and reached around where a sock might have stuck in the spinning process and todaya good luck signshe found it clinging to the top of the drum she wasnt about to run a whole load of drying for one sock so she took the wet sock and its dry partner and threw them both into the dryer where they would wait until the next load went in then she gathered the other clothes in her arms opened the garage door to the kitchen and went to distribute them through the house she was making enchiladas for sunday dinner and their wonderful smell stopped her in her tracks in the kitchen caught in a rogue wave of emotion she put the clothes down on the table and pulled out a chair to sit on roberto had taken the childrenall the children bless himto costco for their biweekly run there and this had left gloria free to clean and do the laundry in an empty house get it ready for the next week after a minute she got up to pour herself some of her delicious guatemalan coffee sitting back at the table she wrapped her hands around her mug and stared out at the overcast sky through her kitchen window the color of the sky didnt matter sitting with her clean washing in her own house on a sunday afternoon drinking the wonderful coffee smelling the good food that theyd have for dinner she felt kissed by god in complete contentment and who could ever have imagined she would have gotten to here especially after those first few months when shed just arrived to work with the curtlees and after their horrible son whod started in on her within the first few days finally got his way again and again over the months shed stayed what else was she going to do whom could she turn to the family chose to turn at best a blind eye to ros advances and at worst they were complicit that shed eventually gotten out and placed with another family had been miracle number two and that would never have happened if the new girl doloresthe one ro had finally killedhadnt been on her way in the pipeline from guatemala the poor thing gloria had no doubt that but for the grace of god that might have been her and then the scary months before and after shed actually gone in and testified and ro had gone to jail when cliff and theresa curtlee had first tried to buy her silence and then had threatened her through their lawyers with extradition but even with all of their connections they had not been able to call on as many as gloria herself had among her extended family so they could not track her as she disappeared first to live with friends of some cousins in gilroy nor after she met and married roberto and reestablished herself as a housekeeper in sunnyvale now she had a good business cleaning twentyfive homes in palo alto and menlo park every weeksteady legal work and two employees besides herself she had a dependable babysitter her own home a family and a documented hardworking husband who loved her andshe thanked god every dayno ro or any other curtlee in her life not now not ever again the novios had a semienclosed redwood gazebo in their backyard hexagonal in shape about ten feet in diameter when chuck came out to get firewood as dusk closed in on this cold and cloudy sunday evening he noticed his brotherinlaw sitting on the bench that encircled the inside of the gazebo he was faced away from the house canted forward his elbows on his knees hands clasped in front of him chuck walked over and knocked on one of the posts and michaels shoulders rose and fell as he looked over hey you all right just taking a break kathy had insisted that the whole durbin family stay with them at least until the memorial next thursday individual pockets of grief were piled up inside the house like snowdrifts kathy chucks twins and michael and janices own allie and their boysangry jon and devastated peter all of them were flopped wasted on the furniture in front of the television tuned to sports round the clock not really so all right though durbin added no of course not i hear you novio sat down across from him durbin raised his head i keep wondering what im supposed to do now next you know i can imagine if kathy died he shook his head i cant think about it no durbin said no reason to a beat im just trying to get my arms around what happened i cant put together any kind of a plausible scenario i mean why was she home what was she doing there that time of morning she was supposedly going out the door right behind me and next thing we know somebody else is in the house and shes dead up in the bedroom how does that happen chuck whats that about what do the cops say they got any theories durbins face went dark fucking cops dont get me started they got nothing no lab reports the autopsy wont be done until maybe next month theyre not even ready to say somebody killed her yet not on purpose anyway she might have just happened to be home when whoever it was started the fire maybe she ran upstairs and tried to put it out and died of smoke inhalation so at least theyre saying it was arson apparently but thats the other thing i told you not to get me started too late now whats the other thing this guy glitsky the inspector when he was here it was like i was part of his investigation like i could have had something to do with it chuck nodded in understanding yeah he had some questions for me too while we were waiting for you to come downstairs this information straightened durbin right up he talked to you he questioned you what about my cell phone or rather janices cell phone which didnt burn up because it was hanging from a peg behind the kitchen door evidently he said i got twelve calls to or from her in the past two weeks i told him that evidently i did so what we were planning a surprise party for kathys fortieth next month was there something sinister about that whatd he say a shrug he just let it go as he should have but jesus talk about shaking every tree i know its his job but can you say ridiculous yeah well i hear you and the funny thing is before yesterday i would have told you glitsky and i got along all right before yesterday you knew glitsky personally not saying we were friends exactly but after ros trial we went out together a couple of times just comparing notes on how the curtlees were fucking around with both of us so i figure he knows who i am basically but yesterday i get the strong impression that he doesnt really think its out of the question that i killed her either hes just turning over rocks durbin shook his head maybe but stupid and a waste of his time i told him janice and me we were having a few problems same as every other married couple with teenagers on the planet but nothing we couldnt work out you guys were having problems a shrug nothing we couldnt fix chuck nothing to kill her over trust me no i didnt mean durbin waved him off it doesnt matter the point is glitskys ears go up and hes all how long have you been having these difficulties and were you seeing anybody a marriage counselor like that i tell him maybe he hasnt heard but janice was a psychiatrist we werent anywhere near therapy anyway bottom line i shouldnt have mentioned anything next thing i know he tells me hes talked to some of my people down at the shop he wants to know where was i that i got in late friday morning i told him i didnt even realize i had been late and he goes yeah like a half hour and then waits like ive got something to tell him then he starts asking about liza whos liza my assistant manager at work smart and cute shes sticking up for me when glitskys down at the store asking questions about how late i was how was i acting he actually went to your store first thing before he came to see us here i told you im on his list but thats just so ludicrous its beyond that but then hes going on about my relationship with liza like maybe its because of her i decided to kill janice i want to strangle the guy his temper flared again suddenly thinking it could be me for christs sake chuck came forward on his bench he couldnt really think that hes just getting started let the evidence come in get the autopsy done itll all work itself out durbin leaned back against the wall of the gazebo youre right youre right he brought a hand up to his forehead his eyes dull shot with red im just so done in suddenly durbin cocked his head life coming into his eyes what chuck asked its not too often you actually see the lightbulb go on durbin stared out over novios shoulder mike what is it durbin let out the breath hed been holding you know the troubles i told you wed been having janice and me i think she was having an affair novio went still before he finally shook his head no way mike i dont think so not janice then really you know this with who one of her patients if i had to guess the idea growing on him he straightened up i was just wondering who could have had a reason to have done this no way it was just random someone picking our house and deciding to burn it down but if she was involved with somebody and wanted to break it off and he came over and went into a rage i mean thats somebody who would have a motive some kind of personal connection to tell glitsky about get him looking at somebody besides me nodding going along with it chuck said at least its someplace he can start or he can go with my other theory whats that chuck hesitated that this might not have been about janice at all that she was just a way to get at you me whod want to get at me what for but then the obvious occurred to him ro curtlee novio shrugged the first witness who got killed after he got let out didnt he burn her place down around her and you said you thought he recognized you in court last week so i start thinking maybe durbin held out a hand stopping him god in heaven he said i really think we ought to move to new york theresa curtlee said on monday morning she was at breakfast downstairs with her husband she would alternately sip from a porcelain coffee cup a leadedcrystal riedel wineglass filled with pellegrino water garnished with a slice of lime and a small glass of grapefruit juice on her plate shed sliced off two small bites of pineapple the table between her and cliff groaned with food most of it destined for the disposal several bowls and platters of french toast scrambled eggs sausages bacon smoked salmon bagels english muffins bran and blueberry muffins a composed fruit salad there really is no reason we have to live with the constant aggravation here cliff moved his copy of the courier off to the side it would be difficult to run the businesses from new york he said and we dont want to uproot now at our ages although it is tempting i must admit all this madness with ro i just pray now that they let it drop you dont think that glitsky is really going to let it drop do you sometimes im afraid he might actually be lying in wait somewhere when ro goes out i dont think hed do that himself but he might in fact hire someone else no not even hire it would be some kind of a favor she put down her cup thats what i mean clifford why do we have to live with that fear every day i dont understand why we cant have him removed somehow we tried that before if you remember hes resilient i was sure hed quit when they moved him to payroll but no here he is again and again apparently with the support of his chief these cops and their stupid loyalty and theres just no getting rid of our brandnew chief not for a while anyway so here we are again theresa dabbed at her lifeless lips i dont really understand whats the point of acquiring influence if we cant keep ourselves a little bit insulated from this riffraff element isnt this what we work for instead with all the money we hand out to that same element and all the good we try to do it just doesnt seem right it isnt right theresa but its the way this town is basically insane she cut another small slice of pineapple and chewed it primly and completely and i dont suppose she said that our good mr farrell would let us take ro with us if we went east would he maybe just for an extended vacation i think not so why again did we donate all that money to his campaign he was the lesser of two evils theresa and in his defense i have to say that he could probably have made a stronger stance against bail and kept ro in jail which he did not do so i think all in all the campaign money was well spent so far at least if he doesnt try to get too cute and fancy pleasing everybody theresas eyes went to the platter of bacon in front of her she moved it forward a couple of inches before thinking better of it and pushing it back reaching for her grapefruit juice she asked why are they so out to get him ro he picked up a bite of his own bacon chewed swallowed and sighed i mean she asked what did he do that was so terrible sowed a few wild oats show me a young man who hasnt done that suddenly theresas eyes glistened with the threat of tears when i think of the time hes already lost and now finally they let us have him again but for how long i dont know if i can bear it if they take him away again i just dont understand the witch hunt clifford i really dont what did he really do i just dont understand it what he did cliff curtlee began was he committed the grave sin of not apologizing for the class he comes from our class and in this city as you know there is no greater crime because were all exactly equal dont you see but thats so patently absurd nevertheless that is precisely whatand i take my share of responsibility for thisthats precisely what we didnt take seriously enough at the trial i mean yes he might have gotten a little out of control with some of these girls and of course that was wrong but he was young and really who were they did they count in any meaningful way would they ever just at this moment linda salcedo one of their young and attractive staff came through the door from the kitchen holding a pitcher filled with freshly made coffee ah cliff said here is my savior perfect timing a little more please just half a cup there thats good thanks youre a dream linda what would we do without you linda gave him a thin smile and curtsied politely gracias and turned toward theresa senora no thanks dear im fine another little bow and the young woman disappeared back into the kitchen darling girl theresa said wonderful cliff agreed then continued on his earlier topic not saying that if ro in fact hurt one of these girls there shouldnt be some punishment but clearly his sentence was out of all proportion to the damage he did and our failuremine as well as his lawyerswas that we didnt understand how deep the prejudice of those jurors went that class divide the jury wasnt going to forgive him they were going to make him an example in retrospect and ive agonized over this a thousand times we should have played him down market the way we did last week that worked pretty well that judge couldnt help but see him not as a boy with a little money and maybe a leadership attitude but as a beatendown victim i hated seeing him like that thats not who he is no but thats who he may have to be if he wants a lighter sentence next time or even no sentence at all but best would be if there is no next time cliff nodded of course i agree and i know that tristan and ro are working on that now so well just have to wait and see how that turns out and here again we still may be able to prevail on mr farrell to hold off scheduling the new trial for quite some time or even canceling it altogether especially if none of the earlier witnesses can be found to testify again which looks like it may in fact be the case lets hope so but if they do rescheduleshe lowered her voicei really think we might want to send ro someplace safe if we can where they dont extradite cliff sucked in a breath well he said of course thats a possibility but its a tenandahalfmilliondollar decision theresa we could do it but lets exhaust all our other options first without making a conscious decision to do so farrell stopped by his former law offices on sutter street he was still one of the name partners at the firm freeman farrell hardy amp roake even though his private practice had dried up on the notunreasonable assumption that it was a hard sell to clients seeking a defense attorney if you happened to be the person also charging them with their crimes still he supposed that his name had a certain advertising value to the firm and in terms of the other shareholders in the firm the plain fact remained that out of the four name partners three were essentially uninvolved in the practice david freeman was dead farrell himself was the da and gina roake was spending most of her time writing her second novel after the modest success of her first one this left as the only practicing name partner dismas hardy farrell came up the main staircase into the lobby and strode across to the circular reception area behind the low wall phyllis sat at her keyboard multitasking away in her multiple roles as secretary chief receptionist and gatekeeper to hardys office catching farrell on approach her fingers stopped moving as her mouth first pursed in faint distaste then rearranged itself into an arctic smile mr farrell she enthused welcome back thank you phyllis is diz in clearly the question she was hoping he wasnt going to ask her lips reassumed their pained expression and she lifted her arm so that she could consult her wristwatch hes got a scheduled appointment in twenty minutes she said emphasizing the vast difference between that appropriate business moment and farrells unexpected appearance is he expecting you no i just thought id drop by for a minute maybe you could buzz him for me or i could just he made as if to go around her station and straight to hardys door no no she held up a restraining hand let me just tell him youre here and she lifted her telephone and pushed a number one minute later dismas hardy closed his office door behind them both shes armed you know he said are you kidding hardy shook his head not kidding as of a couple of months ago she pointed out and rightly so i might add that if somebody really wanted to get by her and into my office to see me there was no way she could physically stop them there would be nothing she could do so i went down with her and we bought her a big ol gun threefiftyseven magnum hollow point slugs all to stop people from seeing you without an appointment hardy said thats the crucial distinction farrell sat on one of hardys queen anne chairs like the appointment i didnt have this morning and to think i actually made a move in the direction of your door youre lucky she recognized you and held her fire you dont think thats carrying the whole thing a little far i would hardy said if it were true farrell sat back in his chair im slowing down you really had me ah but to discuss the possibility gives it a sort of truth i have a tshirt that says so you have a tshirt for everything hardy said you want some coffee sure two sugars please hardy stirred carried the cup and saucer over people still not joking around too much down at the hall not as much as you might think farrell said so you havent heard about the two canadians playing twenty questions no but hardy couldnt wait he started right in so the guy whos it thinks up the word moosecock and the other guys first question is can you eat it and the first guy goes well yeah i guess you could so the other guy thinks a minute and says would it be moosecock farrell had a mouthful of hot coffee when hardy got to the punch line his reaction was immediate trying to hold the coffee in for a half second or so during which time hardy thought he might be choking but then farrell lost the fight altogether and exploded into laughter as a fine spray of coffee filled the air in front of him oh god diz im sorry your rug farrell had his handkerchief in his hand coffee was coming out his nose another bout of hysteria shook him and another hardy whirled on the spot quickly peeled off a couple of paper towels from the wet bars roll went to a knee and began dabbing at the rug farrell came down with his handkerchief and joined him but the residue of the laughter still hung there between them the rug hadnt sustained any major damage farrell got back up and sat again on his chair hardys own grin creased his face i should have waited till you swallowed dont worry about the rug its my fault farrell sat back sagging in the chair wow he said he took a few more breaths retaining his equilibrium when hed gotten himself together he got down to it i was just hoping to hear an objective voice around all this ro curtlee stuff thats all im getting it from both sides in the newspapers sams barely talking to me amanda jenkins still might quit over it and were not even talking about glitsky what about abe he thinks ros killed somebody else a woman named janice durbin and she is the wife of the jury foreman at his trial but abe cant arrest ro again now not after the fiasco last week crawford wants him shitcanned just on general principles anyway and vi lapeers had to go to bat for him which makes her own job security a little tenuous to say the least the whole things just a complete clusterfuck and sam might be right thinking its all my fault but i dont really know what else i could have done or could do now for that matter hardy stalled for a moment sipping his coffee what do you want to do go back to baretto just rewind the clock unring the bell hardy said if only we could what would you do different id recommend in the strongest terms that bail would be inappropriate that ro was a killer and a danger to the community forgive my ignorance but what did you tell him last time last time i didnt say anything i sent amanda to court and let her do her thing at hardys look farrell went on i know what youre thinking youre thinking i buckled under to the curtlees i dont know anything about you and the curtlees wes so i promise you thats not what i was thinking what happened they lobby you they probably thought it was subtle but it was more or less a fullcourt press and after that you didnt go chat with baretto wes shook his head no but i wasnt going to before that either why not besides the fact that it would have been totally unethical i actually thought it was his decision and you know ten million bail isnt exactly chump change hardy sipped his coffee farrells shoulders settled he shook his head i fucked up didnt i hardy shrugged how long had you been in office when you made the call three days something like that but i had another chance last week with donahoe and i blew that one too and now weve got another dead person and i wouldnt be surprised if were going to see more of them hardy took a minute how about the grand jury ive got no evidence diz and i dont mean a little i got nothing then how do you know its ro he leaves the shoes on his victims both women have a connection to his trial hes a psycho and hes loving this thats evidence it might be enough for the grand jury then they indict him for both killings and theres no bail so he gets arrested twice in a week hows that look who cares its happened before and the grand jurys going to take longer than a week anyway to get your indictment then send a swat team down and bring him in maybe youll get lucky and hell resist arrest again and you can shoot him dead your mouth to gods ear farrell said hardy shrugged again look wes youre the da now not a private citizen and certainly not a defense lawyer get used to it whatever you do youre going to make enemies so given that the only thing you can do is what you think is right you think this guy needs to be in jail find a way farrell took this advice in silence after some seconds he reached out and sipped at his coffee after he swallowed he met hardys eyes shit i know i asked for this didnt i thats the rumor farrell dragged himself to his feet well diz i appreciate the straight talk and sorry again about the rug dont mention the rug ill tell phyllis the machine malfunctioned and spit coffee all over shell want to buy a new one and then ill say i really like this old one in spite of the malfunctioning aspect we ought to go around on whether or not to get a new one for a couple of weeks at least itll be really fun farrell smiled in spite of himself why again did i quit working here destiny came calling and youre welcome back anytime but wes yeah while youre still in public service do yourself and everybody else a favor and put this fucker away he picked up the phone in his office on the first ring glitsky lieutenant this is michael durbin glitsky took a beat how are you holding up to be honest its a challenge these last couple of days im sure it is glitsky surprised by this call scratched at a spot on his desk lieutenant im here we didnt talk about it much when you came by on saturday but over the weekend i realized maybe i should have what im trying to say is that i felt in the aftermath of ros trial that we had developed something of a personal relationship glitsky considered his words before he spoke we had a couple of cups of coffee together afterward i remember that as i recall lieutenant you drank tea thats right still do well i felt then that we had a certain simpatico between us both being hassled by the curtlees as we were i thought maybe we could kind of have a little offtherecord talk now like we did then about your wifes case glitsky pulled his yellow pad up in front of him in a way yes i got the impressioni should have mentioned it at the time i knowthat you thought i was some kind of suspect the thought that michael durbin was any kind of a real suspect had never really entered glitskys mind and for an instant he felt a degree of satisfaction that hed sold his objectivity so convincingly but he didnt want to confide that or anything else to the man he was talking to mr durbin he said ive just begun my investigation ive got any number of people who could conceivably be suspects and probably but wait no no no you cant have me as one of those people because im not in it i cant be a suspect lieutenant you know that how do i know that because you knew who i was back after ros trial and i havent changed you know that im no killer i couldnt kill a fly i didnt kill my wife or light the fire we dont even know if the fire killed her yet sir or if somebody else killed her and then set the fire were hoping to get some lab and autopsy reports soon and then well have more of an idea of what were even looking at okay fine but whatever that is my wifes dead and the investigation into her death cant include the possibility that i had anything at all to do with it which is what i keep feeling you must be considering and especially when i think you and me must already know for a fact who did this anyway we do oh come on lieutenant think about it ive been doing little else and ro curtlee hasnt occurred to you glitsky said nothing until at last durbin pressed on all right maybe its not the most obvious thing in the world i admit it didnt occur to me until yesterday which was probably because you had me so rattled with your questions why would ro want to kill your wife to get back at me just like he burned up that other woman the witness yes but she could testify against him she was a threat in the here and now your wife had no connection to him and wouldnt have any influence on his future its not the same thing at all its him i know it was him listen i was at his bail hearing last week and of course now i realize that was probably a mistake but he turned around and looked right at me im sure he recognized me and that gave him the idea now hes paying back old debts glitsky suddenly realized that this was almost precisely the type of lead that he hoped he would uncover in the course of his investigation durbins information came from an independent source and led to ro without any reference to glitsky or the police department it was a legitimate lead in the case that he would have to follow up even if hed never heard of ro curtlee thats a provocative theory glitsky said its a damn sight more than that ill bet you anything its what happened well then hopefully well be able to prove it not if any part of you is still thinking it could be me youve got to concentrate on ro for gods sake before the trail goes too cold at the vehemence of durbins comments a small part of glitskys brain nudged him with the idea that durbin was protesting too much but he cast that niggling quibble asidero was certainly janices murderer and glitsky could understand durbins desperation to see him apprehended and charged he had just lost his wife after all and ro was very much a person to suspect and to fear glitsky his voice matteroffact came back at him im going to go where the trail takes me sir and from your information here today it sounds like it might be heading toward ro theres no might about it maybe not glitsky said but its my job to make sure arson inspector arnie becker showed up unannounced at glitskys office that monday morning and now he was sitting across from the lieutenant listening to his wrapup where the bottom line had been that no one had seen anything suspicious near the durbins house on friday morning this guys luck is just phenomenal glitsky was saying somebody should have seen something everybody going to work or school about the time the fire started and nobody saw anything like a purple zfour how many cars do you think the curtlees own abe six eight fifteen they got a whole fleet im sure youre right youre right glitsky ran his hand back over his scalp i just want something almost anything so badly i can taste it well i might be able to help you there ive got some news talk i just came from strout downstairs downstairs meant the coroners office outside the back door of the hall of justice strout was the octogenarian medical examiner who seemed immune to the citys policies on retirement probably because he was so good and so fair that no one wanted to rock that particular boat first things first even without a tox yet now theres no doubt its a murder hyoid bones broken which by the way same with nunez so janice was strangled and dead before the fire started assuming of course that she didnt strangle herself after she set it no glitsky said lets rule that out and it was definitely set althougha bit of a surprise herethe accelerant was downstairs in the kitchen and dining room both and spread up from there newspaper and gas if youre keeping score he brought the gas in one of those big plastic diet coke containers pretty much melted away but identifiable the twentyounce one glitsky received that information with a brusque nod what kind of accelerant did he use with nunez gas again with some of her clothes any container in that one not obvious nothing i found and i looked so glitsky asked he didnt light janice on fire well she was upstairs in a house nunez had just the small apartment so he didnt have other options with nunez but he made the best of what he had to work with and actually lightly balledup newspaper is pretty much the best accelerant you can use so maybe hes refining his technique but janice didnt burn as much as nunez did she no not really close actually and that leads to the other thing glitsky perked up tell me you got dna did not but maybe something we can work with we did get chlamydia youre saying that janice had it becker nodded strout wasnt even looking for it and one of his assistants caught it on the slide so he rechecked no doubt about it glitsky sat back and crossed a leg when i talked to the husband michael he said they were having some problems serious but nothing to kill her over now i know what kind of trouble it was and maybe it was more serious than he let on so we know she was having an affair becker said or he was glitsky countered she finds out hes given her chlamydia and they get in a fight and he kills her or shes given it to him same result yeah becker said except he didnt kill her ro did married people have problems all the time and they dont necessarily kill their spouses over them glitsky theatrically used his finger to clean out his ear im sorry arnie i thought i just heard you say spouses dont kill each other in which case this department might have enough inspectors after all are you getting squishy on ro becker asked no abe replied without hesitation im just trying to fit this chlamydia thing into the picture well the good news becker said is that ros going to test positive for chlamydia too when you get him locked up again not necessarily not if he used a condom glitsky said not if he didnt rape her at all and theres no forensic evidence that he did am i right no not yet becker said then added do rapists use condoms your higher class of rapists you bet all the time glitsky sat back in his chair his right hand stretched out before him drumming his fingers on his desk when he spoke it sounded like he was working it out for himself ro might not have raped janice if in fact he didnt because she wasnt like his other victims she wasnt anything personal to him just a way to get to durbin hows that sound anything that includes ro sounds good to me abe i examined the nunez scene and the durbin scene so youre talking to a true believer thats two of us glitsky said in his personal parking space behind his store durbin sat in his car and waited for some inner voice to give him the secret password that would get him moving the solid cloud cover had finally broken up and splotches of sunlight had been coming and going for the past ten minutes pushed along by a strong freshening breeze he didnt really know what he was doing here but then he hadnt really known what he was doing earlier that morning back at chuck and kathys either except rattling around in the big house after the kids had all gone off to school so hed gotten into his car and told kathy he was going to go check on things at his place of business at last he opened the car door and let himself into the back of the shop the little bell rang over the door and a couple of his employees turned at their windows registering surprise and worry but he simply waved a hand in acknowledgment turned into his office and sat down behind his desk it didnt take liza sato ten seconds to appear in the doorway wearing jeans and a cowled fishermans sweater with her hands on her hips she wore an expression of equal parts frustration and concern what in the world are you doing here michael he tried a smile that died halfway im not all that sure to tell you the truth it seemed like a good idea at the time a vague gesture hows everything out there everything out there is fine except you shouldnt be here where else should i be how about back home thats kind of the problem liz homes gone her eyes widened and her hand went to her mouth oh i didnt mean its all right i know what you meant you want to come in sure she closed the door behind her then leaned back against it with her arms crossed michael i dont know what to say i am just so so sorry his shoulders rose and fell he spread his hands on the surface of his desk then simply shook his head and shrugged again liza pushed herself off the wall and came around the desk where she draped an arm around his shoulders leaned down and kissed the top of his head she felt his body heave in a sigh then she let go and boosted herself onto the desk really she said you dont need to be here i know but i dont know where else i should be he let out a breath i stopped by the house where the house was this morning you know how weird that was i mean i leave there friday and its my home where my kids live where all of our stuff is where most of everyday life happens and then this morning i go by and all thats gone and janice with it he looked up at her i just dont have any idea what im supposed to do now you dont have to do anything no ive at least got to somehow be there for my kids although thank god for school which is where they are now i dont know how theyre hell who am i kidding i dont know anything he paused im sorry i didnt come down here to cry on anybodys shoulder thats all right she said you can cry all you want michael cryings okay well its not not really he quickly patted her knee right there next to him but thanks for the offer pushing himself back a little farther away from her he said i heard you met inspector glitsky on saturday morning she nodded he came by yes and evidently i was late getting to work on friday were you thats what he said or rather somebody who works here said i was he seemed to think it was important in what way in the way that i might have stayed around to make sure the fire was well advanced before i started driving to work lizas face went dark thats just nuts he cant really think that i was late though wasnt i she thought a moment well i remember i opened up but beyond that she shrugged but really though so what well i finally remembered wracking my brain all weekend just a couple of other little things on my mind i stopped for gas coming in got stuck behind an rv who needed like a hundred gallons then got caught in a line inside after the pump told me i had to go to the cashier to get my receipt which i never wound up getting anyway because the guy two people in front of me started screaming something about getting the wrong lotto ticket anyway in case anybody asks again which they probably wont i dont think it was a big deal anyway michael well glitsky kind of made it seem like one and youd think i would have remembered all that insanity at the gas station but i swear to god it all just went away maybe something to do with your house burning down and your wife dying you think that could do it yeah maybe that but i just wanted to tell you i never thought anything about it michael really well good but i think the question is going to be moot anyway whys that because im pretty sure i know who did it ro curtlee and his lawyer tristan denardi sat at the bar at tadich grill both of them eating cioppino i know youre not supposed to ask ro was saying i know you dont want to know but im telling you anyway i wasnt anywhere near the place i did not kill nunez though it doesnt break my heart to see her out of the picture well shes not quite out of the picture ro denardi for all of his theatrics in the courtroom cut a more or less paternal patrician lowkey figure a full head of silver hair an unlined face that suggested time spent in a tanning salon a beautifully cut italian suit with a gold silk tie theyre still going to use her testimony from last time sure but it wont be her on the stand giving it again you said theyre just going to read what she said last time right right theres no other option so how convincing is that going to be not very and i know and agree its a definite plus for us although i admit i would have liked it better if she were still alive and we could persuade her not to testify at all or even to change her testimony plus then there wouldnt be any question at all of your possible involvement in her death ro rolled his eyes how many times do i have to tell you denardi raised his hand palm out i understand that im not accusing you of anything ro its just that the timing her dying in the week after youre released you have to admit its unfortunate not my problem counselor and not yours with his good hand ro stabbed a scallop seems to me our one problem remaining is that other witness gonzalvez weve got to find her and make her change her mind either about what shes going to say or whether she really wants to say it at all we dont want her showing up as a surprise if this thing ever goes back to trial no i understand that but as ive explained to you she disappeared right after your trial shes likely to stay disappeared i think that if your parents havent been able to locate her it might prove to be a little difficult for anybody else ro shook his head i dont buy it why not because they werent really looking for her they were going to hassle her maybe put her out of work if they could but once she was gone they let it go what was the point but now for us its a different story now she alone could swing a jury you see that i acknowledge the possibility yes well then i say we find her first how do you propose we do that you got private eyes who work for you dont you sure several well put one of them on it you know ro the rumor is shes in guatemala shes really not coming back im just saying why not be sure in spite of how hed left it with arnie becker glitsky had his tape recorder out on michael durbins desk in the back of the shop the door was closed behind them rendering into a muted white noise the normal business dealings taking place out front among the customers glitsky had recognized liza sato among the employees right away from his saturday morning interview and twice now in his peripheral vision hed noticed her at the window coming back to check on how things were going between her boss and the cop hed already covered durbins belated and labored explanation of his tardiness coming into work last friday morning durbin had then mentioned his suspicions about ro curtlee and glitsky had dutifully listened and asked the appropriate questions now though with that line pretty much played out he thought hed bring things a little closer to home but having been at the arraignment you knew about the recent history between me and ro the arrest and so forth sure im just curious why you didnt come by and say hello to me then well you were obviously busy and in the middle of things and i was way back in the gallery i would have had to wait and then walk back through a lot of people and then of course i didnt have anything specific to talk to you about either so what happened this morning with the phone call to me well i put it together about ro and me yesterday and i thought youd understand i mean knowing all the background with ro and me and all it would be easier to sell the idea to me is that it i didnt really think of it in those terms i figured id pass along whatever i knew to you i thought i was doing the right thing well glitsky said as far as that goes you did fine thats a relief i didnt mean to cause any trouble i just thought well you know ro hes a dangerous man yes he is listen durbin cleared his throat could we take a short break maybe get us something to drink im dying of thirst could i offer you some water coffee coke only diet im afraid thanks im good but you go ahead durbin got out of his chair and walked around glitsky and out into the hallway glitsky turned off his tape recorder and looked around at the small wellordered office at a glance it reinforced his view that durbin was an organized wellordered guy after a minute or so he returned with a clear plastic cup full of ice cubes and an oversize plastic bottle of diet coke he poured a splash into the glass let the foam settle and poured a little more then placed the bottle on the desk between them glitsky turned his tape recorder back on when we talked saturday he began you mentioned that you and your wife were having some troubles durbin stopped middrink and set his glass down i dont understand he said why does that possibly matter now why would it matter any less than two days ago because two days ago we didnt know that ro had killed janice now we do so what difference does it make if things had been a little difficult lately glitsky framed his answer carefully just because ro had a reason to kill janice doesnt mean that he did or someone else did not we dont know that ro did durbins voice got loud the hell we dont what the hell more do you need keeping his calm glitsky replied we need evidence sir fingerprints dna somebody seeing him at your house something a jury will need to convict so go look around him to find your evidence youre not going to find it sniffing around whatever problems my wife and i might have been having glitsky somewhat taken aback slowed himself down before he replied i get to ask the questions here sir if you dont want to answer them thats fine but well have the answers sooner or later are you seriously telling me im a suspect here i dont have a suspect yet im looking for one durbin slammed his fist on the desk you got one for christs sake you need a map can i draw you a picture its ro curtlee glitsky took a beat was it you who was having an affair durbin shook his head jesus christ i dont believe this he paused should i be getting myself a lawyer thats your absolute right if you feel you need one this is bullshit no sir its a murder investigation glitsky sat back his mouth set in a thin line and for the record you should know that im not a fan of that kind of language so we can either be civil with each other or not again its your choice im trying to find out everything i can about your wife so ill have a better idea of where to look if im going to locate her killer do you want to help me or not of course in fact ive given him to you and ill be looking into that i promise in the meantime youre here and i need to know who your wife might have been seeing or who you were slumping back durbin sucked in a lungful of air brooding for another moment at last he said i wasnt having an affair with her id bet one of her patients do you have any idea how long this might have been going on i dont know anything about it except just the bare fact and maybe not even that we hadnt been intimate for a couple of months at least a couple of months though i wasnt keeping track a long time ill say that but i dont want you thinking i didnt love her anymore because i did i do i was sure wed come out of it so you never called her on it confronted her directly no not on last friday either no not then not ever he suddenly reached for the glass in front of him and drank deeply from it you ever go through a bad time with your wife lieutenant sometimes you just wait it out you hope something gives of course glitsky had no intention of discussing anything about his marriage with michael durbin or anyone else for that matter would you happen to have a list of her patients he asked no theyd be at her office over by stonestown durbin gave him the exact address and suite number if you can get at em she was superprotective about her records patientdoctor privilege you know ive heard of it is there anything else you can think of that you might want to tell me about the way it worked with eztli was that nearly every day he got most of the day off he had no regular duties down at the castro street offices of the courier where cliff and theresa spent most of their time during daylight hours back home eztli was in charge of the general upkeep of the house though supervising the cleaning kitchen and gardening staff coordinating visits from repairmen and deliveries he was a very efficient manager and these duties even at their most onerous would rarely keep him occupied until noon after which his afternoon time was his own when he wasnt out on special projects the curtlees expected him to be home and dressed in his business suit to greet visitors and to serve as a generally unobtrusive bodyguard and butler he had a license to carry a firearm courtesy of a sheriff from a small county in the central valley so when he was dressed up in the house he packed an ugly black semiautomatic under his arm in a shoulder holster sometimes he also wore it when he was outside he had not shot anyone since a few months before hed come to the united states today since eztli was out with ro and had already learned that anything might happenhe really liked the vibe around this kidhis gun rested snug up under the arm of his black oakland raiders jacket eztli had both dropped and then picked up ro at tadich grill and now he pulled the runner out into traffic with his passenger back aboard and said somebody joined in with us waited with me in the garage the whole time when ro turned around eztli said the white honda looks like an accord white guy tie no coat half bald got him ro said and came back around facing front you know him never seen him before so one of glitskys plainclothes guys got to be all right they drove a few blocks farther west until just short of polk ro told eztli to pull over into the next parking spot he saw and keep the car running when he did the white honda which had been following about three cars behind them cruised on by the driver apparently whistling to the radio eyes straight ahead guys going for the academy award eztli said now what now hes going to turn to go around the block and catch us again so lets get on his ass instead eztli pulled out in a squeal of rubber then at the corner and against the light cut in front of a bus coming up polk street and fell in behind the white honda just in time to see it turn right again at the next corner eztli didnt need any instructionsaccelerating up the block he almost went onto two wheels as he turned steeply uphill and had gained half his ground by the time the honda turned right again at the next corner this time as eztli got within sight they saw that the honda had done their old trick of pulling off to the side and coming to a halt block him off ro said and eztli pulled a hard right into the driveway just in front of the honda before their runner had even come to a complete stop ro was out onto the street the middle finger of his uncasted hand extended hey he yelled all the while flipping off the man whod been tailing him hey coming right up to the window now you want to get off my ass what the hell are you doing the window came down and the man not at all impressed with ros outburst held his wallet up with his left hand flashing his badge in his right he held a gun that was pointed directly at ros face and who the fuck are you ro asked ive about had it with you guys you know that seeing eztli coming up too hands in the pockets of his raiders jacket the man held the badge up farther so that eztli could see it too so there would be no misunderstanding im an inspector with the das office and im here to make sure you two boys dont get yourselves into any more trouble well im here to tell you to stay the fuck out of my life ive got my rights here i can go where i want and do what i want you hear me eztli put a restraining hand on ros arm and leaned down did wes farrell put you on this he asked quietly we have other das matt lewis said i take assignments from many of them now get back in your car and move along fucking jenkins ro said to no one then to eztli got to be jenkins shes an extraordinarily determined woman isnt she yeah and those legs go all the way up i bet id like to get myself some of that wouldnt you ez i would not turn it down im telling you exactly once more move along ooh ro said leaning in toward the car im thinking maybe we hit a nerve here ez maybe the man heres already had some of that matt lewis raised his gun hand a little higher ro eyes on the gun began to step back but eztli was right behind him solid as a wall so farrell didnt assign you eztli said he did not retreat one single step nice wheels by the way is that the accord by way of answer lewis pointed the gun at him and said one eztli kept his calm the officer wants us to back up ro he said i hear him then by all means let us comply he backed up and pulled ro along with him talking easily as they walked back to the runner the city doesnt use hondas as city vehicles so how does he stay in touch without a radio his cell ro replied not when hes driving eztli said that would be against the law he went around the bumper of the runner opened his driver door got in and started the engine matt lewis shaking from adrenaline put his glock back into its holster he turned on the ignition and waited for the runner to back out and drive away as they turned back west onto california street ro asked what was all that about his car the honda eztli glanced at the rearview mirror whats he doing now ro turned around to look lewis was right behind them just driving no phone no unless hes on speaker does he appear to be talking no im thinking not no bluetooth on that model its too old so so its his own car he doesnt have a radio hes not using the phone right so no one knows where he is or what hes doing somebody knows hes assigned to tail us how do they know we didnt shake him okay but again so what so youll see they rolled across van ness franklin gough eztlis eyes flitting back and forth between his rearview mirror and the road ahead as they approached fillmore he suddenly flicked on his signal and pulled over into the leftturn lane wherere we goin ro asked just taking a little detour too much traffic up here heading south now they stayed on fillmore as it morphed in only a few blocks from a welltraveled highend shopping street to a nearly empty thoroughfare through one of the citys ghettos eztli already driving slowly slowed further at each corner while he checked the traffic on the cross streets turk street was deserted in both directions and he suddenly turned right continued about halfway down the block then pulled over and came to a stop what now ro asked im tired of this guy you tired of this guy im tired of all of em okay then you see anybody where anywhere ro spun around checked the sidewalks the street itself no eztli nodded me neither behind them matt lewis had pulled over as well and put the car into park but he hadnt quite decided what he was going to do there was no point in following these clowns all over the city so long as they knew he was following them amandas original idea sprung on her own initiative had been to see if they would lead him back to any of their suspected crime scenes or to her missing witness gonzalvez or failing that to someplace where they simply did something else illegal and then he could call in the troops and arrest them again they both had figured given who these guys were it wouldnt take too long but now when matt lewis looked up he saw eztli coming again around the back of his car impatient now with the absurdity of this situation hed just about decided to drive around them and come back another day but now here came the aztec in his raiders jacket looking like he had something to say so lewis lowered his window and leaned his head outside what now eztli was almost up to him his face placid even apologetic oh he said nothing much i just forgot with no further warning he brought his gun around from where hed been holding it out of sight and in one fluid movement pressed it up close to matt lewiss head and pulled the trigger dismas hardys suggestion to have the grand jury indict ro curtlee on a nobail multiplemurder charge had grown on farrell all day as he prowled the offices on the third floor of the hall of justice taking the pulse of his staff when hed started on his rounds he still didnt quite trust that he was contemplating the right decision indeed when hed first heard about the nunez killing hed considered and rejected the grand jury solution for what he thought had been sound reasons that hed only have sixty days to bring ro to a trial that would probably not convict him that his acquittal on that charge would make it much more difficult to bring him back to a retrial in his initial case that in any case hed be out on bail again in another couple of months he could have asked the court to join the cases for trial but he couldnt count on having that motion granted and if the cases had been kept separate it would have been a train wreck but that was before janice durbin with that murder farrells personal priorities had evolved hed finally come to believe that keeping ro behind bars was a valid end in itself for no matter how long a time if he could get the grand jury to indict hed take sixty days as a good start and work on getting more jail time from theretry to move up the retrial date work on baretto and donahoe to revisit their bail decisions whatever it took the lawyers on his staff were generally a bunch of hardcore prosecutors and the events of the past few days particularly ros bail hearing had cut into the teams morale in a big way now farrells suggestion that he circumvent the judges rulings met only with untainted enthusiasm finally he was the boss and acting like it taking charge not one of farrells assistant district attorneys had any doubt about ros guilt both originally on the rape and murder charges at his trial and then with the two latest victimsfelicia nunez and janice durbinand all of them seemed to believe that the grand jury idea was legal and liable to conclude with ro sitting in a jail cell where he belonged now closing in on five oclock having made his decision farrell called his own task force together if he was going to go to the grand jury he needed to know everything relevant that anyone could give him on ro curtlee his office continued to be logistically challenged however and so he had his invitees seated willynilly medical examiner john strout and police chief vi lapeer on the couch arson inspector arnie becker on an ottoman glitsky and amanda jenkins on a couple of folding chairs brought in from treyas office farrell himself sat on the sturdy oak library table after he asked them to turn off their cell phones and then thanked everyone for coming at his summons he got down to it i think its pretty clear with this durbin homicide that ros taking this time out of jail as an opportunity to pay back some of the people who helped put him away in the first place abe and amanda i know youve both argued that same thing right from the start and i want to apologize to both of you for not making a stronger case against bail in the first place you were both right i was wrong and for the record abe your instincts were also right about trying to arrest him for the threat against you even if youd waited and gotten a warrant i believe her honor erin donahoe would have done what she did bailwise so now the situation really couldnt be clearerif were going to override these bail decisions and we mustweve got to get him indicted and i mean yesterday for nobail murder sohe spread his palms supplicatingi need you all to help me i know weve got the shoes on both victims weve got the connections and motivations related to his trial the fire in both cases none of which im sorry to say rises to the level of convincing evidence it might work for the grand jury if i tapdance enough around the related motives but it would be nice to have something else in the line of evidence since were going to get huge media on this and im predicting theyre not going to give us a pass just cause were the good guys for a moment no one spoke glitsky looked at becker over to amanda back to farrell thats all weve got wes except they were all strangled and naked except for the shoes but thats not enough evidence either all of the people in the room knew the extent to which the grand jury was a prosecutors tool there was no judge at the proceedings and no defense attorneys allowed to refute or even argue against any of the das assertions still although the standard of proof was low it was in theory nevertheless based on evidence and so far they didnt have much how about witnesses farrell asked arnie on nunez we have two people over on baker who saw a car like ros around the corner probably the same car and no they didnt catch or notice the license number and nobody saw him get in or out of it otherwise pretty much zero how about the same car at the durbin site becker shook his head not yet still canvassing but im not holding my breath farrell let out a disappointed sigh john he asked the ancient doctor scratched at his white hair i know yall been talking about rape an hopin to pick up some dna but the nunez woman was too burnt for any analysis whatever wasnt anything like fluid left to test and durbin best i can tell there wasnt any rape at all although i did i told arnie here this morning i did find that she had a dose of chlamydia the bottom line is that theres nothin i can point out proves either one ofem was raped at all so i wouldnt be comfortable putting that in your mo what about the chlamydia farrell asked would she have been contagious yeah but even if it got passed on to curtlee theres no provin it came from her so whats that get you amanda jenkins cleared her throat if i may she said how about if we think about the one trial that ros had i mean there was no question about evidence in that case we had the two witnesses solid and his dna with his victim yeah farrell said but hes already been tried convicted and appealed out on that one you cant punish somebody for winning an appeal by recharging him with something more serious of course but how about if you take it from a completely different angle tell the grand jury that youre joining that first case sandoval with these later two so youre not upping the charge in sandoval which is the legal objection and why are you joining the cases then because the first one is the motive for the others so now youve got multiple murder and thats a special circumstance and thats no bail and that wayi really like this wesyou also make a neat endrun around the sixtyday issue if his attorneys press for trial theyre shooting themselves in the foot because weve got him again cold on the first one farrell swinging his feet as he contemplated sat with the idea for a long moment its good amanda but i still think were on some pretty shaky legal grounds not really if we tried charging the sandoval rape again definitely but were not so the specials this time out arent murder rape but multiple murder and if weve got the evidence to convict him on one and we do thats all we need farrell clearly warming to the general idea still wanted more specifics so how exactly do i sell it to the grand jury that these are all connected aside from the fact that its pretty selfevident on its face you just tell them ladies and gentlemen janice durbin was a suburban housewife she wasnt robbed she didnt have any known connection to gangs or to drugs who else in the world would want her dead except ro curtlee and what was his motive revenge on her husband pure and simple really into it now amanda looked around the room and found herself selling it to everyone you remind the jury that their standard of proof isnt reasonable doubt but merely probable cause could any one of them really believe that mrs durbin getting killed right now was just a coincidence did they want to live with that no even though theres ten years between them these murders are obviously all connected so obviously that it cant be ignored and more murders are going to keep happening with who knows how many other victims until ro is back in jail farrell nodding easily now finally said i think so i think that might work he looked around anybody else have anything to add vi lapeer spoke up for the first time it would be better if this didnt leak i hope farrell said that goes without saying sorry lapeers smile was tight and unyielding in philadelphia sometimes that wasnt always so clear now she turned to glitsky id try to get your investigations on these two new cases assigned to an event numberthis meant that the investigations would have an unlimited budget from the citys general fundbut id have to get his honor to sign off on that and we cant go there so given that thats not going to happen do you have enough personnel abe i could move people around maybe assign out overtime he said but whos going to pay for it how about if you go over budget you dont get dinged on my guarantee thank you glitsky said ill find some troops and put them on it he turned to farrell so whats our time frame on this farrell shrugged looked over to jenkins amanda if i drop everything else i can present most of it next week that is a week from tomorrow or you could wes if i brought you up to speed its your case farrell said all right jenkins clearly pleased let out a breath of relief ill need every witness i can get both from ros trial and from the ongoing investigations if all goes perfectly maybe we can hope for an indictment two weeks from tomorrow jesus christ arnie becker said that long he could wipe out half the city in that time jenkins threw him a look maybe but that long would basically be a world record for speed inspector she said in the meantime lapeer said i can keep it out of the homicide budget and authorize putting someone on him twentyfour seven ive already done that jenkins said this was news to farrell you did well he volunteered actually matt lewis one of our inspectors she explained to lapeer matt thought i might be a next possible target and wanted to keep an eye out and it wasnt twentyfour seven just his shift and then maybe a few hours at night hell want some backup then lapeer said that would help jenkins said farrell surveyed the room briefly all right he said it looks like weve got a workable plan with a reasonable timeline longer than id like in a perfect world but probably the best we can do amanda since youre going to be presenting to the grand jury why dont you take point coordinating all these efforts with what youre going to need couple of weeks with any luck well get this animal back where he belongs before he can do any more damage i want to thank you all again for a knock on the door interrupted him followed immediately by treya from the outer office im sorry to interrupt she said but abe somebody hunted you down and theres an urgent call for you out at my desk in the decade or so that it had been since hed last shot anybody eztli had almost forgotten the pure adrenaline rush and pleasure of violent action of simple pure killing he didnt realize how much hed missed it having to make do over the years with the vicarious thrills of gamecock or dog fighting now the taste of blood still fresh in his mouth it was as though hed been sensation deprived weaned slowly methodically and successfully off his drug and then reintroduced to its power and its beauty in ways he didnt try to understand he knew that ro was somehow the source of this drug before ro had gotten out of jail eztli had been marking time comfortable and secure with the curtlees and then suddenly ro appeared at the home with his energy and fearlessness and eztli riding around with him catching the hightension vibe of the younger man had in the past days woken up from what felt like a long sleep ending in the climax of the gunshot to the mans head this afternoon ro perhaps even unwittingly had been the catalyst the gateway to the drug and eztli was going to protect that source now at around nine oclock he was sitting in his car alone parked across the street from buena vista park in the upper haight wes farrell lived in a mediumsize victorian home just down the block that eztli and ro had checked outthe address compliments of one of denardis private investigatorsas one of ros first excursions after hed gotten home farrell eztli knew was going to be the key to whatever happened with roand farrell was weak and indecisive he could be controlled and much more effectively than with cliff and theresas carrotandstick relatively subtle approach the trick eztli felt was to see the man in his natural environment and determine where when and what kind of pressure to bring to bear on him to control his decisionmaking what eztli had said to ro was truefarrell was his best friend it really wasnt in ros or eztlis best interests to eliminate farrell to take him entirely out of the picture no farrell needed to be part of any equation that could keep ro permanently out of prison he would be crucial to that eztli simply had to make him understand the seriousness of the situation so far farrell had mostly stood aside and let things happen and the curtlees influence had carried the day but eventually he was going to have to make a decisionto prosecute ro or to let the matter drop eztli did not want him confused as to the proper choice so he had to get to know him a little more see where the pressure points were when farrell dragged himself back into his home at nine thirty that monday night he could not ever remember being so tired somewhat to his surprise the house was completely dark well he wouldnt blame sam if she had decided to go out to have dinner somewhere by herself or even with one of her friends hed been terrible company lately tonight he hadnt called her to tell her hed be late hadnt even thought about it in the hurricane of emotion and upheaval that had swept through his office at the news that matt lewis had been found shot to death in his car out in the fillmore district amanda jenkins breaking down inconsolably wedged between grief and guilt john strout treya and farrell himself administering to her while glitsky and becker headed out to the crime scene lapeer herself the chief of police had gone down to the magistrate on duty to try to get whoever it was to sign off on a search warrant for the curtlee home since no one had the tiniest doubt as to who was responsible for lewiss death farrell flicked on the light by the front door and in a second he heard the familiar click click click of gerts nails on the hardwood floor as she came padding out of the kitchen to meet him shed probably been sleeping in her bed in there and now he reached down and petted her wheres your mom he asked putting down his briefcase turning on more lights heading for the refrigerator the answer came in the form of a note she left him on the kitchen counter wessorry if this seems abrupt but we both know ive been thinking about taking a little time off from us for a while now you not calling or making it home tonight after all of our discussions about just keeping on communicating with one another anyway it was a wakeup call telling me that i should actually do something rather than just taking things as they come and building up resentment against you if i was choosing to stay around here and just keep taking it whose fault is that so im going to be staying over at mariannes house for at least the next few days and id appreciate it if youd leave me my space so i can think about what comes next for us i dont know maybe you wont want me back once you get used to me being gone either youve got to admit we havent been having much fun lately im not really much of a politicians wife or even girlfriend im afraid i just dont seem to have much of a stomach for it the compromises the deals ro curtlee all of it i do still love youi doand im fine but i dont know if i can live anymore or want to the way weve been lately sam ps gert has had dinner but probably needs a walk before bed if you want you can leave her at the center during the days and ill drop her back here at night if youre going to be around just let me know farrell let himself down on one of the kitchen chairs laid the note on the table in front of him gert had put her head on his leg and he scratched the top of it absently after some time had gone byhe had no sense of how muchgert started nudging his leg and whining moving like a zombie farrell put her leash on her and retraced his steps back to the front door and then out into the night the street that his house was on mostly encircled the park and he and gert had a regular route they walked in the morning and before bed where she took care of her business the park itself now in the dark was its usual open expanse of nothingness and suddenly tonight as he walked around its periphery farrell in his numbness gradually became aware of an ominous something that he couldnt quite put his finger on stopping he looked out into the parks center several of the lights in the street all around were out and he couldnt for the life of him remember if theyd been working over the past few days ahead of him there were no lights at all either in the park or on the street at the end of the leash gert started in with a highpitched whining farrell walked on a few more steps then stopped again he stood completely still for a minute or so there was no sound at all in the street not any movement that he could see finally he whispered down to his dog come on girl back we go but gert with hair standing up now down the center of her back strained at her leash growling low and harsh and now barked at something out in the invisible distance keeping a tight rein on her farrell moved up next to her head and petted it come on now come on pulling her around heeling back toward his house when they got back inside he closed and locked the front door behind him he took off gerts leash and started to go back again into the kitchen as a matter of course whenever he did this gert would tag along next to him but this time she turned back to the front door and another low rumbling came out of her hey easy now he said its okay everythings okay but holding her by the collar he opened the door again and took a quick look outside at his benign street upon which nothing moved after he finally got gert calmed down doing her business out the back stairs in their tiny backyard and then lying back down on her cushion in the kitchen farrell went over to the liquor cabinet and pulled down a bottle of knob creek bourbon he freepoured himself most of a juice glass full threw in enough ice cubes to take the liquid to the rim of the glass then drank it all off in a gulp thislosing his woman and imagining threats on empty streetswas not by any stretch what he had bargained for when hed run for da in his heart he didnt really think that he was that serious a person he had some verbal skills and he got along reasonably well with people from most walks of society but hed never considered himself to be a leader of men he had originally been talked into running for da with the thought that hed bring a measure of enlightenment to the law enforcement community within the city from his perspective as a lifetime defense attorney he had believed that there was in fact often a problem with cops using more force than was justified he thought that police often overstepped their mandates with immigrants as well as many of the other assorted minority populations in town and by the same token hed represented a host of people who had made mistakes and no question were not angelsbut through a mixture of glib humor and just the right amount of backbone he had never felt in danger from most of these miscreants well there had been one mark dooher had been farrells best friend for years a fellow attorney but inhabiting an entirely different stratosphere from farrells dooher had been counsel to the archdiocese of san francisco among a host of other highend clients when doohers wife was killed in a home invasion the overweening overreacting policeabe glitsky in point of facthad launched what wes took to be a vendetta against his friend eventually bringing him to trial charged with his wifes murder farrell had taken on his defense and in a brutal and grueling trial against amanda jenkins had won an acquittal that trial moreover marked the beginning of farrells rise to prominence in the citys legal community the only problem was that mark dooherpillar of the community wonderful father and husband legal face of the archdiocesehad in fact been guilty of killing his wife and also guilty of raping a woman while hed been in college and killing another man with whom hed been selling drugs in vietnam and gutting with a bayonet another young attorney with whom hed been in litigation and then he had tried to kill farrell too now with ro curtlee wes felt that he was once again up against a true sociopath who might have given mark dooher a run for his money hed been out of prison for less than a month and hed almost undoubtedly already killed three people including farrells own investigator and no one apparently seemed to be able to stop him vi lapeer had volunteered to put a watch on him around the clock until the grand jury could issue an indictment against him but she wouldnt have had time to do that yet today ro could be out there on farrells street right now sitting in a car lying in wait he might break in here and light the place on fire one thing seemed certainro was committed to staying out of jail it seemed obvious to farrell that hed prefer to die resisting arrestlook how hed fought with glitsky and his two menthan go back to prison so he wasnt afraid of anything he would attack any and every person whom he wanted to punish or who threatened his freedom felicia nunez janice durbin matt lewis gloria gonzalvez wherever she was and to that list farrell felt he could confidently add amanda jenkins glitsky and his family and himself glitsky turned the keysfirst the dead bolt then the regular lockin his front door as quietly as he could it was sometime after midnight inside he untied his shoes and slipped out of them then picked them up and went around the corner to his small living room where treya stood up from where she was sitting on the couch and said thank god youre home if you could spare one i could use a hug she stepped forward into his arms held him as tightly as she could he dropped his shoes onto the floor and she felt something give in him and she reached up behind him and pulled his head down to the crook of her neck he let his head rest where it was heavy and she could feel the thick strong muscles in his neck letting go of the tension in them after another moment his arms came up around her too pressing her against him so hard she almost for a second couldnt breathe she didnt care this was all she wanted if she couldnt catch a breath she would do without it he exhaled completely nuzzled his head into her neck and kissed it two three times then straightened up youve been up all this time apparently hows amanda as bad as youd think maybe worse she thinks its her fault its not no i know that its going to take her a while though you want to sit i believe i could treya sat back down where shed been waiting on the couch and pulled the blanket shed brought out of their bedroom up around her glitsky eased himself down sideways at the other end of the couch you get anything she asked do you want to count getting rejected on the search warrant even with the chief herself requesting it even then same rules for the chief you need probable cause how about matt lewis was following him and ro shot him how do we know lewis was following him that was his assignment how do we know he ever caught up with him because we do didnt he call amanda at lunchtime this the shooting was at least an hour later maybe more maybe in that time he lost them and went on to something else and whatever that was got him killed does anybody really believe that no and whos them now another guy was driving not ro matt lewis didnt know him but told amanda he looked more or less american indian they came out of the curtlees house together im thinking its the bodyguard i met the first time i went out there so matt lewis followed them for an hour isnt that probable cause right there they must know the chief isnt making this up they might know it but theyre not signing the little piece of paper glitsky drew a hand down the side of his face as though he were wiping dirt off it a law enforcement officer matt lewis is shot executionstyle in his car on a deserted street in a very bad part of town crawling with the drug trade fifty people within the sound of the shot could plausibly have done it why pick on ro curtlee because we know he did it well one little bit of proof and the judge signs off but he shrugged so who was the judge chomorro treya clucked disapproval so now theres three of them what do you mean baretto donahoe chomorro doesnt anybody on the bench want to put this guy in jail not more than they want to protect his civil rights glitsky went on do you know what it takes to win a contested judicial race trey a hundred and fifty grand walking away two fifty if you want a landslide and theres no limit on contributions to a judicial race slick huh bottom line the whole bench is terrified of the curtlees so who did his initial trial again thomasino how about taking him your warrant to sign glitsky was shaking his head no you want a warrant signed youve got to go to the sitting magistrate and this week its chomorro randomly this i need hardly tell you ensures the impartiality of the law i dont want impartial not in this case well glitsky said in fact you do but it wouldnt break my heart if we got lucky now and again treya tightened the blanket around her shoulders sitting with her thoughts for a minute she said in a small voice do you think we need to be worried us i mean glitsky heaved a sigh and moved down the couch next to her id say im worried enough for all of us but thats probably not what you want to hear he took her hand in both of his i like to think hes made his point with us just to rattle my chain hurting you or the kids doesnt get him anything and he knows id hunt him down and kill him coming after me or us doesnt help him with his retrial either so logically i think hes probably done with us i hope beyond which the chiefs putting on a few teams to follow him around the clock you dont think hell be able to shake them i dont know i wouldnt rule it out treya closed her eyes took in a breath well be that as it may after tonight i mean ive been thinking i dont know if i can feel right leaving the kids with rita anymore or at school even if you say theres no risk im not saying that i know she took another shaky breath this isnt like anything else abe this is a truly crazy person after a moment glitsky nodded i cant argue with you youre right what do you want to do i think i want to go away for a while all of us until this blows over somehow glitskys nostrils flared and his mouth went tight the scar going white through his lips i cant do that trey not in the middle of this why not well if for no other reason thats telling ro he wins so what if he wins treyas voice took on an edge its not you against him im not so sure about that well then all the more reason she brought her hands together over his if its that personal then you really are in danger dont you see that i do okay but i cant run just because some psychopath is out to get me there are protections in place and theres no reason to think theyre not going to work there isnt tell that to mr lewis but glitsky shook his head i dont really think he can touch me or you or the kids or that he has any reason to and youre willing to bet all of our lives or any of our lives on that trey he said that might be a little dramatic dont you think she let go of his hands and now very suddenly glitsky realized that shed quickly worked herself into a cold and unaccustomed fury im willing to take grief for being dramatic when our childrens lives have been threatened abe and in fact im kind of outraged youre not taking it a lot more seriously i am no youre not youre thinking of all this in terms of your job of you versus ro curtlee and whos going to win and youre willing to risk losing all of this our homeshe gestured at the room around themlosing rachel or zack or you and me were not going to now tears of anger and frustration in her eyes treya slammed both fists into her lap we will if one of us is dead abe dont you see that how close does it have to get just like poor matt lewis all the sudden poof gone forever and never even saw it coming hey reaching out he touched her shoulder treya brushing his hand off she turned on him dont touch me im not being hysterical or dramatic i dont need to get calmed down youre talking logic but dont you see that that man can take all this away on a whim everything weve ever built together and care about and youre willing to risk that why because of your job your career in law enforcement i cant even believe were having this discussion i told you i dont think the likelihood fuck likelihood abe fuck that the profanity hit glitsky with a titanic force snapping his head back she knew that he had a visceral intolerance for that kind of language and in all the time theyd been together shed never said anything like that around him he ran his hand over his foreheadhis blood was rushing to his head his stomach roilingand he stood up and walked over to the front windows trying to grab a breath i didnt mean he finally got out whatever i said i didnt mean it of course you can go of course no risk is tolerable im so sorry i didnt mean to criticize you you are completely right if you need to go you need to go the children need to go and what about you he turned back to face her met her eyes waited shook his head no how is this possible she asked how can we have come this far and i dont even know you trey he began you know me you know who i am ive been a cop ever since she held up a hand stopping him oh spare me she said spare me please and standing up she gathered the blanket around her and spun on her heel around the corner and back to their bedroom closing the door hard behind her at seven fortyfive the next morning a homicide sergeant inspector named darrel bracco knocked at the door to glitskys office which was open although the lights inside were off the lieutenant slumped in his chair nearly reclined in fact his outstretched arm around a cup of something on the desk you wanted to see me abe i did come on in lights no leaveem please take a chair obeying orders bracco entered the office and sat glitsky made no effort to sit up straighter even in the dim light bracco could see a grayish pallor under the lieutenants light brown skin his body language screamed exhaustion although when he spoke the words came out with a clipped precision you heard about matt lewis it wasnt really a question even if word of the shooting hadnt permeated as if by osmosis into every inch of the hall of justice building itself the shooting of the da inspector had been the lead story on all the local network news programs last night and had made headlines in both the chronicle and the courier this morning bracco knew that the whiteboard on the wall behind his head already had his name down as the lead investigator on three active homicides a nohumansinvolved gangbanger shooting in the lower mission a tragic shaken baby case out in the sunset and a fiftysomething unmarried insurance broker whod gotten himself stabbed to death the week before in the alley outside alfreds steak house these bracco felt put him at about the limit of his capabilities particularly since he was working solo lately but now glitsky was asking if hed heard about matt lewis and bracco said sure terrible thing and ill take it if theres no choice but if somebody else wants it my plates pretty full im not asking you to take it darrel sorry i just thought he shrugged go ahead so what have you heard about it lewis not much out there in the mothis was department slang for the lower fillmoreit could have been anything whos got the case nobody not yet i might wind up taking it myself glitsky turned his cup so you havent heard anything no what if i told you he was following ro curtlee around bracco kept his reaction lowkey thats not come out no is it true true enough in all of the news reports glitsky had carefully declined to state whether they had a suspect or even a person of interest in the shooting it appeared to be a random perhaps drug or gangrelated homicide but no one yet knew for sure the investigation was continuing that was all he could divulge so bracco waited so i need a volunteer to call curtlees lawyer to ask him for an interview and for obvious reasons that cant be me no way is denardi going to let that happen but we have to ask i dont want the accusation that we never gave him a chance to tell his side of the story but supposing he says yes do you want me to talk to him about this lewis thing actually that and one other case janice durbin dont know her friday her house burned down around her just like with felicia nunez who happened to be a witness in ros trial also like felicia strangled and this latest victim janice durbin was married to the jury foreman in ros trial im seeing a pattern bracco said no flies on you but the good news is that because of lewis and the fact that we know he was following ro around youve got a reasonable even plausible excuse to talk to ro see what he says he was doing yesterday and while youre at it get his alibi for janice durbin if hes got one you think hell talk to me not a chance in the world but weve got to do the drill bracco said lewis was really tailing him what darrel you think im making this up but then hearing how brusque he sounded he held up a hand in apology sorry he said i didnt sleep last night but yeah lewis was tailing ro at least until an hour or so before he got shot that was his last checkin with amanda jenkins outside tadichs where ro met his lawyer then what then ro came out and hopped in his car with his driver and lewis took off after them said he was going to anyway after that we dont know bracco considered then gave a brusque nod close enough for me it was nurseryschool day at the das office treya came in late getting on toward nine oclock trailing her two children about fifteen minutes later farrell showed up with his dog in tow luckily gert was wellbehaved and liked children so it wasnt the chaos it could have been but neither was it exactly a finely tuned professional office environment now rachel and zachary were coloring together on the library table in farrells inner office while gert had stretched out under them treya and wes had some important issues to discuss and they had migrated out to the reception area treyas domain and closed the doors both into farrells office and leading out into the hallway so they could have some privacy farrell was perched on the front of treyas desk for how long he asked her i dont know as long as it takes treya stood leaning up against the wall of law books in the outer office im not leaving the kids with this kind of risk do you know where youre going ive got a brother in la well start out down there and then abes father has a place here in town where wed be welcome although that may be too close i dont want to be findable and whats abe going to do treyas mouth went a little loose before it tightened up again hes staying on he says its only going to be a couple of weeks now hopefully i mean until ros in jail again if we can get an indictment and now with amanda farrell ran his hand back through his hair she was going to be presenting the case but i dont know if shell be able to pull it together quick enough after this matt thing you could do it yourself i know i might but meanwhilehe spread his hands out in front of himwhat am i supposed to do around here with you gone im sorry about that sir i really am i wish there was some other way but i dont see what that would be im sure theres somebody good here in the building who could cover for me you are you got a name for me she crossed her arms and shook her head no a silence built up between them this is a real problem treya you realize that the more i get used to the idea the more its a real problem yes sir i understand its a real problem at home too but what am i supposed to do ive got the vacation time accrued thats not the issue im sorry but its my issue i cant keep the kids here im afraid of what ro might do to them and you know hes capable of it whatever it is farrell digested her answer for a moment then shook his head in disgust fuck he said pardon me the least of my worries treya said anyway i just wanted to tell you in person see if i can help you find a replacement in one day treya tried to put on a brave face but it didnt take she shrugged thats all i can try for im sorry wes boosted himself off the desk and looked straight across at her you know treya he said if you do this i dont know if i can guarantee that ill be able to take you back in the same job thats not a threat its just reality i need somebody whos in here every day i realize that she said i couldnt ask that you take me back just so you know yes she said i think thats clear enough bracco found out why denardi had agreed to the interview when he showed up at his downtown office and found cliff and theresa curtlee there too along with ro tristan denardi introduced them both to bracco explaining that they were here not only in support of their son but as representatives of their newspaper bracco understood that clearly no matter what happened their presence meant that the courier was going to spin this interview as a further example of police overreaching denardi crossed an ankle over his knee revealing a flash of argyle sock over his highly polished black brogues the impeccably dressed elderly attorney took his cup of hot coffee on its saucer and placed it on the low table in front of him in the conference room im not sure my client has anything to say to you he said to bracco when they settled down to business in fact im fairly certain that he doesnt its clear that you people have a vested interest in harassing mr curtlee and i hope weve made it equally clear that were not about to let such harassment go uncontested now youre here asking about my clients whereabouts on last friday morning and were not inclined to provide that information without some sort of explanation as to why anyone should care where he was or what he was doing bracco sipped at his own coffee to give himself some time the silent presence of the curtlees unnerved him he looked from the solid unyielding parents over to ro curtlee in his pressed blue jeans and formhugging black tshirt and his eighthundreddollar cowboy boots he still wore the cast on his arm from his altercation with glitsky and his patrolmen his face though had all but cleared up hed shaved this morning and his hair was neatly combed when he noticed braccos eyes on him ro smiled dismissively bracco chose his words carefully im investigating another case and would like to clear your client from suspicion you mean hes under suspicion in another case only in the sense that we dont have a suspect yet in this other matter i am in the process of trying to eliminate possibilities and mr curtlee is among those possibilities yes a bark of a laugh from ro and then he sat back in his upholstered chair unbelievable he said theresa curtlee finally got on the boards truly she said denardi held out a warning palm toward both her and his client ro theresa please and then back to bracco this other case a homicide i presume arson murder actually this brought a tight little turnup of denardis lips of course and how would mr curtlee be even remotely connected to this hypothetical arson murder the victim was the wife of the foreman of his jury janice durbin another prim smile from denardi i see and maybe you could draw me a road map as it were of how this poor womans unfortunate death leads in any way even remotely to mr curtlee bracco kept it simple she was strangled and somebody lit a fire the same thing happened to felicia nunez and of course ms sandoval was also strangled there would appear to be something of a coincidence so if your client will cooperate and we can eliminate him as a suspect id like to do so i just dont see what your objection could be cliff curtlee ostentatiously cleared his throat but said nothing denardi took his cue well on general grounds inspector my objection is that we american citizens have the right to our privacy mr curtlee doesnt have to tell you or anybody else what he was doing on friday morning or any other time no of course not on the other hand denardi turned toward ro again and some signal must have passed between them if youd give my client and me a couple of minutes alone inspector we might be able to come to some accommodation if you dont mind with that lawyer client and his parents all stood and left the conference room bracco sat back crossed his legs and leaned back to take in the large canvases of modern art and the leatherbound shelves of books and photographs of the famous and powerful he cast his glance out over the citythe chop on the bay far below the scudding clouds the ferry building and bay bridge elegantly sweeping out to treasure island then as though it had been choreographed and maybe it had been denardi ro and the curtlees came back into the conference room inspector denardi began before theyd even sat down it would be wonderful if you could pass a message back to your colleagues in the police department that we are always ready to cooperate with its investigations when the proper procedures are followed mr curtlee is ready to make a statement about his actions last friday morning do you have a tape recorder to get it down for the record sure they sat down in their previous seats if you dont mind ms curtlee will be taking notes as well fine bracco pulled out his pocket recorder and placed it on the table after his standard introduction he asked ro curtlee what hed done on the previous friday morning i woke up late about nine fifteen in the house here he said i went down and said hello to my parents who were just finishing breakfast and then had some breakfast of my ownserved by our lovely linda well corroborate that cliff curtlee said gesturing toward his wife both of us would you like to know what we ate too bracco kept his composure that wont be necessary he said turning back to ro he asked and after breakfast i showered and put on some clothes and at about eleven i was at my doctors where he checked the cast on my arm hows that want to go later yes please they ran down curtlees actions through the whole day until he joined his parents again later for dinner thats good bracco said when they finished let me ask you a couple more questions about the morning is there anybody here who might have seen you in bed before nine fifteen he thought for a moment linda knocked at nine thats what woke me up it kind of pissed me off if you want to know so nine then and before that denardi had had enough before that inspector he said he was asleep in his bed at his home is there anything difficult to understand about that no well then denardi clapped his hands i believe thats what you came here for youve got your statement willingly delivered full cooperation now if youll excuse us bracco made no move to reach for his recorder instead he nodded amicably hey though he said as though hed just thought of it now that were talking hows the food at tadichs lately good as ever the furtive look between lawyer and client disappeared almost as quickly as it came but not so quickly that bracco didnt see it and they both knew that hed seen it the hell with this ro curtlee said to denardi this is never gonna end unless we do something about it ill tell you what inspector ill take a fucking lie detector test we got to put an end to this howd you like that denardi extended his arm to its full length ro but the young man went on no tristan this is just bullshit the same shit they been laying on us since all this began i didnt shoot anybody yesterday or any other day i finished lunch and me and ez went to the planetarium denardi actually came out of his seat ro shut up thats enough but ro couldnt seem to get himself under control he stood up too now pointing at his attorney his face flushed with anger what im supposed to just take this he just accused me again dont talk damn it denardi nearly bellowed dont say another word then he turned to stare down at bracco this interview is over he said right now bracco got his hands on his recorder first thing leaving it on he stood and backed away a couple of steps what are you going to take a lie detector about ro i never mentioned anybody getting shot dont answer that denardi said he already did bracco said this is absurd cliff curtlee got to his feet denardi reiterated he didnt admit a goddamn thing oh okay then hes got nothing to worry about ro took a step toward him i got nothing to worry about anyway dickhead ro enough denardi moved his bulk around in front of his client get out of here inspector sure bracco said backing away im gone he said nice chatting with you all the only courier reporter who worked in an office instead of in one of the cubicles on the main floor city room was sheila marrenas she had earned this eminence not only because she was an excellent stylist as a writer with a distinctive voice but because her column our town was the most widely read and popular recurring feature in the newspaper she had a great eye for news and especially for conflict disguised as news it didnt hurt either that marrenas had early on been inculcated with a belief system that coincided with the politics of the newspapers owners and that she could and did express these views with the passionate conviction of the true believer now she came into her office fresh from her lunch with the mayors press secretary a bit of a coup in itself her brain considering the slant to take on leland crawfords first weeks in office to cast him in the best possible light she wasnt overly concerned with her objectivity which so many other news outlets had long ago proven to be a spurious virtue when it came to reporting besides she was a columnist nownot just a reporter she was all about opinion nuance point of view marrenas knew that newspapers were about wielding influence and molding public opinion and the point was that leland crawford had accepted a great deal of the curtlees campaign money and now even at the very beginning of his administration was showing signs that he knew which side his bread was buttered on he could be a crucial ally in the political wars that were always on the horizon in san francisco a flattering column by her on his first weeks could go a long way toward setting his inclinations toward them into concrete maybe she could contrast crawfords own bold agenda and nononsense activism with wes farrells fairly abysmal continuing performance to date that might really shake things up her phone was ringing as she came through the door and she reached over her cluttered desk to pick it up chirping her name in her trademark response sheila cliff somethings come up you got a minute good ill be right down she went behind her desk opened her drawer and took out her hand mirror checking to make sure that every little thing about her face and hair was as it should be she neednt have worried at fortythree years old she possibly looked better than she had at thirty certainly shed grown into her style which was professional and cultured shed tamed the wild mane of frizzy black hair shed had ten years ago with soft curls now settling about her shoulders and her face had never been a problem her olivetinted skin was not simply clear but luminous small pored and glowing her smile under the sultry coals that were her eyes was genuine and generous after the braces had come off at last about six years ago she was more than comfortable with her looks and now as she put the mirror back in her drawer she allowed herself a small smile thinking that it was almost a shame that she wasnt inclined to consolidate her position here at the paper by seducing cliff who clearly had always found her attractive her taste though truth be told ran much more to theresa butshe asked herselfwhat would be the point of seducing the second in command ahh here you are looking even more lovely than usual i might add oh stop you flatterer but she was smiling as she stood and came around the desk offering first one cheek to cliff then the other one kissing the air on either side by long custom when cliff came down to her office to visit they sat on either end of the leather couch that ran along under the window with the view down onto castro street so howd the lunch with the mayor go cliff asked by way of warmup his press secretary she corrected him but it went very well shes very quotable i got some good stuff youll see she shifted facing him on the couch tucking one leg up under her but youve got something hotter not so much hot as in sexy he said as hot as in urgent its ro and the police again a small bubble of laughter shook her youve got to be kidding me youd think after last week they would have learned i dont know if theyre capable of learning i dont either was this glitsky again no although with glitsky running homicide its obvious where the orders came from this is an inspector named bracco marrenas nodded darrel i know who he is what did he do well maybe we should thank him actually since hes giving us this story but he came up to tristan denardis office today to ask ro some questions tristan didnt want to let that happen under any circumstances but on reflection i thought since you werent available it might be a good idea if tristan and ro went ahead so long as theresa and i came along to represent our interests her eyebrows went up in surprise go on cliff sitting sideways on the couch leaned in toward her anyway glitsky it turns out is working on another murder just some random murder across the city out in the sunset although glitsky naturally thinks maybe it isnt really random he thinks ros got something to do with this one too and he had bracco ask for the meet today to get ros alibi for the time of the murder this other murder you mean yes and i know its bizarre so whats the possible connection to ro youll love this you remember that difficult jury foreman at ros trial michael durbin suddenly she snapped her fingers thats who it was she said her eyes flashing who this guy outside the courtroom last week who wouldnt give me the time of day it was durbin i knew id seen him before at ros arraignment why was he there i have no idea she shook her head so what are you saying somebody killed him no somebody killed his wife and then burned down the house around her marrenas took in a quick breath and let it out in a rush thats not very nice no but the point is that the police apparently somehow think by some tortuous logic that ro had something to do with it in fact its so obscure that i cant believe anyone really thinks it but it seems like its going to be the next point of attack on ro and this in spite of the fact as ro told bracco this morning and theresa and i backed him up because it was true that he was sleeping at home at the time that this murder occurred lowering his voice cliff went on and heres the thing sheila he was sleeping in his room this was last friday i remember distinctly and so does theresa he came down and had breakfast with us at around nine or nine thirty and i promise you on my word of honor that he hadnt been out killing some woman in the sunset an hour before and then setting her house on fire that just didnt happen sheila picked up his thread but the cops still came to question him right and you want to hear another one that da investigator who got shot yesterday out in the fillmore yes evidently that was ro too if you ask bracco or glitsky marrenas nodded admiringly wow ros been busy hasnt he isnt this just totally outrageous in fact he had lunch yesterday with tristan denardi at tadichs the two of them talking about their legal strategy then he and ez went to the planetarium together they did not stop and kill a da investigator on the way he let out a deep sigh this is long past amusing i must tell you marrenas got up stretched her back showing off the merchandise and walked across her office when she turned around she asked so what do you want to do cliff came forward to the last few inches of the couchs seat well the story itself the cops suspecting ro for every murder committed since hes gotten out of jail thats got to get out but more particularly theres got to be another story around this durbin murder and one that doesnt have squat all to do with ro since its absolutely definite that he didnt kill her or anybody else now weve got public opinion largely on our side i think especially after your last couple of brilliant articles on police brutality it would be interesting to illustrate how badly the police can get off course when theyve got a preconceived idea and theyre out to get an innocent man do you think you could do some looking around and write that story with my eyes closed sir with my eyes closed are you and mommy mad at each other rachel asked they had parked at the airport in the hourly lot and now they were walking out to the terminal treya had wanted abe to just drop them off at the curb by the departures lane but he had overruled her and said he wanted to be with them all for as long as he could to which treyas response had been silence and which in turn led to rachels question the two of them father and daughter were about fifteen feet behind treya and zachary lagging on purpose glitskys daughter was holding his hand with one of hers pulling her small pink rolling suitcase with the other one her monkey doll alice rode on rachels back its hands velcrod together under her chin glitsky said no were having a disagreement thats all but youre not mad at her i said no i know but i think shes mad at you she might be at that why because im not going with you why arent you isnt this a vacation mommy said it was like a vacation i know but like a vacation isnt the same as a vacation if it was a real vacation id be going but why cant you go on this one see if you can guess she looked up and over at him youll get mad i wont i promise okay then work correct its always work now you do sound like your mother but do you have to work this time if i didnt think i did dont you think id be going with you i dont know probably no definitely and you know why because i love you i love all of you even mommy especially mommy at this moment treya and zachary got to the escalator leading up to the security checkpoint and treya turned around yelling back to them cmon you two cant you try a little harder to keep up rachel again looked up at her father i dont care what she says shes mad i think youre right glitsky whispered then they were where the line for security began in glitskys arms zachary wore the modified bicycle helmet hed been living with for over a year now the four of them had already done the sandwich hug with rachel holding on to both abes and treyas legs now glitsky lowered zachary down next to rachel and told them to hold hands and stay together and guard the luggage for just one minute while he and their mother said a little private goodbye glitsky took treyas hand and after only a slight hesitation she moved off with him a few steps away he put his arm over her shoulder and drew her around into him for a moment she simply stood there arms at her side but then he felt and heard her sigh and she came full around in front of him and brought her arms up against his back pulling her head away she stretched up and kissed him i love you she said i love you too im sorry about she brought a hand around and put it up against his lips shut up okay im sorry too this is just what ive got to do i get it and you do what youve got to do right those are the rules for the record im going to be fine and careful she put some work into a smile okay sure you will you take care of our guys i will and we talk every day deal deal and youre all coming back theres no question of that really none she stretched up and kissed him again ive got to go i love you me too after another fleeting half smile she turned toward the children and glitsky waved goodbye to them he heard them say goodbye and tried to get out a word or some facsimile of a smile but it was no use so he waved goodbye one last time then turned and started walking back toward the parking lot when glitsky got in from the airport bracco had been sitting out in the detail waiting for him after glitsky had listened to the tape the two men had discussed it for a while and then had decided to bring it to wes farrell and let him make whatever decision he wanted about it now farrells and glitskys footfalls bounced off the walls as they walked side by side down the internal corridor that ran behind the courtrooms on the second floor they were both exhausted and neither had the will nor the strength to try to make conversation it was near to the end of the business day and most of the courtrooms to their right were empty on the left were the doors to various judges chambers the corridor itself echoed with the desultory conversation of a couple of shackled groups of defendants in orange jumpsuits and bailiffs who were waiting at the other end of the hall for the elevators that would take them up and then across to the jail behind the building farrell and glitsky stopped in front of a closed door with an etched panel on the wall next to it that read the honor able leo chomorro farrell gave glitsky a hopeful shrug and hesitated one more second they heard some continued muted conversation behind the door and then farrell reached out and knocked he had of course called to make the appointment and so they were expected behind the door a chair scraped on a hardwood floor and then they were both shaking hands with judge chomorro still in his robes whose strong hispanic presence filled most of the doorway standing a few steps behind him in a business suit hands clasped easily in front of him was judge sam baretto there in chomorros chambers for god knew what reason and who stepped forward to greet farrell and glitsky and then excused himself and walked out into the hallway closing the door behind him after these somewhat stilted salutations chomorro invited farrell and glitsky to sit around the cherry table that he apparently used as his working desk the table had a computer on one end and took up a good portion of the middle of the room which was about as plain a judges chambers as glitsky had ever seen aside from chomorros diplomas and awards and four or five photographs with politicians two of the four walls were bare another wall contained law books a set of golf clubs resided in one corner otherwise the room was basically empty except for the table the chairs and a love seat after they were all seated chomorro cleared his throat well here we are mr farrell at your request what can i do for you your honor i realize that this is something about which youve already ruled yesterday but weve got new evidence so ill try to keep it short and sweet this morning inspector bracco of homicide conducted an interview with ro curtlee with whom i know youre familiar chomorros visage had gone dark but he said all right go ahead lieutenant glitsky and i have listened to the tape of this interview and we both believe that it is incriminating on its face and now wed like to play it for you to what end chomorro asked to once again ask you to sign off on a search warrant at the curtlee home chomorros mouth went tight no one here kidded themselves that this was a small or casual request the ro curtlee story was already as high profile as they came chomorro knew that if he reversed his decision about letting a search proceed at ros house it would be headline news to say nothing of what the curtlees themselves might try to do to scuttle his career of course justice was blind and all that but in fact it was simple prudence not to needlessly antagonize powerful people yesterday chomorro had turned down the chief of police not so much because she did not have probable cause which was the standard albeit a flexible and subjective one but because given the curtlees the actual standard in the real world was very probable cause and he would forget that only at his own peril chomorro dragged in a lungful of air and let it out all right lets hear what youve got he said farrell turned his head said abe and glitsky placed the recorder on the table between them the voices glitsky explained are inspector bracco ro curtlee and his lawyer mr denardi youll also hear the curtlees cliff and theresa a time or two but dont worry about them he pressed the play button and braccos introduction came out of the speaker then ro curtlees voice i woke up late about nine fifteen in the house here i went down and said hello to my parents who were just finishing breakfast and then had some breakfast of my ownserved by our lovely linda well corroborate that both of us would you like to know what we ate too thats cliff curtlee glitsky explained i can follow it chomorro said impatiently nevertheless glitsky said now bracco that wont be necessary and after breakfast glitsky ro i showered and put on some clothes and at about eleven i was at my doctors where he checked the cast on my arm hows that want to go later they fastforwarded to the critical part of the conversation hey though now that were talking hows the food at tadichs lately good as ever the hell with this this is never gonna end unless we do something about it ill tell you what inspector ill take a fucking lie detector test we got to put an end to this howd you like that ro no tristan this is just bulls hit the same shit they been laying on us since all this began i didnt shoot anybody yesterday or any other day i finished lunch and me and ez went to the planetarium ro shut up thats enough what im supposed to just take this he just accused me again dont talk damn it dont say another word this interview is over right now what are you going to take a lie detector about ro i never mentioned anybody getting shot dont answer that he already did this is absurd he didnt admit a goddamn thing oh okay then hes got nothing to worry about i got nothing to worry about anyway dickhead ro enough get out of here inspector sure im gone nice chatting with you all glitsky reached out and switched off the recorder chomorro cocked his head to one side curiosity writ large on his features thats it he asked falls a little short of a confession dont you think glitsky spoke in measured tones he didnt want to appear to be hardselling it if it was supposed to be selfexplanatory bracco never mentioned what he was talking about your honor he said and ro went right to the killing yesterday of matt lewis it couldnt have been more obvious actually it could have been a lot more obvious lieutenant this man ro curtlee knows that you both are pulling out all the stops to get him back in jail in spite of the rulings of two of my colleagues so your inspector alludes to his whereabouts yesterday afternoon and ro assumes correctly i might add that he is now a suspect in another murder that happened at that time do you really think its that odd that he could predict which murder that was its been all over the news it would have been more surprising if he hadnt known your honor farrell said this man shot one of my investigators allegedly shot mr farrell as i tried to explain to chief lapeer yesterday the allegedly goes away after you get a conviction your honorfarrell didnt give inwith respect its a fact my guy was following him look at whats happened since ro got out of jail hes but chomorro heating up a bit himself held up a finger while were on that i got the impression from the first part of that tape we just listened to that ro was under suspicion for yet another homicide and giving his alibi for that isnt that true lieutenant yes on what evidence in that case the connection your honor she was the wife of his jury foreman her murder and the burning of her body was the same mo not only as the killing ro got convicted on but as his first victim after he got out felicia nunez another alleged victim im afraid is she not glitsky couldnt keep the reproach out of his voice shes a real enough victim your honor shes just as dead as can be as is janice durbin and yet chomorro said on the tape ro gives a completely plausible alibi for the time of the durbin murder does he not and his father backs him up what do you say to that so is he no longer a suspect there plausible doesnt mean true your honor glitsky replied it does if it gets enough corroboration his parents and their employees what do you expect theyre going to say hes lying theyre all lying maybe maybe not chomorro all but collapsed back into his seat he took a slow breath then came back to glitsky then over to farrell gentlemen he said in a conciliatory tone i understand your predicament i even empathize with you i know you believe that this man is a danger to the community and quite possibly even probably you are right if he had said to your inspector yeah i killed that inspector what are you going to do about it youd have your warrant signed by me before you turned off the tape but what you have isnt enough not nearly enough your honor farrell began but chomorro cut him off again with a raised finger please so the bottom line is weve got to do it by the book thats the only way it works and both of you know that we start arresting people and searching houses without probable cause we all might as well close up shop because were no longer working under the rule of law and the rule of law is what we do here do we not so my answer and im afraid its a final answer is no well farrell said thanks anyway for your time your honor if you get anything truly substantial chomorro replied anything that rises to the level of probable cause ill be happy to revisit this anytime im just saying what youve got now isnt enough i thought it was worth a try glitsky said it couldnt hurt chomorro stood up announcing that the meeting was over he shepherded them over to the door making small talk and just as they were about to go out he said you know this kind of thing is more or less what a grand jury is all about make your case to them and they might indict yes your honor farrell said thank you that was and remains our plan b you still might need more than youve shown me the judge said were working on that glitsky said but were also thinking farrell went on about attaching the first murder the one he got convicted on with these latest which makes it multiple murder which makes it a special circumstances case but as i say its going to take a couple of weeks to put the thing together maybe longer than that chomorro hung by the door holding it open perhaps not completely willing to be sending them away with so little result or even encouragement i know this seems to have gotten personal to both of you but if this guy did any or all of this hes got to have slipped up somewhere and if he did im sure youll find out where thats what we keep hoping farrell said but its already not soon enough glitsky added though his office entitled him to farrell found that he didnt want to use a driver all the time for the daytime events that made up such a disproportionately large segment of the jobwhen he was going out and speaking before civic groups or doing lunch fundraisershe was happy for the company and sometimes protection afforded by the rotating police inspectors who ferried him around in one of the citys few lincoln town cars most days though he found that he preferred to drive in on his own park in his designated spot behind the hall of justice and drive home this morning though between the sleepless night hed experienced along with the actual fears for his physical safety he called in and had the car come pick him up at home now coming out of the hall in the dark at quarter to six he was extremely grateful for the perk dragging with fatigue gert on her leash alongside him he let her pull him by the coroners office on the right and then the jail on the left and over to where the car sat waiting his most regular driver with whom he got along very well was sergeant ritz naygrow tonight ritz was still on duty behind the wheel undoubtedly working it for the overtime and by the time farrell got to the car he had come around and opened the door for them gert immediately jumped into the backseat and settled down and wes climbed in behind her ritz closed their door and then went around and got himself arranged behind the wheel but though he put the car into gear he didnt take off driving right away so where are we off to on the peoples business tonight sir he asked farrell had already closed his eyes and slumped back in his seat now with what felt like herculean effort he opened them i hope the chinese merchants if my calendar isnt wrong which it might be treyas gone on vacation with no warning and she keeps my book and i thought my back too or did ritz looked back at him you didnt know she had a vacation coming howd that happen she didnt know it either shes glitsky wife you know that sure it took him a second then he half turned in his seat oh the threat ro curtlee she took it pretty seriously i would too well weve got people on him around the clock now hope that slows him down some he is one bad motherfucker still i wish treya hadnt gone off i dont know what im going to do without her you want ritz said ill swing by ros place while youre talking to the chinese merchants tonight and shoot him dead then you can say i was with you the whole time and were good and then you can call treya and tell her she can come back the coast is clear okay farrell said lets do that thats a good idea long as we got a plan ritz said so where are we going the mandarin oriental i think at least itll be good food dont kid yourself ritz it might start out good but by the time it gets to my plate lets just say they dont call it the rubber chicken circuit for nothing now im going to close my eyes the mandarins like five minutes away sir thats a short nap its five minutes more sleep than ive had since yesterday after another few seconds farrell opened his eyes and said are we going one other thing if you dont mind sure what if you could let dispatch know if youre going to be bringing your dog along to work when you want the car the thing is im pretty allergic to gert to pretty much all dogs sir cats too pollen you name it im sorry about that ritz i didnt know so what you wouldnt take the gig on those days ritz shrugged other guys could cover just to let you know okay farrell said ill try to call and let somebody know if i can remember when im bringing gert down is that likely to be often you think just so i can plan i dont know ritz sometimes i guess i dont really know he paused slumped down farther with his hand over his eyes my girlfriend left me too he said last night ritz spun his head to look at him are you shittin me sam sam man first treya then sam actually the other order sam then treya but yeah then you if you want to count people leaving me for one reason or another its not like i wouldnt stay if you really wanted me its all right you do what you have to do ritz took a beat man you are having some bad week here i know farrell said i feel like a haitian with a prius abe glitskys father nat was rinsing what few dishes theyd used tonight in the kitchen of the small duplex he shared with sadie silverman on third avenue just off clement street the kitchen was in the back of the flat and although its dimensions were only about tenbyeight feet they used it for a dining room as well sitting while they ate on their spindly wooden chairs and eating off one of sadies dainty occasional tables from her old house nat wasnt exactly robust anymore but then again at eightythree he wasnt in the ground either so there really wasnt much to complain about his weight was down from his lifetime high of to about pounds and most disturbing hed lost an inch and a half of his original five foot tenwhere had that gonebut he still had all of his hair now wispy and white but still there thank you very much at the table sipping at the thimbleful of port shed poured herself sadie turned the page of her book sighed and closed it i dont get all these vampires she said this is my third try on one of these books and i just cant get myself to believe them maybe thats because there are no vampires in real life but there are no star wars in real life and i love those or hobbits or time travel either nat turned around at the sink when did there stop being time travel stop nat turned back to the dishes ran a sponge over a plate if i didnt believe the first two books i read he said i wouldnt have gone to the third thats because youre so impatient i like to give things a chance good now i know what ill get you for valentines day number four and i am not impatient my patience is legendary sadie sighed again but everybodys reading these not me thats because all you read is the torah thats all i need you might even like it more than vampires besides you read it enough and you know all the good parts by heart and then you can carry it around inside you and david begat solomon and solomon begat hey you dont have to believe in that stuff but i do i believe david begat solomon maybe but that whole moses and the parting of the red sea thing nat turned around drying his hands miracles sadie they happen every day you and me for example she couldnt help but smile pointing a finger up at him thats cheating and you know it bringing it around to us we just got lucky luck schmuck were a miracle and you know it all right im not going to fight you about it youd better not you might be smitten for ingratitude smitten theres a word he stepped over and kissed the top of her head im going to cut a piece of honey cake you want a bite small she said and the doorbell rang your fathers right abraham you dont look too good are you eating sure abe admitted like when when what when did you last eat im eating now this fine homemade honey cake or sleep his father asked in the tiny kitchen on his dainty chair next to the two older people abe could have been a giant how bout we leave off with the third degree he swallowed his bite of cake sipped from his cup of tea are you following this ro curtlee thing at all some trouble when you arrested him his father said i read the paper i arrested him for threatening the kids they gave him bail and let him out again and treya decided she couldnt she had to get the kids out of here to where sadie asked la her brothers place nats bite of cake stopped halfway to his mouth youre saying shes gone abe nodded this afternoon whyd they let him out sadie asked theyre insane they dont live in the real world vampires nat said not exactly pops but close enough anyway as you can see i stayed is she mad at you sadie asked the corner of abes mouth went up a quarter inch i want to say she understands but im not sure whats not to understand nat asked me staying why my job is more important than my kids or maybe evenshe thinksmy life he twirled his eggshellthin china cup of tea in its saucer the thing is she left her job she thinks i should have left mine she quit her job sadie asked shes taking vacation days but its going to amount to the same thing so what are you going to do i dont know abe said not to complain but the jobs just one frustration after another i dont have enough manpower to do it if i go down to la with treya somebody else will just step in and muddle through or more likely muck it all up which is what it feels like im doing anyway but i feel like ive got to stay theres no other way to explain it i took it on i cant hand it off to somebody else it sounds stupid and outdated but i feel like its kind of my duty nat took a moment then said i dont hear any question there no i know abe said there really isnt one tristan denardis first meeting this morning was with his private investigator mike moylan who got himself settled into one of denardis wing chairs and said i cant find her denardi signing papers at his desk stopped and looked up in surprise what do you mean you always find everybody and usually within five minutes i know but not this time she just dropped off the radar but youve told me that was impossible very hard but not impossible first youve got to use cash only no credit cards ever second you get a false set of identity papers and third you cut all ties with your previous life you do all that and remember that most people cant and youre disappeared denardi sat back gloria gonzalvez was that sophisticated evidently although it doesnt take so much sophistication as it does pure will anybody wants they can go cash only and fifty bucks maybe a hundred buys you all the id youll ever need but most people somebody dies in the family or gets married or has a kid either somebody contacts you or you hear about it and need to get back in touch and gloria hasnt done that not that i could find anyway pensive denardi put his pen down and sat back in his chair could she still be in witness protection i dont think so they usually only keep them until they testify then theyre on their own so what did she do after she testified you get any kind of a trail at all no she just vanished somebody must have coached her this will not please my client im sorry sir i can keep working on it if you want but if she hasnt turned up on any of my databases i dont know where id start did you try thatwhat do you call itthe pizza list moylan had fascinated denardi with the socalled pizza list soon after hed found out about it himself as everyone whos ever ordered a pizza by phone knows the first thing they ask for is your phone number second is your name this databasemost if not all of the pizza stores in the nationis then sold to various marketing organizations or otherwise interested persons such as private investigators it is a very potent tool for locating people but moylan was shaking his head no why not expense mostly you gave me four hours besides which i dont think shes gloria gonzalvez anymore how about just gloria how about it probably so you look for glorias tris theres probably forty fifty pages of glorias single spaced once i can even find them you want me to call each one individually maybe if you just start with california moylan chuckled yeah thatll narrow it right down to maybe two thousand names if i call em all were talking maybe a full week maybe two eighty hours and then maybe no results at all which dont get me wrong id be delighted to do but youd want to know what youre signing off on denardi sucked at his teeth for a moment my clients really want to talk to her mike shes the last witness standing and they think they can persuade her that she doesnt want to testify again and i wish them luck but you know moylan went on if shes this invisible i doubt if the das going to be able to find her either thats a good point but if they do find her first theyll slap her back into protection and then were screwed id rather we get there before they do so you want me to keep on denardi nodded give it a week see what you come up with sheila marrenas walked into the front door of michael durbins store and stood in line to all appearances patiently waiting her turn when she got to the counter she took off her dark glasses smiled at michael flashed her press card and asked if she could have a few minutes of his time his face went pale at the sight of her i dont think so no you dont want to get your side of the story out there my side of what story your wifes death i understand youve been talking to inspector glitsky how did you know that she shrugged it doesnt really matter how i know michael i talk to people they talk to me im giving you an opportunity here that youre going to need and i really do think its in your own best interest at least to address some of the issues im hearing about why so you can treat me as fairly as you did last time i gave you every chance back then to defend yourself and you made the same mistake then that youre trying to make again now and whats that defending myself against accusations that have not one grain of truth in them youre telling me you never stole anything from that job paper supplies anything like that you never filed a false timesheet im still not going to talk about that god knows that whatever i did and it wasnt much was part of the culture of the firm everybody there was doing what they accused me of and everybody would include you wouldnt it whether or not it does ive already paid enough for it whatever it was you know everything you ask is of the whendidyoustopbeatingyourwife variety every answers the wrong one all right then she said getting down to it when did you durbin lowered his voice and leaned in toward her you get the hell out of here right now from somewhere down the counter suddenly liza sato appeared at durbins sleeve is there a problem she asked michael is everything all right not even close he said as of this minute were refusing to give service to this woman i want her out of here but sheila marrenas spotting the name tag on lizas chest wasnt going without a fight now she shifted her attention to the assistant manager ms sato she said is it true that mr durbin arrived late to work last friday morning dont answer that liza whatever you say shell twist it sato shook her head at marrenas ive got no comment she said except that my boss wants you out of here she turned to michael should i call nineoneone the four other customers and five other clerks had been trying to ignore the ongoing exchange but suddenly the place had gone quiet durbin looked back and forth along the counter then nodded to his assistant give her ten seconds he said all right marrenas said backing away but dont blame me if your side of things doesnt get in my column im trying here youre trying to sandbag me is what youre doing youve got about two more seconds and then liza calls the police its your funeral marrenas said you brought it on yourself and turning she walked out of the shop no bracco sat with his feet up on his desk in the homicide detail that isnt quite true i said the investigation is continuing beyond that i have no comment but marrenas countered you interviewed ro yesterday at his lawyers in connection with these murders all right and you contend that this isnt part of the pattern of harassment weve seen against ro curtlee over the past weeks absolutely not theres been no harassment of ro curtlee or anybody else so youve been looking at someone else besides ro as a suspect were looking at the whole world maam including michael durbin bracco paused we have found no evidence linking mr durbin with the crime but you have no evidence on ro either ive already said everything i have to say on that issue why did you feel the need to interview him then to give him the chance to eliminate himself as a suspect and did he do that well as you know he provided an alibi for the time of janice durbins death so that eliminates him right unless the alibi doesnt hold up bracco brought his feet down off the desk listen sheila im sorry but im going to have to cut this short the investigations are continuing thats about as much as i can give you the matt lewis investigation too im not the investigating officer on that case bracco replied but you also asked where ro was when that crime was committed a cop gets killed we throw a wide net and again with no evidence against ro both investigations are continuing bracco said we have not eliminated anyone as a suspect no sooner had he hung up with marrenas though than bracco realized that what hed told her was trueglitsky hadnt eliminated any suspects in the janice durbin murder glitsky and becker might be percent certain that ro curtlee was guilty ofof killing herand ro sure as hell looked guilty to bracco of the matt lewis murderbut the plain fact remained that ro had given bracco an alibi for durbins time of death and four people who could corroborate it granted by no stretch could this corroborationhis parents eztli and the maid or morning cook lindabe deemed unimpeachable but what if they were all telling the truth and if ro in fact had not been at the durbin homeand no physical or other evidence placed him therethat meant that someone else had killed janice earth to bracco come in darrel he looked up startled to see glitsky hovering over his desk abe hey in his chair he straightened to attention ive got to learn that trick glitsky said sleeping with my eyes open i wasnt sleeping i was thinking good thinking is one of the approved activities what about well sheila marrenas called me i just now got off the phone with her i hope you didnt tell her too much i said that our two investigations are continuing durbin and lewis we didnt have suspects for either she believe you she didnt care shes going to write what she writes anyway whatever that spin might turn out to be so what were you thinking about well since thats what i went out there to find out it looks like ros got an alibi for durbin if you believe it hes got four people he says will back it up glitsky said the parents and two servants true im not arguing with you abe im just saying no its a good point glitsky conceded he had lowered his haunch onto the corner of braccos desk his eyes had gone to a half squint his mouth was tightly closed and a muscle worked in his jaw ill keep it in mind and bracco hesitated while were talking one other thing whats that ros arm what about it its in a cast still righteously broken in the fight with you was it not all right all right so you told me that janice durbin was strangled didnt you manual strangulation not a ligature ligature was a strangulation device such as a rope or a belt bracco stopped and leveled his gaze at his boss waiting for the impact of his words to kick in he didnt have to draw the picture any more clearly every homicide cop knows how extraordinarily difficult it is to strangle someone to death even under the best of conditions using both of ones hands the struggle tends to be violent and protracted the idea that someone could do it onehanded while probably physically possible for a very strong and committed person was close to farfetched when he was sure from his lieutenants change of expression that glitsky had understood his point bracco went on pressing it did strout find any signs shed been knocked out before she got strangled lacerations or abrasions or bruises to the head id have to check to be sure and i intend to but my memory says no bracco leaned back in his chair so ro is holding her down with his knees he said and shes bucking and kicking under him and he never hits her to knock her outi mean hes got a heavy cast on right and instead hes got her by the neck and strangles her with one hand this when we know hes in possession of a gun because thats what he killed lewis with and he doesnt use that shaken more deeply by braccos objections to ro as janices killer than he cared to show glitsky walked down to the third floor where he would sometimes drop in on treya in the middle of the workday just to say hello share a few bons mots touch base today he made it as far as the hallway that led to the das office and nearly stopped at the outer door to farrells lairtreyas officenoticing that her desk was still unoccupiedno replacement yet anyway standing in the outer doorway he heard farrells voice emanating from inside in a few steps he passed treyas workstation and stood in the open doorway where he saw farrell sitting on one of the couches a telephone to his ear no i have no comment he was saying no sorry no comment im afraid im not going to talk about that glitsky knocked once on the doorjamb farrell looked up and indicating the telephone shook his head in disgust and then waved glitsky in and motioned him to one of the chairs while he continued listening and then said im sure but well just have to see how that turns out well no i mean yes of course youre going to do what you have to do but the same is true of me i know and im sorry about that but ive got an appointment thats just showed up here and i cant really say any more at this time all right all right thank you farrell hung up flipped the bird at the telephone then looked at glitsky who had not yet sat down and said some son of a bitch leaked the grand jury that if you didnt guess he added gesturing at the phone was marrenas shes getting around today glitsky said twenty minutes ago she was talking to darrel bracco but not about the grand jury well then she must have talked to somebody in between because what you heard just now was all grand jury all the time she even had the strategy of combining the cases so wed get to specials and beat the bail problem glitsky walked over to farrells library table knocked the wood on the top of it a couple of times thinking then turned around it couldnt be chomorro i wouldnt pick him as capable of doing that he couldnt give us our warrant but i got the impression he was on our side farrell nodding in agreement said but remember who was in his office when we got there just having a nice little chat baretto thats the magic word you win a hundred dollars you think he called her marrenas yes but it doesnt matter who called who theres a lot of candidates someone in the clerks office a bailiff a court reporter the point is shes got it and shes going to print it which means ro and denardi will know if they dont already by now well so they know so what it wasnt the original plan but it shouldnt make any real difference no not really i dont see how it could anyway how about if ro gets to one of the grand jurors first or to amanda or even to me glitsky leaned back against the table pensive frowning he scanned the room settled back on farrell you could call marrenas back and tell her she got it wrong whoever told her they got it wrong youve thought about it since you hung up and she really needs to know youre not going to the grand jury period the strategy of combining all the cases is flawed theres not enough evidence it just couldnt work youre waiting until ros retrial and then what then you go to the grand jury anyway youre saying i lie no god forbid you just changed your mind again after you hang up with her oops sorry you forgot to tell her that part farrell settled back into the couch put a hand to his temple rubbed at it just to spin it out he said so i go to the grand jury and get my indictment and arrest ro whereupon marrenas then tells the whole world that i flatout knowingly lied to her whats that do to my credibility with the fourth estate who cares by then youve got your indictment ros in jail he doesnt kill anybody else in the meantime sounds like a winner to me farrell shook his head i cant lie abe ive got to leave it at no comment its a secret proceeding for christs sake i cant talk about what im doing with it thats the whole point of the damn thing and why so grand jury witnesses dont get threatened or worse by the lowlifes theyre testifying against so i can put on my cases without fear of reprisal which let me tell you ive got a shitload of right now i mean true actual fear if i didnt know they had a twentyfourhour tail on ro i think i might be completely paralyzed well on that glitsky said the first shift already lost him ro and eztli were a little high laughing at how easily they had eluded the morethanobvious city vehicle that had been parked on the street since early morning ro had simply lain down on the floor in the backseat while eztli pulled out of the driveway waved to the cops and drove off in the runner on his midafternoon errands three blocks out he had pulled over and ro had gotten back into the passenger seat if it wasnt so funny they agreed it would be pathetic now they were in a warehouse in the industrial area just north of san bruno another peninsula suburb later that night the warehouse was going to be the venue for about six rounds of pit bull fighting that would begin around eight and go on until past midnight but ro had gotten a call from tristan denardi earlier in the day reporting on his private investigators lack of progress locating gloria gonzalvez and ro was quickly losing his patience this woman had to be found and neutralized or he was going to go back to prison and if denardi wasnt going to be able to find her ro had to make it his own business so hed discussed the problem with ez and as usual the man had a sound workable idea of how to get some results eztli had long ago developed a relationship with lupe garcia who not only ran the dogfights but was the goto guy in the bay area guatemalan community if you wanted to borrow money or bet on almost anything or buy a weapon or drugs or get a woman to be your maid or your sex slave or both when ro and eztli caught up with him escorted by two of his bodyguards lupe was in the inner shell of the warehouse a huge prefabricated sheetmetal space very much like the inside of a circus tent complete with bleachers surrounding the ring fourteen feet in diameter where the fighting took place lupe was hosing down the carpeting that the dogs needed for traction cleaning it from the previous nights fights he could have farmed out this workcertainly it was far beneath his stationbut he liked to get down on the floor with the smells and the damp and the blood ez and ro and the bodyguards waited while he finished up turning off the hose drying his hands on a towel and coming over to them a warm smile of greeting on his face lupe wasnt a big man perhaps five foot eight and wiry he wore long hair pulled back and blue jeans and cowboy boots and a canvas jacket over a plaid shirt a heavylooking silver cross hung off his left earlobe tattoos covered the backs of his hands and disappeared into his shirtsleeves he and eztli greeted each other with clasped hands and onearmed hugs they spoke in spanish of course lupe reminded ro of any number of la eme gang members from prison they hadnt been particularly interactive with the caucasian population but none of that seemed to be in play here as eztli explained both ros presence and the nature of their business lupe glanced over from time to time with an expression that indicated acceptance from his attitude alone ro had obviously been in prison and he was putting up not only the upfront thousand dollars to lupe for his troublebeaming as eztli gave him the envelopebut the other five thousand to the person or persons who gave him the whereabouts of the woman who ten years before had been gloria gonzalvez one of the two key witnesses in ros trial back in their car on the surface streets back toward the freeway eztli drew deeply on the joint and said i like lupe but ive got to believe we were smart not to be carrying the other five thousand with us you saw his reaction to that kind of reward i get the feeling if we had given it to him ro said he would have thought about keeping it not just thought about it eztlis shoulders heaved a bit with his low rumbling laughter hes probably trying to figure out how to get his hands on it right now but thats not our worry hell have an army of guys working the problem by tomorrow how long did he think it would be hed be surprised if it was more than a week word gets out thats a lot of money for these guys its a day or two of denardi ro said nothing well there you go eztli took another long hit and let out the smoke different worlds when hed been in private practice farrell had availed himself of the superb gatekeeping services of his firms indomitable phyllis for the past half dozen years hed never picked up a phone in his office without a very clear understanding of who was on the other end since hed come on as da treya had performed the same function in the short time shed been gone the phones had become one of farrells more constant problems he really had to get another person sitting out there at the reception desk but in spite of his warning to treya that he couldnt guarantee her job when she got back what he wanted was to have her out there again as soon as she felt it was safe and he really didnt want to promote someone on a temporary basis to cover his phones and to some extent share his secrets mostly because once they were in they might make a stink and try to fight to stay and piss around with the union when treya reappeared but also because he was starting to get some appreciation of the value of trust and he trusted treya the person he chose to sit in for treya might very well turn out to be a spy of some kind for his political enemies or at least able to be turned farrell didnt want to risk it but now the phone was ringing on the table in his office and he didnt know who it was and he really couldnt justify not picking it up and so sighing that is what he did das office he said this is wes farrell mr farrellan unmistakable voiceive heard some very disturbing news this is cliff curtlee mr curtlee how are you well not too goddamned well if you want to know the truth i thought we had some kind of an understanding you and i in what way in the way that you were going to cut out all this bullshit surrounding my boy i thought it got all worked out pretty well at that charade of a hearing last week ros back out on bail when i know goddamn well you could have gone in and told the judge no way so given that bail got granted i thought weyou and mewe were still working within the bounds of our understanding that you had to do what you had to do politically but that basically ro stays out of jail until the retrial wasnt that it i know it was well not exactly yeah but close enough now its unconscionable what that madman glitsky put my boy through when he arrested him but even then okay hed had his shot and it didnt work and i thought with you riding just a little bit of herd on him that would be the end of it until we got back to the retrial whenever that turned out to be and then next thing i know my lawyer and theresa and i are sitting with ro through another interrogation that was a police decision sir not mine all right all right im not going to split hairs with you on that but what i am concerned about and the reason i called you directly is one of my reporters here told me that youre planning on using some kind of fancy legal strategy to go to the grand jury and get my boy behind bars again i cant comment on that sir grand jury proceedings are confidential so youre not going to confirm to me that youre planning on taking a case to the grand jury and yanking ro back into jail im neither going to confirm or deny it im not going to comment well youll understand if that makes me feel just a little bit as if youre going to go ahead and do it its no comment sir either way i cant undermine the foundation of how the grand jury works my reporter had it on very good authority curtlee said well whoever told her has a big mouth you want to tell me who that was even if i did know and i dont i couldnt reveal my reporters source you know that well then farrell said i guess weve both got our secrets a silence hung on the line then i want to make something very clear to you farrell you and i had a deal about my son not going back to jail not saying we did sir but if we did that was before he started killing people oh make some sense farrell you believe that the evidence inclines that way fuck theres no evidence or glitsky would have his ass in chains already so dont give me evidence so heres what im saying to you i dont want this grand jury thing to move forward it would be a bad thing for you personally if it did are you threatening me cliff cause weve done some very recent research into the legal penalties for making threats to officers of the court now youre threatening me all im saying is youll be happier if this grand jury thing stops right now assuming its going on of course and if its not then theres nothing either of us has to worry about eztli and ro were stationed at the bar at momos a popular eatery where theyd just had lunch across the street from where the giants played ball eztli didnt drink much but here in the early afternoon ro had already put away four shots of jack daniels and a couple of draft beers along with sharing two joints of eztlis very good marijuana still the younger man seemed little the worse for wear ro was chatting up one of the cocktail waitresses named tiffany a freshfaced young tawnyhaired woman with a terrific smile and an aggressive bosom no its absolutely true he was saying i was away for nine years no way she looked past him at eztli is this the truth yes maam he said and finally released on appeal oh my god she said i mean its cool and all that they finally let you out but nine years how could you have stood that i just kept telling everybody whod listen that i was innocent ro said i guess i just never lost faith that this is maybe the one country in the world where if youre truly not guilty you can finally get to some kind of justice sometimes it takes a while but ive got to believe that the system really does work tiffany touched the back of his hand resting there on the bar with a welllacquered perfect fingernail well you are way more together around it than i think i could ever be if it were me all id think about was how much of my life id lost id be just so incredibly bitter i think thats one way i could be i suppose but really think about what a waste that would be i mean look at me now sitting in a terrific restaurant in the worlds greatest city young and healthy having a conversation with a beautiful woman oh now ro held up his good hand it aint braggin if its the truth dear i hope im not being too forward just stating an obvious fact and my real point is i dont want to spend one day of my life looking back in regret all that other stuff is behind me id rather be looking forward with hope and life is so good right now my goal is to work like the devil to keep it that way forever are you allowed to drink if youre still on your shift can i buy you one she tossed her hair and favored him with a megawatt smile im sorry i cant again she brushed the back of his hand with her fingers back in a second she said ive got to run check my tables after shed moved off ro turned to eztli you were right i thought if i mentioned prison shed run like the wind he shrugged some do most dont depends on how you play it if things work out from here ro said ill just get a cab home from her place or stay there and catch up with you tomorrow cool whatever the cell phone chirped at his belt and eztli picked it up read the screen and said your dad hes living with a woman named sam duncan cliff said she runs the rape crisis counseling center out on haight street youve got to be kidding me eztli said given everything that is just too perfect i know it is you couldnt have made it up any better but it doesnt really matter what she does the point is that sheila has talked to some of her sources at the hall of justice and she tells me that farrells going ahead with some more legal shenanigans now with the grand jury that he thinks will wind up getting ro back in jail and without any possibility of bail how many times can they keep putting us through this evidently as often as they want so how would you like me to handle it well the idea is that we want to get the message to farrell but we dont want anything that he can point to as even a remote personal threat the way glitsky did the way theyre all charged up down there at the hall sheila says one of them stubs their toe theyre going to try to connect it to ro and get him back downtown i think what weve got to do is make farrell see that its in his best interest to just back the fuck off give up on the grand jury nonsense use his brain and you think this woman is how we get to him i dont think we want to have her be hurt ez i dont think that would accomplish anything other than get em all more rabid down there but im thinking maybe some damage at the place she works nothing serious but so that farrell cant help but get the message ill leave it to your discretion and whats the time frame whatevers comfortable for you do what you do get your plan together next couple or three days maybe but its flexible glitsky was talking to bob grassilli in missing persons outside bobs window the day had grown blustery again and inside the small office the whistle of the wind reverberated with an insistent regularity grassilli was a career desk cop in his midforties balding and a good forty pounds over his ideal fighting trim he smiled easily under his reddish brush of a mustache i dont even know if this is where id look abe eight or nine years is a pretty cold trail youve tried all the usual databases im assuming glitsky nodded drivers license social immigration you name it ive been on it for a couple of hours already so now im thinking what if she got married and changed her name shed still have her same drivers license number and passport im assuming you say shes legal she came up from guatemala on a work visa that was still in effect when she went into witness protection afterward i dont know did she become a citizen again dont know well if she did therell be a record of that someplace which of course is worthless if she later changed her name but did you ever think maybe she just went back home shes a crime victim here right maybe she just doesnt want to be here anymore i think thats likely tell you the truth bob but how do i find one particular gonzalvez in guatemala its like locating a smith here well welcome to missing persons grassilli said with his trademark smile if anybody really wants to disappear and stay disappeared its not rocket science unless hey you might consider hiring a private eye theyve got databases they can buy or download that were not allowed to use course theyre not allowed to use them either but out in the private sector no ones checking thats really swell news bob heartening in fact grassilli shrugged showing some teeth under the mustache im just the messenger abe thats the way it is yeah well i dont have enough budget for my own men how am i going to even try to justify hiring a pi id say youre probably not id say youre probably right our town by sheila marrenas the tendency of the san francisco police department to overreact harass and brutalize the citizens of our town has been welldocumented over the years in this column mayor leland crawfords appointment of vi lapeer an african american woman as chief of police raised hopes that these practices would not be tolerated any longer under his administration these hopes were for the most part dashed over the past couple of weeks most notably in the police treatment of ro curtlee the son of this newspapers publishers as readers of this column already know mr curtlee was recently released from prison by the ninth circuit court of appeal then here in the city judge sam baretto ordered mr curtlee freed on bail while awaiting his retrial a decision that did not sit well either with district attorney wes farrell or with the head of homicide lieutenant abe glitsky within days of mr curtlees release glitsky presented a new set of spurious charges against him and in a widely publicized incident arrested him after first beating him seriously enough that he required hospitalization and again a superior court judgeerin donahoeruled that mr curtlee posed no danger to the community she again released him on bail but in our town it doesnt seem as though the regular workings and procedures of the criminal justice system apply once prosecutors and police even contrary to judges rulings have preconceived notions about a persons guilt and this is why yesterday morning mr curtlee again found himself facing yet another bit of gratuitous harassment from the police an interrogationfortunately this one did not turn violentfor the murder last friday of a woman named janice durbin this interrogation in which mr curtlee voluntarily and cooperatively participated unearthed a solid alibi for mr curtlee for the time of the murder beyond that the inspector who conducted the interview darrel bracco told this reporter that there was no evidence implicating mr curtlee in the crime hearing this one might be tempted to ask as this reporter was well then if there is no evidence upon what criteria did you decide to interrogate mr curtlee how could this be viewed as anything but harassment in reply inspector bracco had no comment however police have determined that mrs durbin was in fact a murder victim since someone did kill her and mr curtlee has demonstrated that it could not have been him why are the police still fixated on his possible involvement might not the solution to this mystery as it most always does lie closer to home among mrs durbins intimates a cursory investigation by this reporter has already determined that mrs durbins husband michael durbin for example cannot account for his whereabouts at the time of his wifes death moreover sources at his place of business told this reporter that mr durbin may be romantically involved with another of his employees this is specifically not to accuse mr durbin of any wrongdoing but merely to indicate possibilities in the murder investigation that to date the police seem to be willfully ignoring as glitsky and farrell continue their personal and extralegal vendetta against ro curtlee youve got to sue her chuck novio said her and her newspaper and the curtlees personally this is the most appalling libel ive ever read it was a few minutes after seven am and they were all sitting around the dining room table michael and chuck and the three durbin children kathy and the twins were in the adjoining kitchen making eggs and bacon and toast they would be cremating janice today at eleven oclock and so the kids and chuck were all taking the day off from school durbins second son peter had been the first one up and hence the first to read the article and hed barely gotten through it before he went running up the stairs to wake his father and show it to him but she says shes specifically not accusing me of anything durbin said thats bs pure bs peter said shes saying you did it dad that you killed mom youre not going to let her get away with that are you dad jon asked you dont go after her hard youre basically admitting that shes right the elder son slumped back in his chair with his arms crossed staring out into nothing with a sullen eighteenyearold malevolence i agree with jon mike chuck said youve got to go after her allie the thirteenyearold down the table barely holding back her tears until now had been silent all morning and she finally spoke in a tremulous voice you didnt though did you durbin reached out a hand across the table and covered his daughters with his own no sweetie of course not i loved your mother and i miss her so much me too i already miss her so much and allies tears broke kathyher own eyes bloodshot and teary with grief and lack of sleepswooped in from the kitchen and put her arms around her niece nobody thinks your father did anything wrong at all she said you just dont even have to think about that marrenas thinks it jon said and now maybe half the city and now dads got to deny it plain and simple i dont have to dignify what she wrote by responding to it thats lowering myself to her level and im not going to do it you gotta do it dad youve got to say loud and clear you didnt do it if you didnt michael slapped his palm flat against the table cutting jon off of course i didnt do it goddamn it i hope we havent gotten to that no chuck put in dont be ridiculous then just deny it jon said come right out with it michael was shaking his head his fury building when one of the twins voices came from the kitchen hey theres somebody in a tv van pulling into the driveway damn chuck stood up craning to see out the dining room windows howd anybody know you were staying here somehow i just bet marrenas knows michael said he was getting up too and if she knows the word is out maybe id better go see what they want you know what they want peter said youre right dad i wouldnt tell them anything wrong peter jon said what have we been talking about here hes got to deny it or it sounds like he did it thats why allies crying it sounds like it to her too it would to anybody his voice notching up in volume durbin whirled on his older son what are you saying dont talk like that im just saying and the telephone rang christ what a circus chuck said you want to get that les leslie one of the twins picked it up in the kitchen just a minute she said uncle mike its for you he says its jeff elliot from the chronicle jesus peter said ill get these clowns out front chuck said im not talking to anybody from the chronicle they might get it right dad jon said theres nothing to get i keep telling you so tell him that if thats what it is jon said i wouldnt peter said dont tell em nothing jon wait a minute look at me durbin said what do you mean if thats what it is i dont like your tone or the implication i didnt have anything to do with your mothers death thats what you keep saying so whats that thing marrenas said about you getting it on with somebody at work too whyd she say that if theres nothing there jon kathy snapped stop talking like that right now thats ridiculous yeah sure right the lanky kid suddenly pushed his chair back with an obscenity and stomped out of the room and up the stairs jon durbin called after him son but the sound of steps continued until a door slammed upstairs whats his problem peter asked and durbin just shook his head his hands outstretched in a supplicating gesture uncle mike leslies voice calling from the kitchen again hes still waiting let him wait no tell him i cant talk to him no wait ill tell him dont get roped in dad peter said dont worry i wont christ allie her face wet and blotched turned away from her aunts embrace i dont want this to be happening anymore she sobbed i just want my mommy back i want my mommy eztli was up early that thursday morning too ro had kept up the press on tiffany from momos and by the time eztli had left on his own at around three thirty tiffany had finished her shift and ro had stood her to a couple of cuervo shots withit looked likea whole lot more to come which was all good as far as eztli was concerned the morethanobvious plainclothes cops parked on the street by the curtlees even though theyd lost the trail yesterday looked like they were going to stick around so the longer that ro stayed away from home the more mobility hed have at least until they caught up with him again fortunately and eztli didnt really understand why this should be they werent following him maybe it was because yesterday hed driven off apparently alone and then returned all by himself as well did they think ro was still in the house holed up well whatever it wasnt his problem they werent on his tail and that was the main thing by a little before eight the day clear and chilly hed driven the zhe loved that cardown to haight street and found a parking space diagonally across from the glass storefront that announced the location of the rape crisis counseling center getting out of the car he crossed the street and walked by the front of it a heavylooking woodandmetal park bench was chained and padlocked along the front of the building the center didnt officially open for about another half hour but there was a light on and some movement inside the glass front he thought presented some promising possibilities he could come back later tonight when it was dark and shoot out the window but he wasnt convinced that this would be the kind of unambiguous message that he was trying to deliver to farrell through his girlfriend sam anyone could have a grudge with the policies or personnel of the center and it wouldnt be as clear a signal as cliff curtlee would want to send eztli walked down to the end of the block then crossed the street and came back the other way familiarizing himself with the lay of the land it was typical haight streetalmost exclusively small business storefronts when he got back to his car eztli checked his watch and saw that the center would be opening in another twenty minutes while he was here he might as well wait then he could go in and ask for sam duncan telling her that it was important that wes farrell abandon his plan to bring ro to the grand jury as it had many times before he knew that his simple presence could work magic but then suddenly a black town car turned into the street pulled up and stopped directly in front of the center after a second or two the back door opened and wes farrell himself stepped out followed by the yellow labrador that hed been walking with the other night out in front of his home as eztli watched the two of them went up to the front door of the center farrell knocked and a dark attractive woman opened the door then took the leash after only a few seconds of conversationobviously theyd already discussed leaving the dog and therefore she must be samfarrell walked back to the limo and it drove off eztli sat thinking in the drivers seat of the beemer ideas dancing around in his mind until after a couple more minutes the door to the center opened again and the woman came out onto the sidewalk with the dog on its leash which she then attached to one of the legs of the park bench when she patted the slats of the seat the dog obediently hopped up and settled itself on the bench eztli waited and watched for a few more minutes the street was slowly waking up the woman in the center turned the closed sign over to open then came out and put two large red dishesfood and wateron the sidewalk under the bench the dog hopped down ate and drank some water then as dogs do it sniffed around and anointed the leg of the park bench before it went back to its place up on the bench and stretched out to sleep in the morning sunshine if glitskys threebedroom flat had a characteristic feature it was that the thirteen hundred square feet of it always felt crowded when hed first moved in here with flo thirtysome years before theyd already had two boys isaac and jacob and within the next year added orel after flo had died of ovarian cancer the three boys filled up the two bedrooms off behind the kitchen and a housekeeper rita had taken up nearly fulltime residence behind a screen in the barely serviceable living room by the time treya and her daughter raney moved in with abe and orel the household reverberated with the noise of the two teenagers and now they too had gone only to be replaced by rachel and zachary who were themselves not exactly monklike in their habits now there was no trace of any of the children nor of treya for that matter and glitsky sat drinking his morning tea at the table in his tiny kitchen experiencing the unaccustomed silence as a palpable and ominous presence when the telephone rang he had just picked up his cup and the brrring was loud and jarring and unexpected enough that he twitched and spilled some tea over the cups edge and into his lap jumping up furious at himself brushing his pants to get the liquid off he finally made it over to where the phone hung on the wall and picked up the receiver growling his name into it abe its vi sorry to call you at home but you werent at the office yet and i thought id take a chance the implied rebuke did nothing to elevate glitskys mood no problem he said whats up i wondered if you happened to see the our town column today not yet no well then its lucky i reached you so i could give you a headsup shes pretty much all over you about your handling or mishandling i should say of this janice durbin thing i got a call from hizzoner first thing this morningand yes if youre wondering at homeand he read me the riot act about whats going on and i must say this wasnt the way i envisioned spending my first month or so on this job defending myself and my chief of homicide every time i turn around shes an irresponsible lunatic glitsky said that may be true but shes got lelands attention in a big way and hes all but screaming for your head glitsky let out a deep sigh you know vi at this point im almost tempted to say give it to him who needs the aggravation if you ask me to ill resign right now dont tempt me will you i dont want you to resign especially over this which strikes me as you just trying to do your job not to mention imagine my future if i cave to this kind of idiocy the first time it rears its ugly head but ive got to have some answers for leland and for the public before this gets any further out of hand again glitsky blew out heavily whats she say marrenas basically its the same old in your zeal to get ro curtlee back behind bars youre ignoring a far better suspect whos right under your nose and whos that the durbin husband who doesnt have an alibi and is also evidently having an affair with one of his employees she printed that to that effect and of course then the question is why arent you concentrating on him instead of picking on ro maybe because ro did it although for the record you should know that ive interviewed the husband at least twice already and plan to do it again because its such a good time meanwhile youll notice i havent arrested anybody yetro or michael durbin or anybody elseand thats usually a clue that i dont have a viable suspect well if thats the case it might be in your best interest to prepare some kind of statement to that effect and ill do the same it should go without saying yes well thats not how it seems to be playing this time how about just saying we cant comment because the investigation is continuing howd that fly last time you tried it i think weve got to be a little more forthcoming im serious here abe i dont know how long im going to be able to keep my own job if this keeps up im on thin enough ice as it is lets try a little proactive appeasement hows that sound put on a little show for the home team fiftyeight people were in attendance at the crematorium service glitsky sat in the back row listening and taking notes as the relatives and acquaintances of janice durbin stood up to give their eulogies a borderline tearful but controlled michael durbin got up and extolled his wife as a partner provider helpmate and mother kathy novio breaking down several times invited everyone over to her house for the reception afterward then talked about her sisters childhood her passion for her family and patients and career and her belief that the world was a good place a safe place and how in spite of what had happened to her kathy was sure that janice would not want anyone to come away from this ceremony with negative feelings or despair two other girlfriends one from college and one from medical school talked about how much fun shed been how dedicated a friend her pastor who appeared to have known her fairly well talked in a resounding baritone about her volunteer activities with the mentally handicapped her generosity and her faith it was glitsky thought pretty much the usual stuff but amid the tributes to janice durbins life he found himself unable to stop wondering which of the guests here and he thought it must have been one of them had given her chlamydia or if janice had spread the disease to someone in this room while the last of the talks was winding down he went out and stood by the back door and let the crowd flow out past him he didnt know if anyone recognized him and he certainly didnt pick up any sense of hostility from any of the guests for the way he was screwing up the investigation into janices murder glitsky had met all the kids and the novios the previous saturday and now when the families came out straggling behind the rest of the crowd he saw that the trauma of the past few days had taken a heavy toll kathy in stark contrast to her talk inside was nearly ashen with anger and grief she held hands with both of her daughters glistening eyes straight ahead a couple of steps behind her her husband walked in a kind of stifflegged attention the elder durbin boy jon his face a cloud of fury cleared the door and immediately walked away from the general direction of the crowd michael durbin following walking next to the middle son peter on one side of him and his daughter allie holding his hand on the other called out to him but jon half turned and waved a dismissive hand and kept walking away glitsky had come to the service as part of his chiefs appeasement strategy thinking that some reporter from the courier or the chronicle or one of the tv stations might be among the audience and would interpret his presence there as having something to do with his investigation and not to do with ro curtlee in fact he had arrived at the ceremony with every intention of pulling michael durbin aside and trying to get some clearer information either on his alibi for the time of the murder or on the situation if any between him and liza sato he even considered that he might reveal the chlamydia angle and see where that led them but seeing the family now so rawly exposed and with the children around he simply met durbins eye and nodded in apparent sympathy as he walked past and let them all go to their waiting cars i think you should call jeff elliot back chuck was drinking a beer sitting on the counter in his kitchen talking to michael durbin while the reception continued in full swing in the living room give the guy an interview in the chronicle go on the offensive whats the offensive going to get me michael asked he held a glassful of bourbon and took a drink of it its what peter said this morning the more i deny it the more it sounds like im hiding something mike chuck put a hand on his brotherinlaws shoulder listen to me we know who did this right so you notice anything missing from the marrenas column like all the reasons we know it was ro did she mention that you were the foreman of ros jury no or the murder of that other woman the witness no or any other very good reason glitsky might have been concentrating on ro instead of you thats a lot you could tell elliot right there that somehow isnt making its way into the conversation dont you think i dont know i dont think anything anymore i mean even jons starting to have the idea that but chuck cut him off no hes not hes just devastated by his mom dying and who can blame him he doesnt really believe you had anything to do with it i promise hell hes eighteen hes trying to find someplace to put all this emotion hed rather deny hes feeling so marrenas gives him the idea and he takes it out on you hes smarter than that maybe but hes all fucked up right now just let him work it out what other choice do i have anyway i dont know where hes got to hell be back dont worry about that meanwhile you call the chronicle you know theyll talk to you get ro out there in front of the story where he belongs that son of a bitch but then what if he comes after me or the kids and at this chuck drew a breath drank off a slug of beer i hadnt thought of that he said i havent thought of too much else he lifted his glass to his mouth and half emptied it i know what i should do im not kidding lowering his voice he said i ought to go kill the guy myself chuck shook his head no thats a bad idea ive got a fucking shotgun out in my garage ive had it forever from back when i used to hunt they cant trace a shotgun i go over there to ros house some night knock on the door start shooting then i throw the gun in the bay and tell glitsky i was say with you the whole time drinking away my sorrow ive already said thats a bad idea now ill say it again thats a really bad idea i dont have any other ideas well lose that one it totally sucks youre not a killer michael you couldnt do that it would ruin your life durbin tipped up his glass finishing the drink as opposed to what it is now you mean sheila marrenas was waiting just outside the door of the outer lobby of the chiefs office when vi lapeer got back from her lunch meeting she was talking to one of her chief detectives and didnt notice the reporter until marrenas stood up and blocked her way excuse me chief ive just got a quick question for you and ill be glad to answer it lapeer said she looked at her watch in fortyfive minutes at my press conference thats why we have press conferences so i can talk to the press now if youll she started forward but marrenas moved to the side blocking her this cant wait well im afraid it has to because marrenas stepped directly in front of her isnt it true that youve assigned roundtheclock surveillance to follow ro curtlee wherever he goes and that youve authorized budget and even overtime for this surveillance and in spite of all this time and overkill no one seems to know where ro is right now isnt that true is that your idea of efficient use of an already overextended police budget how can you possibly justify such an expensive useless waste of money and personnel lapeers mouth hung half open in shock although she quickly recovered i have no comment she said no comment now if youll excuse me and with that the similarly astonished assistant chief next to her took her arm and without touching marrenas while moving her gently to the side got her inside the lobby to her office and closed the door behind them hector murillo was not aware of the concept of six degrees of separation he was a twentysevenyearold day laborer whod come up from mexico in and who remained undocumented for the past eight months hector had been a regular in the fourman landscaping crew of roberto serrano he was still pretty much low man both because hed worked for roberto for the shortest time and because he was mexican and not guatemalan but that was basically okay the difference between low man and high man wasnt so great anyway not when his boss roberto himself did whatever had to be donegrunt work like cleaning out gutters or spreading decomposed granite by the cubic yardas well as the mowing and blowing and trimming all in all hector was grateful to have a regular job where he got paid in cash every week hector lived in a trailer park just east of the freeway in mountain view and many nights he would hang out drinking beer with other men mostly from mexico who found themselves in situations very much like his own this was what hed been doing last night when jorge cristobal one of the guys from the park had mentioned the fivethousanddollar reward that lupe garcia was offering to find a woman whose name used to be gloria gonzalvez evidently her mother had died in guatemala and she had come into some money and her lawyers had contacted the wellconnected lupe in the hope that for a portion of the inheritance he could help locate her so they could all get paid that was the story anyway at first hector didnt think much about this other than to try to fantasize how much five thousand dollars really was he made sixtytwo dollars a day six days a week about fifteen hundred dollars a month and that covered food and rent and clothes and beer but not much else he didnt own even a share of a car he had no insurance and even so he had amassed a savings of exactly zero after twothirds of a year of steady work it wasnt until hed been lying in bed trying to sleep with that huge number floating around in his brain that he realized that robertos wifes name was gloria she was also guatemalanor at least he assumed she was since that was robertos nationality it would certainly be odd if she wasnt he woke up with the possibility still fresh in his mind thought about it through their first six houses in the morning he did not want to give away what he knew to anyone he knew roberto and if he told him about the reward and if his wife had been gloria gonzalvez roberto himself would go to lupe and claim the reward and hector would be lucky if he even got any small part of it the same went for his three coworkers if they had any idea what it was about in exchange for any information they gave him they would undoubtedly want to share part of the reward themselves jorge cristobal from the trailer park was going to be bad enough if he was going to be the intermediary between hector and lupe it looked like whoever claimed the reward was going to be stuck with someone like jorge but at least if hector came to jorge with the truthif it was the truthabout robertos wife then he would still have some leverage and might be able to keep jorges cut of the five thousand to a minimum five thousand dollars it was unfathomable they didnt take much time for lunch no more than twenty minutes but hector arranged it so that he sat near to roberto who tended to sit somewhat apart from the crew normally and halfway through their food he struck up a conversation with his boss under the pretext that he had a girlfriend himself and was thinking about marriage how long he asked in spanish have you been married roberto shrugged eight years and how is it good i got lucky gloria works hard and shes a good mother dont marry a girl who doesnt like children that isnt the problem hector said if you already have a problem maybe you should think about this decision some more you shouldnt have problems before you get married well maybe it isnt one i dont know its why i wanted to ask you you dont know if you have a problem i know what i have i dont know if its a problem roberto waited shes whats her name maria all right maria has lived here already for seven years is she a citizen because then yes marry her no not yet she is like me but she has gotten ideas from some of the women she knows she says its not right that i should force her if we become married to change her name this seemed to confuse roberto for a moment what would she change her name to there is no better name than maria her last name hector said to mine murillo murillo is a fine name why would she not want to have it its not about the name its about being a modern american woman but shes not american no but she speaks good english she wants to fit in here its the new culture she says roberto frowned she will never fit in to the culture here doesnt she know that her children maybe or their children but maybe not i dont want to tell you what to do with this woman but ill be honest this doesnt sound good to me he took a bite of his burrito chewing as though he was considering the issue from all angles hector took the opportunity to go on so your wife there was no problem she changed her name roberto nodded of course it was never discussed i would not have discussed it she is my wife she has my name that is what ive been thinking hector said except then i wonder if it is just that she doesnt like the sound of it maria murillo nonsense the sound of a name what does that matter what is her name now gonzalvez hector said maria gonzalvez roberto said ha and threw his hands in the air in a gesture of triumph you know this was my wifes name gonzalvez once she changed she has never missed it you tell your woman that and if she still wont do it i dont advise that you go ahead with this marriage a woman who doesnt want to take your name she sounds like she could be a lot of trouble eztli bought two piroshkimeatfilled pastriesfrom one of the little russian shops in the nearby neighborhood he started eating one of them while walking back toward haight street and when hed finished that he unwrapped the other one and pressed four of the little tablets hed bought at the hardware store into the bottom of it he threw the waxpaper wrapper and the package that the tablets had come in into a trash receptacle sitting on the sidewalk two streets down from the piroshki stand coming around the corner a block away from the rape crisis counseling center he turned right and strolled casually along taking in the storefront windows as he aimlessly windowshopped stopping two doors down from the center checking out the vacation specials in the travel agencys window he waited while a couple of elderly women stopped to interact with the cute yellow lab on the bench now very much awake and receptive licking their hands as they petted it farrell stood in a brown study in the midafternoon aimlessly flicking the handles at his foosball table keeping the ball in play someone knocked on his door he looked up stopped defending and the ball went into the righthand goal as he said come on in wheres treya dont ask get the door please amanda jenkins wasnt showing off her legs today she was wearing stonewashed jeans and a simple black tshirt she hadnt combed her hair since she had gotten up and didnt look like shed had too much sleep before then either for the first split second when he saw her farrell almost cracked wise about her appearance here on the job but one look into her redrimmed eyes told him that wouldnt be sensitive or wise and so instead he said i dont expect you to be in here amanda maybe you want to take a couple of days off give things a chance to settle are you kidding me she asked thats why im in here i dont want anything to settle i want to string that bastard up by his balls you want the grand jury absolutely i want it sooner than you do i doubt that he came around and leaned back against the foosball table could you get the case prepared sooner if i dont sleep and thats what seems to be happening well dont sacrifice your prep you dont want to go in and not get him ill get him i swear to christ ill get him you thinkreallyby next tuesday well ive got all the evidence from sandoval ive got testimony about matts assignment ive got nunez and janice durbin and revenge and then ill have to see what else i can gather from abe but speaking of which did you see marrenass column this morning fuck her well sure but you didnt read the column no why shes turned up the heat on abe in a big way on abe how can that be hes not investigating michael durbin hes fixated on ro its a vendetta blah blah blah and meanwhile just in case things are getting too dull around here guess who called me yesterday about this grand jury thing jenkins ran her hands through her hair what is this bullshit wes this is alice in wonderland yes it is welcome to san francisco so who called you about the grand jury marrenas well yes of course first but the real fun part was cliff themanhimself curtlee who seemed to think that the personal threat is an effective negotiating tool runs in the family apparently anyway theres no goddamn instruction booklet on this da thing i seem to have gotten myself elected to hes threatening me and im holed up here in the office without any clear plan on how to fight him not exactly kicking ass doing the peoples work im starting to think that this is something that try as i might i just dont have the chops to do well get him wes we really will well somebodys going to get somebody thats for sure wes finally crossed the room and half collapsed on the couch and dont think i dont realize how much of this is me is my fault he looked up at his chief assistant i am so so sorry amanda about matt and about you to say nothing of the other victims i ought to be impeached well hold on that amanda said striving to lighten it up not now when youre just starting to get it dont kid yourself farrell said i dont get it at all wess cell phone went off at his belt and he pulled it out looked at the screen and told amanda this is sam ive got to take it itll just be a minute he pushed the answer button hey no im just easy easy what shes what well call the police get somebody down there right away im on my way too closing the phone farrells face was a study in confusion and panic what amanda asked what now somebody fucking killed my dog farrell said his voice breaking they killed my fucking beautiful dog glitsky drove back from the crematorium service to polk street where he parked and got in the line for the swan oyster depot an hour and a half later he reemerged from the very far end of the bar his stomach uncomfortably stuffed into the sunlight having broken about every dietary law he knew of either for a sometimeskosher jew or a recovering heart attack victim hed had two dozen raw oysters half a dozen clams a half loaf of sourdough bread with an uncounted number of pats of real butter half a dungeness crab with mayonnaise and more melted butter and his first two beersin fact his first sip of any kind of alcoholin over three years back out in his car he called treya down in los angeles and they had a short conversation that resolved nothing she still wasnt coming home the kids were fine he told her about the marrenas article and she had said well what would you expect and then after five more minutes he told her he loved her as he said goodbye and shed said okay actually getting some rubber from his tires as he pulled out of his parking place he drove in a cold fury out to the curtlees house there was no sign of any twentyfourhour watch on the place but then glitsky realized that the surveillance team might be out following ro around on the chance that ro might show up although god knew what he planned to do if that happened glitsky sat in the street across from the house for about twenty minutes until his head became too heavy to hold up waking up from the following fortyminute doze disoriented and cotton mouthed he started the car back up hung a uturn and headed back downtown never exceeding the speed limit by less than fifteen miles an hour the dark side of his nature almost hoping that some patrolman would try to pull him over or write him up or fuck with him in any way bearded and burly jeff elliot was in his wheelchair in his glassenclosed office downstairs at the chronicle building and of course when hed heard that glitsky was at the front desk hed had them send him right on down he might have done this in any case since the two men had known each other mostly as tacit allies for more than twenty years but today glitsky was big news and if he wanted to make time for jeff jeff would find time for him and now here he was looming in the doorway breathing through his nose his mouth under tight control the scar through his lips burning white glitskys menacing face wore a brandnew terrifying expression that elliot couldnt read and in fact so threatening was the visage that elliot unconsciously backed himself away before he recovered and put on a welcoming smile perhaps meant to disarm doctor glitsky he said to what do i owe the pleasure off the record until i say so okay sure i want to kill somebody jeff i mean literally and i figured if i didnt get myself off the street i actually might do it ro curtlee hed be a start sheila yep her too i thought maybe you could talk me out of it why would i want to finally letting out the breath hed been all but holding jeff indicated the chair just to the left of his door you want to sit now glitsky eased a breath out and nodded as though convincing himself i could sit he said and he did ramrod straight jeff regarded him for another brief moment bad day at black rock huh glitsky shook his head if you only knew you want to tell me your side ill get it into print just so youre perfectly clear on it glitsky said i havent ruled out anybody yet in the durbin murder including her husband including ro curtlee but to pretend as marrenas did that ro doesnt have a bona fide motive is just insane he saw michael durbin at his arraignment last week and recognized him its a matter of public record that michael was the jury foreman in his trial and that he persuaded a few of the hanging jurors to come around to convict so theres a revenge motive and anybody who doesnt believe its there is deluding themselves elliot picked up a transcribing tape recorder from his desk and held it up knowledgeable sources glitsky asked how about highranking sources within the police department sources with knowledge of the investigation sold said elliot and he turned on the tape recorder back in the runner eztli picked ro back up at around four oclock at momos where hed had another lunch and sat in the same seat in the bar that hed anchored yesterday tiffany was on duty working the late shift today and ro wasnt going to wait around until two oclock or whenever the hell it was that she got off so he had called eztli and asked for the pickup so whatd i miss ro asked him as they drove down the embarcadero i feel like ive been gone a week that girl is one enthusiastic piece of ass once more and i think i swear to god she might have broke it eztli looked across at him with something very like affection he loved this kids attitude youre breaking my heart he said and there have been a couple of developments mostly that theyve pulled off the tail must have been going around i pulled off a little tail myself ro chuckled at his cleverness you wouldnt have a jay on you would you sure eztli pulled a joint from his inside pocket and passed it across the tail being the cops who were supposed to be following you he said well they didnt do shit anyway ro lighting up sucking in a lungful of smoke then blowing out he asked but i dont get whyd they pull em off not that it matters sheilas been busy she told lapeer she was going to write up all about the tail tomorrow how it was more harassment and lapeer just cant take any more heat i would love to fuck that woman lapeer no well maybe but im talking sheila hit he passed the joint across so just like that were free again eztli had a toke looks like you got any plans nothing definite well i was thinking ro said i got an idea glitsky talked to jeff elliot for more than an hour then stopped back at the hall to show his face farrell had gone off somewhere and most of glitskys own troops were running on autopilot writing up their cases in the detail in the detail hed received a nice informal show of support from all the homicide inspectors and taking any little bit of goodwill where he could get it had stayed just to shoot the breeze for a while now he was driving around and around trying to find a parking spot someplace within five or six blocks of his duplex and running out of hope not helping matters out to the west a fog bank presaged the end of the cold and clear weather theyd been tolerating next up glitsky thought ought to be cold and wet there it was black and foreboding bearing down on him from thirty blocks away when his cell phone rang he was tempted to simply turn it off without even looking at it hed already worked a full and grueling day he felt a little sick from his stupid lunch and he was exhausted but on second thought he thought it might be treya and he looked down to check michael durbin lieutenant durbin said youve got to get over here youre not going to believe what hes done now by the time glitsky got out to rivera street the bank of bad weather had completely engulfed the neighborhood wipers slashing back and forth against the thick mist his lights on in the fog and darkness glitsky pulled up at durbins address and could barely discern the outlines of the house from the curb a figure sat behind the wheel of the car glitsky pulled up behind and no sooner had he pulled over when the drivers door of that car opened and his headlights revealed michael durbin stepping out into the street glitsky killed his lights and ignition and was out of the car before durbin got back to him thanks for coming out i really think this is something glitsky crossed his arms against the chill well lets go take a look in silence durbin led the way up the driveway and back behind the house to where an unattached garage filled up half the backyard space because it wasnt part of the house it had escaped any fire damage and now with bits of broken glass and cinders crunching under their feet they proceeded around to a side door a bare lightbulb burned over the door durbin reached into his pocket for a set of keys and fitted one into the deadbolt slot i probably should have thought about touching the doorknob he said but it never occurred to me thered be anything to see in here glitsky glanced down at the standard plain brass doorknob something that would take and hold a fingerprint beautifully hold on so youve already gone in this way just the once backing durbin away glitsky stepped closer pulling on the pair of latex gloves that he always carried with him ill open it this time i dont want you to touch anything else out here or inside nothing at all is that clear sure glitsky turned the deadbolt key and gripped the doorknob with his gloved hand turning it and pushing the door came right open and he stepped into the doorway and felt to the right of the door for the indoor light switch which he turned on bathing the room in brightness from three lines of track lighting up in the ceiling somewhat warned of what to expect glitsky still wasnt completely prepared for the sight that greeted him durbin had obviously used this place as a painting studio somewhere between a dozen and twenty very large colorful andto glitskys eyeprofessionallooking portraits of very real people stared back at him from canvases that were stacked and leaning all along the back and side walls in the center of the wideopen space three others of what looked to be works in progress sat on the ground leaning up against the wooden tripods or easels that held them someone had come in here though and slashed every one sometimes only once sometimes five or six times the canvas simply shredded but there was no painting glitsky could see that hadnt been cut into and what made the vandalism all the more disturbing were the pictures themselves glitsky did not consider himself any kind of connoisseur of art but these paintingsnone of them less than threebyfour feet and a few as large as six or even eight feet on a sidewere clearly the work of at the very least a talented artist whatever else his misgivings about durbin the mans work had an undeniable power and quality glitsky was standing as though hypnotized just one or two steps inside the door when durbin came up next to him glancing over at him he was not unduly surprised to see what might be incipient tears in his eyes youre thinking ro did this glitsky asked absolutely how would he have known these were even here marrenas she wrote about my derivative amateur ludicrous stuff back in the day while she was libeling both of us this place has been my studio forever i never made any attempt to hide it why would i who cared glitsky found himself focusing on one of the unfinished paintings sitting on the floor it was a womans face filling the frame with almost no background showing durbin had caught her turning around her beautiful dark eyes a mystery her skin touchable even with the one slash through her right eye and down across her nose and lips she was arresting especially caught in that pose and of course even so the portrait wasnt yet completed is that liza sato he asked yeah or was did she come over here and pose for you no no of course not people dont have the time to pose i dont have the time to work with them that way anyway mostly i just start with a picture a photograph he was staring at the piece shes beautiful isnt she glitsky nodded yes she is did your wife ever see this durbin shook his head i keep telling you lieutenant i didnt kill janice i didnt do this either slash my paintings this is my lifes work for the past ten years this might be true but glitsky was aware that he hadnt answered the question did your wife ever see this he asked again defeated durbins shoulders sagged i just dont know she wasnt my arts biggest supporter lieutenant and i couldnt blame her i couldnt sell these things back when we really needed me to they look pretty saleable to me well thank you but you dont know the market or how to play it its brutal out there for realistic fine art which is unfortunately what i do what ive always wanted to do but it doesnt pay the bills and thats the bottom line when youve got a wife and kids sad but true so i havent even tried to sell in years he ran his eyes over his ruined work but that doesnt mean this doesnt break my heart that this doesnt feel more wrong than almost anything i can conceive of glitsky could not help but understand this was a soulshattering display of pure inhumanity glitskys own stomach had gone hollow at the waste and destruction but he was also aware that michael durbin might still have performed this vandalism on his own works in an effort to keep ro curtlee in the picture as a viable candidate for janices murder the timingcoming so soon after ro had provided an alibi for the time of the crimewas suspicious as was the fact that michael durbin had been the one who had discovered these slashed paintings which led to glitskys next question so when did you come upon all this just before i called you you just remembered these were back here no lieutenant obviously i knew they were here all along and i knew the fire hadnt touched the garage so there was no urgency to see how theyd made it so were you coming back in here today to paint why does it matter why i was coming back here my wifes dead my kids are falling apart my life as ive known it is over after what marrenas wrote this morningand you should know this as well as methe vibes even at my real job got too weird to handle plus it seems one of my people there is leaking to her why do you say that somebody told her about me getting in late last friday do you know who it is or why liza sato thinks its a guy named peter bassey whos jealous because she likes me a nonplussed look hey what can i say we like each other we get along not a crime last time i checked so peters poisoning the well at work and i had the whole afternoon off and yawning before me so i came to hang out here he raised a hand at the destruction and found this and then called you if ros been here maybe he left some sign of it what do you think glitsky didnt answer he was punching numbers on his cell phone bringing it up to his ear he said this is abe glitsky with homicide i need a crime scene unit as soon as i can get one her cheeks wet with tears sam duncan sat disconsolately on one of the sagging sofas in the raggedy reception area where she worked wes farrell all cried out sat beside her holding her hand gerts body lay on the other side of him her head in his lap his other hand gently stroking her head animal control was on its way and sam was still trying to get a grip on what exactly had happened although to wes this was not a mystery i mean sam said shed been out there on the bench all morning just lying in the sun like she does did you see anybody stop wes everybody stopped little kids old ladies every homeless person that passed by this was gert remember everybodys favorite dog you know i do know but then somebody stopped and poisoned her we dont know that not for sure i do how i just do she waswhatfive years old in perfect health and now suddenly shes foaming at the mouth and shes dead that doesnt just happen sometimes it does why would somebody want to kill a sweet dog like her its got nothing to do with her you remember the horses head in the bed in the godfather this was the same thing this was cliff curtlee but ive met him wes hes a charming man he gives money to the center for gods sake he wouldnt do something like this not himself no and hes charming all right but hed order this in a heartbeat and ill bet you a million dollars that he did but why to warn me that hes serious hes not kidding around and to give me a good idea what hed do next except next time to someone closer to me like you maybe even to me myself hed do next if what if i continued to pursue this grand jury thing on his little boy she ran her free hand over her head through her hair god i cant believe this how can this be happening we both know the answer to that sam i didnt push hard enough denying ro bail now hes had a taste of freedom again and hes not giving it up without a fight or a whole lot of fights his eyes went down to his dog goddamn it sam reached over and touched gerts head gently left her hand on farrells thigh so what are you going to do now i dont know i dont really have any idea take ro out right now convene the grand jury for an emergency session like tomorrow and just march in with amandas basic case but you were saying this was cliff curtlee not ro i know it probably was i dont know if it even matters its all so fucked up which is why another part of me wants to just call cliff and tell him ive gotten his message and he wins were calling everybody off anything that has to do with ro except the retrial which isnt calendared until next august anyway maybe that would slow down the carnage you believe that farrell shook his head no ros still going to want to find the other main witness a woman named gloria gonzalvez shes still going to be in danger no she still is in danger which is pretty much why i cant just give up either besides the fact that its the last thing i want to do giving up is not happening ive got to keep the pressure on these pricks let them know that they picked the exact wrong guy if they think they can pull this shit and get away with it but what if they come back at you with something worse one of us you mean he shook his head im not going to give them any time although i know that if theyre capable of thishe gave gerts body a pettheres nothing they wouldnt do i could get you moved to someplace safe until this is over i dont want to do that no but it might be smart sam let go of wess hand stood up and crossed over to the door standing there arms crossed looking out into the darkness and fog she might have been a statue but for the slight rise and fall of her shoulders finally she took in a big breath and turned around fuck that if theyre not driving you off theyre not pushing me out either yeah but you didnt sign up for this and i did its not the same thing close enough no its not arent you the one who moved out a couple of days ago because of how badly i was doing the job and you know you were right i couldnt have proven it any better these last couple of weeks if id tried she had moved now back to the couch going down to one knee in front of him that wasnt about your job wes it was about you and me communicating about what you were doing what was in your life the way we are right now for example and you cant let these people get away with stuff like like this and worse he looked at her imploringly i have to be honest i dont know exactly how im going to stop them sam what im precisely going to do but im sure as shit going to try there are just no other options even if its probably true that im not the best man for the job but you are wes you might be the only man left standing who can actually do it you got any ideas on how not just at the moment but well get one i promise we yes we of course we what did you think durbin stayed at the garage behind his burnedout house with glitsky and the csi unit for about two hours the team worked quickly and efficiently lifting fingerprints from likely surfaces and taking photographs gathering dust devils and sweeping up fibers and hairs and whatever else they might have been looking for they found nothing that might have been immediately incriminating to ro curtlee or anybody elseno probable slashing instrument for exampleand since the next steps of the investigation would take place at the police lab they declared themselves finished and left the whole time glitsky was a desultory and vaguely threatening presence keeping michael away from the other officers and offering little in the way of information or even conversation now at around eight oclock durbin let himself in the kitchen door at the novios home the house was dark and mostly quiet although it sounded as if someone was watching television somewhere michael was a bit surprised to see kathy all alone perched on a stool at their granite counter with a drink of some kind in front of her shed been crying recently and looked up as he came in hey she said at the low range of audible hey he got to the counter and stopped you all right she lifted her shoulders an inch what are you drinking he asked i dont know bourbon i think you feel like company i know youve had nothing but company all day so if you dont no if you want its fine the bottles on the counter over there you can hit me again too if you dont mind michael got himself a glass and ice and filled it with bourbon then crossed over and refilled kathys sitting down on the stool next to her he took a sip has jon come back he asked not yet he texted me and said he was staying out till when she gave him a glance till he gets back id imagine hes all right michael hell be okay he thinks its possible i killed janice she shook her head i doubt it hes just upset everybodys upset and everybody shows it differently he took another pull at his bourbon so wheres everybody else the girls are watching tv peters already asleep upstairs i think chucks at school at school papers hes got to grade she sipped her drink it never ends i dont know where he gets the energy she gave him a sideways look that he couldnt read he conserves it in other places not knowing what to make of that response michael said i guess so they both drank again i shouldnt have said that kathy said i think im probably drunk thats all right youve earned it no but i shouldnt criticize chuck but sometimes its just so difficult a day like today for example with a million people in and out and so much going on emotionally and sometimes you just think wouldnt it be nice if your husband didnt have to go out and work and instead could stay and be with you and maybe be i dont know be like we were she wasnt sobbing but tears were again suddenly rolling down her cheeks i mean she said i just think of poor janice dying with no warning one minute alive and then gone forever and it makes you question whats important and why youre doing the things you do and why youre not spending more time with the person you supposedly love when she really really needs you instead of correcting your goddamn papers for your stupid students she wiped her cheeks with her hands picked up her drink took another sip and put it down im sorry michael im so sorry i dont even know what im saying im just still all so upset its just i feel so alone so completely alone i know you know i do i shouldnt be mad at chuck its not him im just mad at the whole world thats a good thing to be mad at michael said im pretty much at the same place he picked up his drink and drained the glass dismas hardy the managing partner in wes farrells firm was abe glitskys best friend he lived with his wife frannie out on thirtyfourth avenue near clement street and though this was not directly on the way home from durbins house it wasnt far out of the way either when glitsky drove by lights shone in the living room and smoke emanating from the chimney was faintly visible for a few seconds before it disappeared into the fog a parking space on the opposite curb clinched the deal and glitsky hung a uturn and pulled into it hardy opened the door to his standalone victorian home wearing an old worn pair of jeans destroyed topsiders and a faded blue pullover sweater that had seen better days sorry he said no solicitors maybe you didnt see the sign by the gate and he closed the door on him glitsky could have simply knocked on the door or rung the bell again but this of course in some obscure but important way would have been losing so he put his hands into his jacket pockets and settled in for the long haul hardy held out for nearly a minute and it might have gone longer if frannie hadnt somehow gotten in the act and finally opened the door to all appearances surprised to see him abe jesus you guys how long were you going to stand out there as long as it took diz would have opened the door eventually would not hardy said then added all he had to do was knock in your dreams glitsky said so would you like to come in now frannie asked rather than stand out here freezing all night thatd be nice ask him to say please hardy said that ought to be good for another fifteen minutes while he decides she turned on her husband theres something truly wrong with you you know that not so much wrong hardy answered as elusive fleeting ethereal hard to define in the best possible way im with you fran glitsky said i define it as wrong ive been telling him the same thing for years okay that does it now hes really going to have to say please oh for crying out loud frannie grabbed glitsky by the arm pulling him inside and closing the door after him this is why i love her hardy said she makes the tough decisions look easy five minutes later hardy and glitsky were sitting in armchairs in front of the fire hardy with a neat scotch and glitsky with a cup of green tea that frannie had made for him and okay glitsky was saying i know what you read about this morning how im all over ro curtlee about these murders i dont read the courier except under grave duress well thats good to hear but the plain fact is ros got an apparent alibi for this janice durbin thing and her husband really doesnt youre thinking its him im thinking more it could be him but i really dont see it i mean the guys a legitimately talented artist i cant see him slashing his own paintings trying to frame ro and then not leaving anything around that ties it to ro does that make sense not much so yeah im thinking its still probably ro but if im wrong and wes takes my case to the grand jury you see the problem of course he gets off on one charge and the whole thing falls apart so dont use janice but without her we dont have the motive connection to ro sure you do the witnesswhats her namethe first woman he killed when he got out glitsky nodded felicia nunez and thats one connection with his trial but without janice durbin thats all weve got the one thats not a pattern hardy looked at the fire sipped at his drink how about matt lewis glitsky held his palm out and rotated it tenuous at best and again ro and his butler they both have an alibi evidently the two astronomy buffs decided to take in the planetarium show well at least its credible hardy replied tongue well in cheek then more seriously i dont trust too many perfect alibis he said it smacks of premeditation doesnt it though so what are you going to do i dont know it looks like its all going to come down to janice durbin but we dont have anything solid on ro there at least id like to resolve my doubts about the husband before wes goes ahead with the grand jury well something will either break there or it wont yeah but i dont want the next break to come in connection with another murder like who i dont know anybody wes amanda me im not kidding you the other and now last witness from his trial if he can find her who is she gloria gonzalvez one of his rape victims you got her in protection no glitskys face showed his frustration i cant find her either a frown creased hardys brow so as it stands now shes not testifying in the retrial not unless we can locate her so even that retrial youve got testimony but no actual witnesses right hardy made a noise in his throat that glitsky read very clearlywithout witnesses even the retrial was in very serious jeopardy ro might never actually get back into prison hardy had another sip of scotch frannie appeared from the back of the house and asked abe if hed like a refill on his tea i think im good thanks frannie nodded hesitating and then said i know its short notice but we just found out our little darlings are both going to be home this weekend maybe you and treya and the kids could come over on saturday for dinner just simple glitsky took another moment before he said theyve all gone down to her brothers in la more of this ro curtlee stuff treyas afraid ros going to come after one of the kids treyas not afraid of anything frannie said well not much glitsky admitted but ro curtlee got her attention shes definitely afraid of him so whens she coming back frannie asked that glitsky said is a good question hopefully someday hardy reacted immediately coming forward in his chair leaning in toward his friend oh come on abe of course shes coming back glitsky nodded thoughtfully as though he were considering the question at last he let out a short breath thats the hope he said but im not sure id bet on it when she heard the voice on the intercom say that it was michael durbin at her door liza didnt know what to make of it at first he had never before been to her place a nice onebedroom apartment at chestnut and laguna not far from the store liza had been more than a little bit in love with him now for well over a year the feeling had developed from an original natural simpaticoshed had another boyfriend at the beginningthat had turned to friendship in the years that theyd worked together and then finally at the christmas party two decembers ago they had been shooting pool together at one of the north beach bars theyd all repaired to after the dinner and as she leaned over to take her shotshe was wearing a low but not particularly plunging necklineshe noticed him noticing her janice had already gone home and liza had definitely had too much to drink michael had smiled and shrugged as if to say you caught me her eyes had locked into his and she straightened up walked around the table right up to him and told him flat out that she loved him he told her he loved her too and then leaned down and kissed her with a deep passionate openmouthed hungry kiss that had weakened her knees but then almost immediately afterward while they were still holding each other he realized what hed done and he pulled away saying he was sorry he shouldnt have done that it had been a mistake the next monday back at work hed taken her out to lunch and apologized again it wasnt that he didnt find her attractive he told her and didnt love the person she was but he was married to janice and committed to her and to their family hed had a moment of infatuation with liza that in his weakness hed given in to but that was all there could ever be between them if she was uncomfortable continuing to work with him hed understand and help her find another job with at least equal pay and benefits if he could or of course if shed like to stay on he would be happy to keep her but there could be no repetition of what had happened the other night and there had not been without hesitation she pushed the button that opened the downstairs door and let him in and now she opened the door to her apartment and he came out of the elevator and turned to see her standing there when he got to her she stepped into his arms and they stood embracing holding on to each other as though for their lives ros idea from earlier in the day was more or less in the line of a game he had been talking to tiffany about some of the things that had changed in the years that hed been in prison not just ipods and phones and all the technology but the other changes that made the world feel so different in the daytoday the giant malls and the enormous discount stores with everything you could ever want to buy all in one place or on the opposite scale all the closedup independent bookstores now you wanted to buy a book tiffany said you had your basic one or two choices borders and barnes amp noble and they were pretty much the same or coffee shops starbucks on every corner who could have predicted that and for coffee but that example had led tiffany to tell him about another one of the latest things going around in the city which she had at first found hard to believe but which according to some friends of hers whod actually seen it wasnt even uncommonpeople were carrying guns openly around in public this was mostly facilitated evidentlyaccording to tiffanyby twitter and facebook and other stuff on the web about which ro was ignorant but these people would somehow all get in touch with one another and meet at some predetermined starbucks location where they were making some second amendment point by showing up wearing their guns out in holsters like in the wild west this was happening every day she said and why at starbucks stores she didnt know but it wasnt only the coffee shops over just the past weekend a posse of more than seventy people had showed up at baker beach all of them carrying wild huh ro thought so the catch was that the guns could not be loaded that would be illegal as there were city county and state laws forbidding carrying loaded weapons around but astoundingly to ro carrying the unloaded guns themselves as long as they were not concealed was not only not illegal it was specifically protected by the second amendment which made no sense because you could carry your piece unloaded with a clip or four in your pockets and basically load up the gun in about the time it took to rack a round into the chamber but the point to him wasnt whether it made any sense but that it happened at all people walking around with perfectly usable guns on their hips he told eztli that the two of them really ought to go around the city and see if they could find one of the hot spots and thats what theyd done they got lucky just about the time they were going to quit getting on toward five oclock at a starbucks pretty close to where theyd begun at momos out at fishermans wharf as they drove by from the street they saw not only that the place seemed to be unusually crowded but three blackandwhite patrol cars were pulled up out front neither eztli nor ro had any fear of the police in general and beyond that they knew that the policemen here at starbucks were beat cops if anything their presence added to the spice so eztli pulled into a parking garage a block away removed the bullets from his own weapon and tucked the gun into his belt he also removed the jacket from his suit leaving it on the car seat so there would be no misunderstanding about whether the gun was concealed or not and the two of them had strolled down to check it out sure enough there must have been thirtyfive or forty people waiting for or drinking their supertall macchiato or whatever it was and packing heat the uniformed copsnow eight of themwere politely but carefully checking to see that none of the guns were loaded all of the demonstrators were reasonably well dressed and well behaved many seemed to be professionals most were men although there were more women than ro would have guessed six or eight of them by the time ro entered the store he was probably the only person left inside besides the employees who were not armed they stayed long enough to have their own coffees still flying on their reefer and until the crowd had started to disperse of course as theyd expected the cops did not recognize them back at the garage they waited out on the sidewalk until they saw one of the demonstratorsa paunchy middleaged balding man in casual business attire with what looked like a big semiautomatic with custommade grips in a holster on his hippass them and turn into the entrance eztli had come up quickly and silently behind him and put him down and out with one rabbit punch and less than five minutes later ro was wearing the gun and had the guys bullets in his pocket and the two of them roared out of the garage howling with the good clean sheer fun of it all now at eleven thirty or so ro turned off the tv in his room he wasnt so much tired as he was bored and when he was bored invariably he got horny and he sure didnt want to wait around until two oclock or whenever tiffany got off besides he didnt want to start up anything regular with any one chick not when there was so much opportunity a lot closer at hand ros room was on the third floor at the other end of the house and one floor up from his parents bedroom eztli the cook and the two cleaning girls had their rooms two floors below his parents on the basement level to facilitate communication in the seventhousandsquarefoot home the curtlees had installed a sophisticated intercom system between the various floors and rooms starting to get excited by the idea he was developing ro got up off his bed and crossed over to his dresser opening one of the drawers and taking out the gun that hed scored that afternoon he hefted it in one hand and then the other appreciating its weight and appearance it was a beauty he thought brandnew or as good as a big mother with an oversize magazine with a seventeenround capacity about a foot long with a bright satin stainless finish and custom wooden grips the kind of gun that could get your attention from across the room twentyyearold linda salcedo heard the faint buzz of the intercom through her blankets and for an instant couldnt place where the sound was coming from then coming fully awake she waited in the dark of her room to see if shed imagined it or if one of the curtlees in fact needed her for something even at this time of night that would be unusual since her duties keeping the rooms spotless kept her busy throughout the day by the time shed helped clean up after dinner she normally had her nights to herself but of course if anyone needed her at any timeto restock toilet paper get some hair out of a sink change a lightbulb anythingshe would have to go and take care of it and yes here it was again the intercom buzzing sighing throwing the covers off she padded barefoot over to her door and pushed the reply button si linda hi this is ro upstairs sorry to bother you so late is no bother no i was just sitting up here at midnight waiting for something to do hoping one of you would call good listen i was getting out of the shower and i knocked over the shampoo bottle and got it all over the floor i wondered if you could come up and get it cleaned up i wouldnt want to get up and slip on it in the middle of the night okay she said letting out a frustrated and weary breath you spilled some shampoo you wouldnt want to try cleaning it up yourself would you heaven forbid in two minutes si si he said two minutes is fine even three take your time gracias de nada she had been sleeping in her nightgown and now she considered taking it off and getting dressed again in her regular uniform but that seemed a lot of effort to simply go upstairs and clean up a little spill which would probably take her all of one minute so she decided she would just put on her bathrobe and her crocs shed be done and be back down here in five minutes and then she could just go back to sleep no one else seemed to be awake in the house but the halls were lit with tiny night lights in the wall sockets and in the light of these she walked up the three flights to the top floor then turned left at the top of the stairs and went to ros door closed at the far end of the hall gently she rapped on it come on in when she opened the door she was briefly surprised to see that ro had turned the lights out in here already probably just going to sleep he had no reason to talk to her againhed already told her what she needed to do would you mind closing the door behind you she heard him say from where she knew the bed was she did as she was told and now there was nothing but darkness she stood stockstill inside the room waiting for her eyes to adjust so she could go to the bathroom where hed spilled the shampoo you can turn on the light he said again she did as he requested half turning away to the switch by the door when she came back around and looked at him she did a little half jump backward accompanied by a frightened little yelp her hand to her mouth her eyes wide with terror ro was naked on top of the covers with a full erection he was holding a gun on her centered at her heart with his other hand the arm in a cast above it he patted the bed next to him and broke a big smile nobody has to get hurt here if you act smart he said just come on over and take that robe off you and you and me well lay down and get ourselves comfortable driving back from lizas to chuck and kathys place all michael durbin knew for sure was that he was a mess there was guilt but also no question elation over the time hed just spent with liza he told himself that he hadnt gone over there to go to bed with her but simply because he felt like he needed someone to talk to whom he could trust and who believed him but did he know even as he was driving over to lizas that they would probably wind up having sex and even if he did so what so soon after janices death thats so what he told himself and yet janice was truly dead now cremated he had been faithful as hed sworn he would until death did they part and he didnt owe her anything after that he didnt understand so much of what he was going through and he thought that liza was sensitive and smart enough to help talk him through it all janice gone his paintings now gone his eldest son thinking he was capable of murder the beginnings of fullscale mutiny at work and while he was at it why not add the facts that hed slept with a new woman for the first time in twenty years that also he was driving around with his shotgun in the trunk of his car he hadnt seen any need to tell glitsky the real reason why hed gone out to his garage earlier in the evening after the memorial had worn down he had only inadvertently stumbled onto his slashed paintings he had not come to the garage to do anything with his paintings he had come to get his shotgun he wasnt quite clear on whether he wanted it more for protection or for aggression but once the idea of having the thing near to hand had taken hold he found himself powerless to resist it parking in the novios driveway he checked the time on the dash before he turned off the engine he got out of the car and went back and opened the trunk there was the shotgun still and the box of twelvegauge ammunition that went with it so he picked them both up and carried them around to the kitchen door no point having a weapon he thought if you couldnt get to it in an emergency in the living room one light burned michael came through the kitchen and chuck looked up from where he sat in his reading chair one stack of papers lying on his lap another on the floor next to him youre still up michael said couldnt sleep he pointed vaguely what are you doing with that thing keeping it handy is it loaded i dont think im comfortable with a loaded gun in the house for an answer michael broke open the barrel and looked down through it both barrels empty then he held up the small cardboard box ammunition over here where are you going to keep it near me did kathy tell you the latest i didnt see her she was asleep when i got in whats the latest michael sat down the shotgun on the coffee table between them and told him about the slashed paintings all of them chuck now sat all the way forward in his chair every one son of a bitch chuck said why did he do that why did he kill janice same reason to get at me chuck sat back as though exhausted he glanced down at the shotgun up at his brotherinlaw dont get me wrong he said i can see where youd be tempted im a lot more than tempted chuck if it wasnt for the kids he broke off his train of thought derailed speaking of which have you seen jon tonight no but i didnt look in on any of them why he wasnt home by the time i left tonight he texted kathy and told her hed be late id better go look and with that he was up and out of the room chuck came forward in his chair again reached out and picked up the shotgun broke it open over his knee and checked the barrels again then closed it up michael appeared back in the doorway hes still not here shit hes a big boy mike hell be all right i hate this i hate all of it he took a step into the room what are you doing with the gun making sure it isnt loaded you shouldnt be walking around with a loaded gun mike jon comes home late you might shoot him by mistake i doubt that where is he staying with friends im sure text him tell him youre worried durbin back at the sofa sat down heavily youre right youre right and you might think about getting some sleep you too he paused i think kathys been missing you chuck looked up sharply a frown etched in place why do you say that she mentioned a little something about it thats none of anybody elses business i didnt say it was im just passing along the information for what its worth from a guy whos just lost his wife to a guy whos still got one chuck stared at michael with what seemed like true malevolence for a long few seconds then finally let out a heavy breath looking down at the pile of papers on the floor the smaller stack on his lap he managed a weak smile sorry mike i think were probably both done in maybe we ought to call it a day citytalk by jeffrey elliot sources close to the investigation yesterday sat down with this reporter to explain the events of the past few weeks related to ro curtlee and the murder of janice durbin san franciscos beleaguered head of homicide lieutenant abe glitsky has been under fire from both mayor leland crawford and from printed accusations of harassment and police brutality in a rival newspaper it is public record that glitsky and curtlee have a long history as antagonists beginning with the formers arrest of the latter for rape and murder back in charges for which mr curtlee was convicted and sentenced to twentyfive years to life in prison early this year the ninth circuit court of appeal overturned that conviction and ordered a retrial and since that time mr curtlee has been free on bail also since the time of mr curtlees release three people with connections to his earlier trial have been murdered these are felicia nunez a prime witness against mr curtlee matt lewis an investigator for the district attorneys office and janice durbin the wife of the foreman of the jury in the curtlee trial michael durbin and only last week in a highly publicized sequence of events lieutenant glitsky arrested mr curtlee again on charges ranging from death threats and resisting arrest to attempted murder during his arrest mr curtlee fought with police including glitsky and sustained several injuries including a broken arm two of the arresting officers were also injured and again ro curtlee was released on bail the common denominator in all of these crimes is ro curtlee officers sought and obtained an interview with mr curtlee in the presence of his lawyer to determine his whereabouts and activities at the time of these latest two murders in an effort to eliminate him as a suspect in either of them he provided them with alibis for both and that is where the matter stands at this time despite the hysteria generated by the courier a curtleeowned newspaper and no friend of the police there seems no evidence suggesting that these have been other than straightforward murder investigations police have named no suspects in the matt lewis or janice durbin murders what has been widely publicized as police harassment in some circles may well instead be seen as a simple attempt by the rich and powerful to use their political and media influence to insulate themselves from investigation for a series of brutal crimes glitsky at his kitchen table nodded in a kind of grateful relief as he read these last words as usual jeff elliot had gotten it right his tone reasonable maybe this he thought sipping his tea would help to lower the temperature a little around all this madness and he could get back to just doing his job he folded up the chronicle and was rinsing out his mug getting ready to leave the duplex and go to work early when the telephone rang it was just after six oclock which gave the trained investigator in him a clue as to who it possibly was he hoped he took the two steps across the kitchen and picked up before the second ring hello hey hey everybody okay everybodys fine except i miss you you do i do of course i do i thought you were furious at me mad not furious frustrated now im over it and just miss you i miss you too i can fly down this weekend if youre going to stay if im going to stay are you i dont know i havent decided it seems so stupid and melodramatic to be down here but up there it felt real and scary i just dont know what hell do abe nobody does thats what makes him so scary i mean what are the odds hed really try anything with any of us if therere any odds theyre too great now you sound like me good youre obviously the smart one he paused you know on second thought maybe you ought to think about staying down there a few more days i can fly down make it a vacation for the weekend hows sixto holding up with the kids my brother are you kidding he wants to keep them forever maybe we could do a little negotiation get a night away i could do that glitsky took a breath i wasnt sure we were okay were okay were different but okay i dont do the risk thing so well you shouldnt have to you shouldnt either well then i should change jobs which you dont want to do no i dont somebodys got to hang in there and do it and im temperamentally suited its a curse but its who i am i know and i dont want you to change i love who you are a sudden surge of emotion made his head go light he put his hand up to steady himself against the wall ill call when i know what time ill get in at burbank he said lou the greeks opened for business at six oclock in the morning every day but sunday the barrestaurant occupied a semihygienic semisubterranean space directly across the street from the hall of justice and this location made it a favorite for cops and jurors and lawyers at lunchtime it tended to be packed with humanity the tiny tables and sixperson booths equally hard or impossible to come by and this in spite of the fact that the only item on the menu was the special a mostly edible sometimes not sometimes delicious combination of flavors and textures drawn from the rather disparate culinary cultures of both greece and china only greece and china lous wife chiu upon whom the chronicle had a few years before bestowed the sobriquet most creative chef in the city had an undeniable knack no doubt about itsouvlaki char siu bao barbecue red pork moussaka hot and sour and lemon curd dolma stew crispy duck pita pockets and the everpopular and mysterious yeanling clay bowl but before lunchtime and especially in the early morning lous was a haven for serious drinkers not so much the indigent or homeless alcoholics as one might suspect but in general a welldressed and blearyeyed clientele of men and a few women who often were in line down the steps to the front door by the time lou opened up at the crack of dawn the stools at the bar which had closed four hours earlier were usually filled up before lou could ring up the first sale on this friday morning though the main action wasnt at the bar but in the booth farthest from it along the righthand wall and nobody was drinking anything alcoholic a galvanized farrell positively dapper in armani had made some important decisions and in fact had already sprung into action during the night and finally hed contacted the principals who would need to be involved in his plan and told them that he needed them at lous by seven am so he was sitting against the wall next to amanda jenkins and looking across the table at glitsky and an uncomfortable vi lapeer everybody had already expressed their condolences and outrage about wess dog gert then said nice things to abe about the mornings citytalk column and after that vein had played itself out farrell drank some of his coffee cleared his throat and spoke in a voice that though firm was so quiet that it could have been a stage whisper this is the most offtherecord conversation any of you will ever have with me i would vastly prefer it if not one word of it got out to anyone beyond the four of us is that acceptable to all of you eyebrows went up in surprise all around the table but no one objected and within a few seconds all nodded their assent all right then farrell went on ive asked you all here this morning because after all he and his family have put us all through the last couple of weeks ive decided that enough is enough its my intention to get ro curtlee back behind bars by tonight fuckin a jenkins said pumping her fist yes although he nodded again in apparent agreement glitskys brows came together in his default frown while chief lapeer sitting across from farrell against the wall squinted in consternation threw a quick glance at glitsky then came back to wes how are you planning to do that the short answer is that im going to indict him he spent a few moments bringing everyone up to speed on the grand jury explaining the relatively newly hatched strategy of tying via motive ros earlier conviction to the current crimes he was suspected of committing thus creating the special circumstances farrell would need to outright deny him bail when he finished amanda had a perplexed look on her face i understand the strategy wes but the grand jury doesnt meet until tuesday and even then but farrell was shaking his head ive called them into emergency session this morning at eight oclock this morning but how did you amanda began i called them at home last night i got fourteen of them to commit to be there and left messages for the other six and i only need twelve so were good to go except that im not nearly prepared thats not going to be your problem you know the basic argument thats what youre going to give them but without any new evidence its not going to be enough weve got solid gold evidence from the original trial for sandoval i already have the good dr strout coming in to say she was raped ive got the evidence tech to say that the sperm in her was ros and since nunez is dead we can read her transcript into the record thats all we should need for her then strout can talk about how nunez is dead the crime scene guys say that the body was naked except for she was wearing shoes and arnie becker says it was arson we get a detective to say that ro was out on bail facing a trial during which nunez was expected to testify that gives us multiple murder specials and the specials of murdering a witness to prevent testimony jenkins obviously excited by these possibilities still had her doubts what about janice durbin we have a johnson problem she was referring to the case that requires the district attorney to tell the grand jury about possible exculpatory evidence if we try to subpoena curtlees alibi for durbin which is his parents theyll know what were doing denardi will at least delay the whole thing maybe block it indefinitely right farrell said so heres what we do we get the indictments for sandoval and nunez first we start the grand jury on durbin maybe even present a couple of witnesses then we subpoena ros alibihis parents and employeesbut by then hes already in custody for the first two and they can screw around as much as they want when we get the indictment for durbin we join it up to the other two we dont we still have him in jail on multiple murder no bail he looked around at a quorum of clear skeptics listen ive spent thirty years hearing that as far as the grand jury is concerned any da worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich well i guess were going to find out if im worth my salt and prove it once and for all if we can but doesnt that mean youll have to try him on those charges lapeer asked eventually maybe i thought it was within sixty days glitsky said farrell allowed himself a selfsatisfied smile yes and if ros lawyers want to argue that theyre ready to go to trial in sixty days guess what then theyre obviously ready to defend him on the remand trial arent they since its the exact same case they cant have it both ways glitsky held up a finger dont get me wrong id love to see him in jail yesterday but ive still got concerns about janice durbin what about her well ros got the alibi witnesses even if theyre all lying thats a lot of firepower for a jury to ignore even a grand jury by the time they hear from those alibi witnesses hes already in custody for our two best cases farrell said i think theyll indict in spite of the alibi but if they dont no harm no foul okay glitsky persisted but for the real trial then were back to what i just said a minute ago they cant have it both ways if theyre ready for one trial then theyre ready for both or either and meanwhile ros out of circulation which is a consummation devoutly to be wished i think we all agree amen to that glitsky said hear hear jenkins added lapeer finally spoke up so what do you need me for wes farrell drew a breath twirled his coffee cup around for a moment with both hands i know youve been taking a beating on this since the minute you took office chief i also understand why you were persuaded to withdraw your surveillance people you had attached to ro lapeers brow clouded how did you even hear about that word gets out chief thats the way it is but even so i thought you might have given me the courtesy weve all got jobs were trying to hold on to here mr farrell she said if his honor gets one more excuse to let me go and this surveillance was going to be one farrell held up his hand i said i understood your problem so now im asking you to do what im doing and whats that pretend that none of thiswhat were talking about privately here this morningnone of this is happening pretend that were not going ahead with the grand jury were beaten and cowed into submission pretend that were not keeping ro under surveillance but in fact were not well we will be here farrell took a beat letting out a breath he seemed to have been holding with an almost audible sigh what i propose we do this morning is send out a couple of unmarked vehicles to the curtlees home starting as soon as this breaks up here theyve got five automobiles up therethree in the garage and a matched set of white suvs usually driven by their butler and the household staff any one of those vehicles leaves the premises we trail them first stop they make somebody sticks a gps under the bumper lapeer had her hands clasped tightly in front of her on the table and why are we doing this right now she asked two reasons first from everything hes done so far ro is almost undoubtedly on the lookout for the other witness in his trial a woman named gloria gonzalvez and if he finds her it probably wont be pretty to say nothing of the fact that were looking for her as well so shell testify again at the retrial theres a reasonable chance he might lead us to her and if he does we want to get her into protection so youre saying you want to try to follow him again lapeer asked no farrell admitted i dont think we can do that too much manpower not to mention its too expensive and too much visibility okay so if were not following him how do we know if he gets near her and ps he might not stay in the car anyway he leaves it at the bart station then what glitsky cleared his throat well plus wes ive got a problem too what is it if we have to follow every car that leaves the house sooner or later theyre going to notice and talk about it odds are decent somebody among them thinks about a gps i dont even want to think about the press reaction if that comes out lapeer said we think were on the hot plate now amanda all but snapped we can certainly justify wanting to keep some kind of tabs on a convicted rapist and murderer which lets not forget is what ro is whatever spin sheila marrenas puts on it this is a reasonable and defensible strategy lapeer shot back at her so is everything else weve done and it doesnt seem to have made any difference especially to the mayor fuck the mayor amanda said hes just casting for votes as always well youll pardon me if i dont want to challenge him any more than i already have if we dont play by the book this is by the book glitsky the voice of reason put in theres nothing illegal about either tailing him or planting a gps provided the car is in a public place and we attach it to some exterior part of the vehicle no fourth amendment problem its legal period even the ninth circuit thinks so and they dont like much that we do farrell did a little drumroll on the table heres the deal people quite simply we cant lose him again especially if we get this indictment today which i am determined to do well want to serve it immediately and to do that weve got to know where he is he scanned around the table can we all be on board with that amanda and glitsky were both nodding and farrell zeroed in on lapeer vi finally she came to her decision lets just be extra goddamn careful planting these goddamn devices can we at ten oclock sharp eztli walked up the stairs and found ro alone sitting at the dining room table having a breakfast of coffee fruit and bacon barefoot and dressed in gray sweats he might have slept in he hadnt yet shaved or combed his hair i just got a call on my cell from lupe garcia eztli said somebody says they found gloria gonzalvez ro put down his forkful of cantaloupe youve got to be kidding me no i dont think so in two days i told you money talks awesome ro said where is she the guy wont say till he sees the money which is only smart so what do we do well hes down at lupes now ro took a bite of bacon and chewed ruminatively for a moment then pushed his chair back and grabbed a last sip of coffee time is money he said with a victory smile let me throw on some clothes ill be right back down ill be waiting eztli said and ro yeah youre not going to like this but dont bring the gun ro stopped in the doorway dont bring the gun what are you talking about i love that thing i know you do but you dont want it anywhere near you if we get pulled over for any reason which as weve seen can happen your parents would kill me if i let you get arrested for something that stupid theyre not going to arrest me again or even try if youre carrying they wont have a choice what about you what about me youre packing am i right i have a license to carry and of course its not the same piece after the other day that ones in my safe in my room until i have a chance to get rid of it but i just got mine you got any idea how long ive been without a piece a guy feels naked and not in a good way eztli sighed with a hint of impatience i realize that i know its a disappointment but getting our hands on that piece was the exercise yesterday fun and instructive and in a pinch youll know where it is but today we wont need it good i dont like it but yeah all right because they had to make a stop at the bank for cash they didnt get down to lupes until about noon once there they drove around the back of the bynowfamiliar warehouse to where a doublewide trailer sat incongruously up against a hill that looked as though it had been stripmined at the back of the large parking lot a brisk breeze blew under a pewter gray sky as they got out of the suv and up the steps to the front door they rang the bell and a short heavyset latina answered with a mere nod for an introduction she directed them past the kitchen and eating area and along a short hallway to what was obviously the mans business side of the trailer lupe and three other hispanic men sat each with a bottle of negra modelo beer in a large living room that would have been spacious but for the clutter besides the enormous flatscreen television set a low blackglass coffee table a metal bench two couches and three leather barcaloungers lupe or whoever had a penchant for storing things out in the open and all around the periphery of the room on the floor were both opened and stillclosed cases of beer and tequila used pizza boxes piles of girlie and dogfight and hotrod magazines the three windowstwo on one wall and one on the otherhad no curtains and even with the overcast day the room had a certain brightness when eztli and ro entered lupe stood up and he and eztli greeted each other with an arm around the neck and a chest bump lupe then nodded in a businesslike way to ro and said something in spanish that eztli answered then translated for ro he says this is a good way to find people put out a reward ro shrugged whatever works he said here is your man hector lupe reverted to english for ros benefit turning around he pointed at one of the men whod come forward in one of the barcaloungers and who upon hearing his name stood up his face with a hopeful helpful expression and his hands clasped in front of him ro looked at him and laughed guy looks like hes going to piss himself he gave what sounded like a dog bark and at the same time made a quick lurch in hectors direction and the diminutive worker jumped as though a current had passed through him everybody except hector got a chuckle out of that ro straightened up and laughed again then turned back to lupe tell him i dont bite then directly to him easy jose i dont bite hector the man said in a quavering voice hector jose whatever the point is wheres gloria hector threw a plaintive look at lupe who interpreted it and said first the money first the money naturally sighing dramatically nodding ro reached into his jeans front pocket and extracted a thick stack of foldedover hundreddollar bills handing them over to lupe he said you want me to count em out no lupe said if its wrong he will tell us he looked back over to hector whose eyes were glued to the bills all right hector theyve come all the way down here to talk to you time to tell them what you know hector pulled out his cell phone this is the woman youre looking for si he showed ro the picture he recognized her immediately thats her all right where is she but hector perhaps understanding that he only had leverage until he gave up his information put on an apologetic face i am sorry but before i will need the money he said in english theres the money ro said gesturing to it then to lupe give him the goddamn money lupe turned back to ro what is he going to do with all of this money where is he going to put it does he even have a bank account im trying to save him a lot of trouble ask me if i give a shit ro said with a final small show of reluctance lupe held out the wad of cash then reverted back to spanish saying something to hector who simply took the bills and nodded in satisfaction stuffing them into his pants pocket ro turned to hector okay you got the money talk to me out of his other pants pocket hector extracted a folded piece of paper opened it and passed it across to ro in pencil written in block letters he saw the name gloria serrano and a street address with the word sunnyvale under it he pointed at the name and asked hector so gloria serrano si you know for a fact she lives at this address then a thought occurred to him what if it turns out its not the right one hector made a face i know its the right address i know her husband ro said to lupe you know where this fucker lives if he got it wrong lupe turned and spoke in spanish to one of the other two men near jorge he said he can find him hed better be able to really lupe said no problem he pointed at the piece of paper that is your woman hector said a few more sentences in spanish after which all the other men looked around at one another and laughed whats funny ro turned to eztli and asked hector suggested a way that lupe could get some money out of this was that maybe after the woman gets her inheritance lupe could go by and see if shed like to give him some of it for helping to find her so she could claim it after a minute to let it sink in ro threw a baleful look at hector and said good idea jose then lets go ez were done here lupe his crew and hector were still standing around while lupe went to one of the windows to watch eztli and ro get into their car and drive out of the lot when they had gone around the corner of the warehouse lupe turned around and walked over to where hector stood waiting for something else to happen with jorge cristobal and lupes companion a wiry rail of steel named daniel hey man lupe said to hector in spanish you still look like you got to pee you got to take a leak is that it murillo was in fact shifting his weight from foot to foot hands in his pockets as though he were cold lupes face set in a half smile didnt signal a warning of any kind as he brought his fisted right hand up in a vicious punch to hectors cheek the backs of the young mans knees hit the glass coffee table and he fell heavily over it and down on his back to the floor before he had any time to even begin to recover daniel was on him his knees on his arms holding them useless pummeling his face and head with a flurry of punches after hed knocked any chance of a fight out of him he jumped back up to his feet and with the fury still on him kicked at his head two three four times until at last lupe reached out and grabbed him daniel bastantes seemingly unable to stop himself daniel struck out another time with his boot then finally reluctantly stepped back breathing hard he continued to back away while lupe went around the table and leaned down over hectors now nearly motionless body he reached into the boys jeans pocket and pulled out the folded wad of bills then straightened up and kicked murillo in the side once more for good measure idiota then he turned to face jorge and daniel peeling hundreddollar bills off and counting them out dos tres quatro cinco he handed the first five hundred to jorge then counted out another equal share to daniel finally he looked down at hector still unconscious i offer this little prick two thousand dollars and he tells me no the money is all his he walked back over a couple of steps hawked and spit on him then looked over at daniel go dump this trash someplace he said jorge get us both a couple of beers would you farrell only needed twelve to issue an indictment but as it turned out he persuaded fourteen of the grand jurors to come in on their friday off for the emergency session now and for the past hour and a half they were seated in front of amanda jenkins and listening attentively many taking notes as she finished outlining her case against ro curtlee jenkins knew that in spite of the earlier sandoval conviction this was going to be close she needed twelve votes to indict and she was all but certain that she had ten but all four of her skeptical jurors had independently peppered each of the witnesses so far with questions about the lack of physical evidence in the nunez case and one of them a retired schoolteacher named julian ross had in the course of his questions gone from the specific to the general which amanda feared in this case might sway the others what had taken so long to bring this tenyearold case to the grand jury jenkins had assured them that while she could not discuss specifics it was for delays that had nothing to do with the strength of the evidence and that they should not consider it didnt inspector glitsky find it unusual that police had uncovered no physical evidence implicating mr curtlee in the nunez murder glitsky had emphasized the motive the way the body was found and other similarities between the killings amanda was nearly to the end farrell had told her to let them take a short recess before they received instructions and began to deliberate he had something more he wanted to bring before the grand jury and now here farrell was sitting at the witness stand hed come up during the break after amanda had called him on her cell phone a couple of clerks from the das office had accompanied him one of them pushing a dolly that held a goodsize cardboard box which theyd picked up and deposited on the evidence table in front of him farrells presence here was extremely problematic to say the least he knew that if not political suicide the legal fallout of having the district attorney be a witness in his own case would be enormous certainly the courts would say that with the chief prosecutor as a witness the office would never be permitted to continue handling the matter they might even toss out any indictment as a product of prosecutorial misconduct he could see the words like unethical and indefensible appearing in the ultimate decision farrell knew that what he was supposed to do was call the attorney generals conflict staff and turn the case over to it and if he hadnt known it jenkins had told him that three times in the five minutes before he took the stand he flat didnt care at least if i get run out of office he thought grimly i can wear any goddamn tshirt i want so they had cleared everyone from the room except amanda farrell and the grand jurors what was happening here would remain secret until a transcript was prepared and turned over to the defense and in the meantime hopefully ro curtlee would be behind bars while they regrouped and formed a plan to keep him there even if it was the ag who ended up with the case farrell and his office would have done what they could and then it began under questioning by jenkins farrell told the grand jury why he was before them yesterday afternoon i received a telephone call from cliff curtlee the father of ro he had come into the information that i was planning on convening this grand jury at its regular time next tuesday when i would present the evidence that youve heard today and seek a nobail indictment against ro tell the grand jury what he told you jenkins said he said to me and i remember the quote exactly i dont want this grand jury thing to move forward it would be a bad thing for you personally if it did suddenly farrell had to grip the front rail of the witness box almost as though he were going to faint swallowing blinking back his emotions he struggled to regain his composure excuse me he said this is difficult jenkins had the box hed brought earlier into the courtroom marked as an exhibit and put it in front of him tell us please do you recognize the contents of this box i do will you please show the contents to the grand jury opening the top of the carton farrell reached in with both hands lifted gerts body out and laid it gently on the table giving her a last loving pet he looked up at the members of the jury several of whom appeared stricken this was my dog gert she was on the street in front of my girlfriends place of business yesterday jenkins then asked mr farrell what if anything did you do with gerts body i had it taken to the police laboratory early last night for testing amanda turned to the panel and explained mr farrell cant testify about the results of the test because he didnt do them himself but what he was told by the lab techs explains what he did next which is why im going to ask him mr farrell what did you learn from the lab farrell couldnt keep the emotion out of his voice somebody poisoned my dog mr farrell you talked about your partners place of business what is that place of business she runs a rape crisis center on haight street does it have surveillance equipment it does based on what the lab told you did you go and download some photographs from that surveillance equipment i did jenkins produced an eightbyten blackandwhite photo of the bmw z and had it marked as an exhibit according to the surveillance equipment when was this photo taken right about the time the dog was poisoned he said can you see the license number on that vehicle jenkins produced a certified dmv record had it marked as an exhibit and handed it to farrell tell the grand jurors mr farrell based on the photo and those records whose car was parked near the rape crisis center just before your dog was poisoned the records indicate farrell said that the car belonged to ro curtlee jenkins let a long minute pass before she concluded questions from the grand jury mr farrell youre excused after being admonished like every other witness by the foreperson not to discuss his testimony farrell got up and nodding soberly as he passed jenkins walked out of the room down in his office wes closed and locked his door behind him his whole body was shaking with the cynical enormity of what hed just done crossing over to the foosball table he grabbed two of the near handles and put all of his weight on them closing his eyes he sucked in a deep breath swallowing against the urge to throw up hed been through difficult times before in his trials his failed marriage with his children in his life but never before had he completely abandoned his essential view of himself as a good man an honest man a man of good character and he had justwillingly knowingly with aforethoughtdone exactly that he didnt kid himself he knew that what hed said and shown the grand jury might have been marginally relevanteven there he was on thin ice but he also knew that the way he did it appearing as a witness in his own prosecution was at very best unprofessional if not flatout unethical he had done something he knew he wasnt supposed to do in the grand jury room there was no check on his power it was virtually absolute and it had corrupted him absolutely he remembered what treya glitsky had told him in his first days in office that his predecessor clarence jackman had stayed on because hed become addicted to the power and now farrell had a clear understanding of what she had meant this was his rubiconhe was cheating he knew he was cheating he would cheat again under similar conditions and then suddenly the shaking within him stilled into a calm acceptance he let go his death grip on the handles got his weight back onto his feet surveying the shattered remnants of his conscience as though from a great height he felt neither guilt nor pain only a mild regret at its former gentle insistence upon the right and the fair the last vestige of his idealistic youth what mattered most to him was that in the sacred secrecy of the grand jury room jenkins would get her twelve votes im sorry abe amanda jenkins said i just cant seem to stop crying crying is okay its not like baseball we allow crying in law enforcement even encourage it there are classes trying to keep it light it didnt work i dont know whether it was the dog the stupid beautiful dog or relief or even matt i mean matt i still cant believe she couldnt go on dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief glitsky put an arm around her she had come down to his office to share with him what she hoped would be the upcoming good news about the indictment except that as she started telling him it had blindsided her in the end she couldnt stand being cooped up inside the hall of justice any longer and shed borrowed glitskys spare raincoat and theyd snuck out the back stairs down to bryant and now were walking east in the misty cold gray windy early afternoon you know what else i cant stop i cant stop thinking i want them to kill him she said i want this indictment so bad and then i want him to just think about resisting arrest and have them kill him maybe they will they walked another half block in silence glitsky tightened his arm briefly around her shoulders and then let it drop as they continued side by side assuming we get the vote you think well really get him she asked i dont see why not we got him last time not without a little difficulty but we got him well get him again whos going out lapeers picking a couple of special teams assuming the grand jury decides soon enough theyll be waiting for him when he gets home not you glitskys mouth went up a quarter inch wiser heads prevailed id have thought you wanted to be there i did she took my interest into consideration another half block a restaurant with happy early tgif revelers a body repair shop a tattoo parlor four homeless people gets home from where jenkins asked wherever they wind up going they him and the butler they left at around ten thirty we got him tagged with the gps when he stopped at his bank about ten minutes later so whered they go after that san bruno for a half hour or so and finally sunnyvale now for a while i checked just before you came in he was still there whats down there i dont know some lunch place maybe a whorehouse i glitsky came to a standstill put his hand on jenkins arm what abe i just had a horrible thought he said i could be wrong im probably wrong what glitsky was already turned around starting back toward the hall weve got to get back and find out for sure he said abe what she asked again not what who he said gloria gonzalvez gloria built her work schedule so she would get the maximum time with her children there was no avoiding leaving her baby threeyearold bettina every day with angela who was a find at eighteen really more like an older sister than a babysitter but with the boys ramon and her sixyearold geraldo both of them finally spending their full days in school she could leave home just after they caught the bus at eight clean her five or six housesonly four on fridayand still be home by the time they got there at three thirty or thereabouts today shed finished a little bit earlier than usual dropped off her two helpers at their apartments then did a little grocery shopping for dinner and the weekend before stopping by angelas to pick up bettina now she had an hour or so before the boys got home as she turned into her block enough time to get dinner started and play with her baby alone which was such a rare and special treat that they both loved her street down in the flats just to the west of the freeway was wearing its shabby winter coat today the trees bare the small standalone houses in dull and faded pastels what lawns there were as gray as the leaden sky above this was a neighborhood of working people and the line of cars that sometimes made parking at the curb so challenging at night and on the weekends was missing making the street feel all the more deserted gloria thought it was a little odd to notice a brandnew white suv parked a couple of houses down from hers people on this block didnt buy showroomquality toyotas or lexuses or whatever the car was it was out of place enough that she glanced over as she drove by and was reassured by the latino driverwell dressed but clearly one of them someone who belonged here maybe someones cousin she thought or new boyfriend she pulled her own ruststained green midnineties honda into her driveway and pulled all the way in so that she could enter by the back door directly into the kitchen she had bettina buckled behind her in her backwardfacing baby seat and she went around to the cars back door opened it leaned over and gave her a quick kiss on the cheekmomento chica then she opened the cars front passenger door to get out her two grocery bags and closed that door when she had them both with a bag in each hand she turned and went up the three steps on her back stoop putting the bags down she fished for a second in her purse for her keys then found them and opened the back door picking up the bags again she brought them inside the house put them on the counter and then remembered that shed bought some haagendazs dulce de leche ice cream robertos favorite she didnt want to let that get warm and start to melt so she dug down in the bag for it and crossed the kitchen to put the carton in the freezer all the while shed been softly humming to herself as she did when she was happy and suddenly she thought she heard something closing up the freezer she stopped and listened intently her head cocked to one side what had that sounded like the answer came to her in a flasha car door openingjust as she turned and bolted for the back door and out onto the stoop and there was a man already halfway out of her car on bettinas side the close side to her straightening up and turning around holding her baby in his arms she stopped her eyes wide with terror frozen ro curtlee was holding her baby hey gloria he said with his terrible smile all these years and youre still a damn finelooking woman glitsky placed a cell phone call to the sunnyvale police department while he was jogging back to the hall of justice since he hadnt placed it as a call the dispatcher down there put him on hold before he could get a chance to state his business two blocks later as he was getting to the steps of the hall he gave up hung up and tried which was busy inside the building he lost his signal altogether he ran down the internal hallway that led him to southern station the police precinct located on the ground floor within the hall of justice where a sergeant named mildred bornhorst was monitoring the gps results here glitsky learned that ros car was still parked down in sunnyvale where it had been for more than an hour glitsky got the relevant information such as it was to give to the emergency operator but again he couldnt get past the busy signal it was not until he was in his office againthe clogged river of humanity in the lobby the long ride up in the worlds slowest elevatorthat he could punch up the emergency numbers again on a landline this time through a disturbance in the force he got through and in another two minutes was talking to a sergeant bransen at the sunnyvale police department the suspect is ro curtlee glitsky was explaining he spelled out the name hes out on bail on a rapemurder charge theres no bail on a rapemurder charge the sergeant said dont ask glitsky snapped in any event hes armed and dangerous hes due to get indicted on multiple murder within the next couple of hours so if you can get in his face any way you can wed appreciate it more than i can tell you get in his face whats that mean is he indicted or isnt he he should be by the time you find him what if he isnt then you can at least slow him down another hesitation then glitsky heard and whats he doing again i think hes threatening or harming one of the witnesses whos going to testify against him whos that gloria gonzalvez although that might not be her name anymore she might have gotten married or just changed it all right so gloria somebody right and where does the gps put him glitsky had written down this information and now he consulted his notepad and said it looks like the nine hundred block of dennis drive between burnham and agnes okay whats the address theyre in front of i dont know exactly license number of the car glitsky gave it to him okay and where the woman lives her address i dont know that either a slight hesitation on the other end perhaps a sigh of impatience glitskys blood pounded from his temples to the center of his forehead look the guy is serious as a heart attack and hes down there now hes probably stalking this gloria woman you need to just send some units down and check it out be a presence you see a guy who looks like he doesnt belong get his id if its curtlee hold him or if the indictments come down take him in you suggest we go door to door yeah absolutely if you have to can i get the spelling of your name again sure glitsky blew out heavily to release some of his own frustration then spelled it out for him im head of san francisco homicide all right i hear you ill send a unit over more than one would be better another hesitation ill see what i can do on the way down to sunnyvale and although it was illegal even for a cop like glitsky to use his cell phone while he was driving he checked in again with sergeant bransen he had sent a couple of squad cars over to dennis drive but there had been nothing suspicious going on there his officers had not seen fit to go door to door glitsky placed another call back to southern station at the hall and talked to sfpds own sergeant bornhorst again manning the gps feed since the morning from bornhorst he learned that ros car had moved on from its sunnyvale location and was now on the freeway going north back up toward the city there were no units highway patrol or local in any kind of pursuit but bornhorst assured glitsky that as soon as word of the indictment came down if it did police could pull the car over and pick up roit would take some coordination with mobile units but they could get it done glitsky was sure she was right but because of his own history with ro as well as the new chief of polices need to avoid the appearance of anything personal sullying the arrest lapeer had rather pointedly taken glitsky out of the decisionmaking process on her strategy to serve ro with the indictment and get him back into custody the chief was assembling a special team for the takedown and from what glitsky had heard it was going to be near or at ros house where he could be expectedeventuallyto turn up assuming of course that the grand jury could make up its mind on indictment for the first two murders before the end of the day by this time glitsky was twothirds of the way down to sunnyvale he could still be useful he had his own reasons for finding gloria gonzalvez during his drive down the peninsula the clouds had bunched up and condensed and now a stiff cold rain pelted his windshield as he turned into dennis drive cruising the length of the street fortunately only one block long there was still just barely enough light to assure himself that sure enough neither of ros two probable vehicles were parked at the curb finding a space more or less at random he parallel parked into it and sat for a moment hoping for a break in the rain since he realized to his chagrin that he only had his regular mountain hardwear jackethed loaned his raincoat to amanda jenkins for their walk up in the city and she no doubt still had it finally giving up as the rain kept falling he got out and jogged from his car to the nearest house that showed a light got under the front door overhang and rang the doorbell after a moment the inside door behind the screen opened a crack and a female voice said yes glitsky a large black man with a fierce countenance and a long scar up and down across his mouth almost never encountered less than a severely reserved welcome from his unexpected appearance at someones door if not one of actual fear and this woman was proving to be about typical so he had his badge out and introduced himself then continued im looking for a woman whose first name is gloria who lives on this street her last name used to be and maybe still is gonzalvez i believe she may be in danger and id like to talk to her the woman didnt open the door any farther simply said sorry and closed it glitsky didnt waste any time hoping to alter her worldview about how to act if policemen came to her door requesting information instead reasoning that she would probably at least know the name of her nextdoor neighbors he skipped the next house and the one after that jogging through the rain and a few houses down another house had lights showing and he turned in and tried again this time the resident was a middleaged african american man and he opened his door and actually gave glitsky a smile wet enough for you out there he said just about glitsky held up his badge and gave him his pitch the man didnt have to think about it thatd be gloria serrano he actually came out and stood next to glitsky on the small porch pointing to be helpful shes four houses down on the other side the blue shutters is she all right i hope so glitsky said thank you you need any help no youve been one thanks half a minute later glitsky rang her doorbell it was apparent that several people were inside there was a bit of commotionchildrens exclamations and then an authoritative mans voice when the door opened glitsky was holding his badge out again and looking at an obviously angry worried hispanic male of about thirtyfive he was holding a fireplace poker in his right hand and looked ready to use it at the slightest provocation si abe glitsky san francisco homicide he said homocidio comprendo behind the man the small living room was well lit two young boys stole glances at glitsky around their fathers legs glitsky caught a glimpse of a woman sitting on the couch who appeared to be holding a toddler on her lap and now hearing glitskys name she stood up and came into the light roberto its all right she said i know him let him in she offered glitsky a small bath towel to dry his head and his face and hung his soakingwet jacket on the back of a chair over a heating duct the house was pin neat bare bones and warm the windows cloudy with condensation glitsky sat down across from her sideways to roberto at the formica table just off the living room she had the toddler back on her lap while the father ordered the young boys to sit quietly on the couch which they did without a word of resistance to glitsky there seemed to be enough tension in the room to spontaneously combust im so glad i found you glitsky began she forced a polite smile its good to see you too is there a problem well glitskys relief at seeing her alive and unharmed was substantial there may be i dont know if youve heard but ro curtlee has been released from prison she glanceda warningat her husband then pulled the toddler in closer to her her arms encircling her bouncing her on her knee she shook her head no how did that happen he appealed the guilty verdict and theyre going to give him a retrial in the meanwhile they let him out on bail why did they do that theres no good answer to that the point is they did so you havent heard from him no why would i have heard from him he might want to talk you out of testifying against him again because if he has a new trial were going to need you to give your testimony again but i have already done that last time yes i know doesnt that count anymore what i said yes but it will be more persuasive if you tell it to a jury again i am sorry she said but i do not think i can do that another time glitsky of course never thought this was going to be easy i can understand how you feel that way he said but its come to the point now where you are the most important witness from the last trial if we are going to hope to put him back in prison gloria looked again at her husband whose eyes had never left glitsky and who hadnt moved a muscle since hed sat down how has it come to that point what about the other witnesses what about felicia glitsky took in a quick breath and came out with it felicia is dead gloria crossed herself her lip quivering she was in a fire glitsky said since ro got out of prison a hesitation then a nod yes he killed her maybe thats not impossible suddenly roberto spoke up she cannot do this again he said that is all well im afraid thats not all sir ive been trying to locate gloria for almost a month now that ive found her all of you id like to put herand now your familyinto a witness protection program until the trial no we cannot do that gloria said i did that last time when i was alone but now we have jobs a life as you see i cant just disappear again it would only be until you testified like last time and when would that be august at least maybe later she almost broke a smile at the absurdity of the request no she said i am no threat to him and he is no danger to me if i dont testify so i will not it is simple glitsky all at once felt a chill settle on him and he shivered against it he did not want to bring undue pressure to bear on this woman but she had to realize the danger of her situation do you know how i found you here he asked her and when she shook her head no he went on we put a tracking devicea gps uniton ros car he drove down to this street today and stayed here nearly two hours roberto and she shared another blink of a look i was not here she said you didnt see him he didnt talk to you this time glorias glance at her husband conveyed a true message dont say a word no she said i will simply call his parents and tell them i wont testify he will not come back glitsky held his hands clasped tightly on the table in front of him he became aware of the tension in them and consciously willed them to relax he didnt want to snap or become argumentative positions from which thered be no extrication he met glorias eyes tried to soften what he knew was the harsh set of his features he came by here this afternoon and threatened your children didnt he he said in an even tone isnt that what really happened she was not even remotely skilled as a liar after her eyes went wide she looked over to her husband for help who couldnt manage much more than a whatcanyoudo shrug finally she shook her head several times much too quickly i just told you yes you did you told me he didnt do anything like that glitsky leaned in toward her was that the truth again she silently begged her husband to step in but either he couldnt read the signal or he didnt know what to do with it her eyes went across the room to the two boys sitting on the sofa she wrapped her arms more protectively about the toddler on her lap at last she shook her head again i did not see him she said i dont know why he was parked here glitsky lowered his voice to an allbutinaudible whisper i dont want to alarm your children gloria but i think he came down here to kill you just like he killed felicia nunez and then when he saw you had children he had a better idea she just stared at him he needs to be back in prison glitsky said so that he wont be able to hurt anyone else he will not hurt my children if i dont testify she said there would be no reason how do you know that glitsky asked how can you be sure of that please it is no use she lifted her chin and met his eyes i just know driving back up to the city on the bayshore freeway the cars heater blasting away and his windshield wipers swishing at top speed glitsky tried to console himself with the fact that at least now he had a name and address for gloria serrano and that other more persuasive souls in the das office might convince her that she needed to testify again against ro that might still happen he thought especially once they got him back into jail and he was no longer a direct threat to her children his mind kept returning to the question of how ro had located gloria so quickly and again it returned to the old familiar theme of the citys stupid police budget he was sure that ros success was a function of his ability to hire private investigators who could use private and in some case downright illegal methods to locate missing persons or persons who wanted to be missing he was working himself up into a fine lather about it as his cell phone chirped on the seat next to him seeing the name wes farrell on the screen he dispensed with the preliminaries tell me we got the indictment better late than never we got the indictment fifteen minutes ago hallelujah thats what i said too sorry i didnt call you sooner but i thought vi needed to know first true enough she got her teams in place not yet i only just called her last she heard from her gps people he was already back in town from somewhere down the peninsula sunnyvale glitsky said he found gloria gonzalvez god shit no farrells voice went hollow youre not telling me no he just threatened her kids because it was so much more fun now shes saying she wont testify against him it might be a hard sell getting her back on board well maybe when she finds out hes back in jail thats what i was hoping too so did the chief say how long it would be before they could move she said she had to gather the troops some of em evidently have already gone home though theyre all on call then she first wanted to make sure where ro was going next place he stops which her guess is his house her guess hes in the city on nineteenth avenue heading that way you got a better idea no i suppose not but nothing glitsky wasnt going to criticize the chief whod mostly stood up for him under serious and unrelenting pressure but inwardly his guts churned that she had not chosen to put someone on ros cars tail from the minute hed come into town and maybe even before but like glitsky and maybe more so lapeer was probably dealing with budget issues i just want to see him off the street probably wont be more than a couple of hours farrell said less would be better you want to call vi and tell her that no glitsky said i dont think that would be productive jon durbin had just been getting home late last night when he saw his father pulling out of his uncle and aunts driveway not really having any idea of where his father could be going late on a thursday night he had followed him up through golden gate park then right on geary down to laguna and finally north to chestnut where he parked at the curb pulling over a half block away jon had watched his father get out of the car and walk to the entrance of the large apartment building that anchored the southwest corner after ringing outside and then opening the lobby door he had disappeared inside jon followed a minute later and stood looking at the bank of inhabitants names on the mailboxes when he saw the name sato he almost couldnt believe it and then he totally believed it and his hand went to his stomach as it turned over on him his father and liza how sickening how gross how fucking obvious did his dad really think he could get away with this did he think they were all complete gullible morons after that he hadnt been able to face going home at all he stayed with his best friend rich and had gone on to school in yesterdays clothes with almost no sleep today he had seethed all day a blackness growing within him minute by minute and after school ended he had first gone back to richs and then decided that he had to deal with this somehow bring it out in the open so he had come back to the novios at around quarter to five about when the rain had unleashed he still wasnt sure what he was going to do but something he had made it back to the house without having to explain much to aunt kathy who was still wreckedas they all were except his goddamn fatherby the plain fact of his mothers murder he went upstairs to the bedroom he was sharing with peter took a shower and changed into some other clothes then lay down on the bed closing his eyes when peter came in a half hour later he opened them hey where have you been richs just hanging out except earlier last night you know what i did last night who cares you will i followed dad when when he went out you didnt know he went out peter shook his head i crashed early you followed him why where to because i wanted to see where he was going and guess where that was liza satos this information stopped peter short until he could finally form the question why did he go there why do you think i think probably because shes his friend and he needed somebody to talk to yeah either that or hes fucking her bullshit you dont know that you dont know anything then the fully realized thought of his brothers meaning dawning on him peter stepped up close to where jon sat up on the bed and said are you saying you think dad killed mom is that what youre getting at cause if it is that is just such bullshit you think its bullshit that hes having an affair and nobodys talking about it i think that sounds to me like the reason he had to kill mom he didnt have a reason to kill mom he didnt kill mom he loved mom peter broke into tears he loved her goddamn it he loved her in a sudden fury he struck out with both hands slamming his brothers shoulders knocking him back on the bed fuck you jons feet came up off the floor and he kicked out hitting his younger brother in the chest knocking him backward as he came scrambling up off the bed screaming more obscenities throwing punches wildly peter charged back head down catching jon around the waist slamming him back against the rooms wall knocking over one of the bed lamps in the process jon came back up swinging and connecting hitting peter in the face at which the younger brother let out an animal scream and his nose now spewing blood came at jon with everything he had they both went over the bed and fell off the other side and into one of the mahogany end tables splintering it knocking down another light which came crashing down around them michael durbin surveyed the wreckage of the boys room at a complete loss at how to deal with this latest disaster he turned back to chuck who stood at his shoulder i dont know what to say except im so sorry of course ill pay for any damages payments not the issue well its at least part of it he cast his glance back again at the destruction jesus christ what got into them from talking to peter chuck said i gather it was about you me how could it have been me chuck rested a hand on his shoulder maybe you should talk to peter i think im a little too mad to talk to peter if i was going to be mad at anybody michael i think id go for jon i got plenty of mad for both of them another sweep of the room christ it looks like a bomb hit this place why should i be more mad at jon he evidently told peter that you had some kind of a hand in janices death durbins head dropped until his chin nearly touched his chest how can he think that my own son how can anybody who knows me at all he followed you last night mike jon did when you left here over to liza satos durbin turned to face his brotherinlaw christ he said not you too chuck shook his head not me at all michael im just telling you what your son was saying he motioned to the room what started all this i needed to talk to somebody durbin said id leaned on you and kathy enough i had to get out of here for a while thats all you dont have to explain anything to me as far as im concerned janice was murdered by ro curtlee and thats all there is to it look at the paintings too jon cant think id have done that and suddenly a new voicepeters hoarse and chokedfrom behind them he does dad to make it seem more like it was curtlee durbin turned to see his younger son he was still wearing his ripped and bloodstained shirt his face was swollen his eyes red his cheeks glistening with tears his nose flattened and off center possibly broken peter durbin shocked by his sweet sons battering spoke more gently than hed intended what the hell i know im sorry i dont know what happened jon just started talking crazy and i went off on him he looked past his father at the damage hed done im so sorry uncle chuck im so sorry sorrys a good start chuck said but ive got to tell you peter youve got a ways yet still to go do you know where jons gone to peter shook his head no he was staying at richs but i dont know where he is now and i dont care either i hope he never comes back no you dont hope that hes just reacting this way because he misses mom we all miss mom and hes really really angry about it and doesnt know where to put it so hes taking it out on me and you and maybe all of us durbin touched his sons arm but how did he get this into his head peter just because i went to see liza sato peter nodded he believes youre having some kind of a thing with her i told him there was no way you loved mom i did love your mother peter i loved her so much i still love her thats what i told him i said you and liza were just friends thats all and thats true isnt it i mean isnt that completely true of course it is durbin said completely one hundred percent true hearing his fathers emphatic denial seemed to bring some real relief to the boy he blew out heavily through his mouth and closed his eyes while he let the answer sink in okay he said okay then eztli and ro got home at a little after six oclock ro had originally wanted to get dropped off again at momos where he could get some food and drink at the bar until tiffany got off but this was friday night and eztli was cutting it close getting to the curtlees home on time when he knew he had to put on his tuxedo and drive them to the saint francis hotel by eight for a fundraising wine auction of some kind this had been on eztlis schedule for the past month and though he got a true rush out of the time he spent with ro he also didnt have any nagging ambiguity about who was writing the check every month and if cliff and theresa needed him to be someplace then thats where he would be stoned mellow and buoyed by the positive turn of the afternoons events with gloria serrano ro hadnt objected and so at seven oclock eztli and the three members of the curtlee family were all gathered in what they called the little studya quiet booklined relatively small room with a fireplace just off the dining room cliff and theresa in their blacktie garb were sharing a split of roederer cristal champagne sitting hip to hip on the love seat that directly faced the dancing flames of the fire ro on a wing chair catercorner to them had showered and changed into a blue silk longsleeved shirt and a pair of khakis he had his bare feet up on an ottoman his hands around a large leadedcrystal brandy snifter with a good strong two fingers of remy martin vsop eztli stood in his own formal wear across from both the parents and from ro closest to the fire where he could keep an eye on the one entrance to the room he hadnt shared any marijuana with ro on the way up to town and he wasnt drinking here tonight with the family either since he would be serving double dutychauffeur and bodyguardhe was carrying a caliber semiautomatic pistol in a shoulder holster under his left armpit nothing like the weapon that hed used on matt lewis ro was regaling his parents with his good fortune today in locating gloria it was amazing to see you guys the change in her which is i guess what living with guilt can do to you he was saying she was like a different person she told me she had nothing but remorse for testifying against me last time i should think so theresa said i always thought before she told those lies on the stand of course that she was a nice girl very nice cliff concurred and i thought one of the prettiest really she still is eztli said anyway bottom line ro continued and this is the really great part no way is she going to be testifying again she even asked me if there was any way she could talk to tristan and recant some maybe even all of what she said last time ro cliff said that is fantastic really fantastic but im curious how did you find her theresa asked i understood from tristan that that was turning out to be a little problematic well he was using a private eye i used ez to whom all eyes turned he shrugged selfeffacing i just put the word out in our community not much of a deal theres a network of likeminded people and really she wasnt hiding yes well nevertheless your efforts were a little bit more effective than the attorneys were paying now werent they eztli smiled we got lucky but ill take lucky over smart anytime hear hear theresa said and wasnt she this gloria wasnt she the last one i mean the last witness who was set to come to your next trial ro sipped contentedly at his cognac well never set as it turns out she didnt even realize id gotten out of prison theresas nearly immobile face almost managed to look surprised how could she be unaware of that ro smiled at her i dont think shes a big reader of newspapers mother or watching the news she has three small children eztli added it looked like they keep her busy well that will explain it theresa said and cliff added so thats pretty much their case then am i right lets hope ro said theyve got no new witnesses and now pretty much none of the old ones thats what tristan has been hoping for all along and now it looks like thats what weve got so they may not send you back theresa asked ro sipped more cognac put on a rueful expression i dont want to jinx us he said you know theyre going to try i cant see them just giving up but now there is some real hope glitsky wont give up theresa said hes such a nuisance weve got to find a way to get him transferred into another department or something but cliff was shaking his head its not glitsky its farrell if hes got no case they dont retry and we can get to him in fact ive already gotten to him again thanks to ez here eztli gave another slight acknowledgment a tip of the head i would think farrells pretty well neutralized he said cliff looked down at his empty champagne flute well he said all this calls for a toast and just as ive run out of champagne ez you might even have a sip just for the celebration of it as you wish ill ring sir bracco stood outside in a steady drizzle a full two blocks down the street from the curtlees home waiting for the last two guys of the tenman team that lapeer had put together to effect the arrest of ro curtlee he would have already moved the men into positions all around the house except that he wanted to be sure they didnt compromise the element of surprise and unfortunately the last two guys were coming from downtown and bringing with them the physical arrest warrant a pair of headlights cut through the mist as it turned onto the street a couple of blocks down and bracco heaved a sigh of relief as the car pulled up and parked behind the small caravan that had already formed behind braccos car at the curb unable to calm his nerves bracco jogged down and arrived at the car as its driver was just opening his door warrant was about all he could manage to say the driver tapped his chest with his knucklesright hereand from the sound of it bracco realized that these guys too were already wearing kevlar as was the rest of the team nobody taking any chances and now everyone was ready another wash of relief swept over him it was time he counted the men one last time now all of them having gathered close ten of them present and accounted for okay guys he said quiet and careful lets move it out eztli crossed to a small table at the back of the little study that featured a diminishing selection of nuts and hard candies he picked up the little silver bell identical to the ones in the kitchen and living room and gave it a shake which produced a melodic tinkle and which in turn produced one of the uniformed young women from the kitcheneztli did not always bother learning their individual names since he had so little interaction with them and also because they tended to move along to their next posting to one of the curtlees acquaintances within a year or so he thought this one might be named linda but it wouldnt do to call her by a name and get it wrong eztli prided himself on being unfailingly polite another bottle of the cristal please he said the fullsize bottle from the refrigerator oh and two more champagne glasses she looked over at where the curtlees sat let her eyes rest on them for a moment her face it seemed to eztli fighting against itself to keep an expression of resentment at bay it was difficult he knewhe was not entirely immune to some resentment himselfto be constantly aware of the unbridgeable gap between staff and principals when her eyes came back to him he gave her what he hoped was an understanding nod and she returned it curtsying as shed been taught she then glanced at the nearly empty nut tray and went over to pick it up and carry it back with her his eyes followed the smooth perfection of her hips as she crossed the dining room and disappeared back into the kitchen and for an instant he thought he might reconsider his firm lifelong policy of never dating the help this young woman was certainly pretty enough to make the effort worthwhile but he banished that thought as quickly as it had appeared no good could come of it just look what problems ro had had even though that was a lot of years ago it was still wreaking havoc on his life there were other women who didnt live under this roof that eztli could enjoy it wasnt as though he was hurting in that department it didnt take the young woman thirty seconds to reappear with the glasses and the champagne wrapped in a plain white dish towel carrying the expensive champagne and the dainty expensive glassware obviously made her nervousthe glasses were clinking dangerously against one anotherand she set all of the stuff down on the small table with visible relief that shed made it without breaking anything with another little bow she turned to go back to the kitchen eztli brought the champagne bottle over to ros parents presenting it for their approval he got a brisk nod from cliff theresa said i believe that will do just fine half listening to the conversation that had now moved along to sheila marrenas and her latest column on leland crawfords assertion of his vision over the police department and how well it was beginning to work eztli went back to the table removed the foil expertly then the wire then turned the bottle carefully while holding the cork in place with a satisfying little pop the bottle opened with no spillage first he poured one of the two glasses for ro and crossed the room to deliver that next he would pour for cliff and theresa only then would he take care of his own half glass he was almost to ro when behind him he became aware of the young woman returning again this time with the tray of nuts under a silver dome she set it heavily on the small table clearing a space for it and then stood still for a moment her hands holding both sides of the table as if she needed to do that to remain standing aware of the unusual hesitation eztli turned back to see if everything was all right with her just as she removed the dome and placed it in front of the tray so that it blocked eztlis view of it then she reached down with both hands and lifted an object and for an instant eztli found himself confused by something that in this setting was so bizarre and unexpected that it paralyzed him she was holding the big semiautomatic in both hands beginning to bring it up as the confusion crystallized into a horrified and desperate certainty eztli dropped the bottle of champagne from his right hand and in the same motion threw ros glass over toward the fire ez cliff jerked at the sudden noise and movement what the eztlis right hand was reaching for his own weapon turning to face her inadvertently giving her a larger target but with no other real choice and by the time he got his hand on the grip she had brought the gun all the way up centering it on his chest he never heard the first blasting report as the slug hit him just above the heart and threw him backward onto the floor then as though from far away he did hear and this time felt another shot a searing pain in his shoulder and then all the sounds in the world growing fainter several more reports in quick succession until finally everything went quiet and then dark ro didnt believe that this was happening this wasnt how he was supposed to die he had been so relaxed with the weed and the glass of cognac that he felt molded to his chair slumped down into the cushion just reaching up to grab his glass when ez turned and suddenly was looking at linda then throwing the drinks down and making a move toward his shoulder holster he never got to it and she kept pulling the trigger another shot hitting ezro trying to look everyplace at once with nowhere to run or even duck away to now he heard his mother scream and linda had fired again at his father who had been halfway to his feet and who then went down now she was bringing the gun around just firing away not really taking time to aim but pointing straight at his chest and he felt the first slug go all the way through him from side to side low in his gut as the force of it knocked him back and sideways now in the chair he couldnt take his eyes off her she was still pointing the thing at him he tried to put his hands up but they didnt seem to want to obey him dont he began she pulled the trigger again and it felt as if someone had ripped his right arm off in the corner of his eye he saw his mother stand and as he watched linda turned to her and fired once doubling her over before theresa went down on her knees but linda wasted no time making sure with his mother as she came walking forward now the gun extended in front of her pointing right at his face he met her eyes through the shock and pain ros brain tried to make sense of any of this what was her problem what was the big deal so she hadnt been in the mood he had to fight her a little to finally get it done but so what thats what you did he couldnt believe she wasnt already pretty used to it she was a big girl she he felt the gun pressed high against his left cheek adios she said fucker glitsky got the call from bracco with one of the arrest teams the teams had been gathering out in front of the mansion on vallejo street when theyd heard the shots from inside the house and rushed to the door glitsky had to pull up and park behind rows of other cars and vans nearly two blocks away it was raining steadily and it seemed impossible to him that such a crowdof police personnel curious neighbors news vans politicians and reportershad developed in such a short time but then again the bare fact of what had apparently happened here seemed impossible as well all these people braving the inclement weather in coats and umbrellas pressing in against the yellow police tape line theyd strung along the street and across the property line glitsky picked his way through the mass of people ducked under the police line and showed his id to one of the patrolmen standing guard at the bottom of the steps once he was safely inside the perimeter he turned briefly to look behind him he estimated there were fifteen blackandwhite patrol cars each with their red and blue lights strobing the night somebody had already set up at least one set of kliegs to brighten the place even more glitsky counted four television vans which must have gotten the word even more quickly than he did sheila marrenas so far unsuccessfully was trying to bully her way through the line down at the end of the driveway leland crawford was giving an interview to a small knot of television people over by his limo glitsky jogged up the steps and slowed down at the open door where bracco was waiting to meet him that was fast the inspector said glitsky nodded i was motivated whered it go down bracco pointed and started walking toward the study at the same moment glitsky at his heels the chief here yet he asked not yet no how about csi yep and weve got the suspect in custody back in the kitchen one of the maids linda salcedo shes not giving us any trouble lets hope we can keep it that way you got the weapon tagged and bagged it was on the floor where she dropped it she dropped it dropped it and answered the doorbell then showed us where to go you could still smell the cordite craziest thing ive ever seen but by then they had reached the arched entrance to a small room guarded by two other members of what was originally supposed to be the arresting team glitsky stopped a half step behind darrel and nodded at both of the other men there was plenty of light from a couple of standing lamps and an overhead chandelier the study was less than fifteen feet deep maybe twelve feet wide it seemed to be filled with bodies and even with his vast experience glitsky was impressed by the body count in the enclosed place the iron smell of blood and underlying it something sweet smelling and alcoholic glitsky stepped forward so he could take it all in the butler lay on his back by the fireplace his tuxedo coat wide open revealing a shoulder holster with its gun still in it a red splotch bloomed in a wide circle in the shirt over his heart another slug looked like it had taken him in the shoulder but the one by the heart looked like it had done the job when eztli had gone down hed knocked over the screen in front of the fireplace which lay on the floor by his head on the other side of his head a bottle of champagne lay on its side the mirror above the fireplace was shattered and shards from it littered the floor all around him ro curtlee sat slumped in an easy chair literally soaked in blood hed taken two or three in the chest and one at really close range high in his left cheek the force of the shot had canted his head to the right and the entire right side of his shirt was soaked from the exit wound damage the exit wound annihilation the most ghastly image was cliff curtlee who had managed to get up and turn around before hed been hit or hit fatally the shot that had done the most obvious damage had evidently taken him in the side of the throathis carotid spurting arterial blood over the rug and onto the hardwood of the adjoining dining room floorbut several other rounds had hit him in the side and back evidently as he tried to get away from the blood trail it looked like he kept on crawling through his own blood for a good three or four feet before finally stopping with the shock and trauma of the injuries and bleeding out bracco leaned over cliff and examined the throat injury with interest he turned to glitsky and said thats going to leave a mark glitsky took in all of this at a glance then said to no one in particular wheres mrs curtlee one of the crime scene guys looked up from photographing ros body in his chair other room he said dead in a perfect imitation munchkin voice from the wizard of oz the tech said she is not just merely dead she is really most sincerely dead glitsky once again reminded of the wisdom of the rule that reporters were not allowed on crime scenes until the techs had finished turned and saw vi lapeer coming through the front door and he moved to intercept her chief he said what youve probably heard is true theyre all dead the curtlees and their butler shot at close range we have a suspect subdued and in custody in the next room lapeer slapped her game face on taking a steadying breath through her mouth she set her jaw and started across the dining room toward the archway at eleven oclock the techs were still working in the study the bodies had been bagged and taken in the coroners van to the medical examiners office behind the hall since bracco spoke excellent spanish and was already here at the scene glitsky assigned the formal investigation of these murders to him so bracco had given linda salcedo her miranda warning and a quick preliminary interview and was on his way with her to the detail for a full videotaped statement outside the crowd had eventually mostly dispersed neither the mayor nor sheila marrenas had ever been admitted to the crime scene and both had eventually gone away as had a stoic vi lapeer amanda jenkins had been out at a restaurant with a couple of other assistant das and caught the breaking news flash on the television now she sat at the dining room table with glitsky both of them too wound up to go home so our suspect evidently had heard about the earlier rapes so she had some type of warning glitsky was saying but she didnt take it seriously enough youre saying ro had already done another one of them since he got out no one of the other workers here had heard the stories and told her she should be on her guard but she wasnt not enough anyway he called her up to his room under the pretext of her cleaning up something last night last night he pulled this shit just last night when he knew were all over him a brisk nod he thought he had us beat killing farrells dog cutting our balls off squeezing lapeer with the mayor time to go back and check out the home turf what an asshole so she was warned about it and still went up glitsky shrugged hed been home almost a month and never did anything last night he called and needed something cleaned up so she goes to his room and hes naked in bed with a gun on her so she she wanted to stay alive jenkins shook her head in disgust id like to kill him again i hear you what about the shoes evidently not an issue this time i know she didnt mention anything to darrel okay so howd she get the gun glitskys lips turned up slightly this is my favorite part he said he just left it in his drawer next to his bed in his room loaded so he goes out with his man ez today and doesnt take it with him probably figures that linda liked itthe sex not the gun or the sex with the gun so today she comes up makes sure the gun is still there and waits for her opportunity which doesnt take long coming but why kill the others why isnt she just waiting in his room for him when he comes home i asked darrel to ask her that myself she said it was selfdefense where shes from you kill a member of a powerful family they kill your whole family she knew if she was going to kill ro she had to kill them all jenkins thought about this for a minute knowing the curtlees she just might have been right maybe anyway she knew ez carried a gun and so he had to go first and then she figured cliff and theresa they knew what ro was doing and had been doing all along and they enabled him not her word so they were part of it what he was doing and so the heck with them too jesus christ though amanda said i didnt think anybody was that good with a pistol she killed all four of them god was on her side amanda sat back looked up at the ceiling and closed her eyes for a moment im going to want to run ballistics on the gun tonight the murder weapon to see if it matches the one that killed matt glitsky nodded probably a good idea and ezs too while im at it whatever you can find glitsky said i dont think a search warrant is going to be a problem this time around at the novio house the muted jubilation over news of the death of ro curtlee was even more restrained than it otherwise might have been because by midnight jon durbin still had not come home he had not answered his cell phone or responded to text messages either even when michael had jons little sister allie text from her phone and beg him to just tell her he was okay now finally all three of the girls were asleep and peter lay on a couch covered by one of kathys comforters sleeping with the tv on in the family room the three adults sat in the living room chuck and michael on either end of the couch kathy in a lounger all of them obviously wrecked by the recent and continuing events finally michael sat up straighter and slapped at his arm of the couch thats it he said starting to get up im going to call the police chuck looked over and say what that my sons missing see if they can go on some kind of lookout for him but hes really not missing kathy said softly not any more than he was last night michael hes just confused trying to sort things out and the police wont be able to find him anyway orcheck thatthey wont look for him chuck added hes too old and it hasnt been long enough i dont think they even consider an adult missing anymore unless no ones heard from them in three days well that sure gives whoever it is enough time to hide out pretty good doesnt it he slumped back into the cushions i just want to talk to him thats all i can answer any questions hes got for me any of them i promise of course you can kathy let out an exhausted sigh maybe this news tonight will make a difference to him they said on the news that the police are closing the ro curtlee cases and thats got to include janice wouldnt you think you would think michael said but maybe not not the way glitskys been looking at it he obviously still thinks it was ro but keeps talking about things that dont fit which still doesnt mean it was me i mean as far as i know he hasnt done a thing about even looking at her clients i dont know if he can do that kathy said isnt there some kind of privilege or something and besides why would he want to talk to her clients do you know something that points to any of them only that she was he stopped abruptly what kathy asked you were going to say something no mike brought his hand up and squeezed at his temples only that im so tired i dont know what im saying but kathy persisted was there something you know about one of her patients michael that could be real i dont want anything to be real kathy he said im sure it was ro curtlee its just this other stuff muddying the waters for glitsky but what other stuff she persisted chuck finally spoke up mike thinks she was having an affair what janice no way mike durbin shrugged yeah kathy i think there was a way why do you think that well a brittle little laugh thats kind of personal if you know did you talk about it no did she say she was going to be leaving you or anything like that no he hesitated looked to each of them in turn then spoke to kathy we hadnt had the most intimate last couple of months and now she laughed her own brittle laugh ha if thats it i think they must be putting something in the water chucks head came up in a quick spurt of anger kathy she looked right back at him what what if its the truth then she turned to durbin like thats a sign youre having an affair even happy couples go through some ups and downs like that its part of the package then back to her husband isnt that right chuck it doesnt mean your marriage is in trouble at least i hope it doesnt shes right mike chuck said shes absolutely right but going back to the original question id like to know what glitskys reservations are he said i mean its obvious enough to all of us that janice was killed by ro curtlee and now ro curtlees dead and that ought to be the end of it is there something none of us are seeing well this affair if there was one kathy said but even if there was one chuck said theres nothing that eliminates ro curtlee he had a reason he slashed the paintings for the same reason mike he wanted to get at you even if janice was having an affair why would the guy slash your paintings that had to be ro which means the fire had to be ro too why dont you tell that to glitsky next time he asks but all this emotion and discussion along with the worry over his son were finally taking their toll durbin bowed his head and shook it slowly back and forth lets just hope he doesnt he said doesnt think hes got a reason to ask now if you guys dont mind im going up to bed i think we should too kathy pushed herself up and looked down at her husband chuck he brought his head up and smiled at her right behind you he said you said call anytime i did treya said but im not sure i meant one oclock youre never out until one oclock occasionally i am as you can see but i can hang up now and call you in the morning or you can just tell me what time youre getting down here and then i can go back to sleep and wake up in time to greet you warmly well on that i thought you and the kids might want to consider coming back up here get back to normal life she paused for a long beat you got your indictment and arrested ro no close but better what could be better if one of the maids he raped shot him are you kidding me not even a little hes dead completely he heard her exhale i know i shouldnt be too happy about somebody dying but there are cases its warranted this would be one of them so do you want to come home she paused again whats the weather like beautiful fortyfive and pouring what could be nicer seventyeight and sunny for starters seventyeight scouts honor sixto told the kids wed take them to the beach tomorrow do you realize weve never taken either of them to the beach im not surprised why would we it was abes turn to hesitate its really going to be seventyeight if not eighty a last pause and then glitsky said im on southwest landing in burbank at eleven fifteen maybe you could pick me up not impossible treya said ill see what i can do farrell crossed the threshold from the hallway inside to his outer office and stopped in his tracks he broke a genuine smile his hands outstretched with more than a bit of theatricality the sun shines my secretary returns ro curtlee is off to that big appellate court in the sky could life get any better at her desk treya rose out of her chair there are a couple of bear claws on your table she said would that do its a good start anyway very nice thank you youre welcome theyre by way of an apology im sorry about the absences just taking off like i did i didnt mean to leave you in the lurch but he waved that off no explanation necessary treya his expression sobered i should have taken it more seriously myself maybe sent gert down to be with you im so sorry about that me too his smile didnt quite take i try to console myself that she was some kind of a martyr to the cause cliff that son of a bitch killed her to try to scare me off and it almost worked instead much to my own surprise it kicked me in the ass and got me moving although in the end i guess it didnt matter one way or the other no it mattered either way it was going to end friday night you just provided the insurance maybe thats another nice spin on it but if somebody told me i could trade gerts life for ros im not sure i would have done it even though she was just an animal so was he well there you go changing gears he pointed toward his office anything else i should know about in there besides the bear claws treya glanced down at the book she kept next to her computer vi lapeer wanted to have a talk with you when you got in also mr crawford himself in person after that treya continued nothing else till ten when you swear in the two new adas their names are in your folder then at noon lunch with the odd fellows and a few words on disaster preparedness farrell chortled my specialty dont worry i got the talking points from the io this was the information office again its all in the folder just dont forget the folder and youre golden you want a cup of coffee a cup of coffee would be wonderful and treya sir good to have you back glitsky said i think ive got a vitamin d overdose or hangover or whatever youd call it dismas hardy had a court appointment on this monday morning but things were dragging downstairs in the departments and his hearing wasnt going to be called anytime soon so he dropped in at glitskys office to share some peanuts and abuse with his friend you cant get a vitamin d overdose and in my extensive research into hangovers i havent run across that one whats it feel like weird its like im almost i dont know happy i guess wow hardy cracked a peanut that would be weird and its neat how you qualified the living shit out of it almost you guess you dont know bar the door katie glitskys on a roll glitsky ignored the derision i think it was the beach all that sunshine hey the sun is shining here too glitsky with a dour look glanced up and over at the high windows in his office yeah but here its only fiftytwo degrees down there it was eightytwo thats thirty degrees difference he excels at math too but its a rare treat to see you even almost happy i must say you think it might also have something to do with the curtlees glitsky chewed his own peanut im not ruling that out so how many cases did that clear for you well not including the retrial at least felicia nunez and matt lewis and janice durbin to say nothing of gert wess dog plus the damage ro will never get a chance to do to gloria gonzalvez or her kids or my kids or anybody else hardy hesitated for a minute not to pick nits he said but last time we talked you had a small problem with janice durbin not really glitsky shook his head mostly logistical if we couldnt prove it to the grand jury and now theres no need okay hardy said okay what nothing another peanut i dont want to be the proximate cause of you lapsing back into your traditional funk no chance right now im too high on life too hooked on a feelin hardy sat back grinning if you break into song i swear to god im calling the paramedics b j thomas glitsky said i know who it was raindrops good time charlie i know every song the guys ever sung of course you do with your eidetic memory id expect nothing less okay then with my eidetic memory i need to tell you that i remember ro curtlee had apparent alibis both for janice and matt thats not logistical as you put it thats factual well then well never know for absolute sure because his parents were it for durbin and his butler was it for lewis all three of them being dead i choose to believe both alibis would fall apart under questioning sometimes you just take a free gift from the almighty bow your head and say thank you lord these cases are done diz all closed up and more power to em thats what im sayin know what im sayin im not arguing hardy said you know best he broke another grin as the great bass player ray brown once said i just came to town to help with the fuckin amanda jenkins felt about as attractive as a turnip she hadnt slept more than three hours at any stretch since shed heard about matt and the past weekendin spite of the apparent closure and cosmic justice represented by the deaths of the curtlees and their butlerhad been more grueling still she had dated him for more than a year but she had never met matts parents or his three sisters or his older brother nevertheless on saturday shed been included in the extended family for the huge funeral mass at saints peter and paul at washington square and then the burial down in colma after which shed been seated between his mother nan and his sister paula at the reception at fior ditalia that had gone on until seven or so and then she and nanby now her best friendhad gone out on an oldfashioned roaring drunk around north beach where they hooked up with some other assistant das and cops whod also been at the funeral in spite of the alcohol or maybe because of it she woke up before dawn yesterday sunday and cried pretty much nonstop until the late afternoon when her crushing hangover finally began to fade after a twohour doze she had moderated the drinking somewhat last night ate some chinese at home and then didnt fall asleep again until three am so when she got to the police lab at nine thirty she knew she wasnt at or even near her physical peak still you had to play the cards you got dealt and she knew that her aces were her legs so it would be foolish not to play them she wore her shortest miniskirt dark green under a severely plunging green pullover sweater and threeinch heels checking herself in her mirror before she went out she was reasonably certain that nobody was going to spend much time noticing the pallor of her face the sag in her cheeks the red in her eyes shed handed in the request early saturday morning to one of the csi guys who promised hed take it out to the lab as part of their general delivery glitsky had been right and there had been no legal issue at all with serving a search warrant at the curtlee mansion amanda was still there going on two oclock in the morning when they found the safe in eztlis room and broke into it what they found inside brought to six the number of handguns in the housethe curtleeeztli murder weapon the gun under eztlis armpit an s ampw in his safe and three other pistols in another unlocked safe in the headboard of the curtlees bed four of the weapons were caliber and could have been the weapon used to kill matt lewis for some reason amanda had become fixated on getting all the details right about matts murder she thought she knew that ro had killed him but somehow it had become very important to her to make absolutely sure if only so that it might help her better understand although to understand precisely what was something she could not have elucidated from linda salcedos statement the murder weapon in friday nights massacre had been ros personal gun so what amanda had requested was that the lab conduct a ballistics test with a bullet from that gun against the bullet that had killed matt since shed marked it as high priority and rush shed hoped to have it by first thing monday morning assumed that someone would have pulled some overtime to get it when shed called at eight hoping to get some results they hadnt even started yet when she got the name of the ballistics tech vincent j abbatiello and realized that it was a guy who sounded on the phone to be about in his late twenties probably straight if he was a cop shed reached for her miniskirt now abbatiello had invited her back with him showing off the still relatively new lab in the departments building facility in hunters point naval shipyard with illconcealed pride this was an enormous and modern structure a far cry from the tiny and cramped lab of the past amanda oohed and aahed her way along with him and by the time they reached his area what she wanted was his first priority given that no one had seen fit to get to it over the weekend amanda was amazed at how little time it took the lab really had modernized its capabilities and the shooting and computer analysis of ballistics results took no more than five minutes per test including shooting the gun and retrieving the bullet to test against the standard fighting her nerves and the residual alcohol the tension while she waited on the first testwith ros gun a smith amp wesson military and police semiautomatic mmwas nearly unbearable she sat next to the microscope that abbatiello used and while he calibrated the machine she had to lean over her hands over her stomach and the result of this first test was obvious although not in the way she hoped it was clearly a mismatch oh god she said to abbatiello how could that be its all right we got three more tries they got it on the second one glitsky was down on the third floor in amandas office leaning back against one of the counters with the door closed behind him doesnt mean it wasnt ro he said but it was this guy ezs gun i mean it was in his safe its registered to him hes got a carry permit and while were at it tell me would you how in the world does that happen hows a guy like this get a carry permit hes a citizen right naturalized but even so he works in security hes got no criminal record but mostly cliff curtlee is behind him pulling strings with just a tiny bit of influence no problem so heres the problem with that i dont see him letting ro shoot his gun i dont know if i see anybody letting ro even hold a gun much less shoot it he might point it back at you and pull the trigger just for jollies he might glitsky chewed his cheek any of ros prints on the gun itself no any of this other guy several hm so whats it mean abe if ro didnt shoot him for what its worth i think ro probably shot him i know but what if he didnt i mean then what would that have all been about she was back on the verge of tears glitsky couldnt offer much in the way of solace look he said whoever actually pulled the trigger ro was responsible for it hes responsible for all of this glitskys vitamin d overdose if thats what it was had worn off completely by the time he stopped in front of darrel braccos desk out in the middle of the homicide detail his inspector was filling in an administrative report of some kind engrossed in it when glitsky put a haunch on the corner of his desk sat and said i dont even want to start to tell you how much i dont want to ask you this question bracco looked up then dont yeah but heres the deal this morning i come in to work and the world is a rosy place ro curtlee is out of our hair forever all of his cases are closed theres a high degree of certainty about all of this right right as in none right so then amanda jenkins gets into work this morning and shes been down at the lab doing ballistics on the bullet that killed her boyfriend okay actually not so okay that bullet didnt in fact come from ros gun it came from the bodyguards gun bracco clasped his hands behind his head doesnt mean ro wasnt shooting it thats what i said too it doesnt mean ro didnt shoot it but you know what it does mean it means it wasnt definitely ro it might have been the other guy the butler bracco snapped his fingers thats why he offered to take a polygraph the son of a bitch wouldve passed it too he broke a sudden grin but heres the good news fourteen years a cop and i finally get to say the butler did it how cool is that i dont want it to have been the butler so not very cool at all i wouldnt worry about it abe it probably was ro what does it matter anyway anybody it matters to is dead not true it matters to me why because i was completely and absolutely certain that ro had killed matt lewis i mean he had motive he had opportunity he had the means no question he did it now there is doubt maybe not a lot of it but real honesttogod doubt he might not have done it but again abe so what why does it matter now it matters now because now im starting to have doubts about the other case i was equally certain about janice durbin no bracco said theres no doubt there with the shoes and the fire and then the paintings getting slashed that was definitely ro right glitsky said except if he wasnt there but he was well remember your talk with him at denardis office where he essentially admitted to killing matt lewis when it turns out maybe not after all sure but i still think he pulled that trigger well think it all you want but he also in that same interview gave us an alibi for the morning of janice durbins murder you remember that of course his parents the butler and the maid the maid glitsky said that would be linda salcedo wouldnt it bracco sat all the way back in his chair his eyes had closed this was the thing you didnt want to ask me didnt want isnt strong enough then ill say it again dont ive got to shes the last person in the world whod want to give ro an alibi for anything she hasnt been to court yet and doesnt have a lawyer i want you to go over to the jail and see if shell talk to you ask her if she remembers any time ro went out early in the last couple of weeks shes already told us hes a late sleeper if she corroborates his alibi if he really couldnt have been there he was there abe at durbins he had to have been there yeah i know but it would be better if we made sure way better jon durbin got called out of his english class at eleven fifteen and was asked to report to the principals office when he got there and gave his name the secretary instructed jon to go to one of the counseling rooms down a short hallway off the main lobby his stomach doing cartwheels and his head lightwhat else could have happened nowhe got down to the third doorway on his right and knocked once the door opened away from him and he stepped inside not seeing his father until the door was nearly closed behind him jon looked from side to side in anger and frustration trapped i dont have to stay here let me out michael durbin stood his ground holding the door closed behind him i wanted to have a few words with you he said after which youre free to go im free to go now ive got nothing to say to you well that makes one of us ive got something to say to you short and sweet i did not kill your mother i dont know where you got that idea you dont you dont think we all heard you fighting all the time it wasnt all the time we were having some issues thats what parents do sometimes i did not kill her we were trying to work things out so we could stay together we got a little vocal from time to time ha a little so what jon really so what the issues were serious okay i know what the issues were or rather the main issue you do maybe you could tell me then you and liza thats what hows that well thats just completely wrong is how that is michaels arms were crossed over his chestprotecting the door protecting himselfand now he dropped them to his sides you think we could sit down a minute the room held a table and four chairs jon hesitated then finally sidestepped over to the nearest chair and lowered himself into it his father pulled another chair from where it sat against the wall over to him he wasnt going to leave an open shot at the door to his son now though seated in front of it he came forward with his elbows on his knees and raised his eyes directly to jons i dont know how im going to convince you of this but liza is a friend of mine and thats all she is thats all she has ever been yeah right you went over there the night after moms service are you gonna deny that too no i went there i was in pain jon im still in pain i needed to talk to somebody and felt id dumped enough on chuck and kathy i knew liza would listen why is that so hard for you to understand id think that you of all people would get it you know who i am youve always known who i am michaels even tone was puncturing jons bubble of hostility he sat back in his chair hands folded in his lap studying the floor finally he looked up well then what was all the fighting about with you and mom i dont know which fights youre talking about exactly but some of them were probably about money your mother wanted a bigger house like chuck and kathys she wanted me to open another store if i could i didnt want to do that if anything i wanted to work less and maybe get back to my painting and thats the other thing do you really believe i cut up my paintings i dont know if it was the only way to get the cops off you jesus michael dropped his head and wagged it from side to side i dont know how ive failed you so badly that you could think id do any of this i didnt i swear to you no liza no slashed paintings no hurting your mother in any way then why couldnt you even say where you were that morning i was driving to work thinking about work about making more money worried about your mother and me and about ro curtlee being out of jail i wasnt paying any attention to the drive or the delays do you remember all the details about coming in to school today so who killed her then ro curtlee killed her jon i was the main reason he did all that time in prison and he killed her and slashed my paintings to punish me why doesnt this make sense to you because dad he had a goddamn broken arm how about that it was all in the papers about the police breaking his arm when they arrested him you dont strangle somebody if youve got a broken arm not somebody like mom anyway she was strong you know she could still beat peter at arm wrestling so it just couldnt happen and then whos that leave he slammed his palm flat against the surface of the table next to him eyes filled with rage and confusion you dont think i havent thought enough about this you think i want to believe that my father that hed do this and so fuck up all our lives so if its not ro curtlee whos that leave huh especially when you cant remember what you did that morning i did remember i do remember it just didnt come to me when it should have dont you hear yourself that is so fucking lame its what it was jon its just what it was afraid that he was losing him again and maybe for the last time michael came forward in his chair listen he said listen urgently quietly youre not going to want to hear this but it wasnt me having an affair are you saying it was mom your mother yes bullshit no true just so you know somebody else is in the picture who we dont know inspector glitsky doesnt know maybe one of her patients but the bad news about that is that with ro dead glitskys not going to be looking very hard anymore he thinks it was ro he cant think that its too damn convenient and beyond that it doesnt make any sense he thinks it does but the bottom line is we may never know who killed her and that just kills me but it might be true he reached a hand across and touched his sons knee come back home jon please jons mouth stayed tight his posture rigid not committing to anything tears pooled in the corners of his eyes and overflowed where have you been staying anyway richs they said you werent there i know michaels frustration with richs family forced a breath out of him well were moving out of chuck and kathys and into a motel on wednesday i think its time we started trying getting along again as a family do you think you could do that angrily jon brushed away where his tears had wet his cheeks i dont know dad all i know is i want to kill whoever killed her i do too jon i do too and i swear to god that wasnt me it wasnt me i need you to believe me do you think you can do that jon slumped back and crossed his arms his face set in a mask after a few long beats michael realized that this was the best he was going to get from his son today and he stood up laid a hand gently on his shoulder and walked out the door darrel bracco phrased his questions to linda salcedo in such a way that she had no idea he was inquiring as to the alibi of ro curtlee on the morning of janice durbins death he let her believe he was getting general background about daily life in the curtlee mansion and she had been unwaveringly certain since hed been released on bail the first time and except for when hed been in police custody and on one other morning last week ro curtlee had spent every night in his bedroom and had never gotten up before nine or nine thirty in the morning linda remembered specifically because she herself was up at six thirty starting her cleaning upstairs before coming down to help with breakfast she passed directly in front of ros room every morning knocking quietly then opening the door a crack to look in and see if hed gotten up so that she could clean up in that room and make the bed but no hed been in there every day definitely and had appeared downstairs either during or after the curtlees having their breakfast this was not the news glitsky wanted to hear after bracco left his office glitsky sat in a blue funk for nearly a half hour finally he got up and went around his desk to the whiteboard where he kept his list of active cases and inspector assignments in the clean white space that only this morning had held the name felicia nunez he wrote the name janice durbin in large block letters and then across from it in the empty rectangle on the rightglitsky it was going to be a long slow haul getting a special master appointed by a judge to go through the patient files in janice durbins office and try to find evidence of a carnal relationship between the psychiatrist and someone who was seeing her professionally it could take weeks even months and still in the end yield nothingfor the truth remained that there was a whole universe of men and even women who might have been intimately involved with janice durbin and none of them her patients and that was if in fact it had not been michael durbin whod been having the affair contracted chlamydia and killed his wifeperhaps even by accidentwhen shed become infected and fought with him over it of course to believe that michael durbin had killed his wife glitsky would have to believe that hed also slashed his own works of art but this was just the sort of almost unfathomable subterfuge he might in fact expect from a desperate killer in any event hed already let too much time go by because of his insistence upon the guilt of ro curtlee this was the eleventh day after janices death and to say that the trail had gone cold was a significant understatement at having spent an hour on his paperwork for a search warrant and special master request glitsky found himself in the hallway of the blocklong lowrise stucco professional building about midway between the stonestown mall and san francisco state university where janice durbin had had her office it was a relatively modern building with no apparent frills janice had practiced in suite just across from the elevator on the second floor and glitsky now stood outside of that suite in the hallway peering into it through the halfopen gray venetian blinds unless he was missing something and he didnt think he was he could see the entire office there was no reception area simply a couple of functional couches one along the right wall and one under the wide rectangular windowits blinds too half openthat made up most of the back wall on the left a low dark wood credenza looked like it probably held her files facing the two couches was a large redleather lounge chair with a telephone table and a floor lamp next to it a large purple beanbag chair sat in the far corner some framed pictures hung on the walls on either side but the glare from the outside window kept him from seeing what kind of art shed hung there it wouldnt matter too much he thought the place was clean uncluttered basic can i help you glitsky straightened and turned to face an attractive professionally dressed heavyset black woman who looked to be somewhere in her late twenties introducing himself and proffering his badge he said as you may know dr durbin was murdered a little over a week ago i was hoping to talk to some of her neighbors in this building see if somebody might be able to throw some light on the investigation in what way in any way really we havent gotten very far yet did you know dr durbin not exactly just you know in the ladies or passing in the hallway i couldnt believe when we heard what happened nobody could you never think that kind of thing could happen to somebody you know or like her how was she then oh you know polite sweet classy downtoearth just a regular person do you know if she had any particular friends here in this building people she hung out with not really no not saying she didnt just if she did i didnt know about it its not like were all one big office here as you probably figured out already everybodys got their own mostly im with bayview security down at the end there at twoohseven although dr mitchell downstairs hes a dentist actually hes got his own big triple suite but hes about the biggest lots of equipment you know probably the main reason the building needs a security service although were here for everybody well thank you glitsky said maybe ill just knock on a few doors would that be all right with you you go ahead she said good luck to you starting at on the opposite side of the hall glitsky worked his way quickly down to then started up janice durbins side which faced west over the back parking lot as hed been warned there wasnt much in the way of information six of the offices housed therapists or counselors of one kind or another and two of those were in session on his first pass but none of the other four nor the people in the insurance office in knew janice any more than the first woman hed met in the hallway it was the same on janices side until he got to a pilates studio glitsky almost gave it a pass figuring that it would be a room where people just showed up as they would at a gym willynilly he didnt even know if a specific tenant ran the place in the end though being thorough he knocked even with no discernible makeup and a light sheen from sweating the woman who opened the door nearly tied his tongue in knots clad only in a red leotard she wore her blond hair shoulder length held back with a red headband it showed off the broad fair forehead over eyes of pure jade perhaps in her early forties she had trace lines at the corners of those distinctive eyes but otherwise her face might have belonged to a twentyyearold hi she said extending her hand im holly hello glitsky shook her hand showed his badge kept it simple im abe glitsky with san francisco homicide can you answer a few questions she cast a glance back over her shoulder at the obviously empty studio and shrugged sure this must be about janice right and then suddenly her incredible eyes flashed that fucker the vehemence surprised glitsky you mean dr durbin no no no hands waving in front of her face of course i dont mean janice i mean that fucker who killed her so you knew her yes i mean not that wed been friends a long timei just started the studio here two months agobut she was i thought we were going to be friends forever you know how that is you meet somebody wham right actually not too often glitsky said no i know what you mean not too darned often so you felt you were getting to know her well she nodded now dead somber i thought she was starting to be my best friend some days shed get an hour or two between appointments and shed come down here and as you can see it gets a little slow here too so wed just talk what about everything kids staying in shape getting old running your own business books movies you name it we talked about it men she cocked her head to one side sure not just her husband not always no shifting her weight from one foot to the other she added i guess what you want to know is was she seeing someone else she was one of her patients did she say no i mean yes she did say no not one of her patients youre sure unless she was lying to me which she wasnt so who was he did you ever meet him or see him no did she ever mention him by name no she really wasnt comfortable talking about it it was like she didnt want it to be happening but she didnt know how she could stop she wasnt really proud of it so she wanted it to stop i dont know i dont think so really she was just mostly worried that shed get caught she didnt want to lose her family life and her husband but she was infatuated with the guy even though she was pretty sure he was a player a player you know lots of partners a player lots of partners where would he get lots of partners the question clearly amused her hello a straight guy in san francisco finding partners isnt your problem trust me you look a little frustrated glitsky nodded i am if this guy wasnt one of her patients ive got basically no place to start looking for him he could be anywhere you think hes the guy who killed her i think he might have a motive or given her husband one either way id like to find him do you know where they hooked up some motel maybe an apartment why if he used a credit card we got him if he paid cash he had to show an id and they keep it on file im grasping at straws here after a small silence she said if its any help janice told me he came by here a few times after hours maybe somebody would have seen him then ill be sure to ask glitsky said and then berating himself for not getting to any of this much earlier he thanked holly and continued on his doortodoor down the hallway in the end hed spoken to a living person in every one of the twentytwo businesses in the building and except for holly no one had known janice durbin as other than a professional acquaintance waiting for michael durbin to get back to the novios after his day of work glitsky sat alone for the moment at the dining room table with a cup of tea that kathy had brewed for him then she appeared in the doorway leading to the kitchen with a platter that held a plate of cookies and a china cup of coffee on a matching saucer glitsky watched her place the tray down on the table sitting across from him she picked up her cup and saucer as though afraid that it would shatter how are you holding up glitsky asked her gently she gave him a weak smile is it that obvious every minute i feel like im going to break she wasnt only my sister you know she was my best friend have you thought about talking to somebody a grief counselor you mean she shook her head ive had a couple of my other friends recommend that maybe i should look into it although something tells me that what its going to take mostly is time which right now seems to have stopped moving so it feels kind of hard to depend on it can seem like that i know she lifted her cup put it back down that sounds like experience talking he nodded my first wife he said cancer im sorry glitsky shrugged it was a long time ago it sounds like it still hurts there are moments mostly though you remember the good times the good times sometimes you feel like theyre never going to come back like its completely impossible i know i mean when i think of how it was even so recently here we are me and chuck and the girls sitting here around this table no more than a month ago everybody getting along everybody laughing and loving one another and here i am about to turn forty next week and chuck made up this song they were all going to sing at my big old monster birthday party we were going to have old old really old or something like that the chorus you know really really really old then the girls each wrote their own verse just cruel and witty and funny as hell we were all cracking up and now i see the girls all just so sad and me and chuck in this awful funk she stared across at him the idea that we could ever have a time like that again carefree and happy it just doesnt seem possible suddenly she straightened up dabbing at her eyes with her napkin im sorry she said you dont need to hear this its fine he said its part of it i dont know how you do it she brought her coffee up and sipped at it all the victims and their families theyre all like us a little arent they a little everybody deals with it in their own way but its never easy that must be good for your motivation in your job i mean the pain of the victims glitsky felt the impulse to smile and resisted it its a factor he said they both went to their drinks and sipped can i ask you another question kathy asked i dont know that youve asked even one yet but go ahead what are you here to talk to michael about i thought it was pretty clear that this that janice was ro curtlee glitsky killed a couple of seconds with his tea then there are some unresolved issues like what she brought her hand up to her mouth you mean it might not have been ro you cant think it was michael do you not necessarily ive got some questions for him thats all she put her arms out on the table he didnt do this inspector you dont know him he couldnt have he loved janice all right thats not really an answer im sorry glitsky said i dont really have a better one she had chlamydia glitsky said they were in the libraryoffice the door closed to keep them out of earshot of the rest of the household glitsky half leaned half sat against chucks desk while michael sat at one end of the leather couch his feet up on the coffee table what and now he brought them down as he came forward to the edge of the couch what does that mean its a sexually transmitted no no i know what chlamydia is youre saying that janice had it you didnt know this no how would i if we subpoena your medical records we wouldnt find that youd had yourself treated for chlamydia absolutely not how did you find this out the autopsy why didnt you tell me at the time we thought it might save you from some pain thats when we thought ro curtlee had killed her you dont still think that not so much his alibi stands up he wasnt there i wasnt either thats what youve said did janice tell you she had an std no ive told you we hadnt had sex for two months which is one reason why i thought she was having an affair so now i know why the sex stopped dont i i would have gotten the chlamydia and then would have known for sure wouldnt i and knowing for sure about that and knowing all about how ro curtlee set up his victims and also knowing that he was out on bail if you were going to make it look like him you should have gotten in touch with ro and made sure he didnt have a solid alibi maybe invited him to come by your house on some pretext planted something to look like hed been there glitsky stared down at him waiting michael durbin met his gaze you know lieutenant i agreed to meet you voluntarily tonight but ive got to tell you im not going to listen to this im trying to keep my family together and deal with the tragedy of my wifes death and i just dont have the energy to argue with you anymore about it if youre going to arrest me find some evidence and take me downtown otherwise get the hell out of my face so i can go back to trying to live my life and make it worth something at dinner all eight of the extended family about to start digging into the huge platter of spaghetti and meatballs at the big table michael clinked his wineglass and drew a shaky breath first he said before we move out of here on wednesday all of us durbins want to thank all of you novios for your incredible generosity in letting us share your home these past ten days it makes us realize that this is what family is all about hanging in there together when the times are hardest second he went on heres to jon for coming back to us michael looked at his oldest son i know youve still got reservations but im confident theyre all going to get resolved i want to thank you for putting your trust back in me michael held jons eye knowing that this little speech was mostly for the benefit of peter and the girls to calm the waters jon didnt look exactly like he was sold on his fathers story but for the moment he was giving it the benefit of the doubt and michael felt that was good enoughin any event it was all he was going to get his glance went over to peter and to both of you boys for burying the hatchet and finally kathy put in can i just say heres to janice we will always love you and miss you hear hear chuck intoned and tipped his glass and now kathy said lets start passing the food before it gets cold but the pasta platter hadnt even gone halfway around the table when jon spoke up so dad what did glitsky want to talk to you about michael made a face hes frustrated that he cant seem to put ro curtlee at our house that morning why not chuck asked well evidently his housekeeper says he was at home and glitsky believes her so now he needs something he can point at and prove to shut up his critics hes taking a lot of flak about ro that he blamed everything on him without any real evidence to back him up and how are you going to make any difference about that jon asked i cant michael said hes got the same problem with me but it seems to me like hes getting desperate like hes got to have a different story to tell pretty soon or hes in big trouble himself he put his fork down in fact he went on i was hoping to not get into this discussion but i might as well say it i dont think its entirely out of the question that glitsky might decide to arrest me daddy no allie cried she jumped up out of her chair and came around to put her arms around her father how can he do that you didnt do anything thats right i didnt do anything so theres no way he can prove that i did but well need to all stand togetherhe looked from jon to peterespecially you kids if he does come after me you dont really believe hell do that do you kathy asked i dont see how he can with no evidence but he was planning on arresting ro with just about as much i dont know what hes going to do i doubt even if he does but it would be a good idea if we were a little prepared the power of the police chuck said its scary michael and chuck sat at the kitchen counter with the remains of their wine while kathy did the dishes the kids had dispersed back into the house to start packing for the move on wednesday and to start their homework the talk about his possible if improbable arrest had seemed to grow weightier on michael throughout dinner and he was now on his sixth glass of wine staring into the glass i dont know what id do with the kids he was saying dont be silly kathy replied you know wed take them again a bitter laugh just what you guys need five kids instead of two wed take them in a minute michael chuck said but its not going to happen im glad youre so sure you said it yourself he cant have any evidence against you since you didnt do anything no evidence no trial yeah but even if im arrested all that time before the trial im in jail kathy jumped in at that wed bail you out michael thank you but only if you could well chuck said thats putting the cart way before the horse at this point i dont believe glitskys anywhere near arresting you i was with him today chuck i heard him hes closer than you think and forget about me what would that do to the kids jon already thinks it might have been me if i lost all of them over this he picked up his glass and took a drink i dont know what id do i couldnt let them see me go through it sure you could kathy said youd fight it wed all fight it i dont know if it would be worth it of course it would kathy came around the edge of the counter and picked up michaels still halffull glass then kissed him on the cheek and went back around to the sink she poured out the wine its obvious that this red stuff isnt helping your state of mind at the moment first nobodys going to arrest you and if they do were all on your side to get you back out okay you hear me okay he let out a deep sigh im just so tired tired of the suspicion tired of my sons doubts tired of glitsky and of living without janice of living period dont say that michael he looked up at her with an unfocused blearyeyed gaze oh okay then he said i wont with a stifled cry glitsky jerked and sat up straight in bed his hand over his heart his breathing came in heavy gasps beside him treya was immediately awake one hand on his back the other reaching around to rest over his heart babe what is it are you all right he shook his head from side to side and kept taking heavy breaths abe answer me is it your heart again should i call nineoneone he finally got out some words no no im okay im okay he took another enormous breath and let it out completely ive just got to get up starting to rise no you dont just stay here lie back down i cant yes you darn well can calm down but he stayed in a seated position gradually he brought a hand up and covered where his wife still had her hand pressed against his heart okay he said again as if to himself okay treya whispered so what was that if it wasnt a heart attack a nightmare not a nightmare glitsky said i wasnt asleep so what is it janice durbin he said just another something i missed but this one could be real he turned back to her ive got to get up abe its the middle of the night what are you going to do i dont know but sleeps out of the question he was waiting in the spacious back parking lot to janice durbins office building and saw the african american woman hed met before get out of her own car at a few minutes before eight summoning all of the patience he possessed glitsky gave her another ten minutes to let her get settled and then he went to the door and into the building heading upstairs again to suite she recognized him right away greeting him with a warm smile but im sorry i dont remember your name glitsky he told her lieutenant abe glitsky and im roberta so what can i do for you lieutenant abe glitsky well youll remember yesterday i was asking about who in the building might have known or been close to janice durbin it turns out that might not have been the right question i talked to holly down the hall and she told me that janice had admitted to her that she was seeing someone outside of her marriage and that that person had apparently come by here to this building after hours maybe several times so i noticed you seem to have video cameras mounted over the doors and i wonder if one of them might have picked up a picture of either this guy or his car roberta scrunched up her face in disappointment this would have been more than a week ago then wouldnt it right at least eleven days maybe a lot more she tsked im sorry but i dont think youre going to be in luck were on a sevenday cycle on this building and most of the others we monitor if were going to need to identify somebody usually we know the next day if you know what i mean when the robbery or vandalism is reported three days at the most if its over a weekend youre sure it would have been that long ago at least im afraid glitskys mouth tightened in frustration would you mind telling me how else you monitor the building i notice youve got alarms at the doors people punch in a code when they go in or out right but thats only for offhours normal business hours were wideopen roberta suddenly perked up snapping her fingers but wait heres something else maybe she got up from behind her desk and walked over to a bank of filing cabinets against glitskys righthand wall weve got a nighttime driveby service every two hours from six pm to eight am thats every night physical inspection of the building and parking lot patients and clients and tenants are welcome to use the lot whenever they need to but generally at night its pretty empty and if its a nontenant car they make a note of itlicense number make and model or theyre supposed to she reached into the file and pulled out two relatively thin binders heres the hardcopy reports from january and last december februarys probably still out with the unit youre welcome to look at them at a quarter to four that afternoon novio turned his cell phone on as soon as he got back to his office from his last class chuck its michael he heard durbins voice on his voice mail was hoarse with emotion please call me as soon as you get this its urgent frowning at the tension in his brotherinlaws voice he hit the call back graphic on his iphone and waited for the connection it came before the end of the first ring chuck thank god where are you my office just finishing up can you meet me at janices right away janices office yeah sure whats wrong everything i just talked to glitsky i think hes coming down to your house to arrest me i had to get out of there im not going to jail a pause ive got my shotgun with me novio swore then dont do anything stupid michael ill be right there hang tight less than ten minutes later chuck knocked on janices office door come on in michael sat back his hands clasped in his lap at one end of the couch that was under the window his face looked pasty drawn with fatigue and stress his shotgun lay on the top of the file cabinets next to him the barrels broken open the brass backs of the shells visible in them the weapon was loaded chucks eyes went quickly from michael over to the shotgun then back to michael carefully he closed the door after him then turned back what are you doing he said motioning toward the gun whats that thing doing here i told you im not going to jail chuck of course youre not no i mean i really wasnt going to jail if glitsky was coming down for me i wasnt going to give him the satisfaction i wasnt going to let him put the kids through the whole ordeal of a trial with me a murder suspect the kids would be fine through it michael theyd be way worse if you werent there for them at all im not sure thats true well im telling you it is chuck half turned and lowered himself down onto the front edge of the leather lounge chair well get you the best lawyer in town and but michael was holding up a hand shaking his head no thats not happening in fact none of this is happening none of what what do you mean i mean i came down here thinking it would be a good place to end things you know a little symmetry janice betrayed me and i splash my brains all over her office you see what im saying theres no reason to end things michael if you didnt do it what do you mean if i didnt do it michael moved up to the front edge of the couch his voice raspy you of all people know goddamn well i didnt do it and you know why you know that no i dont chuck was the picture of rational calm and concern for his brotherinlaw except that i believe you if you say it wasnt you michael all but collapsed back on the couch god youre good he said like an inquisitive bird chuck cocked his head to one side what are you talking about michael good at what regaining his composure michael straightened up maybe it was actually getting close to thinking i was going to end my life over this chuck what a goddamn waste that would be when i knew i was innocent so while i was sitting here trying to rationalize myself out of it my brain must have gone into high gear and i remembered something you said something i said michael nodded that first weekend after janice was killed you told me that glitsky had asked you about all these cell phone calls to and from you on janices phone and youd told him that you were both planning a surprise party for kathys birthday that was the reason for them you remember that sure well the thing is chuck you in fact werent planning a surprise party for kathy janice wasnt planning a surprise party for kathy chuck put on a rueful expression i know he said she found out about it and we had to cancel the surprise part i dont see anything sinister in that i wasnt hiding anything no thats funny because once i started thinking about those phone calls that it might have been you who was having the affair with janice stung with a cattle prod chuck held up both hands whoa youre out of your mind michael janice and i didnt michael cut him off so i started thinking you two must have been meeting all those nights she told me she was out with her patients and you were at school working late and where would those meetings have been probably right here and since i was down here anyway i went to the security office just down the hall just a couple of hours ago did you know they keep track of the nontenant cars that are parked here at night hardcopy records chuck with license plate numbers how about that so are you going to try to tell me you were visiting somebody else in this building all those times or maybe you had become one of janices patients and you certainly got here fast enough when i called you today didnt you no directions needed both men were breathing hard in the tense silence after a long moment something went out of chucks shoulders we didnt plan it michael he said it was just one of those things that happened we were trying to stop we didnt want it to hurt anybody in the families i am so so sorry crushed by the enormity of this admission michael hung his head when he looked up again he asked in a hoarse whisper so why did you have to kill her chucks eyes went wide as if he couldnt believe the accusation michael i didnt kill her i swear to god i had no reason to kill her i loved her you loved her but you were fucking someone else too i wasnt chuck she had chlamydia she didnt get it from a toilet seat and she didnt get it from me you gave it to her so who gave it to you one of your students chuck held michaels gaze until it became too much for him and this time it was chuck who hung his head letting out a deep sigh looking back up he saw that michael was wiping tears from his eyes suddenly as quick as the strike of a snake he bolted from the chair and reached out across the small room getting his hands on the shotgun snapping the barrels shut and bringing it to bear on michaels chest you fucking idiot he said you stupid meddling fool he let out a onenote bitter laugh you and janice deserve each other you want to know what happened one of my students happened to go to her for counseling fed her a load of shit about being exploited novio kept talking working himself up all they wanted was their fucking as you know they were happy as hell to trade a little tail for it but janice thought that was wrong that wasnt just fucking that was taking advantage of the poor students his knuckles were growing white holding the shotgun so now its not just being mad at me its a moral crusade and do you know what she was going to do she was going to go not just to kathy but to the school the dean you hear that sure i hear it well that would have been it for me you get it turns out the little bitch was seventeen like i knew lowering his voice he drove in the last nail and thats statutory rape my friend janice was going to call the cops and have them put me in jail she wouldnt even admit it was personal she kept saying that as a therapist she was mandated to report sexual abuse michael sat back on the couch his eyes trained on the twin barrels so what are you going to do now kill me too chuck let out another humorless laugh me im not going to do anything im afraid im going to have not gotten here fast enough i was just coming through the door when my poor brotherinlaw thinking he was about to get arrested for killing his wife blew himself away chuck advanced a step and by the way thanks for the tip about there being no good forensic record with a shotgun coming closer now within a couple of feet he cocked back both hammers and went down to one knee i like this lower angle he said like you put the thing up to your own throat and he pulled both triggers glitsky had started to lead bracco and the three other inspectors in their charge to the door of janice durbins office before they heard the pop and came barreling in with their weapons drawn throw down the gun and put up your hands glitsky yelled the gun chuck novio dropped the shotgun to the floor with a heavy thud he stood there staring down at an unharmed michael durbin as though he were looking at a ghost what the hell pairs of strong hands took each of his arms jerked them back behind his back and fastened them together with handcuffs glitsky was already around novio next to durbin on the couch looking for signs of burns or other damage i think im okay durbin said maybe a little deaf you did good glitsky said you did amazing behind them bracco was telling chuck novio that he was under arrest that he had the right to remain silent that anything he said could and would be used against him glitsky turned back to durbin sorry we didnt get in sooner we thought hed give a little more warning but he moved too fast but the good news is youre okay and we got it all quite a confession as the inspectors marched novio out of the room and down to the waiting car durbin tried to get to his feet but found that he didnt have the strength ive just got to sit here a minute lieutenant he said i cant seem to get my legs to work i feel like i might faint jesus christ poor kathy those poor girls take a deep breath glitsky said put your head down between your knees youll get all the time you need to think about it later for the time being though youre a bona fide hero i dont feel anything like a hero well join the club glitsky said most of em dont there was no evidence glitsky said even after i thought it probably was him i needed evidence i had to trick him he was in a booth at lou the greeks two days later it was after the lunch hour and hence there was no pressure to order the special yeanling clay bowl for the second time in two weeks so abe was drinking iced tea across the table vi lapeer and amanda jenkins sipped their diet cokes it wasnt altogether a casual meeting lapeer had come up to glitskys office needing to understand why hed done what hed done so that she could go and defend it to leland crawford while jenkinswhod drawn the prosecution case against chuck noviosimply wanted to get all the information she could on general principles but what made you even think of him in the first place lapeer asked well i didnt remember it right away in fact almost not at all but he told me a lie the very first time i talked to him i asked him about him being all over janices cell phone and he said he and janice were planning a surprise party for his wife but later his wife kathy was telling me about how they were all planning for her big monster blowout fortieth birthday party she was in on it so it wasnt a surprise now was it luckily the contradiction came back to me lapeer still didnt like it and on that one lie abe you risk a citizens life well two things first it wasnt just the one lie the lie got me to wondering about novio and janice which led to his car in her parking lot still a long way from murder granted and i wouldnt have risked any life on it civilian or otherwise if that was all i had but it wasnt once i was up and had novio on my mind and i admit i was desperate with mr crawford and the curtlees and all that i surfed the web about half the night novios got about fifteen thousand hits on google thousand jenkins asked glitsky nodded sipped his tea so naturally i just found what i wanted in five minutes or so jenkins stared at him youre kidding yes glitsky said it was more like three hours and even then it was lucky im sorry abe but what were you looking for lapeer asked anything nothing i didnt know all i know is that if somebody lies to me during an investigation theres usually a reason and his lie was deliberate around a woman who i knew was having an affair jenkins got him back on point so whatd you find a couple of articles in a small new england newspaper in about this scandal they evidently were having where novio was named as one of the professors who was selling grades for sex the second article just said that all the charges had been withdrawn and a settlement reached jenkins nodded they hushed it up paid off the girl and shipped him out to san francisco with great recommendations thats what i think glitsky said he chewed some of his ice so chief i had janices affair novios past sex with coeds the chlamydia and the lie so i went to janices office and found out hed been parking there after hours basically your smoking gun so i had the affair with janice but still no evidence and no murder okay lapeer said this is where it gets squirrelly so then you go to michael durbin why him his wife was the victim chief he wanted to catch the killer no matter who it was you want to know the truth i came up with the wire idea okay but hes the one who came up with the shotgun which was just brilliant and remember novio would never have admitted any part of this if we interrogated him even if we had him dead to rights on the affair to get him to talk about the murder it had to be with someone he didnt suspect but it could have killed him durbin glitsky shook his head not really not even probably not with empty shells in the shotgun at the worst he could have maybe gotten burned badly burned and sued the city for a zillion dollars true he met the chiefs eyes entirely possible but to tell you the truth i didnt much care about that and michael wasnt going to do that anyway i knew the guy was a justice freak from the curtlee trial hed do what it took and take the consequences he was all the way on board when he realized about novio and janice devastated but on board so amanda continued to go back to the beginning what got novio thinking about this ro getting out exactly glitsky said janice had just told novio what she was going to do to him she just didnt make up her mind fast enough to actually expose him and the hesitationmaybe a couple of days a week at mostthats what killed her because chuckie boy thinks hes ruined and hes going to jail and hes probably right meanwhile just at this time ro gets out and burns up felicia nunezs apartment novio knows the connection between ro and durbin and comes up with this great idea make it look like ro did it and hey while were at it slash the paintings that would be ro all over glitskys face went sour and i almost helped him get away with it lapeer reached a hand across the table and touched his thats a big almost abe i wouldnt get yourself too wrapped up in it and meanwhile if this whole thing comes up in shall we say loftier surroundings which it will youre comfortable with me saying michael durbin got into this because he volunteered glitsky gave a measured nod thought a minute then nodded again that would not be inaccurate he said since the slaughter last friday the couriers offices had been in a state of upheaval cliff and theresa curtlee had been handson managers and without their presence the ship was rudderless and marrenas felt it keenly the office manager was already engaged in a threeway power struggle with the managing editor and the head of sales the stock had plummeted and rumors of a hostile takeover by the mcclatchy group had put everyone on edge the past four columns by heinous marrenas had eulogized the curtlees and their legacy such as it was beyond that shed made as much hay as she could blasting the police department and the district attorney for their unscrupulous persecution of ro curtlee a man who was guilty of nothing more than coming from a family who had dared to take on the citys entrenched law enforcement establishment while it trotted out every trick in the book in a concerted effort to deny him his civil rights with her network of informers at the hall of justice by last monday morning shed discovered that ro curtlee had in fact not murdered janice durbin and for her it was but a short and seemingly logical extrapolation to conclude that hed had nothing to do with the other murders either now she was in the middle of her friday column in which she was well on the way to characterizing the murderous actions of linda salcedo at the curtlee mansion as the work of a lowintelligence disgruntled domestic employee it was shaping up to be the kind of emotional broadside she was best at and she was wrestling with her prose when suddenly the door to her office opened and a man came in like a blast of angry wind who let this man in what was going on in the front office that he hadnt been stopped standing up whirling to face him her hands went to the phone to call security and her eyes flashed in fury over the invasion of her privacy what the hell but in the next second she recognized him she replaced the phones headpiece and leaned forward over her desk her weight on her hands and arms youre michael durbin thats right durbin wore jeans and a windbreaker and carried a large cloth book bag from the san francisco mystery bookstore over his shoulders how are you doing this morning im fine she said but as you can see im in the middle of a column normally i dont take appointments until my columns done for the day heads are going to roll over this marrenas was thinking whoever let this clown into the building forcing on a patient smile she said but since youre already here i can probably spare a couple of minutes what can i do for you do you want to take a seat that would be nice thanks he pulled around the cafeteria chair from the side of her desk when hed gotten seated marrenas sat back down too well durbin pursed his lips took in a breath well sheilado you mind if i call you sheilai noticed that the past few days youve been going out of your way to clear the name of ro curtlee bringing out all the facts of the police investigation and so on right thats what i durbin held up a hand stopping her im very familiar with what you do sheila as you know more familiar than most what im down here for today is to tell you about the damage you do to let you know how close you came to destroying me and my family and to let you know that weve come out of it stronger and better well im glad to see durbin stopped her again please you and your poisonous column came a long way toward convincing my boy jon that his father was capable of murdering his mother marrenas shifted her gaze im very sorry about that i was going on the facts as i knew them at the time for the record i didnt print anything that was factually wrong so if youre entertaining a lawsuit forget about it im sure thats how you justify your hatchet jobs to yourself select the facts you need for your own purposes ignore context and avoid responsibility marrenas huffed in selfrighteousness im not an irresponsible journalist mr durbin im an investigative reporter she gestured to the walls around her office the plaques for her awards and achievements they dont give these things out in cracker jack boxes you know no im sure they dont but let me give you a couple of facts feel free to take notes if you want first of course the most important facti didnt kill my wife second i love my children third since i didnt kill janice the alleged affair that i had with my good friend liza sato could not have been the motive for that murder now could it and as for her sticking up for me at our workplace that was the simple loyalty of a friend not an example of collusion to help me with a coverup are you getting all this marrenas gave him a dismissive shrug durbin went on finally heres some excellent news about my plans for the future im going to take janices life insurance and enough from the fire to build a new house im going to resurrect my career as a painter the career you helped destroy for me ten years ago how does that sound to you good marrenas said her eyes frankly nervous now flitting back and forth between durbin and the door behind him that sounds good im very glad to see that things will work out for you but i really have to insist you leave now durbin shifted his weight in his chair fine but i want you to know that ill still have enough cash left over so that if i ever see my name in your column again im going to pay someone to hunt you down and kill you like the vermin you are staggered by the verbal assault she could do nothing but stare at him unless of course durbin said i dont think youre taking me seriously in which case maybe ill just do it myself right now durbin reached into his book bag and brought out a small handgun marrenass eyes went wide with panic she put her hands out in front of her oh my god dont no please oh god i just peed my pants im so sorry i didnt mean to hurt anyone i was just trying to do the best job i could please please dont durbin allowed himself a small tight smile good he said i appear to have your undivided attention im going to quote a famous line from the graduate sheila you ready for it plastics he reached out and placed the toy gun on the front edge of her desk keep it as a souvenir to remember me by he said and dont even think about calling the police after all what harm could i have done with a plastic gun and i can practically guarantee that they might just agree with the position you took in your column on ro curtleethat threatening people really isnt a big deal but never forget what i told you if my name ever appears in your column again i will have you killed nowhe smiled at herhave yourself a nice day frannie hardy came back into their house on sunday morning just as her husband dismas was sitting down to the hash and egg breakfast hed cooked up in the tenpound castiron pan he kept hanging from a marlin hook over their stove where have you been he asked her i was thinking about getting worried thats what i love about you she said that almost worried quality im pacing myself hardy said you dont want to get too worked up and worry unnecessarily he pointed down at his plate you want some of this ive got plenty no you go ahead she sat down across from him where were you anyway he asked and dont say something impossible like the galapagos islands or the ukraine or someplace she said i went to church i told you no kidding around im not kidding i went to church i could even tell you the specific one if you want hardy put down his fork and looked across at her not that its not a fine thing to do especially here on a sunday morning and all but now i am a little worried is everything all right everythings fine us health kids all good but but remember the other night when you and abe were sitting here doing the postmortem on all this madness with ro curtlee and he was telling you how it had all begun this time around with the burning death of this poor woman felicia nunez whod evidently been one of his first victims too i remember it all too well what about her well for some reason i couldnt get the idea of her out of my mind i mean heres this young girl comes up to this country full of hope from guatemala she gets raped by her bosses son does the right thing and testifies against him then goes to work in a dry cleaners lives alone probably never has a boyfriend maybe because of shame about the rape and finally ro gets out of jail and basically the first thing he does is kill her and burn her body frannie grabbed hardys napkin and dabbed at the corners of her eyes its just so unfair so unbearable hey hardy got up and came around the table put his arm around her hey more gently he kissed the top of her head and she leaned into him after a minute she sighed i dont know why but it just came to me sometime in the middle of last night that abe said there really was nobody to mourn for her nobody even to come and get her body and it just struck me as so so sad so i decided id go down to the church and light a candle and say a prayer for her i know its such a small thing and its probably just superstitious and silly but i just thought hardy said its a beautiful thing fran you are a beautiful person well not really so much but at least it was something for somebody who never had anything not even a tiny chance do you know what im saying i felt like i had to do something so she could maybe at least if there is such a thing rest in peace you know hardy tightened his arm across his wifes shoulders amen he said since the present theyd bought for zachary glitskys fourth birthday was a relatively bulky electric piano keyboard hardy wound up dropping frannie off early that sunday afternoon at the bottom of the steps to glitskys door after which he continued to drive around looking for a place to park when he finally made it to the front door hardy rang the doorbell heard footsteps approaching inside and then glitskys voice who is it the easter bunny hardy said youre a few weeks early im getting a jump on the holiday get it jump good one glitsky said are you going to open the door if you say please nearly ten minutes later hardy was still sitting on the top step outside when wes farrell and sam duncan appeared at the bottom of the stairs farrell was carrying a small giftwrapped box he looked up to see his former partner cooling his heels in jeans and a buttondown shirt hey diz what are you doing out here isnt abe home isnt this where the partys supposed to be hes home all right hardy stood up shook hands with farrell gave sam a hug hes being immature lets see if hell open the door for you and hardy reached out and rang the doorbell again he heard the footsteps coming up to the inside of the door who is it dont say the easter bunny hardy whispered farrell gave hardy a quizzical look ill resist the temptation then to the door wes farrell district attorney he said he loves to say that sam said makes him sound like an action hero hey farrell said i am an action hero the door opened smiles and greetings finally glitsky looking around wes and sam and saying with apparent surprise hey diz when did you get here just now with the rest of the party frannie appeared from the kitchen coming up behind glitsky when she saw hardy she said hey babe i was starting to get worried how far away did you have to park couple of miles hardy said twenty minutes later the three men stood in a knot over in the far corner of glitskys backyard while six women glitskys father nat and a gaggle of kids were deeply involved in a cutthroat game of pin the tail on the donkey youre damn right theres no bail on novio farrell was saying on what possible legal basis hardy asked lying in wait makes it special circumstances he was lying in wait at her house thats my position for how long was he lying in wait long enough glitsky said thats a perfect cop answer hardy said but how do you know he didnt just knock at the door knowing durbin had gone off to work and come on in like he had a hundred times before no this day was different abe interrogated him personally and he admitted to lying in wait unequivocally you tricked him i wouldnt have done that glitsky said that would have been unethical hardy looked from one of them to the other you gentlemen better be careful you dont give this guy grounds for appeal thats all im saying duly noted farrell said but im not going to let a possible appeal affect the vigor of my prosecutions thats what the people elected me for and thats the way im going to run the show from here on out spoken like a true da at last hardy said farrell seemed to consider that for a moment damn straight he said thats exactly what i am all the other presents were opened farrell picked up his box and crossed the living room where zachary sat surrounded by the days bootythe portable piano a football a game boy box that abe was clearly not all that pleased with several books the latest disney dvd here you go zack uncle wes saved the best for last zachary untied the bow pulled off the ribbon and ripped off the wrapping paper seeing the shape and size of the box underneath sam turned to wes and said you didnt hell love it wes said guaranteed go ahead bud take it out and wear it proudly zachary couldnt read yet which was probably just as well the tshirt read lock up your daughters
