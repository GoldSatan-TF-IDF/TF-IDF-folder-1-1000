king pest by edgar allan poe the gods do bear and will allow in kings the things which they abhor in rascal routes buckhursts tragedy of ferrex and porrex about twelve oclock one night in the month of october and during the chivalrous reign of the third edward two seamen belonging to the crew of the free and easy a trading schooner plying between sluys and the thames and then at anchor in that river were much astonished to find themselves seated in the taproom of an alehouse in the parish of st andrews londonwhich alehouse bore for sign the portraiture of a jolly tar the room although illcontrived smokeblackened lowpitched and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the periodwas nevertheless in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it sufficiently well adapted to its purpose of these groups our two seamen formed i think the most interesting if not the most conspicuous the one who appeared to be the elder and whom his companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of legs was at the same time much the taller of the two he might have measured six feet and a half and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormoussuperfluities in height were however more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects he was exceedingly thin and might as his associates asserted have answered when drunk for a pennant at the masthead or when sober have served for a jibboom but these jests and others of a similar nature had evidently produced at no time any effect upon the cachinnatory muscles of the tar with high cheekbones a large hawknose retreating chin fallen underjaw and huge protruding white eyes the expression of his countenance although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or description the younger seaman was in all outward appearance the converse of his companion his stature could not have exceeded four feet a pair of stumpy bowlegs supported his squat unwieldy figure while his unusually short and thick arms with no ordinary fists at their extremities swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a seaturtle small eyes of no particular color twinkled far back in his head his nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round full and purple face and his thick upperlip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent selfsatisfaction much heightened by the owners habit of licking them at intervals he evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling halfwondrous halfquizzical and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of ben nevis various and eventful however had been the peregrinations of the worthy couple in and about the different taphouses of the neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night funds even the most ample are not always everlasting and it was with empty pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie at the precise period then when this history properly commences legs and his fellow hugh tarpaulin sat each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the floor and with a hand upon either cheek they were eyeing from behind a huge flagon of unpaidfor hummingstuff the portentous words no chalk which to their indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny not that the gift of decyphering written charactersa gift among the commonalty of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditingcould in strict justice have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the sea but there was to say the truth a certain twist in the formation of the lettersan indescribable leelurch about the wholewhich foreboded in the opinion of both seamen a long run of dirty weather and determined them at once in the allegorical words of legs himself to pump ship clew up all sail and scud before the wind having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale and looped up the points of their short doublets they finally made a bolt for the street although tarpaulin rolled twice into the fireplace mistaking it for the door yet their escape was at length happily effectedand half after twelve oclock found our heroes ripe for mischief and running for life down a dark alley in the direction of st andrews stair hotly pursued by the landlady of the jolly tar at the epoch of this eventful tale and periodically for many years before and after all england but more especially the metropolis resounded with the fearful cry of plague the city was in a great measure depopulatedand in those horrible regions in the vicinity of the thames where amid the dark narrow and filthy lanes and alleys the demon of disease was supposed to have had his nativity awe terror and superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban and all persons forbidden under pain of death to intrude upon their dismal solitude yet neither the mandate of the monarch nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets nor the prospect of that loathsome death which with almost absolute certainty overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped by the hand of nightly rapine of every article such as iron brass or leadwork which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account above all it was usually found upon the annual winter opening of the barriers that locks bolts and secret cellars had proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust during the period of exile to so insufficient a security but there were very few of the terrorstricken people who attributed these doings to the agency of human hands pestspirits plaguegoblins and feverdemons were the popular imps of mischief and tales so bloodchilling were hourly told that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was at length enveloped in terror as in a shroud and the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had created leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom silence pestilence and death it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned and which indicated the region beyond to be under the pestban that in scrambling down an alley legs and the worthy hugh tarpaulin found their progress suddenly impeded to return was out of the question and no time was to be lost as their pursuers were close upon their heels with thoroughbred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plankwork was a trifle and maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure and holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings were soon bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses had they not indeed been intoxicated beyond moral sense their reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation the air was cold and misty the pavingstones loosened from their beds lay in wild disorder amid the tall rank grass which sprang up around the feet and ankles fallen houses choked up the streets the most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailedand by the aid of that ghastly light which even at midnight never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential at atmosphere might be discerned lying in the bypaths and alleys or rotting in the windowless habitations the carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very perpetration of his robbery but it lay not in the power of images or sensations or impediments such as these to stay the course of men who naturally brave and at that time especially brimful of courage and of hummingstuff would have reeled as straight as their condition might have permitted undauntedly into the very jaws of death onwardstill onward stalked the grim legs making the desolate solemnity echo and reecho with yells like the terrific warwhoop of the indian and onward still onward rolled the dumpy tarpaulin hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion and far surpassing the latters most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music by bullroarings in basso from the profundity of his stentorian lungs they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horriblethe paths more narrow and more intricate huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them gave evidence by their sullen and heavy descent of the vast height of the surrounding houses and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse suddenly as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and ghastlylooking building a yell more than usually shrill from the throat of the excited legs was replied to from within in a rapid succession of wild laughterlike and fiendish shrieks nothing daunted at sounds which of such a nature at such a time and in such a place might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door burst it open and staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an undertaker but an open trapdoor in a corner of the floor near the entrance looked down upon a long range of winecellars whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents in the middle of the room stood a tablein the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch bottles of various wines and cordials together with jugs pitchers and flagons of every shape and quality were scattered profusely upon the board around it upon coffintressels was seated a company of six this company i will endeavor to delineate one by one fronting the entrance and elevated a little above his companions sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the table his stature was gaunt and tall and legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself his face was as yellow as saffronbut no feature excepting one alone was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description this one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded upon the natural head his mouth was puckered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability and his eyes as indeed the eyes of all at table were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication this gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a richlyembroidered black silkvelvet pall wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a spanish cloakhis head was stuck full of sable hearseplumes which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air and in his right hand he held a huge human thighbone with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of the company for a song opposite him and with her back to the door was a lady of no whit the less extraordinary character although quite as tall as the person just described she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation she was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of october beer which stood with the head driven in close by her side in a corner of the chamber her face was exceedingly round red and full and the same peculiarity or rather want of peculiarity attached itself to her countenance which i before mentioned in the case of the presidentthat is to say only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy with the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth commencing at the right ear it swept with a terrific chasm to the leftthe short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into the aperture she made however every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified in a dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin at her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to patronise this delicate little creature in the trembling of her wasted fingers in the livid hue of her lips and in the slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion gave evident indications of a galloping consumption an air of gave extreme haut ton however pervaded her whole appearance she wore in a graceful and degage manner a large and beautiful windingsheet of the finest india lawn her hair hung in ringlets over her neck a soft smile played about her mouth but her nose extremely long thin sinuous flexible and pimpled hung down far below her under lip and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression over against her and upon the left of the dropsical lady was seated a little puffy wheezing and gouty old man whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders of their owner like two huge bladders of oporto wine with his arms folded and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration he evidently prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance but took more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudycolored surtout this to say the truth must have cost him no little money and was made to fit him exceedingly wellbeing fashioned from one of the curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons which in england and elsewhere are customarily hung up in some conspicuous place upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy next to him and at the right hand of the president was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers his frame shook in a ridiculous manner with a fit of what tarpaulin called the horrors his jaws which had been newly shaved were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists it prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table a precaution rendered necessary in the opinion of legs by the peculiarly sottish and winebibbing cast of his visage a pair of prodigious ears nevertheless which it was no doubt found impossible to confine towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment and were occasionally pricked up in a spasm at the sound of the drawing of a cork fronting him sixthly and lastly was situated a singularly stifflooking personage who being afflicted with paralysis must to speak seriously have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating habiliments he was habited somewhat uniquely in a new and handsome mahogany coffin its top or headpiece pressed upon the skull of the wearer and extended over it in the fashion of a hood giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest armholes had been cut in the sides for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience but the dress nevertheless prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates and as he lay reclining against his tressel at an angle of fortyfive degrees a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the celling in absolute amazement at their own enormity before each of the party lay a portion of a skull which was used as a drinking cup overhead was suspended a human skeleton by means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling the other limb confined by no such fetter stuck off from the body at right angles causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment in the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene while coffins and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker were piled high up around the room and against the windows preventing any ray from escaping into the street at sight of this extraordinary assembly and of their still more extraordinary paraphernalia our two seamen did not conduct themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been expected legs leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual and spread open his eyes to their fullest extent while hugh tarpaulin stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table and spreading out a palm upon either knee burst into a long loud and obstreperous roar of very illtimed and immoderate laughter without however taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude the tall president smiled very graciously upon the intrudersnodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumesand arising took each by an arm and led him to a seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation legs to all this offered not the slightest resistance but sat down as he was directed while tile gallant hugh removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head of the table to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in the winding sheet plumped down by her side in high glee and pouring out a skull of red wine quaffed it to their better acquaintance but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin seemed exceedingly nettled and serious consequences might have ensued had not the president rapping upon the table with his truncheon diverted the attention of all present to the following speech it becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion в avast there interrupted legs looking very serious avast there a bit i say and tell us who the devil ye all are and what business ye have here rigged off like the foul fiends and swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate will wimble the undertaker at this unpardonable piece of illbreeding all the original company half started to their feet and uttered the same rapid succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the seamen the president however was the first to recover his composure and at length turning to legs with great dignity recommenced most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of guests so illustrious unbidden though they be know then that in these dominions i am monarch and here rule with undivided empire under the title of king pest the first this apartment which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of will wimble the undertakera man whom we know not and whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal earsthis apartment i say is the daischamber of our palace devoted to the councils of our kingdom and to other sacred and lofty purposes the noble lady who sits opposite is queen pest our serene consort the other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of his grace the arch duke pestiferoushis grace the duke pestilentialhis grace the duke tempestand her serene highness the arch duchess anapest as regards continued he your demand of the business upon which we sit here in council we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns and concerns alone our own private and regal interest and is in no manner important to any other than ourself but in consideration of those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled we will furthermore explain that we are here this night prepared by deep research and accurate investigation to examine analyze and thoroughly determine the indefinable spiritthe incomprehensible qualities and natureof those inestimable treasures of the palate the wines ales and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all whose dominions are unlimited and whose name is death whose name is davy jones ejaculated tarpaulin helping the lady by his side to a skull of liqueur and pouring out a second for himself profane varlet said the president now turning his attention to the worthy hugh profane and execrable wretchwe have said that in consideration of those rights which even in thy filthy person we feel no inclination to violate we have condescended to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries we nevertheless for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a gallon of black straphaving imbibed which to the prosperity of our kingdomat a single draughtand upon your bended kneesye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way or remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table according to your respective and individual pleasures it would be a matter of utter impossibility replied legs whom the assumptions and dignity of king pest the first had evidently inspired some feelings of respect and who arose and steadied himself by the table as he spokeit would please your majesty be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even onefourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just mentioned to say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast and not to mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different seaports i have at present a full cargo of humming stuff taken in and duly paid for at the sign of the jolly tar you will therefore please your majesty be so good as to take the will for the deedfor by no manner of means either can i or will i swallow another dropleast of all a drop of that villainous bilgewater that answers to the hall of black strap belay that interrupted tarpaulin astonished not more at the length of his companions speech than at the nature of his refusalbelay that you tubberand i say legs none of your palaver my hull is still light although i confess you yourself seem to be a little topheavy and as for the matter of your share of the cargo why rather than raise a squall i would find stowageroom for it myself but в this proceeding interposed the president is by no means in accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence which is in its nature median and not to be altered or recalled the conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter and that without a moments hesitationin failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of october beer a sentencea sentencea righteous and just sentencea glorious decreea most worthy and upright and holy condemnation shouted the pest family altogether the king elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes ugh ugh ugh chuckled tarpaulin without heeding the general excitation ugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughi was saying said he i was saying when mr king pest poked in his marlinspike that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or less of black strap it was a trifle to a tight seaboat like myself not overstowedbut when it comes to drinking the health of the devil whom god assoilzie and going down upon my marrow bones to his illfavored majesty there whom i know as well as i know myself to be a sinner to be nobody in the whole world but tim hurlygurly the stageplayerwhy its quite another guess sort of a thing and utterly and altogether past my comprehension he was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity at the name tim hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats treason shouted his majesty king pest the first treason said the little man with the gout treason screamed the arch duchess anapest treason muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up treason growled he of the coffin treason treason shrieked her majesty of the mouth and seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate tarpaulin who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur she lifted him high into the air and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale bobbing up and down for a few seconds like an apple in a bowl of toddy he at length finally disappeared amid the whirlpool of foam which in the already effervescent liquor his struggles easily succeeded in creating not tamely however did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his companion jostling king pest through the open trap the valiant legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath and strode towards the centre of the room here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table he laid it about him with so much energy and good will that as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of october ale and hugh tarpaulin he rolled it over and over in an instant out burst a deluge of liquor so fierceso impetuousso overwhelmingthat the room was flooded from wall to wallthe loaded table was overturnedthe tressels were thrown upon their backsthe tub of punch into the fireplaceand the ladies into hysterics piles of deathfurniture floundered about jugs pitchers and carboys mingled promiscuously in the melee and wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk the man with the horrors was drowned upon the spotthe little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffinand the victorious legs seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud rushed out with her into the street and made a beeline for the free and easy followed under easy sail by the redoubtable hugh tarpaulin who having sneezed three or four times panted and puffed after him with the arch duchess anapest
