david dalglish blood of the underworld prologue the city of veldaren was his to protect but more than ever haern felt himself losing control as he watched the body bleed at his feet it had rained just before dark muddying the streets and back alleys blood mixed with the wet ground the dead mans face was halfburied mouth open in death throat opened by blade and both were filling with mud in the moonlight the green of the dead mans cloak took on a sickly hue haern doubted any would shed tears for the loss but that was beside the point he was the kings watcher enforcer of veldaren and such violence could not be tolerated yet despite the work of his sabers the violence was steadily rising i hope you find a better life beyond this haern said shutting the dead thiefs eye so it no longer stared up at him no one should die in the mud he stood pulling the hood over his face in its shadow he peered about the alley come morning hed alert a guard to the location of the body but before then he needed to investigate if the murder was what he thought it was thered be a sign somewhere a message for the serpent guild where the guards would overlook on either side of him were stone buildings their sides slick from the rain haern slowly checked one then the other until he found it cut into the stone was a crude squiggle representing a snake a jagged line crossed over its head below it was a fresh circle with eight tiny lines spider guild is spreading haern whispered to himself as he rubbed his chin or was this revenge he knew of no particular bad blood between the serpents and spiders but that didnt mean much the thief guilds were all battling for territory a direct result of the peace haern had bought with blood the three wealthiest families of neldar known as the trifect paid handsomely for protection of the entire city yet over the past two years that amount had carefully shrunk as had the size of most thief guilds every bit of land meant a higher payout with the increase of killings the number of guildless criminals had risen they knew the risk the watcher posed they knew what he was capable of but it was starting to no longer matter the thieves were getting desperate they werent afraid of him anymore haern leapt to the rooftops determined to rekindle that fear every night he scoured the city often changing his route he watched and listened always wrapped in his gray cloaks for years hed foiled wars between the guilds disrupting their plans but there were no more plans the thieves were wounded animals biting at everything they saw every night he found a new body a new symbol or a new message he wasnt certain where the various guilds territories ended anymore and he doubted the guilds themselves knew for sure he ran east footsteps in the mud led that way from the corpse perhaps it was time he gave the guilds a message of his own the steps grew fainter out in the wild there were many who were better trackers but within the confines of a city haern was the master leaping up to the rooftops he ran along still following the telltale signs a knocked over barrel here a bit of mud brushed against a wall there after a time he felt like he was inside the murderers mind heading toward safe territory except that was wrong nowhere was safe not from him haern found the spider talking with a fellow guildmate the two standing before a tavern that had long since closed one held a knife and he gestured wildly with it while telling a story the blood on the blade was not yet dry haern worked his way closer silently crawling across the roof until he was just above them his ear leaning toward the edge of the tavern a little bitch said the man with the knife course they are what you expect from a bunch of fags loyal to that ket bastard still youd expect him to die like a man put a knife at my throat you wouldnt hear me blubbering like a child haern drew one of his sabers a dark grin spread across his face was that so perhaps he should test that theory like a ghost he fell upon them not a sound to give them warning his knees crashed into shoulders of the man wielding the knife he heard a crack of bone and the man dropped the other stood shocked still his eyes wide haern kicked his heel crushing windpipe as he fell haern turned his attention on the boaster who lay dazed in the mud from his head hitting the ground so is this how a man dies haern asked as he put the tip of his saber against the thiefs throat he shouldnt be wasting time he knew he was deep in spider territory and they would fight him if enough gathered together not that he feared them only their guild leader gave him pause thren felhorn his father the thief swallowed the movement rubbing the tip up and down against his throat i didnt do nothing he said ive been here all night do you think i care haern knelt closer his free hand grabbing the back of the mans head and holding it still he stared into his eyes then flinched as if he were to thrust the thief let out a cry the smell of urine reached haerns nose he leaned closer his lips hovering before the mans ear i see tears in your eyes he whispered the hilt of his saber cracked down hard atop the thiefs head knocking him out cold slowly rising he drew his other saber and turned to his initial prey the murderer the man sat on his rear both hands clutching his throat he was gasping for air the sound akin to wind blowing over the top of a chimney blood dripped down his wrist to his elbow and then to the ground you slit a serpents throat haern said towering over him care to tell me why the man coughed crimson blobs flecking across his pants he gasped a few times as if to hold his breath underwater then forced out a word trespassing haern shook his head not good enough he said not even close he shoved his sabers into the mans chest through his heart pulling them free he kicked the body to the ground then slashed open his neck the death was quick the message given his throat dry haern turned back to the thief hed left unconscious he almost killed him almost but enough blood had spilled that night and it wouldnt be the last once thren found out hed retaliate against the serpent guild back and forth always back and forth without end he sheathed his blades and turned to go and that was when he heard the scream it came from a distant alley that of a thickvoiced male haern followed it guessing which alley to turn down the night was quiet no one foolish enough to be out and about so deep in spider territory at first he thought hed guessed wrong but then he found the victim he lay on his back at the farthest stretch of a dead end alley arms splayed outward his gray cloak signified him a member of the spider guild no wounds were upon him but for the tiny arrow embedded in his throat haern walked over to it his stomach turning another but by who and why standing over it haern felt something tickling the back of his mind something odd the thief had been a smaller man wiry probably picked for his deft hands instead of brute strength hardly a whisker grew on his face his face his eyes were closed as was his mouth that was it a lethal hit with an arrow should have left him gasping in pain his face reflecting that upon death but it did not the killer had shut his eyes and mouth to create the appearance of sleep but why knowing he had little choice haern reached down pushed two fingers between the dead mans teeth and pried his jaw open the starlight reflected off the metal immediately and something about the sight sent a chill down haerns spine lying on his tongue were two gold coins stacked atop one another haern took them trying to decide the significance a personal vendetta a paid hit by another guild laughter startled him and he reached for his blade he let it go when he realized it was just a drunken man curled against the wall nearly invisible in the darkness sorry bout the scream he said drinking from the halfempty bottle he held didnt mean to scare anybody did you see who did this the drunk shook his head like this when i got here nearly tripped over the damn thing haern frowned so the scream had been from the drunk not the man dying it didnt surprise him given how dry the blood was across the mans throat he yanked out the arrow held it up to the moonlight he caught sight of tiny flecks of poison on the metal a professional hit but again by who and why he glanced about looking for a message and quickly found it that he hadnt spotted it immediately upon entering the alley unnerved him it was large and written in blood tongue of gold eyes of silver run run little spider from the widows quiver the widow haern wondered aloud the drunks laughter stole away his concentration you got competition he said then laughed again haern looked to the gold coins in his hand and didnt see the humor reading over the simple rhyme a thought hit him tightening his stomach into a knot bending down beside the body he carefully lifted open the dead mans eyelids damn it he whispered damn it all to the abyss his eyes were gone replaced by two silver coins staring up at the moonlight haern left them for the guards to take haern returned home to the eschaton tower exhausted hed scoured the area surrounding the murder as best he could and tracked down several runners of the spider guild the few he found had heard nothing seen nothing and even when threatened they showed no sign of lying leaving veldaren for the tower hed felt nothing but frustration and bafflement he kept repeating the phrase in his head tongue of gold eyes of silver as he opened the door the smell of cooked eggs welcomed him home delysia was the only one awake and she sat beside the fireplace with a plate on her lap the orange light shone across her red hair making it seem all the more vibrant seeing him she smiled the smile faded from her youthful face when she noticed his sour mood something wrong she asked ill talk about it later he promised heading for the stairs dont you want something to eat he shook his head he just wanted sleep hopefully when he woke up hed have new ideas as to why someone had killed a member of the spider guild in such a ritualisticnot to mention expensivemanner the thought of eating twisted his stomach anyway hed seen a lot of horrible things but for some reason he couldnt get the image out of his head of the corpses vacant eye sockets replaced with coins eyes of silver haern climbed the stairs until he reached the fifth floor and his room hurrying inside he sat down on his bed removed his sword belt and drew out his sabers carefully he cleaned them with a cloth refusing to go to bed with dirty swords no matter how tired he was that was lazy and sloppy and laziness and sloppiness had a way of sneaking out of one habit and into another his many tutors had hammered that into his head while growing up all so he could be a worthy heir to his fathers empire of thieves and murderers he chuckled put away his swords not quite according to plan he thought imagining thren scowling not quite at all run run little spider his bed felt like the most wonderful thing in the world and with a heavy cloth draped over his window he closed his eyes amid blessed darkness sleep came quickly despite his troubled mind it did not however last long hey haern he opened an eye saw his mercenary leader sitting beside him on the bed his red beard and hair were unkempt from a nights sleep he wore his wizards robes strangely dyed a yellow color for reasons he was sure hed never hear trying not to smack the man haern rolled over go away tarlak good morning to you too haern haern sighed the wizard had something to say and he wasnt going to leave until he said it rolling back haern shot him a tired glare what some fancy new noble is returning to the city today tarlak said rubbing his fingernails against his robe and staring at them as if he were only mildly interested lord victor kane perhaps youve heard of him the name was only vaguely familiar which meant hed been gone from veldaren for a very long time if he remembered correctly he was just another one of those lords who lived outside the city and liked to occasionally make a scene proclaiming how horrible veldaren was and how much better itd be if their ideas were listened to all hot air no substance why should i care haern asked leaning against his pillow and closing his eyes because hell be meeting the king soon perhaps within the hour normally this wouldnt be a big deal but it sounds like hes bringing a veritable army with him as if king vaelor would let them pass through the gates thats the thing tarlak said it sounds like he will he sent a message to the king i wont bore you with all the details much of it was the standard pompous nonsense these lords are fond of but one comment in particular was interesting enough my informant thought it worth waking me up early haern put his forearm across his eyes and what was that i believe it was something to the extent of right now thieves police thieves yet when i am done there will be no thieves at all tarlak stood from the bed walked over to the door sounds like someone plans on taking your job he left the room once more returned to quiet darkness haern sat up tossed the blankets aside damn it all king edwin vaelor fidgeted on his throne eager for the meeting to begin beside him stood his aging advisor gerand crold looking tired and bored theyd emptied out the grand throne room of any petitioners and guests per gerands request the advisor rubbed at the lengthy scar along his face as if it bothered him a sign of nervousness belying the calm facade he showed for some reason this made edwin all the more impatient over the years hed listened to what felt like a hundred lords all talk about how they could do a better job policing veldaren a few had even tried such as when alyssa gemcroft unleashed an army of mercenaries upon the streets for a disastrous two nights half the city had damn near burned to the ground because of it too yet at least alyssa he could understand given her belief at the time of her sons death women did strange things when facing loss this lord victor though you sure he has no family he asked gerand quite sure unless he has kept them in secret the king scratched at his neck he wore his finest robes lined with velvet and furs that were dyed dark reds and purples itd been too long since he had worn it and it itched still he wanted to show this upstart noble his wealth to remind him of his regality and his divine right to rule all of neldar what about a son or a daughter forgive me milord but i do consider that family and as i said he has none edwin shot gerand a glare and he bowed low in apology forgive me he said i did not mean to speak with so harsh a tongue try not to do so again he might have made a stronger threat to someone else but gerand had served him loyally for years any threat would have been false and both knew it he was too important to lose but again it showed gerands true nervousness why what was it about lord victor that worried him so youve met him before havent you he asked gerand nodded adjusted the collar of his shirt my wifes family lives on his lands he said ive spoken to him only once but that was enough he is not a man to forget my liege nor take lightly if he says he will accomplish something then he will accomplish it regardless the cost then why worry hes pledged to clean out the streets let him try and fail gerand cleared his throat that is the thing he wont fail what he promises is war like which we have not had in four years the king grunted you mean when that gemcroft bitch went mad yes like that gerand said dryly edwin leaned back in his chair and drank a tart wine from his goblet smacking his lips he set it down and shook his head if thats all he plans then ill laugh in his face and send him back out to whatever runty castle he came from the thieves are like rats and theyve grown exceptionally skilled lately at hiding in the walls on the opposite side of the room at the end of the crimson carpet leading to the raised dais there came a knock on the heavy doors the guards stationed there waited for an order edwin sighed rubbed his eyes too early he hadnt had much to eat and coupled with the wine it left him with a sharp headache stupid lords stupid naive lords thinking they had every answer send him in he said his voice echoing down the hall but only him two guards bowed and then they cracked open one of the doors and stepped out a moment later it swung open wide and in stepped lord victor flanked by the guard the king studied him as he approached he was a tall man lean with muscle his blond hair was cut short about his neck his face cleanly shaven instead of the expected attire of nobles he wore tall boots a red tunic showing the symbol of his house and a suit of chainmail a sword was strapped to his thigh and edwin felt his ire rise this time for his guards being dense enough to let him keep it greetings my king victor said smiling wide gods he was handsome his voice strong confident it made edwin sick and filled him with an irrational desire to slap him across the face welcome to my home edwin said not rising he gestured to the mans tunic i must confess i have not seen that symbol in many a long year i cannot remember its meaning victor glanced down at his chest having a family crest go unrecognized would normally be considered an insult but victor didnt seem the slightest bit bothered it is a pair of wings stretched wide before the sun he said their gold melds together as is appropriate our wealth comes from the birds of the forest the fields that grow beneath the sun and the strength of our kin rising every day without fail to do what must be done you kanes must be a proud lot edwin said for the first time that smug grin faltered just a little my father was a proud man he said proud as my mother was beautiful a shame you will never meet them dead then edwin asked he sensed disapproval and that made him continue he liked making victor uncomfortable reminding him that he was in charge of everything even their conversation accept my condolences if you are the last of their line i hope you are busy finding yourself a wife in time victor said a hard edge had entered his voice though matters here must be settled first before i take a lovely brides hand in marriage as a child veldaren was my home now i return and i wish it to be my home again but one does not move into a house full of rats and turn a blind eye to their droppings be careful of who you call rat shit in this town edwin said laughing it might get you in trouble his laughter died off uneasily as victor stared at him with those clear blue eyes of his it wasnt just strength he saw in them no what he saw was madness and it was starting to unnerve him fine he said suddenly no longer having fun he sat up took another sip from his cup youve made plain your desire to clean up this city though i have yet to hear how you will do it so tell me victor let me hear your amazing plan there is nothing amazing about it victor said he crossed his arms over his chest tilted his head back i have over three hundred mercenaries at my disposal committed to my cause they will aid me in this endeavor your lands cannot be large how can you afford them all there is always coin available for what a man cares about most edwin rolled his eyes and gestured for the man to continue i know what it is youre thinking victor said starting to pace you think i will unleash them like wild dogs just like lady gemcroft did years before i tell you now that that is wrong i do not do this for destruction nor a desire for killing i will not slaughter life at random nor pronounce a colored cloak reason enough for death i will abide by the law my king that is all i truly desire from you give me your blessing to enforce your laws these guilds may no longer rob from your stores but their hands are far from clean and what do you expect from all this a reward a home where i can live without fear will be my reward victor said smiling that and for you to cover the cost of the mercenaries should i succeed you ask for much while claiming to ask for little gerand said and edwin had to agree what makes you so confident you can accomplish this task the king asked the blood of the underworld will spill across your executioners blade victor said brought before your judges lawfully condemned in your trials and their bodies dumped into pits beyond your walls fear is how they have endured for so long but i am not afraid of them i fear nothing laughter interrupted their conversation edwin felt his throat tighten and he looked to his left there in a tall window at least twenty feet above the ground crouched a figure cloaked in gray how in karaks name did he get up there he wondered come to join us watcher edwin asked im quite content to stay here the watcher said turning his attention to victor you truly think fear is how the thief guilds have endured fear is just the whetstone that sharpens their blades razor wire and poisoned cups are how they have endured they fill their ranks with those desperate enough to kill just to have food in their bellies you want to defeat the thief guilds flood the streets with bread not soldiers for a man of such reputation you are incredibly naive said victor he didnt seem upset with the watcher only vaguely amused you think a little bit of milk and bread will sate their appetites the guilds are full of men who will always want more than what they have you used your blades to cull them and took the gold of others to make them content your way is failing you do not spoil a rotten child you beat his ass with a rod victor turned to the king who chewed on his lip this lord was fiery devoted and quickwitted he truly seemed unafraid of making enemies for few would have dared speak to the watcher in such a manner even the watcher looked surprised do not be afraid victor said putting his back to the watcher i have come as veldarens savior and am prepared for the burden let it all be cast on me let it be my name the thieves hear let them know i am the one enforcing your laws there is nothing for you to lose noble beggar merchant thiefall will come to justice the coin i ask for in return is a pittance compared to what you gain give me your blessing edwin could tell gerand wanted nothing to do with the offer but for once edwin saw a ray of light in his miserable city for years hed lived in fear that hed meet the same fate as his parents killed off because one of the guilds decided him too meddlesome could this lord victor do it could he do what even the watcher could not if you truly desire to uphold the law then so be it he said you and your men may act in the name of victor kane ask questions in your name and deliver justice in a manner befitting the law but the moment i hear of your own men breaking my laws starting fires and acting like the lowborn scum they no doubt are i will banish you from my city never to return as for your reward he stared into victors eyes and victor stared back every guild broken every guildmaster dead or gone when i can walk down my streets without fear of an arrow and eat my food without checking for sprinkles of glass you will have your coin as well as any portion of land within this city you desire for your home victors smile grew thank you he said bowing youll never regret it i swear this upon the honor of my house with a wave of his hand edwin dismissed the lord who left in a hurry a bounce was in his step unbelievable would he still be so cheerful when the collected might of every thief guild bore down upon him how long until there were none left alive to taste his drink and sample his food and when the chaos grew and the real bloodshed began was there anyone with enough skill to protect him he looked to the window but the watcher was already gone her servant women fussed over her fitting clothes applying rouge and brushing hair until alyssa gemcroft finally sent them away unable to take any more they filed out leaving her alone in her extravagant bedroom well not quite alone come down zusa she said tell me what is wrong from a far corner of the room hidden in a dark space unlit by light from the windows a woman fell to the ground despite the many years it had been since leaving karaks cult of faceless women zusa still wore the tight wrappings across her body strips of cloth colored various shades of black and purple her face at least she kept exposed dark skin dark hair cut short at the neck and beautiful green eyes a long grey cloak hung from her shoulders the thin material curling about her body with the slightest tugs of zusas fingers there is nothing wrong zusa said crossing her arms over her chest and leaning against the wall im used to you keeping an eye on me but you only hide on the ceiling when youre nervous she smiled at her friend you know i trust your instincts so tell me zusa gestured to the dress you doll yourself up worse than a whore powder everywhere rouge perfume on your neckand i must say i pity your breasts alyssa looked down at herself indeed shed let her servants help prepare her for her meeting but had she let them get carried away her dress was a sultry red tightly fitted with a ring of rubies sewn along the neck a gold chain held a large emerald tucked into the curve of her breasts which true to zusas words her corset had rammed almost unnaturally high this is what is expected of me alyssa said sighing she wanted to sit down but feared to ruffle her dress or even worse strain the ties of the corset the realization made her blush and she could tell zusa knew her defense a flimsy one since when did lady gemcroft do the expected zusa asked the last of her nerves fading away with a smile but you are beautiful even if overdone i only wonder why lord stephen is but a child young even compared to you your smile alone should impress him alyssa paced keeping her movements slow and controlled lest she muss her appearance its been a year since his appointment and i am yet to meet him i fear hell think i have snubbed him or deemed him unworthy of his position i only wish to make a good impression zusa sat down on the bed shifting the daggers tied to her waist so they did not poke into the soft mattress he will think it anyway she said though i fear his impression will be that you are making advances upon him alyssa opened her mouth closed it and then looked to her dress she sighed help me will you she asked ten minutes later she was in a far more comfortable dress and theyd wiped clean her face alyssa left her hair the same having always enjoyed the sight of thin braids interlocked and weaving throughout her long red locks able to breathe and move far more freely she hugged zusa then attached a simple lace of silver about her neck we have kept stephen waiting long enough she said lets go a litter waited outside her mansion and she and zusa climbed inside as they traveled through the streets of veldaren alyssa felt butterflies in her stomach and did her best to belittle them it was stupid to be nervous of the three families of the trifect shed been in power the longest and had clearly solidified her position as ruler of the gemcroft fortune stephen connington was but a bastard of his father leon still he was the only one with a clear biological relation itd taken several years before hed been granted control of the estate from the caretakers in the end theyd had no choice leon had killed most of his family members and steadfastly refused to have named heirs lest they drown him in his bath she winced at the memory of leon hed been unpleasant at times if not repulsive the fat had rolled off of him yet his tiny eyes had always been of a young starving man eager to take and take regardless the vice shed heard stories of what his gentle touchershis private group of elite torturerscould do to a man to make him break a shudder ran through her she prayed that stephen had inherited very little of his father beyond his name as for the last family of the trifect the keenans theyd yet to recover from the fiasco in angelport two years prior when both madelyn and laurie had been murdered along with their temporary successor torgar their grandchild tori was the biological heir but it would be many years before she could take over rule last report alyssa had heard from angelport was that various relatives were still bickering over who would be toris godfather as the keenan wealth crumbled around them no alyssa was the pillar of strength of the trifect the one holding it all together she had to be strong confident zusa had been right terrible as it was the last thing she wanted to do was flaunt her feminine qualities when needing stephen to take her seriously i should have brought nathaniel with me alyssa said as the litter bounced across the rough street your son is better served with an honorable man like lord gandrem than dealing with worms like the conningtons zusa said alyssa frowned and glanced out the curtained window to the passing homes yes she said but it wont be too long before he must put away foolish fantasies of knights and armies i wont have all ive built squander and break like it has for the keenans in time he must learn to deal with the worms as well as the dragons not long after they arrived at the closely guarded connington mansion thick high walls protected it from intruders and armed soldiers with sashes about their waists to show their loyalty to the family patrolled the area at the gate two men bowed and opened it wide so they could enter one of them sneered at zusas appearance but the woman twirled blew him a kiss and then followed after alyssa must i tell you to behave alyssa whispered as they crossed the stone path toward the mansion entrance i could have struck his head if you would prefer alyssa glanced back saw the same guard watching them with a sneer on his face perhaps on the way out she said and they both quietly laughed another guard stopped them at the door and he glared at the daggers zusa carried no weapons he told them zusa is my bodyguard and will use them only to protect me alyssa said there is no need you are safe within these walls is that so alyssa asked how long have you served the conningtons good sir nine years said the guard that means you were here excellent please tell me where were you when your former master died the guard swallowed hard leon had died in the mansion barracks believed by most to have been killed by the watcher very well said the guard but do not draw them unless forced the doors opened and they stepped inside alyssa had been there before after its reconstruction from the fire during the bloody kensgold the floors were still soft deep red rugs she knew had to be a nightmare to keep clean the ceiling was high above her the wood columns decorated with various animals but where there should have been vases on tables were only bare surfaces where there should have been paintings and murals bare walls much missing extravagance zusa said keeping her voice soft perhaps their coffers are worse than we thought alyssa said zusa didnt look convinced she gestured to where many portraits of leon were clearly missing or the son looked upon the father and did not like what he saw at the end of the hall they waited until a servant stepped in announced their presence and then flung open the door a practiced smile on her face alyssa went in to greet the new heir to the connington fortune she knew hed be young only eighteen if their information on him was true but she was still surprised by his small size his soft face and even softer hands as he bent on one knee bowed low and kissed her offered fingers alyssa felt her smile grow more natural he may not have spent his early life in affluence but hed learned quickly over the past year im thrilled to at last make your acquaintance stephen said his voice tinged with a charming honesty i must admit ever since my appointment you were the one i was most nervous to meet may i ask why your beauty of course he said and alyssa caught his nervous glances about the room his struggle to meet her eye that and your unpredictability would you care for something to drink they were in a cozy study one wall covered with books another with maps of dezrel between the chairs was a small table currently empty when alyssa agreed stephen noticeably calmed calling out orders for servants and offering seats to his guests alyssa sat opposite him at the table while zusa refused instead lurking behind alyssas chair with her arms draped protectively over her neck the embrace was a bit overfamiliar for public but alyssa let it be it amused her to see how stephens eyes kept glancing their way as various cakes and fruits were placed before them stephen sat down and cleared his throat i must confess milady that i asked you here with reason one that you willwell one that youll find surprising ive had advisors attempt to take my life lovers turn to madmen and my son brought to me from the dead alyssa smiled at him i daresay you have a difficult task if you think you can surprise me stephen cleared his throat but she saw a gleam in his eye piercing through his nervousness he lookedpleased she tried not to show it as she nibbled on a sweetcake but a bit of worry crept up her belly what if he did have something worthy of surprise alyssamiladywhat do you remember of your mother the cake caught in her throat and it took all of her control to keep her from launching into an unseemly coughing fit her mother why did he ask of her mother she died when i was young she said once she had swallowed the servants would not tell me the reason and my father would only say that she left i presume you think you know the truth of the matter stephen stood as if unable to sit any longer that i would if youd she waved a hand dismissively interrupting him i am no fool stephen and rumors are no stranger to me i know what happened if that is all youd tell me my mother was unfaithful to my father and he she shook her head i love my father but he was right to hide it from me im not sure id have forgiven him certainly not back then she was given to leonsyour fathers gentle touchers i can only pray they were merciful she felt zusas palm cup against her face and she closed her eyes and leaned against it accepting the comfort when alyssa looked again stephen was approaching the other door to the room well then he said unable to hold back a grin everything you have said is true but you are still wrong he opened the door then stepped back alyssa he said may i present to you melody gemcroft alyssas heart stopped standing in the hall as if afraid to enter through the doorway was a woman from a dream her eyes had sunken further and many new wrinkles stretched across her lips and face but the hair was the same the ears the nose all the same as the woman who had sat on alyssas bed candle in hand and read story after story until sleep had taken her away a thousand memories assaulted her many long forgotten of brushing each others hair of strict discipline and teaching of etiquette the way shed flicked her nose with a finger whenever she grabbed the wrong utensil at dinner the smell of crushed flowers every time theyd embraced mother alyssa whispered tears swelled in melodys eyes but they did not fall she took a few tentative steps inside and then alyssa was on her feet their hug was careful slow as if each were afraid of the other when they separated alyssa looked deeply into that tired pale face and was convinced beyond a doubt she didnt know what to feel didnt know what it meant how she asked not now melody said butit is good to see you alyssa youve grown to be so beautiful just like i knew you would she still needs her rest stephen said gently taking melodys hand ill explain what i can servant he snapped his fingers and when the stiffnecked servant arrived he directed the man to take melody back to her room feeling as if the world were spinning alyssa watched her longdead mother be led away her stomach cramping she went back to her chair where zusa remained leaning against the top a guarded expression on her face is it true zusa whispered as she sat i think so alyssa felt like she walked in a dream one where the dead had come back to life would maynard be revealed next having lived in hiding after taking an arrow to the chest she looked to stephen who appeared ready to burst with pride how she asked again your father did give melody over to my fathers gentle touchers stephen said sipping from his drink he even paid for it but they didnt kill her i believe my father fancied her beauty from what i have learned i will spare you all i know but her detention wasunkind as you can imagine when leon was killed everything here was chaos it was several years before the caretakers would even acknowledge my presence let alone my true birthright none of us knew who melody was for she would say nothing and we had no record of her existence even the gentle touchers didnt know for certain he took another drink alyssa felt chills imagining years crawling by trapped in leons dungeon stephen was right she could imagine the unkind tortures hed have subjected her to how long might it have been struggling to remember she thought back to when shed first heard of her mothers disappearance a year before the bloody kensgold that put it at near ten years ten years in darkness no wonder her eyes had sunken in and her thin frame had been unable to fill the simple violet dress she wore im not surprised leon kept it a secret alyssa said trying to hold down her anger my father would have murdered him if hed found out stephens cheek twitched but his smile remained maybe so he said but when i finally accepted power i cleared out all the prisoners either through release or execution depending on the measure of their crimes and the length of their stay but what crime had this mysterious woman committed she told the truth of course and as you can imagine we did not believe her melody gemcroft was dead we all knew that we all knew but she persisted he suddenly lurched to his feet and before alyssa knew what was going on the young man knelt before her and took her hand in his please forgive me alyssa he said staring at the floor for a year she stayed and i disbelieved but she did not relent and told us stories memories all to prove she was who she claimed to be i should have known sooner i should have believed her will you forgive me for adding torment to an already tormented woman iyes alyssa said carefully freeing her hand something about his touch made her uneasy how could you have known i barely believe it myself this seemed to be enough and with a jarring mood swing stephen was once more the charming boy the finest physicians and priests in all of dezrel have attended her he said grabbing a cake smothered with blueberries and wolfing it down better food and bed have helped nurse her to health and i am glad she took meeting you so well even walking at times puts her out of breath i must thank you alyssa said standing for everything it is all i can do to make up for the sins of my father stephen said that and to earn your forgiveness i want us to be friends alyssa may your next visit be far sooner than the last as for melody well have her few things packed up and ready in just a few moments it was only then it hit alyssa that it wasnt all a dream her mother was alive and of course it was expected that she would go with her to her proper home alyssa swallowed and she felt her world crumbling she hated it how she hated it but her immediate thought was nothing but an angry denial i am still ruler of the gemcroft family she dug her fingernails into her arm as punishment such a selfish childish thought was unbecoming of her she was better than that more mature all the best she said to stephen forcing a pleasant mask across her face it will be such a pleasure to bring my mother home to meet her grandchild to see how the rooms had changed to hear of her husbands death and the thief war that had nearly decimated them to reenter a family of whom she was the eldest and the lawful ruler all the best stephen smiled alyssa grabbed zusas hand squeezed it tight thren felhorn crouched in the alley watching the people pass he wore the gray cloak of the spider guild of which he was the undisputed ruler merchants thieves and lords quivered just hearing his name at least they once did but now someone had dared disrespect him and even flaunted it against him damn serpents thren said do they think i would let them go unpunished beside him his second in commanda rugged thief named martinput a pinch of crimleaf between his teeth and bit down theyve only claimed the first kill and marked it as such martin said turning to spit that second one dont seem like them tongue of gold what the fuck does that mean bert was hardly known for his pretty words thren felt his insides harden theyd found bert the previous night an arrow embedded in his throat his mouth had been open but no golden tongue there the eyes of silver though they had seen and the memory still filled him with rage theyd taken the coins and fled just before the city guard arrived some had thought it a hit by the watcher but thren dismissed that immediately it wasnt the watchers style his two men accosted outside one of their tavernsnow that was the watchers style no the coins and odd rhyme left in mockery had to be the serpent guild their new leader wilson ket was known for his pathetic attempts at resembling nobility instead of the street rat he was now thren said and the two rushed out theyd been watching another tavern a place where thren had been told wilson liked to drink in the early mornings the crowds had thinned and no serpents were in sight at his command he and martin crossed the street their hands on their hilts but when he reached the door he stopped and swore did someone warn him martin asked thren shrugged he didnt know enough already didnt make sense but adding this the door was broken inward they stepped inside their blades drawn not sure what to expect thren still did not find it within that tavern instead several serpents lay on the floor their arms bound behind their backs over a dozen armed soldiers were about some tying ropes others questioning the serpents while a few just stood around looking bored that boredom vanished the moment they laid eyes on the two of them barging in with naked blades oh shit martin muttered an appropriate understatement halt several cried but thren was already on his way out in the street he turned north and ran jamming his swords into their sheaths martin followed still clutching his dagger theyre following martin yelled and thren glanced back to confirm only four but they wore fine sets of chainmail that would turn their weapons with ease he almost engaged them figuring to end the fight quickly but then he saw another squad of soldiers turn the corner just ahead they wore the same insignia as the others yellow wings overtop a gold sun thren had never seen it before in his life follow me he told martin cutting hard to his right they ducked into an alley then dove through a window upon reaching a dead end thren landed hard atop a table then rolled to avoid martins fall banging one of his knees on the way to the floor thren clenched his teeth and muttered a litany of curses at whoever had placed the table there a woman stood screaming and he slashed out her throat not giving a thought to her corpse as they ran up the stairs on the rooftops they were truly at home and they leapt across with practiced ease once the guards were far behind thren stopped damn it he muttered as up ahead martin slowed realizing his guild master was not keeping pace a cramp stung threns side and he tried to push it into a corner of his mind so it wouldnt bother him it would have been easier if he werent so desperate for air old he thought was this what it meant to get old despite his training despite his legendary skill hed still just be a weary man gasping for air while the young ran on you feeling fine thren martin asked dont ask stupid questions thren snapped what just happened there martin shrugged looks like mercenaries going out hunting for thieves weve seen it before thren shook his head yes but not since the watchers agreement have they learned nothing we nearly burned this city down before do they think we cannot do it again martin walked over to the edge of the roof knelt down on one knee and peered down thren he said you might want to look at this thren joined him at the side and if his insides were already hard they now turned to iron hundreds of soldiers wearing the sun and wing insignia patrolled the streets his mind flashed back to the bloody conflict four years prior but it didnt match up back then alyssa had unleashed a horde of mercenaries upon the city smashing in homes cutting down anyone suspected of guilt and filling the city with fear this though theyre orderly he said with a hint of wonder calm not just that martin said pointing theyre only talking to most what do you think theyre doing thren could spot a thief without even trying and he saw at least seven weaving through the heavy crowd of the main street none dared act when one neared the soldiers thren thought they might spot the cloak and attack but did not theyre arresting thieves but not at random thren said who ordered this whose soldiers are these martin paced the roof until he was beside an alley jutting off from the main route waving thren over he pointed to a trio of soldiers marching below them think theyll know he asked grinning thren drew his shortswords answers he said one way or another when the soldiers were directly beneath the two leapt to the ground like hawks descending upon their prey their chainmail was finely woven but thren managed to jam a blade between his victims coif and collar piercing flesh it wasnt deep as planned for the man immediately spun to one side and fell to a knee thren twisted it free then went to cut across the throat with his other sword but was not fast enough the second soldier blocked the attack standing protectively before his fallen comrade thren gave him no reprieve weaving a quick series of strikes to test his foes skill much to his surprise and annoyance the soldier blocked them all curses filled threns mind from the corner of his eye he saw martin battling the third soldier unlike thren hed not managed a solid blow during his fall his dagger failing to penetrate the chainmail the two fought close martin trying to negate the soldiers advantage of longer reach who pays you thren asked feinting one hand then thrusting with the other he expected no answer only hoped to distract his foe it didnt work the thrust parried harmlessly away and then the soldier stepped in expertly weaving his weapon in a beautiful counter thren flung himself to the side bit his tongue as he felt steel slash across his arm blood stained his gray shirt and cloak his fury growing the rush of battle flooding through him he lunged at his opponent with both blades when the soldier blocked thren pressed on hacking and slashing with such ferocity his opponent fell back in retreat the wounded soldier no longer protected thren stopped for just a moment to stab him in the back of the neck then kick his corpse aside what fool brought you to your deaths thren asked as he swallowed his mouth feeling dry he was losing blood fast he knew had to get it attended the soldier started to respond but thren spun his attention no longer on him martin had fought the other soldier to a standstill the two so focused that neither sensed his sudden appearance threns shortsword pierced through the small of the soldiers back a twist a yank and the man dropped martin nodded in thanks and then the two turned on the last thren thought hed run but he did not only stood his ground left thren said softly when they both attacked martin did as told veering to the left and cutting in with his dagger the soldier shifted to the side unafraid of it piercing his armor but the motion kept him from falling into a retreat that was all thren needed a trio of slashes batted the sword out of position and then his own blades sliced in jamming through the soldiers throat the man gurgled his eyes widened and then he dropped thren pulled his sword free shook blood off of it fuck thren yelled kicking the corpse his arm stung and when his battle lust faded he knew it would hurt even more worse theyd failed in their goal hard to interrogate a man who has no throat martin said jamming his dagger into his belt thren sheathed his swords then checked the wound on his arm not too deep it would leave a scar just one more among hundreds glancing out the alley he saw people passing and several spotted the carnage they wisely kept their mouths shut but it would only be moments before someone wasnt so smart back home thren said we know too little it isnt safe they took to the roofs once more and ran thren gritting his teeth against the pain the chaos of the main streets vanished behind them until they reached the thirsty mule martin went first to ensure none of the mysterious soldiers were about the way clear he beckoned thren in and together they entered the cellar of their headquarters disguised as a simple inn the place was abuzz with rumors and questions amid the pain thren estimated at least twenty of his guild milling about swapping stories and making guesses theyd fled home when the soldiers flooded the streets but how many had not made it at threns entrance the conversation quieted and several tilted their heads with respect no doubt they wished to ask him questions but seeing his wound they wisely let him be wheres murphy thren asked as he took a seat at the bar banging his fist on the wood in demand of a drink one of the smaller thieves peb rushed over grabbing glasses ill get him martin said whatll it be asked peb he was quick and had big ears theyd called him mouse for a while then switched to pebble after thren put a stop to it no thief of his was a mouse they were spiders lurkers killerseven the smallest carrying dangerous venom hardest we have thren said by the time peb gave him his glass murphy had arrived a small box in hand how bad is it murphy asked bad enough he downed the glass then carefully removed his shirt so the stocky man could see of them all murphy was the only one with a modicum of training in the skills of the apothecary a gaptoothed man with graying hair murphy loved to say he first learned to sew up cows not people but the two were often the same deep down thren thought murphy had learned how to stitch and amputate because he loved causing pain while still getting praised for it had he been born of higher blood hed have been one of conningtons gentle touchers for sure whats going on thren asked as he motioned for peb to fill the glass well youre bleeding but it didnt quite make it to bone i meant with the city murphy took out a long needle and some thread from the box thren grabbed his glass before peb was even done pouring ive been here all the while murphy said threading the needle he nodded to the rest ask them i have martin said taking a seat on the other side of thren all weve got is a name lord victor kane hes been here hardly twentyfour hours yet hes already stirring up trouble what does he want thren asked as the needle pierced his flesh he didnt let the pain show not in front of so many pain was only a tool and right now he had no desire for it as peb poured his third glass an ache swelled in threns chest there was a time when someone might have chopped off his right hand and hed not have made a sound was he growing so weak that he needed the aid of alcohol for just a little cut angry with himself he pushed the glass away martin snapped it up for himself drank it down then let out a burp thats the thing martin said we dont know what he wants early this morning while we were stalking serpents victors men were rounding up merchants lords landownersand then out they came again for us from what i can tell its all been orderly controlled no ones been killed except those who resist the rest are getting sent to the castlewhether for execution or interrogation your guess is as good as mine thren felt the skin of his arm tightening as the needle did its work he used it to focus to force things into perspective edwins too much of a coward for this he said that and the status quo has served him fine for years someone else hatched this plan and right now the obvious one is lord victor what about one of the trifect murphy asked thread between his teeth victor might be in their pay martin agreed be an expensive gambit but by bringing in this outsider they pull any attention away from them and onto him thren shook his head then investigated the stitches on his arm clean work as always but not quite done yet do it he told murphy the old man grinned then grabbed the bottle away from peb the liquid poured down threns arm it burned like fire but he gave no reaction beyond a tightening of his teeth that done he pulled his shirt back over his body despite his age it was still pure muscle we can do what we did before martin suggested declare war against them and rally the rest of the guilds to counter this new threat thren met his eyes saw the hopeful lie for what it was were too few now he said every night weve preyed on each other and our numbers havent recovered from the chaos four years ago besidesthese mercenaries arent normal scum with a sword theyre too good too well armed martin sighed for he knew the same thren and martin were easily the most skilled of all the spider guild yet even they had suffered wounds in taking a squad down the rest of the guildclumsy men accustomed to threatening fat merchants for bribeswould stand no chance we cant let this go unpunished martin said dropping his voice lower the gold the trifect pays us is no longer enough i doubt we are alone in this either if every guild breaks itll be anarchy we will not break thren said all around him men quieted hearing the ice in his voice the strength of his conviction he stood from his chair slammed a fist against the bar this is our cityours no outsider shall come in bare swords against us and expect to live all of you cowering hereget out now i want your ears at every wall i want your eyes on every street whatever information you can find i want to hear it where this victor lives where he eats where he sleeps where he shitsi want to know it all and if you fear being caught or arrested then dont come back you arent spiders youre worms they filed out grabbing swords and cloaks on their way even murphy left though thren knew he would only go upstairs to wait should anyone returned wounded the surgeon must be ready when thren sat down he noticed a single man remained in the far corner leaning against the wall with his arms crossed over his beefy chest and his strange hat in his hands thren turned on him thinking a savage killing might do wonders for his mood then he saw the mans face and grinned grayson you ox thren said ill never understand how you can hide in a crowd grayson grinned back he was an enormous man dark skinned and stood at nearly seven feet tall the thin clothing he wore did little to conceal the muscles beneath a fourpointed star made of gold thread was sewn into his shirt his head was shaved and he wore nine rings in his left ear running up and down the cartilage from where he came from each ring traditionally represented a kill yet thren knew grayson had been forced to adopt a new standard with each ring counting for ten lest his ear fall off grayson joined him at the bar slapping him once on the back you banished our barkeep said the man his voice deep and rumbling would you make an injured man pour drinks grayson laughed ive never seen you injured thren he said just sometimes youre bleeding more than usual grayson leaned forward his long arms grabbing bottles and glasses from the wall mixing two together grayson tasted his drink and then let out a sigh of contentment for all ive heard i thought youd have little better than donkey piss and water he said looks like veldaren might not be as bad as rumored either that or youre the richest thief left thren bit down a retort grayson was from the distant city of mordeina and was a legendary thief in his own right in what felt like ages past theyd worked together helped build the spider guild into something fearsome but then one terrible night it had all come crashing down the gold still flows here thren said careful to control his tone the protection money from the trifect alone keeps the liquor flowing that the lie you tell yourselves so you can sleep at night grayson took a shot poured himself another threns eyes narrowed things are not the same he said between the bloody kensgold alyssas mercenaries and now the watcher i dare say no thief has faced such hardships as we have here in veldaren ah yes the watcher ive been thinking of hunting him down and seeing how good he really is you know that word of him has reached all the way to mordeina is that so thren asked doing his best to sound bored yes and you know whats worse thren thats not the only thing reaching our ears the nobles are hearing of your little setup this game you play its giving them ideas ideas i dont fucking like already they whisper of similar arrangements of turning our guilds against each other in the name of protection money mordeina wont turn into veldaren the priests alone give us enough trouble im a thief and a killer i wont let myself become some nobles bootlicking bodyguard thren felt his blood turn to ice is that what you think i am he asked some low rent bodyguard for the trifect grayson grunted thats what im here to find out a lot has changed over the past ten years and i want to know just how much he stood put a widebrimmed hat made of leather on his bald head i have my own place to stay so dont worry about offering me a bed not sure how long ill be here but i thought id drop in and give you my greetings what are you really here for thren asked as the big man was about to exit if all you wanted was information youd have sent an underling not traveled across dezrel yourself youre here for more than that what is it grayson stopped looked back at him with a dangerous grin on his face what if i dont feel like answering will you make me thren thren swallowed and his hand drifted down to the hilt of a shortsword grayson saw this smirked careful he said i have no desire to cross swords with you besides it wouldnt be fair after allyoure injured when he was gone thren took his glass and smashed it across the counter the glass cut his hand and he stared at the mixing blood and alcohol his fury grew grayson had sensed weakness and thren could not refute it despite all his best efforts his guild was weaker than it had ever been all the guilds were and if the suns or the stars or any other guild from mordeina decided to move in thren shook his head no there was no if only when grayson would not have traveled such distance without good cause the only question was how the foreign guilds planned to make their attack and how great their cooperation would be their first move though grayson had stated clear as day the truce between the trifect and the guilds would have to be broken and the easiest step to that was obvious ending the life of the watcher good luck watcher thren said softly doing everything to subdue his anger to think clearly and carefully like he knew he must despite his frustration he felt pride all the way to mordeina grayson had said the watchers reputation had spread throughout the four nations coast to coast good luck he wiped his hand with a cloth my son the parade of men in chains seemed endless as victor stood at the entrance to the kings dungeon a large ungainly block attached to the side of the castle theyd even started tying people with rope having run out of manacles an excellent day victor thought he doubted it could have started any better milord said sef victors leader of his guard he was a heavyset bearded and battle worn servant of the kane household for almost two decades sir antonil copernus wishes to speak with you send him over victor said sef bowed hurried away moments later antonil arrived wearing the regal armor of his position as captain of the guard and protector of his majestys city his long blond hair peaked out from the lower limits of his helmet scars of battle marked his face a shield hung from his back and his longsword swung at his hip the guard captain bowed low and addressed him with sincere respect milord victor i come at behest of my king he said standing straight he thought it best i help oversee your endeavor as well as ensure my own guards assist you in any way they can victor grinned at the knight are you sure about that i thought our gracious king might fear giving too much assistance lest he earn the ire of both the guilds and the trifect antonils smile hardened and his voice lowered perhaps in all things i protect the people of this city youd best remember that your men may carry weapons and the kings blessing but upon my word they lose both and join the men theyve arrested in a cell all i do i do for the people of this city antonil antonil nodded but did not respond victor felt his respect growing the man looked tired frustrated but hid it well an air of authority hovered over him and whenever he cast his eyes about even victors own men stood at attention there are so many antonil said turning to the lines before the dungeon entrance we cannot fit them all we dont need to victor said follow me and i will explain victor led the way there were five lines all steadily shuffling forward as victors soldiers brought in their latest catch though some wore the cloaks of the guilds most did not they were merchants peasants prostitutes even the homeless and the beggars antonil took in the sight and his frown deepened they are not under arrest victor explained at least not most we are here for answers antonil and to do that we must ask questions information is our greatest weapon against the shadows these scum cloak themselves in it should please you greatly to know we fully abide by the law they stopped at the head of one of the five lines an older man sat at a desk a lengthy parchment before him along with a large inkwell and quill on his knees two soldiers holding him still was a fat merchant his clothes were smeared with mud and across his right cheek was an angry cut that oozed blood at their arrival the merchant glanced their way and paused continue said the old scribe before him their names if you know them ii dont then their descriptions and remember we will talk to them as well the merchant glanced their way victor put a hand on the merchants shoulder the law will protect you he said speak the truth and hold faith it will only be a matter of time they cannot hide forever their eyes met just for a moment and then the merchant turned to the scribe the bastards names are jok and kevis both in the wolf guild his voice trailed off as victor led antonil away i dont understand antonil said beside him we cannot just arrest anyone in the guilds our arrangement forbids it for it is they who police the streets it should be you who polices the streets not them victor said and you are no fool so think it doesnt matter if the guilds hold to the agreement and do not steal they still extort they still kill they demand bribes of merchants smuggle goods to avoid tariffs and flood your streets with powders and leaves that addle the minds of your people he gestured to the lines right now we gather evidence against them we get names we list crimes when we capture them we steadily move upward we take everyone we can then repeat the process all of it written and stored forever unable to be killed or silenced time will not save them from their crimes i will find them all of them but why here why in the open streets victor grinned and gestured to the dungeon behind them if they refuse or lie that is where they go when their eyes wander they see the fate awaiting them for such transgressions besides let the whole city watch what we do let them know i am here and will not stop i will never stop not until this city is a place of lambs instead of leeches antonil swallowed hard looked back to the line you release them when youre done correct he asked the innocent ones yes and then they go home having been seen by all known by all to have talked you know what will happen to them victor youre sentencing them to death victor whirled on antonil leaned in close if they die it isnt by my hand but the hands of murderers and thieves who should have never been allowed to live as long as they have i do what must be done to save veldaren from itself i am no fool this is a new kind of war but blood will still be shed if your guards do their jobs those men and women will live stop cowering in fear of the dark corners antonil met his gaze a while longer refusing to back down victors respect of him continued to grow as the silence stretched a man in a green cloak was led toward the dungeon door then around to the side antonil noticed this and gestured that direction where does he go he asked i shall show you victor led antonil around the back to where two elderly men stood before a tall table to the side was a hastily constructed platform made of wood and in its center was an anvil seeing it antonils jaw clenched and his eyes widened calm yourself victor said they are your judges those appointed by edwin not myself they hear our evidence read what we have collected and then offer sentencing while the man with the green cloak was dragged before one of the judges another climbed the two steps of the platform his face was ashen and his eyes remained locked on the floor by victors guess he was fifteen sixteen at most two of victors soldiers led him to the anvil where a heavyset man waited axe in hand how many antonil asked quietly as the thief was flung atop the anvil his arms tied by ropes looped through holes in the platform seventeen today victor said by tomorrow it should be twice that the list of crimes grows by the hour seventeen antonil whispered how many executed and how many sent to the dungeon victor shook his head you still dont understand do you your judges do mercy has extended long enough here all seventeen have met your executioners blade the dungeon is only for those who refuse to cooperate who would rather bite their tongue than reveal the guilty this is war antonil war against the very culture that has twisted and perverted everything great about veldaren and turned it into something wicked we have no time for prisoners the executioner lifted his axe neither victor nor antonil looked away as it descended there were no onlookers no gathered crowds so they easily heard the plop of the head hitting the wood the sound of the blood dripping across the platform and the untying of the ropes as they cleared away the body i want every name antonil said every crime every shred of proof leveraged against the men who died here today of course victor said i understand your fear that we will execute an innocent it wont happen antonil i wont let it the only sins ill bear shall come from waiting as long as i did come with me ill tell sef to prepare everything you need as they walked back toward the initial five lines antonil stepped in his way grabbed him by the front of his collar and pulled him close victor tensed but he sensed no anger no threat antonils eyes met his and they were full of fearand hope theyll kill you antonil whispered something like this so grand so terrifyingthey wont let it stand i dont care how many guards you have how careful you are theyll still slit your throat cut your body into pieces and then scatter the remains about the city you are a dead man victor victor took a step closer put a hand on antonils shoulder let them try he pulled away from the guard captain then motioned sef over everything he requests fulfill to the best of your abilities he said i must return to my room and ensure no specters lurk in its corners oh and antonil victor sighed tried to see things from the others perspective his grin faded and he let some of his honest worry shine through i know i might die doing this he said but when how long because each day we do this the sun shines that much brighter upon veldaren succeed or failill have done something what drives you victor antonil asked as victor put his back to him and walked down the street what madness would have you risk so much for so little victor waved goodbye and did not answer unguarded he walked down the street but he never felt alone his men were everywhere always watching always searching they saluted as they passed him by and each time he smiled back just a small smile and a meeting of the eyes he wanted each to think hed put special interest in them watching closely for signs of greatness for the most part it was true and when he received that nights report listing the dead under his command hed recognize every name remember every face steeling himself against the pain did little to help king edwin had not offered them a place to stay just as victor had expected the man was a coward and victor was lucky enough to have the king go along with his plan however distantly but the castle was not a safe place anyway it was too big too grandiose with all the windows high ceilings and lengthy halls filled with a million shadows for most of his men theyd be staying in inns scattered about the town victor had carefully chosen his home though and secured it before ever going to edwin eyes watched him from rooftops but it didnt matter if they saw where he slept the constant surveillance only showed how frightened they were of him evening victor said to the two men stationed before the entrance of what would be his home for the foreseeable future it had once been a tavern shuttered for months until victor bought it every single window was boarded up all doors were nailed shut and then bricked there was but one entrance and it was to be guarded at all times upon his arrival hed filled its stores with food and drink carefully packed away he would search no food for glass require no taster for poison everything watched everything controlled just as he liked the outside soldiers banged on the door a few times then called out victors name moments later it was unbarred and opened by the interior guards victor nodded pleased with their attention to detail and then stepped inside the interior was dimly lit and while it had a vacant feel it was still being meticulously cleaned servants moved about and upon seeing him they quickly bowed and asked if he had any needs wine if possible he said unbuckling his sword and something light to eat bring it to my room when ready the servants bowed again victor climbed the stairs as they hurried into the kitchen another of his precautions the servants were all male and had been in his service before coming to veldaren they stayed within the tavern leaving only when they must hed even implemented rules with the guards that all servants were to strip naked hand over their clothes and then redress once on the other side of the door a severe measure but he could not be too careful the fate of the entire city rested on his survival he couldnt risk a servant accepting a hefty bribe his room was sparse his only luxury a bookshelf full of carefully bound writings the mixture was eclectic from philosophers to kings to childrens fables he drifted his fingers over the spines pondering what to read that night when he heard the door close behind him well arent you a careful bastard victors heart caught in his throat hed tossed his sword onto the bed upon entering and he thought to leap for it instead he turned and stood proud and tall while confronting his nodoubt murderer not careful enough he said meeting his intruders eyes he was a darkskinned man with darker hair that grew down to his shoulders his gray clothes were clearly that of the guilds but more noticeable were his eyes one was a deep brown the other a bloody red have you come to kill me thief he asked the intruder chuckled i could but that wouldnt be interesting would it allow me to introduce myself i am deathmask leader of the ash guild and ive come with a proposal victor felt his muscles relax but only a little the intruder didnt seem particularly dangerous and he carried no visible weapons he leaned with his back against the door his arms crossed over his chest a proposal he asked thinking to stall he took a single step toward the man shifting himself closer to his weapon two proposals actually deathmask said first proposal is that you dont do anything stupid like calling for guards or grabbing that sword of yours once i hear an answer to that one we can move on to proposal number two victor felt his heart skip a beat and he stepped away from the bed toward his bookcase so be it he said clenching his fists at his sides i am listening excellent now to make sure we both understand each otheryou do know who i am right victor nodded hed done extensive research on the various guilds before coming to veldaren learning what he could about their leaders their habits vices and weaknesses as for the ash guild youre the one guild that made the least sense victor said run by a man called eccentric at best insane at worst four years ago you usurped control from garrick lowe killing or disbanding nearly the entire guild estimates vary but all claimed you now have less than ten members one man suggested there were only four of you but that is ridiculous is it deathmask asked grinning no thats true there are just the four of us smaller than the rest of the guilds sure but ive found having a few dangerous intelligent people is far better than a guild full of mouthbreathers victors mind clicked and he shook his head in disbelief and easier to split the rather handsome sum the trifect pays for protection correct deathmask shrugged that too victor shifted closer to his weapon then relaxed if deathmask hadnt killed him yet he wasnt going toat least not until he had an answer to his proposition why are you here victor asked i could ask the same of you deathmask said tapping his fingers together a longvanished lord returns with a miniature army with the sole aim to clear out the guilds preposterous but i do not care because that is not how i operate victor why you do what you do is irrelevant to me all that matters is that things go as i desire and right nowid like to help you help me victor lifted an eyebrow how i can give you names locations shipping datesor i could bring you bodies either is fine with me victor shook his head this wont protect you deathmask i offer no clemency not to anyone i will not accept the help of the very criminals i have come to eradicate you mistake me deathmask said stepping closer a fire burned bright in his mismatched eyes i seek no pardon no clemency for i wont need it tell me of all the men who wilted before your inquisition how many have spoken my name how many pointed their finger at the ash guild have we drugs or slaves or bribes victor had not studied the entire lists but hed gone over them as the day wore on and listened in on several confessions try as he might he could think of nothing and told deathmask so exactly said the thief and you will find nothing i am your ally in this not your enemy let me help you long as you abide by the law and the agreements we have signed your little game here will not affect me not adversely the destruction of the other guilds is something that would greatly amuse me though his words were honey but his eyes were death victor shook his head you may pretend you may feign innocence but i am no fool you are murderers thieves butchers i will not taint all that i do with your presence not if i am to succeed im a dangerous man to have as an enemy victor victor stood tall and spread his shoulders wide as if daring the man to strike kill me then he said ill die eventually but it wont be as a hypocrite they stared matching wills but then deathmask broke into a smile you fascinate me he said you wont die tonight not by me anyway he turned to the corner of the room put his hand against it shadows swelled thickening as if into a liquid the guildmaster looked back his smile had hardened those who loudest profess the law tend to have the greatest crimes to hide i wonder just what secrets you have buried deep in the dark soil the darkness swelled began to swirl with a mocking bow deathmask vanished through it just like that the portal was gone and victor was alone in his room he took a step toward the wall and ran his fingers across it it was cool to the touch as if a frost had settled over it he struck it twice unable to help himself magic he whispered all his planning all his care meant nothing to a man who could walk through walls and if deathmask could do so then others could as well how long until the spiders or serpents obtained a scroll to appear directly below his bed while he slept he needed defenses those of the arcane kind sleep could wait until it was safe grabbing his sword off his bed he reached for the door only to have someone knock from the other side he jumped then felt his neck blush deathmasks visit had unnerved him more greatly than he thought yes he asked flinging it open the waiting soldier took a step back surprised by how quickly victor had come milord said the soldier theres something we feel you should see victor thought to ask then just shook his head it didnt matter what it was hed need to handle it in person anyway these first few days were the most fragile nothing could be left to chance lead on he said haern rushed across the rooftops and he was not alone in the moonlight he saw many others in the distance scrambling to and fro to avoid the roads most fled before his arrival for they recognized his presence above all others he was their watcher their punisher their executioner victor might be a new enemy but they still understood who was the deadlier threat reaching the temple to ashhur haern stopped and atop a twostory building he sat on his knees the building was rented to large families forced to share such meager rooms from within he heard a child crying he prayed it might soon have food as the moonlight dimmed from thick clouds slowly spreading across the sky he heard a distant rumble rain pulling his hood tighter over his head haern chuckled of course it was raining the perfect capstone to a long terrible day pausing for a rest he watched the streets his brow furrowed when he saw a group of victors men rushing north they appeared frightened his knees cracked as he stood and he let out a groan night after night of stalking the rooftops was taking its toll he feared one day he wouldnt be able to walk without a heavy stoop haern thought to follow the men then changed his mind the alley theyd appeared from led into spider territory and by the flickering light he saw more torches within the patrols had found something but what and more importantly how willing would they be to share the discovery with him he dropped to the ground drew his sabers and then ran he felt better with the hilts in his hands cold and hard in a fair fight he knew of few that might challenge him and even if overwhelmed it was haern who tended to come out unscathed at the alley entrance he peered inside saw three more soldiers standing around torches in hand haern decided not to risk a scene just yet retreating back a space he climbed the wall of the nearby home from the rooftops he heard them talking what in blazes you think it means means nothing thats what ive been saying just nonsense cant be nonsense you dont go to this much trouble for nonsense its a message haerns stomach hardened he desperately hoped he was wrong but when he peered over the edge of the building he saw he was not a man lay dead on his back between the three by his cloak and dress he was a member of the spider guild when haern looked to the wall he saw the message written in blood this time smaller more hurried tongue of gold eyes of silver run run little spider from the widows quiver the three soldiers were still discussing the rhyme when haern crouched closer to the edge widow eh the tallest of the three said whos that black widow thats what i say said another a redhaired man with a heavily scarred face when the other two scoffed he pressed on this guys a spider right think about it they go out to some whore only it aint a regular whore its a black widow and after shes done buggering him well he curled two of his fingers and pretended to stab them into his neck the three all laughed it was nervous forced they were trying to make light of the corpse before them to dismiss the mystery and this asked the tall man jamming a thumb toward the wall the redhead shrugged whore fancies herself a poet they laughed again this time far too loudly haern was tempted to startle them show them how unsafe they were but he had no need a loud voice called them to attention and they jumped haerns eyes narrowed as he saw lord victor enter the alley with an escort of soldiers what is the meaning of this victor asked approaching the corpse the men shrugged just a dead thief said the third but this ones a bit odd thought you should see liam open his mouth and show him the redhead knelt grabbed the dead thiefs mouth and pulled it open the gold on his tongue sparkled in the torchlight victor muttered a curse not just this said the tall man the wall too looks like the killer left her name her asked victor or him the man corrected guess we cant judge the tastes of a dead man can we victor looked to the wall haern watched as the mans grip on his hilt tightened with each line is this a hit between thieves victor asked thatd be my guess said one of the soldiers and a foul guess it is haern said his voice startling many into reaching for their weapons he ignored them check his eyes as a couple swore victor leaned down and his hand brushed over the face seeing the silver for eyes victor shook his head and frowned leave us he said at first haern went to go then realized he spoke to his own soldiers milord said liam are you sure thats an order the protest died the men funneled out to the main street leaving victor alone in the alley haern put a hand on the rooftops edge and swung himself to the ground he landed silently not even his cloak making a rustle victor stood over the body and he let out a sigh what is this he asked you know this city tell me im not sure i should help you haern said forget your stubborn pride victor said glaring at him a man died i want to know how and why haern looked to the dead thief saw the silver glinting in his eyes i dont know he said twice now i have seen thisarrangement along with the rhyme on the wall he knelt beside the corpse and lifted it up finding what he wanted he gestured so victor might see as well a tiny bolt embedded in the back of the mans neck poison victor asked haern nodded glad the man could make the connection quick silent hard to stop haern said im not sure its what kills them though look he pulled away the silver and gestured into the hollow eye cavities one was filled with more blood than the other and contained a puncture wound leading in to the brain so whoever it is paralyzes them tortures them and then kills them victor asked appears so haern said easy enough to understand but then you have this he gestured to the coins the writing you said it being a rival guild is a foolish idea victor said why is that because a guild would either claim it or destroy any evidence to avoid retribution this is neither this is mockery or a riddle or vengeance for a blood feud whatever it is it isnt normal and it isnt a guild one maybe two men working together or women victor said glancing at the rhyme haern stood and he backed away from the lord the shadows of his hood protected his face so that only his eyes shone out most wilted under his stare but this victor was unafraid and met them without flinching watcher victor said ive wanted to meet you since i stepped foot in veldaren forgive my boast before the king earlier i know what youve done and it is truly impressive but your way is doomed to fail and that is why i have come you cant control them any longer they fear me haern said shaking his head at the foolish noble that is why i can control them what can you do what terror can you inspire with a few scrolls judges and soldiers victor pulled the gold coins out from the corpses mouth then stared into the vacant eyes they fear you for they know you are with them in the shadows he looked up but they will come to fear me more watcher for i will leave them with no shadows at all that is my terror that is the difference between us you skulk and hide in their midst and with every murder you become more like them you are something they can understand you are greater than them you are frightening but you are still just one man and the moment you die everything youve built will come crashing down let me help you let me save your legacy haern heard no lie no doubt victor meant every word as much as haern wanted to dismiss him he heard the promise of another life of a chance to pull the weight of veldaren off his shoulders you really think you can cleanse this city he asked i can i will haern leapt kicked off the wall and then grabbed a windowsill with it he pulled himself to the rooftop then spun hulking like a gargoyle from a castle edge why he asked what gain what reason you are the nameless man patrolling the rooftops at night victor said a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth yet you wonder about my intentions despite the seriousness despite the body haern let out a laugh very well he said happy hunting zusa had sent a runner back to the gemcroft mansion to warn of their arrival no doubt scrambling the servants about in preparation normally alyssa would have thought to do so herself but her mind was clearly elsewhere after all it wasnt often a parent returned from the dead alyssa and melody sat together in the litter with zusa following alongside ignoring the stares she received for her attire there might not be room for her within but she wouldnt leave alyssa unguarded the sun had begun to set and so the guards escorting them carried torches given everyones somber mood it almost felt like a funeral upon reaching their mansion zusa offered alyssa her hand who took it as she stepped out together they looked upon their home both quiet both sullen it will be difficult but nathaniel must be told zusa said i know melody emerged from the other side her clothes still hung from her thin body but a bit of energy showed in her step as she looked upon her old home just as i remembered she said alyssa went to her mothers side and offered her arm for support melody took it smiling and then together they walked the path toward the door zusa followed after feeling like an outcast they were family however distant what was zusa though friend bodyguard not blood certainly not that whatever family she might have had it had been lost to her upon entering karaks temple nothing but a sacrifice made to serve melody stopped in the doorway of the mansion her whole body trembling she looked about saw the paintings the lush carpet and the wood carefully stained and cleaned by an army of servants home she whispered for a moment she stood perfectly still and then closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as if she could pull the very essence of the mansion into her lungs tears fell down her face and sobs tore from her throat alyssa held her as that tiny body shuddered with each breath whatever doubt zusa felt vanished at the sight the torment was real the sorrow the joy all mixed all confused no actress could pull off such a powerful display her insides twisting zusa hurried away more than ever feeling like a trespasser her room was out behind the mansion in a converted servants quarters made flat and empty so that she might train as zusa hurried through the halls toward the back she was stopped by a boy calling her name zusa she turned then smiled despite her worry nathaniel gemcroft stood in the doorway of his room dressed in his finest tunic already it looked tight on him and she laughed at his obvious discomfort you grow like a weed she said his eyes glanced downward obviously embarrassed he had his mothers features delicate soft and with a moppet of red hair atop his head though he was only nine he was fiercely intelligent and zusa had grown attached to him over the years as had much of the mansions staff the servants saywell you know is it true nathaniel looked up at her and she saw the turmoil in his green eyes it seems so she said why the worry she is your grandmother and will be pleased to see such a fine grandson nathaniel shifted his feet and tugged at the hem of his tunic with his one arm because mother will worry wont she mothers enemies might want grandmother to take her place such intelligence for one so young zusa sensed john gandrems influence here the lord of riverrun had found and protected nathaniel after his neardeath at the hands of a vicious lover of alyssas ever since the old man had played the father figure and nearly every summer nathaniel went to his castle to learn to ride wield a sword and command oneself before the people evidently hed also learned of the many ploys men might use to gain favor and power john was currently staying as a guest in their mansion and she tried not to think of how he might react to melodys return zusa knelt before him put her hands on his shoulders all that matters is that you show her respect she said do not fear for your mother and give no thought to her enemies ill be watching over her always and no one is more dangerous than me what about the watcher nathaniel asked and he cracked a smile zusa kissed his forehead not even him now go introduce yourself and make sure john does as well he bowed then hurried away she watched him biting her lip as he vanished around a corner hopefully if melody and nathaniel got along it would ease alyssas discomfort not that it would help zusa any shed had no discomfort when alyssa took lovers and potential suitors before why did this bother her so she didnt know she didnt care back in her room she stripped naked then retightened the wrappings about herself her mind drifted as it often did during the lengthy tedious task alyssa had once asked why she didnt wear regular clothes since shed left the order of the faceless women regular clothes get in the way shed told her and there was some truth to that she could not leap and climb in a dress but mostly it was that in applying the wrappings loop over loop about her slender arms legs and waist she felt herself sliding away they were poor armor but they protected her from the minds of men anyone seeing her knew she was different and had to treat her as such in combat she was not a woman but a specter a mystery at times she even thought to hide her face as she once did but could not do it that was her rebellion however shallow it might be those who died to her daggers would die seeing her face and in her eyes theyd see no mercy no grace just a killer better than they pulling her cloak back over her shoulders she slipped out into the night alleys and rooftops passed by her and she was dimly aware of them at one time shed been an assassin for her priests and greatly feared by those aware of her existence with enough coin given as donation the temple of karak could eliminate even the most powerful of lords rumors even told of kings and queens who had died to the faceless for daring to publicly condemn faith in karak but now she was just one of many dangerous killers crawling the night with little purpose little meaning alyssa was her ward the doings of thieves and murderers meant nothing to her well almost nothing there was the watcher what brings you out this night asked haern as if her thoughts had summoned him into existence zusa turned she crouched atop a spire of a mansion belonging to some minor lord whod long since moved out of veldaren to safer lands haern stood behind her leaning against the chimney with a subdued smile on his face hed pulled back his hood revealing his handsome face sometimes even mansions arent big enough she said haern chuckled i stayed in one for a few years and was never allowed to leave except when at my fathers side i explored every inch of it a hundred times and i daresay they can seem quite small when theyre your whole world he joined her side and together they overlooked the city the night was deep and in the starlight the city seemed calm empty but that was not what zusa sensed there was a tightness in the air and glancing at haern she saw she was not alone in feeling it perhaps it wasnt just melody that bothered her something the matter she asked him just victor he said not looking at her still torn on what to think and how much to trust him victor she asked he glanced her way an eyebrow raised in disbelief where have you been today he asked busy he shrugged look into it then i wouldnt be surprised if he pays your mansion a visit tomorrow a change is underway and from the way he talks i dont think it is just the lowborn thieves he aims to scatter alyssa would do well to make friends with him ill remember they fell silent again as he stared she looked him over ever since their time together in angelport hed been a far more subdued person even now as they relaxed underneath the moonlight it looked like he carried a terrible weight on his shoulders zusa shook her head hed seen what might happen to veldaren if he failed like in angelport the terror the responsibility it fueled him yet drained him as well she wondered how long until he cracked and could take no more then again shed seen his strength for good or ill giving up didnt ever seem to be an option with him slowly carefully as if reaching toward a frightened animal she put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed she wanted to be reassuring but she knew so little of him and even less of his deeper troubles you are strong she said none can defeat you so do not be afraid it doesnt matter haern said but despite the frustration in his voice he did not pull away from her touch i may kill thousands but i will still die what happens then zusa what will i have accomplished there will be no peace when i am buried only a celebration of fire theft and murder zusa swallowed tears will be shed not for me you are wrong he stood but his head remained low his back hunched his cloaks curled over him like gray wings what if youre right and it is pointless zusa said feeling her temper flaring why continue haern chuckled because im not dead yet have a safe night zusa you too watcher pulling his hood over his head hid his face in shadow but she could still see his mouth and the way it curled into a halfsmile at the mention of the watcher haern he said to you let me always be haern the watcher should have no friends at this she laughed then blew him a kiss as he vanished into the night staring where hed been she thought on his words victor she whispered who is victor haern had told her to look into it so she would but not yet with his absence her mind drifted once more to the mansion and melody waiting there must she burden alyssa with even more worries whoever this victor was zusa hoped that he would indeed be friend instead of foe their life was turned upside down enough as it was she took once more to running across the rooftops the exertion welcome to her muscles she was getting older felt it in her bones it had been nine years since shed stumbled upon a frightened endangered alyssa zusa had been young then but not anymore it seemed everyone she knew was getting older how long until even the watcher was nothing but bent back and wrinkled hands at the image she laughed as if haern would ever age he probably wouldnt let it happen too stubborn for even time to defeat him old instincts guided her along up walls through windows and across dark alleys many feared to tread when the sun went down she was unaware of where she went her thoughts elsewhere but when she crept to the top of a roof and stared out across the street before her she shivered sinking into old patterns shed come to the temple of karak hidden deep in veldarens wealthy district a thousand memories assaulted her most of them painful the beatings the trials the methodical breaking of everything that made her a woman coupled with the hiding of her body and face with cloth and wrappings the priests had branded her a faceless an outcast meant only to serve in penance but not all the memories were terrible she fondly recalled her fellow sisters eliora and nava and their camaraderie in face of such persecution and of course daveriks touch the taste of his lips before theyd been discovered and punished a chill spread through her chest and she shoved such memories away looking to the temple she muttered a curse a hope that the earth would swallow up the obsidian pillars and lion statues leaving nothing but a scar where the temple had been and it was then that she saw the movement just a shadow among shadows the sight of it nearly stopped her heart no she whispered drawing her daggers she leapt from the roof and gave chase it had been heading north a black shape with a cloak but it was no thief shed seen oh no something far worse than that her legs pumped and she was but a blur on the streets when she lost sight of her prey she leapt atop a nearby home and catapulted herself into the air calling upon the innate powers shed developed over her years of training she sailed forward her arms outward her daggers pointed down like the talons of a hawk as she slowly fell she once more spotted her prey twisting her arms together zusa spun and she plummeted at a vicious speed when she landed it was upon a large twostory set of homes the roof long and flat before her at the edge of the roof was her nightmare she wore black and dark purple wrappings tightly woven around her body a white cloth covered her face masking her features a grey cloak trailed behind her another faceless who are you zusa asked as the other woman turned around her own daggers drawn you the faceless woman said her voice revealing her surprise zusa yes the betrayer the murderer of the faithful theyve told us of you warned us of your blasphemy they asked zusa her whole body tensing i was the last of the faceless what cruel joke are you my name is ezra the woman said adopting a similar crouch as zusa her body was thinner and shorter by her voice and the hint of features she could see through the cloth mask zusa guessed her to be young and very beautiful and i am the first of the new the order has been remade and it is my honor to deliver you to karak so we might wash away your sins with blood my sins zusa asked grinning which ones you show your face said ezra you are a disgrace a weakling my faith will bring you low ezras lithe body uncoiled leaping out like a viper her daggers twin fangs zusa fell back surprised by the speed twisting to one side she avoided a stab then batted away the other planting her feet she ducked low and cut ezra blocked with both her daggers then tried to kick a foolish move zusa spun again her feet dancing when she leapt forward ezra was out of position the snapkick having put her balance at risk her daggers flashed in and found flesh ezra screamed but instead of countering she tried to retreat zusa gave her no chance her grim smile remained ezra was younger faster but she was clearly new to the order and could not hope to match the sheer skill zusa had developed over many long years shed fought the watcher to a standstill this little whelp of a woman was nothing compared to that a feint pulled ezras weapons out of position and then she stepped close leg sweeping ezra hit the ground with a cry of pain blood spilled across the rooftop zusa fell atop her knees pressing against her shoulders locking them in place with one hand zusa clutched ezras wrists together the other pressing a dagger against the womans throat you think your faith means anything zusa asked breathing the question into her ear you think it gives you the strength to challenge me you are a fool ezra as is whomever brought back our order kill me ezra said i am not afraid zusas eyes narrowed she shifted her weight tightening with her thighs so that she squeezed against the two stab wounds shed given ezra in her stomach they werent deep enough to be fatal but they certainly hurt like the abyss ezra clenched her teeth but zusa squeezed tighter until she finally let out a scream you should be afraid of me zusa said pressing the dagger hard enough to draw a drop of blood it ran down the edge of her dagger then dripped from the hilt to the dark wrappings i can do more than hurt you she picked up ezras wrists then slammed them down to make her drop her weapons with her unarmed she then took her dagger from her throat and began to cut quick calculated strikes she knew where shed only wrapped herself in a similar manner for over a decade the wrappings about ezras face fell to the roof exposing her small nose creamcolored skin and short brown hair her hazel eyes stared up at zusa with a mixture of horror and fury how dare you ezra asked through clenched teeth they hide your beauty to mask their own shame not so you might earn penance in karaks eyes i will not listen to your blasphemy you dont need to zusa put the tip of her dagger against ezras left eye tell me the name of the man who brought back our order or i will scar your face so terribly you will have a reason to keep it hidden ezra swallowed and looked away zusa could see her trying to be brave to hold fast to her loyalty to karak she shook her head annoyed leaning even closer she let her cheek brush against ezras let her lips touch her ear just a name she breathed all i ask is a name who created you gave you your lessons your rules your training do not make me mar your beauty you suffer enough trust me i know it well know your loathing your anger your frustration that the man you fucked suffered only whipping and a banishment to a new temple while you must spend every waking moment as an outcast humbled and cowering in hopes of forgiveness by our dear beloved karak you would have me condemn my soul to fire i would have you speak a name you stupid girl now tell me or bid goodbye to your eye ezra breathed in deep let it out zusa sensed the defeat in it and sighed in relief herself that relief fled the moment she heard the name daverik the woman said come from mordeina with the highest blessings of the priesthood daverik you lie zusa said you must lie ezra tilted her head back as the knife pressed against her eye and she let out a cry as the tip dipped in and out of the white of her eyeball blood pooled and a red tear slid down her face do not insult me she said now do what you must zusa thought to jam her dagger through the womans throat but could not ezra was only confused her mind twisted her faith a noose about her neck she stood and took a step back as her insides churned i want you to give daverik a message she said why would he care what you have to say ezra asked sitting on her knees he will zusa said tell himtell him katherine must speak to him and to find her along the eastern wall tomorrow night zusa turned to leave glanced back and tell him to come alone well find you ezra said struggling to a stand as the wounds in her stomach bled anew from the movement my sisters and i will kill you for this for what looking upon your eyes and hair zusa smirked we faceless saw far more of each other than that with a running leap she soared into the air leaving ezra far behind if only she could leave her troubles behind as easily daveriks face flashed before her eyes so young so handsome back before shed been forced into the order of the faceless her name stripped away and rebranded as zusa before theyd been caught together before her love of him had doomed her to a life as one of the faceless shed thought him dead thought him gone thought him forever out of her life shed thought wrong damn you daverik she whispered as she ran back to the gemcroft mansion what cruel fate is this alyssa had slept terribly and gladly welcomed the daylight that shone through her window at least she could get up instead of trying to fall back asleep she bathed and servants brushed her hair and helped her dress through it all she keenly felt zusas absence normally she lingered like a protective angel but this morning when she needed her comfort most she was gone i wish for a small meal she told her servants just family at our table plus lord gandrem yes milady one said hurrying off to give the order finally ready to face the day she dismissed the servants and stared at herself in the looking glass theyd done what they could but still she saw the dark circles beneath her eyes and how puffy her face was shed spent much of the night in tears all in confusion she felt joy for having her mother back from the dead and at times it nearly overwhelmed her other times she felt terror at losing control of everything shed built and if she closed her eyes tight she could almost hear invisible gears turning the machinations of a hundred different lords and ladies seeking to use this newfound change against her sometimes she wished melody had remained dead and then immediately followed this up with shame and regret for such horrible selfish desires yes she was very glad the night was done the last thing she wanted to be was alone with her thoughts she was sick of them exiting her room she crossed the hall to where her mother stayed a servant was just exiting her head ducked low and her eyes to the floor is melody dressed she asked yes said the servant a pretty little thing with dark hair but i think perhaps she needs a moment alone alyssa dismissed her and despite her advice knocked on the door no answer she turned the knob and gently pushed it in stepping inside she found her mother sitting on the edge of the bed the image shocked her breath away melody wore an emerald dress that had long remained in the storage alyssa too short to wear most of her mothers clothing it looked like an image from the past and she could almost imagine her childhood self sitting beside her book in hand except tears were in her mothers eyes instead of the smile shed known in the past are you all right alyssa asked strangely timid in her own house i will be fine melody said dabbing at her eyes with a cloth i just miss him is all father alyssa asked sliding beside her on the bed melody smiled softly yes of course she said but let us not dwell on that mindy said you have prepared us breakfast so let us go i dont want to keep john waiting alyssas cheek twitched at that john gandrem was staying in their mansion as an honored guest and was very much a father to her son when melody had introduced herself john had seemed quite taken and theyd talked long after alyssa left them to retire for the night idly she wondered what a union between felwood castle and the gemcroft estate might mean for her son so much added wealth and land she shook her head dashing the fantasies away indeed she said i would hate to be rude in their grand dining hall john and nathaniel sat beside each other in the center of the long oak table looking humorously insignificant compared to the food stretched out before them they had not begun eating yet and alyssa was not surprised john was most particular with his manners and that was partly why alyssa had first sent her son to be fostered in his hall john stood at their arrival and nathaniel quickly followed she smiled at her son looking so small and youthful beside the older lord dressed in fine green robes and a thin silver crown across his forehead i fear your servants misunderstood john said tilting his head in disrespect we are only four yet they cook for forty the rest will eat after we are done alyssa said taking a seat opposite her son she glanced to the upper corner of the room and it is five not four come down zusa just a shadowy spider zusa climbed down from the tall rafter hidden in shadows that clung to her most unnaturally raking a hand through her hair zusa joined them without a word or smile alyssa looked to her plate already simmering with meats eggs and a choice of sweetbreads and felt her stomach twist do you feel well dear melody asked im fine alyssa said forcing herself to nibble on some bacon so they would leave her be from the corner of her eye she caught zusas troubled expression what is it she asked softly as john and nathaniel started up a conversation about some jousting tournament to start soon on the outskirts of the city we must speak soon in private her friend said one is of a personal matter the other of lord victor and his foolish crusade crusade what are you talking about not now and we must speak with terrance if he has made even the slightest error your life might be in danger terrance alyssa was baffled terrance was a distant cousin of hers a young man shed promoted four years ago to be her master of coin and trade after the previous advisor had secretly worked against her eventually making an attempt upon her life so far as she knew terrance was a good man careful how could an error by him put her life at risk zusa i dont like how vague this milady interrupted a servant at the door she was young and looked flustered a man seeks an audience with you and says it is quite urgent it can wait alyssa said harsher than she meant john glanced her way upon hearing the tone of her voice but wisely kept his mouth shut yes of course milady said the servant itswell he has many soldiers with him and is very insistent that he speak with you soldiers asked melody her eyes widening its nothing alyssa said pushing away her barely touched plate i will meet with him though he better pray to the gods his matter truly is urgent what is this whelps name lord victor kane the servant girl said bowing quickly before hurrying away alyssa paused a moment upon hearing the name and she looked to zusa whose eyes met hers a warning went unspoken between them at my side alyssa said softly as both of them stood do you wish me to accompany you melody asked alyssa shook her head stay eat im sure it is nothing alyssa left the room feeling their eyes upon her zusa matched her stride and together they walked through the halls paintings of dead ancestors on either side of them you said you had something to say about this victor correct alyssa asked now sounds like a good time to say it and fast hes been given free reign by the king to pursue his agenda zusa said as they turned a corner rounding up every thief merchant and noble he can find that has broken the law they are taken to the castle judged and more often than not executed on the spot alyssa stopped her mouth dropping open how long has this been going on only a day she ran a hand through her hair trying to piece the puzzle together the kane family sounded vaguely familiar but how or why wasnt coming to her who is this victor she asked what do we know about him zusa frowned a small lord from an even smaller family inconsequential really until now they own a meager castle and control a modest but fertile stretch of land for growing wheat wheat that was it alyssa finally placed the kane name theyd had a few dealings before nothing significant a portion of the wheat market was controlled by their family they werent the dominant player in the market nor the most aggressive so now he enters veldaren as if hes some righteous savior come to arrest the guilty in short yes alyssa chewed her lip then resumed her walk upon nearing the door she found lord victor already waiting in the foyer anger toward her staff for letting him in flared through her veins at least he was alone without guards a sword remained belted at his side something inexcusable she felt no fear for zusa was with her there was no chance he could lay a finger on her with the skilled woman at her side greetings lady gemcroft victor said seeing their arrival his voice was strong charming if he was nervous at meeting her he did not show it welcome to my home lord kane she responded curtseying slightly as she did she took stock of the man he was tall handsome and his smile came easy to his face their eyes met and that was when she saw the hardness hiding within them coupled with a grim determination she felt like she stood before a charging bull but she was no delicate flower nor made of fragile glass it is a fine place victor said glancing about i would love to see the rest someday but sadly do not have the time ive come with both request and wisdom if you would be so kind to hear either alyssa might have offered him a seat or taken him deeper into the mansion but something about his presence unnerved her so she gestured for him to continue he smiled at her showing no hurry despite his claims his chainmail armor rattled when he crossed his arms and tilted his head i do not know what you have heard so let me speak clearly first i have come to save veldaren from itself those responsible for destroying it are legion but for now i focus on the guiltiest my men scour the streets always listening always watching know that i do not do this at random nor recklessly i follow the law and will uphold it beyond all else i have declared war but it will not be chaos and fires in the night alyssa felt the unspoken jab and did not let it pass unchallenged you speak of the thief war she said i speak of the night you nearly burned veldaren to the ground all to mourn a son who was not actually dead a hard edge entered his voice and she found herself taking a step back zusa was there immediately sliding beside her with her hands on the hilts of her daggers alyssa started to defend herself then caught the words in her throat she would not defend that disastrous effort for she herself was ashamed of it it had been a foolish thing her emotions overriding her judgment only zusa had had the courage to say it to her face and what makes you think your efforts will be so different she asked her blood felt like ice in her veins what delusion blinds your eyes to the strength of those who oppose you victors smile returned no delusion just stubbornness yesterday was the first and the next week or so will probably be the most productive but i have months if i must those we capture will talk all seventeen from yesterday died by the axe those we capture today will give every name list every crime theyve ever seen to spare themselves from that same fate theyll fight back zusa said they wont let you round up their fellow thieves without bloodshed we do not march needlessly through dark corners hoping for a glimpse of a colored cloak we learn names we learn homes my men move together close careful and always with purpose you do not remove weeds from a garden in a hurry turning and grabbing every which way you must move slowly methodically so you miss not a one alyssa shook her head these are dangerous men not weeds forgive me if i find them with more similarities than not he smiled at her trying to win her over despite his handsomeness she refused to let it sway her shed let one lover blind her to his underhanded dealings before she wouldnt dare let it happen again you said you had a request and some wisdom alyssa said have you given me either yet victor laughed yes yes of course for the request it is simple your hatred of the thieves is almost legendary and i would ask that you be my ally in this whatever you know of the thieves turn it over to me any names any crimes whatever it is we can use it and if you have any house guards that you trust that might help me secure the streets i will think on it she said your wisdom another smile that you say yes to my request despite herself she laughed perhaps but we have entered an agreement with the guilds and now pay for their protection what you ask jeopardizes everything for once we have a semblance of peace i do not want to ruin that now on some foolhardy outsider who has come to veldaren with more stones than sense your peace is a mirage victor said turning to the door it will fade no matter what you do it is a house built on sand a painting drawn in dust oh and remember alyssa that all i do i do with the kings full authority he opened the door before she could say anything waiting there was an old man a heavy tome in hand his hair was white his face scrunched inward from age her eyes narrowed what is this she asked my most humble apologies the old man said bowing low my name is henris potts and i will do my best to work quickly and without trouble to your businesses alyssa glanced to zusa confused the smoldering anger she saw in her friends eyes only confirmed her fear victor was playing a game with them but what explain yourself she told him it is not only the thieves i hunt but all the guilty said victor henris here must be shown all your records and all your dealings undertaken over the past few years not that i expect to find anything not with such a lawful woman as yourself ruling the gemcroft fortune still i would hate to appear unfair to lord connington by scouring his records but not yours henris stood there looking very nervous and uncomfortable alyssa felt furious but she held back the rage she could not err not now zusas warning suddenly made perfect sense if terrance had made a single mistake if hed avoided tariffs smuggled in goods or dealt in the more exotic spices and leaves illegal to veldaren zusa fetch a servant she said prepare a room for henris i fear this will take many days and would hate to make an old man uncomfortable thank you henris said looking relieved to hear of her cooperation as zusa left the old man followed victor smiled at her and gave a quick salute thank you for your time he said i pray stephen is just as accommodating as you are now if youll forgive me i must be off i have a wizard to hire alyssa thought of the young leader of the connington household and could only imagine how the boy would react most likely better than she had youre making many enemies she told him as he exited her mansion i will not help you not in this he turned back to her hand on the hilt of his sword no smiles this time no amusement he looked tired weary of the long day ahead i am taking up the war the trifect lost i am fighting the enemies you could not defeat why do you respond with anger and resist me just because i would hold you to the same standard as they or is it because your hands are just as dirty she shut the door pressed her forehead against it in her anger she tried to deny him to dismiss the easy accusations it was far harder than it should have been a hand touched her shoulder and she turned thinking it was zusa instead her mother stood there clearly worried alyssa closed her eyes and accepted the silent embrace you poor dear melody whispered i remember well the difficulties of being one of the trifect please let me help in any way i can your father had me to share his burdens with but you are so alone ive always been alone alyssa said gently pushing her away i have ever since i took up fathers mantle and i fear i will be until the day they cast the first handful of dirt upon my grave if you are alone then it is by choice that is the way it always is with our family that what you told yourself when father turned you over to leon and his gentle touchers he was just choosing to be alone it was a cruel barb and she didnt know why she had said it her mother took a step back and touched her cheek as if shed been struck across the face maynard was a cold cruel man she said even on the day of our wedding he had no warmth in him not for me yes he chose to be alone he chose to keep his heart closed and to love nothing but his trade his power and his coin is this why you have been so unwelcoming to me do you think those years of torture were warranted were my fault you insulted his name slept with another and because of that i lost a mother then blame the man who cast me aside and took me from you there were tears in both their eyes alyssa felt exhausted frightened too much was changing without warning without any time to adjust she crossed her arms tried to think meanwhile melody leaned back against a wall alyssa realized how thin she looked barely more than bones at times it seemed like a miracle she could stand do you know how i endured melody asked her words were whispers of a ghost how i managed to sleep at night in thatdarkness i thought of you i prayed for you for safety for protection now i am free and i can touch your face see you growndont hate me dont do this to me i cant stand it i wont live through that terrible a cruelty id rather return to the cage alyssa cast her eyes to the ground she could only begin to imagine everything her mother had been through yet she had the audacity to blame her to feel anger and betrayal for such a distant shame im sorry she said she reached for her mother and it pained her heart to see the way she hesitated the wariness in her eyes but even still she was her daughter and melody came forward wrapping her arms around her alyssa sighed and let tears silently run down her face let her whole household be damned she would not let her fears keep her from regaining what was lost im so glad youre back alyssa whispered please it is just so much and im always fearful for nathaniel you have nothing to explain melody said nothing to apologize for im here ill always be here the door burst open startling them both a guard stepped in then immediately bowed in apology forgive me milady he said to alyssa i did not know you weresorry i was ordered to ensure you were safe safe alyssa asked wiping her face what is the matter nothing you should concern yourself with a servant was killed on the premises and we fear the killer still might be lurking outside pushing her emotions aside she shook her head and straightened her back i will not fear to walk in my own gardens she said let me see the body the guard looked between them then submitted to his master if you insist he said leading the way ill tell john melody said declining to follow and make sure nathaniel is safe alyssa nodded hurrying after the soldier who looked like hed decided that if he couldnt deny her seeing the body he could at least make the process as quick as possible they curled around the front of the mansion off a walkway and into the smooth grass decorated with trees all of it was surrounded by an enormous stone fence the top spiked but the trifect had learned how little use such fences were over the past decade more house guards lingered about some searching for evidence of intruders others scouring the fence for signs of rope or hook make way the guard said as they came upon a cluster of four halfway to the east wall the men stepped aside giving alyssa access to the body seeing it she held in a gasp it was just a young servant boy no older than ten an arrow was stuck in his neck having pierced his windpipe blood stained the grass red beneath him at his feet was a pile of soiled clothes his task for the early morning who would do such a thing alyssa wondered aloud what could this poor boy have done to anyone theres a message one of the guards said sounding uncomfortable he pointed and sure enough letters were cut into the grass by means of something sharp it was hurried disjointed but she could read it well enough to put a shiver down her spine tongue of gold eyes of silver run run little nathan from the widows quiver when did this happen she asked glancing about they were far from any door and the body was partially hidden behind the trunk of a tree hed have been up before daylight to do morning chores said the man whod brought her bloods pretty dry her conversation with her mother along with victor had already left her unnerved but this awoke a brand new fury the killer mocked her and decreed her son to be his intended victim what madness was this who would dare sneak onto her land to murder an innocent child bury him and ensure his family is paid well she said right a guard knelt down scooping the body into his arms as he lifted the boys neck snapped back and his eyes opened alyssa let out a soft gasp two silver coins stared at her all around guards muttered and cursed at such strange mutilation swallowing down her revulsion alyssa put her back to the body and found zusa standing there observing everything silently whoever it is wants nathanial next alyssa said zusas eyes narrowed what would you have me do alyssa glanced back saw the guards pry open the boys mouth and pull out two bloody coins of gold find haern she said quiet enough that no one else would hear he has to know who this widow is or what it means and contact that wizard of his i will have this murderer found no matter the cost will you be safe without me alyssa sighed no but i trust no one else go now zusa headed for the front gates then stopped hurrying back she kissed alyssas hand and pulling her close something is wrong in this city the faceless woman whispered too many pieces are moving at once to be coincidence we are lost in someones game be wary and be safe with that she left vaulting over the spiked walls with ease alyssa watched her go while absently rubbing her hand she did not know all zusa meant but she understood the feeling well her mother victors arrival the widow plus zusa had mentioned a personal matter stay safe she murmured staring at the wall zusa had vanished beyond wrapping her arms around her chest as if cold she returned to her mansion haern awoke a little after midday to the sound of the tower doors slamming shut instinct told him that something was wrong a bad feeling in the air grabbing his sabers and cloaks he slipped out his room and down to the bottom floor there before the fireplace he found delysia sitting on a couch her brother pacing furiously the audacity the wizard muttered care to fill me in tar haern asked still on the steps tarlak heard him and stopped his look was none too friendly honestly no im too pissed behave delysia said and despite her brothers mood she laughed youre overreacting and you know it and good morning haern haern joined delysia on the couch and together they watched tarlak fume delysia leaned over her head resting against his chest after a sniff she sat back up your cloaks smell like death haern shrugged that tends to happen the priestess sighed and reached out her hand when he removed his cloaks she took them to the door and set them down to be washed later that day as she did tarlak stopped pacing and instead crossed his arms and frowned at the assassin lord victor was just here said the wizard that so haern lifted an eyebrow what did he want wanted me to ward the home hes currently staying in cover it with various protection spells so no clever thief can teleport under his bed and stab him while he sleeps doesnt sound like a bad idea haern said as delysia returned leaning against his arm and resting her head on his shoulder why the fuss he wantedbah he threw up his hands he wanted to pay us after his quest or mission or whatever this nonsense hes doing is over said he couldnt spare the coin just yet something about mouths to feed worse he actually hinted hed appreciate me doing it for free you hear that free truly he is an evil man haern said tarlak stopped and gave him a death glare care to share your opinion mister cloak and saber its pretty simple though you wont want to hear it i think you should help him tarlak blinked you do haern shrugged he still hadnt fully made up his mind about the man but he had little doubt victor meant to see through to the end his desire to clean the streets of veldaren if he could be trusted to at least do that i think he truly thinks hes helping more importantly i think he might pull it off the thief guilds havent faced a man quite like him before look at you the only reason youre so bothered is because youre thinking of helping him for free despite all desire otherwise tarlak shook his head hes an egotistical ass hardly the only one around here the wizard glared as his sister covered her mouth with a hand to hide her laughter careful he said to haern otherwise i might turn you into an actual ass for a day and rent you out to a farmer haern only grinned at him with a sigh tarlak relented and he took a seat in a wooden rocking chair beside the fire removing his yellow hat he scratched the top of his head with his fingers then ran them through his red hair to straighten it if we help him then hell live long enough to actually accomplish something he said all his bluster and anger fading away that means the current peace with the thief guilds cannot last theyll react soon and violently but how if they focus on just victor we might counter but if they target the rest of the trifect veldaren will fall to chaos within days we cant let there be another thief war delysia said she said it softly but it weighed heavily on her heart the last one went on for more than ten years so many died so many haern shifted feeling uncomfortable especially with her so close to him her father had been just one of the many casualties of that conflict killed by thren while haern watched it had been his first true mission to kill delysia when she fled but hearing her heartfelt sobbing for her father and her prayers for safety he had not been able to bring himself to go through with it hed later told her and shed forgiven him he didnt know how but she had i wont let it happen haern insisted tarlak shook his head then perhaps instead of helping lord victor we should get him out of veldaren as fast as possible even if he has a chance to succeed tarlak threw up his hands in surrender if thats your idea of intelligence then so be it no matter what we do we risk this blowing up in our faces so might as well go for broke a knocking turned their attention to the door who is it now haern asked tarlak shook his head for scrying spells embedded in the tower let him see the visitor day just keeps getting better he said with a snap of his fingers the door opened on its own and in stepped zusa clad in her dark wrappings her gray cloak fluttering behind her magic is a poor host to greet at a door she said sheathing her daggers yes but it keeps my lazy ass in a chair tarlak said come in and share whatever terrible news youve brought with you gods know youre never here to tell us something good delysia scolded her brothers poor hospitality and hurried up to greet zusa the faceless woman awkwardly accepted her embrace then set aside her daggers a wave of tarlaks hand and a glass of wine appeared on the nearby table haern watched zusa settle in taking a seat opposite tarlak she looked odd dressed in such a way yet was sitting comfortably in an old wooden rocking chair though she tried to appear gracious haern could tell she was in a hurry and that whatever reason brought her to their tower was an urgent one thank you she said sipping the wine before putting it aside but my time is short one of our servant boys was attacked this morning just before dawn his eyes were cut out and replaced with silver coins and two pieces of gold were put on his tongue the news struck haern like a brick to the head a rhyme he said was there also a rhyme to his dread zusa nodded tongue of gold she recited eyes of silver run run little nathan from the widows quiver with each word haern felt his fingers tighten against the fabric of the couch after the first two murders hed thought it was just someone with an agenda against the spider guild but to also strike the gemcroft family especially in such a petty cruel way do you know of thiswidow zusa asked haern sighed and he caught tarlak staring at him clearly also eager to hear nodding haern shared what hed discovered of the two bodies and of victor also requesting help in discovering who it was when finished tarlak leaned back in his chair stroking his red goatee hes taking their eyes he wondered aloud thats a littleodd odd said zusa you insult a dead child saying such a thing it is the cold cruel act of a sick mind whoever this widow is let him kill spiders night and day but to threaten alyssas sonno we must stop him despite your reputation otherwise your eschaton mercenaries are the best my mistress wants this killer found and will pay whatever it takes tarlaks eyes widened now thats what i like to hear he said grinning hes striking at night haern said glaring at tarlak and he bears a grudge against both the spider guild and the gemcroft family any ideas perhaps a rival guild tarlak asked haern shrugged maybe a rogue thief wanting the truce ended neither idea sounded right didnt have that correct feel in the gut and then delysia spoke what about victor she asked haern and tarlak exchanged a glance hes made his hatred of the thief guilds clear delysia insisted he has no love of the trifect either zusa said and she told them of victors visit to their mansion just that morning haern heard it knew it made sense but he shook his head no he said i dont believe it hes doing this with a sense of purpose a sense of honor brutal murders mocking rhymeshow does that help him what agenda does that serve tarlak frowned and he bit his lower lip as he thought zusa he said glancing at the woman tell alyssa we accept her request and ill have a contract brought to you before tonight well start patrolling the spider guild territory come nightfall see if we can spot him attempting kill number four all of us except haern that is you want me to watch victor haern said dont you consider it protecting him tarlak said standing that is if hes innocent and if hes not well the wizard shrugged youll be right there to stop him wont you haern thought of the way victor had responded seeing the body in the alley his anger his revulsionthat couldnt have been an act could it the timing would have been difficult but he didnt have to be the one committing the killings himself its not him haern said reaching for his sabers i hope it isnt zusa said as she left for the door because his scribe sits in our mansion recording our every deed find him quickly eschaton our city is dangerous enough without a madman silence greeted them as the door closed behind her haern stood there feeling unsure then buckled his sabers to his belt where are you going delysia asked to speak with a contact haern said if the spider guild is being targeted someone in their organization might have an idea why be careful she told him he leaned in close to gently kiss her cheek i will he said i promise you sure its safe to be out here peb asked as they neared the castle his wide eyes darted every which way as if guards were trying to sneak up behind him from all directions with his big ears the act only reminded alan why peb had once been called mouse im not sure its safe to be anywhere in veldaren right now alan said twirling a copper coin between his thumb and forefinger something he did when nervous so why should the castle be any worse peb nodded toward the rows of men and women waiting to be interrogated by lord victors men maybe because any one of them people might be blubbering our names any second alan ran a hand through his long dark hair thren wants answers wants something new so either we get him something new or we get a tonguelashingif were lucky given the mood he was in im not willing to gamble on that id rather tempt the city guards than the boss peb didnt look convinced but alan didnt care the guy was a coward and more importantly he hated to be alone hed follow alan so long as things still looked safe alan patted his leg glad for the dagger hidden there taking a deep breath he summoned his courage and then walked out from the alley and into the main street where the interrogations continued peb quickly followed the two were in ratty clothing their faces dirty their hands calloused anyone who bothered to notice them would think them nothing but poor hungry peasants at least that was the hope alan led the way faking a limp toward the lines at the front he saw scribes jotting down the guts that their current pigeons spilled not that alan blamed them when your life was on the line or the coin was right honor was nothing but a hindrance making as little noise as possible he listened as they got closer hoping to catch an errant phrase but a soldier noticed them before he could stay back you two said the armored man his hand already on his sword he stood between them and the tables of scribes on his chest was a tabard bearing a crest alan did not recognize some strange circle with wings drawn in gold any closer and ill think you a threat forgive me alan said bowing low and turning away peb followed saying nothing that was pointless peb mumbled did you see lord victor peb shook his head no you alan glanced back scouring the guards the lines the scribes not here he said but only twelve or so are set to talk yesterday had far more hes slowing down peb asked alan shrugged either that or hes being more careful never know if he had about two seconds to react before it hit alan grabbed peb by the arm and pulled him hard into the side of a building his shoulder throbbed upon slamming the wood and peb let out a cry when his forehead struck having been unable to twist in time still it was better than being impaled by the barrage of arrows that sailed toward victors proceedings over twenty men stood far down the road bows and crossbows in hand their cloaks revealing their allegiance to the hawks starting already alan said before swearing up a storm get down the two dropped as another barrage flew screams filled the air the first barrage had landed among the guards and scribes the second aimed squarely for the men and women brought out for interrogation people fled every direction while the guards swarmed in a panic some flinging the older men to the ground for protection others rushing to meet the new threat we need to get out of here peb said scrambling out from beneath alan thren will want to know what happened here peb spun about shaking his head then let him come count the bodies alan looked back saw the soldiers rushing with swords drawn arrows and bolts shot toward them no longer in any organized barrage some men dropped but most endured even those who were hit their armor was thick and the thieves used small bows and crossbows designed to take out fellow thieves to pierce cloth not metal alan thought to draw his dagger then realized that might label himself on the side of the hawks so instead he hunkered down pretending to cower as the battle unfolded seven soldiers all bearing the same gold crest crashed into the group of hawks at first alan thought numbers would lead the thieves to victory but the initial exchange showed otherwise victors men had long blades granting them better reach their armor protecting them from the quick weak thrusts of daggers and dirks hawks dropped in a bloody clash the thieves attempt to swarm and surround failing miserably half were dead before they had the presence of mind to flee damn alan whispered watching the display victors men were well trained hed give them that glancing the other way he saw the remnants of the interrogations most interrogators had fled into the castle carrying parchments with them nine bodies lay amid the overturned desks their blood mixing with ink alan chuckled would anyone be surprised victor had come in and openly mocked the guilds surely he didnt expect to go unscathed when he turned back to the battle hed expected a route to see victors men chasing in vain after a scattered collection of hawks instead he watched the trap fully unfold as the remaining men on the ground fled twenty more emerged from the rooftops all armed with crossbows bolts flew down like lethal rain despite their armor the soldiers could do nothing not against that many attackers they ran toward the safety of the castlethe few who lived beyond the first volleyblood dripping from bolts embedded in their arms legs and chest with even fewer targets to pick from the second volley was even worse alan winced as the last died some with over five bolts thudding into their backs a trumpet sounded bringing alans attention to the castle he caught a glimpse of castle guards rushing out with swords drawn but then something grabbed his cloak and pulled hard he was thrown into the same alley peb had fled into though peb appeared long gone rolling to his knees alan looked up to see the watcher standing at the entrance to the alley a black shadow in the daylight stay here he said drawing his sabers that was it that one command and then he rushed off moving fast enough to be a blur alan rubbed his neck muttered and rose to his feet despite the watchers fearsome reputation he had no intention of missing this returning to the alley entrance he peered out to watch the carnage fifteen castle guards ran out to engage the hawks unlike victors men they wielded shields and kept them raised high to protect them from the arrows for a brief moment it looked like the hawks were going to make a stand against them as well a few climbed down forming a line of fifteen while the rest fired into the group of soldiers and then the watcher arrived tearing through their ranks upon the rooftop he struck from behind them killing several before any knew they were under attack the distance was too great for alan to see clearly but the gray of the watchers cloak looked like a phantom darting and weaving throughout their numbers never still never hesitating one after another dropped dead when the arrows from up top stopped the soldiers below lowered their shields and charged the hawks without armor or significant weaponry did the intelligent thing and fled they could easily outrun and outmaneuver the city guard the watcher on the other hand alan sunk deeper into the alley glancing about to see if any eyes watched the last thing he wanted was to be spotted he liked living and wanted to keep doing it for many many years minutes passed and with ebbing interest alan listened to the various trumpets and calls by the guards at last he heard a soft rustle of cloak turning he held down a startled cry upon finding the watcher mere feet away did you know this was to happen the watcher asked alan reached out a hand the watcher glared then tossed a small bag of coins at him alan caught it and within seconds the bag had vanished into one of his many pockets he didnt have to check it the watcher paid in silver and always in significant amounts buying information from the spider guild was not cheap nor safe given how vicious thren could be but alan wasnt one to let fear or honor get in the way of making a healthy sum of coin we hadnt heard a word alan said crossing his arms and leaning against a wall kadish pel must be getting ballsy if he thinks his guild can take lord victor all on his own what do you know about lord victor alan shrugged just what everyone knows cant help you there the watcher frowned clearly displeased im starting to doubt giving you your coin alan chuckled i never promise what i tell will be useful or new to you but i dare you to find anyone else insane enough to sell out thren felhorn enough tell me this thenwhat do you know about the murders the ones being claimed by the widow alan grunted caught off guard by the question reaching into his tattered vest he pulled out one of the silver coins the watcher had paid him with and began twirling it in his fingers honestly we dont know shit i might have believed it was you if i thought you had the ability to rhyme the two dead were bert and troy neither of them special or even important no ones seen nothing no ones heard nothing what were the two doing when they were killed keep asking questions i might think i dont have enough silver in my pocket the watchers glare made him chuckle but his nerves were starting to rise all it would take was one person telling thren hed been seen speaking with the watcher just a whisper of betrayal and hed be gutted from the spider guilds rooftopif he were lucky fine i dont know what troy was doing but bert was out looking for whores that help you any perhaps the watcher pulled his hood lower across his face then leapt from one side of the alley to the other vaulting himself up to the rooftops ill find you three days from now on your patrol by the south wall if you can tell me anything about this widow ill pay you in gold should be paying me in gold anyway alan said but the watcher was already gone turning to leave he found a man leaning against one of the walls his large frame blocking half the alley his muscular arms were crossed over his chest and he almost looked like he was sleeping with his widebrimmed hat pulled low over his eyes alan felt a chill but the stranger bore no cloak nor any other sign of allegiance to the various guilds hoping the man just hid there from the carnage alan walked past him toward the main street as he did the man let out a soft whistle that of a songbird alan didnt dare look back nor acknowledge the blatant accusation his hand dropped to his dagger he slowed his walk started to shift but it was too late somehow the man was already halfway down the alley his movement having gone completely unnoticed by alan the man turned smiled at alan and then let out another bird whistle the songbirds are singing the stranger said then laughed as he touched one of the nine rings in his left ear alan fled he knew he should return to his guild to tell thren everything hed seen but he couldnt not yet halfway across veldaren he stepped into his favorite tavern a silver coin in hand hed still tell thren but he needed a lot more alcohol in him to keep from shaking and to keep his perceptive guildmaster from seeing the terror in his eyes with every sip he took he heard the whistle the accusation it didnt matter which guild you were in or even which city songbirds died keep it coming he told the tavern wench pushing away the change shed brought for the silver go until there aint a damn thing left of it thatll do it tarlak said as he straightened up wincing as his upper back popped twice are you sure it will hold no matter how powerful the spell asked victor surveying the runes carved into the outside of his temporary home ten in all covered the large building burned in as if by fire tarlak raised an eyebrow hed spent the past six hours placing markings with chalk rearranging runes and casting a variety of spells that protected the building from magical attacks from the subtle like teleportation to the less subtle such as giant exploding fireballs last but not least was the requested surprise escape in case of an attack his back hurt like crazy his fingers were sore from all the measuring and writing and he doubted he could summon anything stronger than a magical fart with how bad his head ached and yet victor wanted to question his abilities if you didnt think i could do the job tarlak asked why would you request me in the first place victor sighed youre right forgive me today has not gone well so i heard word of the attack had spread throughout veldaren like wildfire tarlak had gotten a firsthand account from haern at least on how the attack had ended as for casualties that was a little sketchier tarlak had hoped to glean more information out of the lord but so far had struggled to get the man to talk now that they were surveying his handiwork at last he had a chance most of these runes ive burned in tarlak said trying to keep victor engaged his mind on their conversation instead of elsewhere itd take a lot to smudge or break them but it is possible make sure your guards are always aware what should they watch for well id say a man with a big mallet smashing the wood in thatd probably break them think your guards would notice that victor paused a moment and then miracle of miracles laughed tarlak snapped his fingers finally he was getting somewhere no one will lay a finger on the building victor said and i think even my leasttrained men would still find it strange for a man to be hacking at a wall praise the gods for intelligent help amen the two walked toward the entrance of the building guards trailed behind them theyd watched tarlak carefully the entire time supposedly on the excuse that they didnt want him harmed while casting the protection spells tarlak found the lie insulting as if he needed protection his balance teetered a bit as he walked with victor and he decided that maybe that wasnt so insulting after all victor caught him inquired if he was all right just a little woozy he said rolling his head side to side ever had a headache so bad that it split your insides in half making every light look ten times too bright i cant say i have then youre damn lucky consider me adding the cost of a drink to your expenses because i need one right now otherwise i wont make it home then consider it paid victor led tarlak to the door the wizard made sure not to crack a smile his head hurt but not that terribly still victor looked like he wanted those he hired to trust him even respect him a good sign anyone willing to buy beer for his underlings was a man with great potential the guards let victor pass then stepped in front of tarlak all off said one alloff tarlak realized the guards meant his clothes but victor interrupted before he could protest let him through said the lord im trusting my life to his wards not much sense to fear him slipping a knife on me smart man tarlak said as he stepped inside and took a seat at a table a servant hurried over pitcher in hand accepting it graciously he sniffed the contents strong scent of honey excellent only common sense victor said dismissing the offered cup as he sat opposite the wizard if you wanted me dead those wards would set my home on fire in the middle of the night instead of keeping out the more determined scum of the underworld speaking of scum did you catch those responsible for the attack on your scribes victor crossed his arms and leaned back in his seat his clear blue eyes bore into him and tarlak could sense the inner debate when victor spoke it appeared tarlak had passed not as many as i would like he said sighing the hawk guild was responsible that i know for sure guesses run from about thirty to forty that set up the ambush we killed at least twentywell twenty died i should say my men can only account for seven the watcher took out the rest he does tend to do that tarlak said chuckling if im not mistaken he is a member of your mercenaries is he not tarlak lifted an eyebrow aye he is considering hiring him doesnt come cheap but of course were relying on future payments already whats a little more debt between friends i just hope to know if i can consider him friend victor insisted money tends to make such matters irrelevant at victors glare tarlak raised his hands and quickly apologized forgive me i tend to joke when i should grovel if youre wondering what the watcher thinks of you id say right now he doesnt know just between you and me i think youre a respectable enough guy but the watcher tends to be a bit more distrusting victor nodded waved at the servants accepting a drink he downed half tarlak shifted in his seat wondered what troubled the lord so that he would suddenly decide he needed alcohol after all one of my scribes died in the attack victor said his voice softer he wiped a few drops from his chin with his fingers good man a friend several other innocent men and women died having committed the crime of being in the wrong place at the wrong time ive relocated all our interrogations to inside the castle with king edwins permission but things are souring already my men must travel in larger and larger packs lest they fall into similar ambushes only ten men went to the judges today and they even freed one of the ten whatever tight mouths i thought people had theyve grown only tighter you walked into a nest of hornets and started swatting tarlak said surely you cant be surprised that theyve begun to sting back victor let out a halfhearted chuckle im not surprised no what troubles me is that my men are afraid the people we drag in here are afraid the king is afraid everyone is afraid so i cant be yet im as terrified as any how did it get so terrible here how could an entire city live its life full of fear tarlak tapped his empty mug this heres a start but when your eyes are shut tight enough you can convince yourself that youre safe from anything its only when bold brash outsiders come in braying and waving swords around that everyone remembers just how terrible the guilds can be and how cruel a bedmate weve made indeed said victor motioning for another drink cruel cold and ruthless but you know what frightens everyone most the spider guild has yet to act all the othersthe hawks the serpents even the ashtheyre nothing compared to thren felhorn the rumors i hear treat him like the reaper man a monster from a childs fable he started a war that lasted ten years tarlak said feeling his mood grow somber and the only reason it ended was because he allowed it thren is the one you need to watch for most hes getting old but that wont matter long as hes alive hell be a danger and if youre hoping someone will turn on him mention where he lives or some illegal violet hes smuggled in he laughed it wont happen unless you want to abandon this charade of law and order and declare full war on the guilds you wont find him wont send him to the executioners axe not unless you kill him trying to kill you victor frowned his face hardened as if the blood beneath his skin was turning to stone tarlak shifted wondering what it was hed said that angered him so it is no charade victor said we will not be monsters not like them i would rather die with every breath of mine ill tear them down cast them from the shadows and into the light but i wont let them drag me down with them i wont become like them that is why i must adhere to the law i must be stronger smarter better prepared the first day was too easy and i grew soft he looked to tarlak and the earnest desperation was clear in his eyes that is why i need you he said why i need the watcher i need you to trust me to help me ive looked into your dealings tarlak and those of your mercenaries youve helped others even when they couldnt pay youve refused any assassinations even when the watcher could do them with ease you have a sense of right and wrong just like i do you know they must be stopped please help me tarlak stood smoothed out his robes i must be going he said thank you for the drink and the company ill consider your request but i wouldnt hold your breath you want my trust so far you have it what you dont have is my approval im not convinced youll make veldaren a better place the guilds were growing lazy their numbers starting to dwindle already they were turning on each other killing more and more all itd take is the watchers death victor said shaking his head the trifect fears the guilds and the guilds fear the watchers wrath remove that fear and their greed resurfaces voracious and starving whatever growing pains i create will be a thousand times better than the chaos that was certain to happen otherwise perhaps so tarlak bowed low ill escort myself home if you dont mind victor gave him a sly smile headache gone never felt better must be some amazing ale you have must be victor stood offered his hand tarlak looked at it as if it were a trap then accepted it just give me a chance victor said ill prove myself to you to everyone in veldaren id be careful of that tarlak said putting back on his pointy yellow hat the more the underworld sees who you are and believes youre here to do what you say the more frightened theyll be good victor said let them be afraid they fear the watcher and they fear thren felhorn should your name one day be among theirs ill treat you to drinks at my tower tarlak left ignoring the cold glares from the guards at the door while heading down the street he stopped and turned back to observe his handwork on the walls and think on the man hiding within crazy bastard tarlak muttered shaking his head what in the world are you thinking he headed back feeling terribly annoyed worse he wasnt sure if it was at lord victors insanity or his own for helping the man in his impossible quest time was not on his side but peb felt confident he could finish quickly not that hed brag about that to anyone else or even admit it but with such a daring mission approaching peb needed some release otherwise hed be a nervous wreck throughout after thren had heard what happened from alan hed been deathly quiet talking to no one for a full hour when he exited his study his plan was simple and his mind set victor kane died tonight like itll be that easy peb muttered to himself as he headed toward the darkest alleys of veldaren he was in too much of a hurry to watch his surroundings but he feared no attack not so deep in the heart of their territory a few coins rattled in his pocket just enough to pay for what he needed he usually had his pick of the women given how weak he looked how unthreatening the whores talked peb knew that they knew he needed just a touch just a kiss and that hed never hurt them not like some of the others who needed to punch or beat someone weaker to get themselves off turning right he passed a dimly lit tavern then veered into an alley beside it he knew many men preferred brothels wanting a bed where they could lie back and do nothing or to have clean sheets they could ruffle and cast about peb needed none of that just him standing and a pretty girl on her knees what did anything else matter especially when the cost would go up twofold for all the extravagances hello peb asked the alleyway as he stepped inside normally thered be three or four girls there eager to sell themselves to the men who stayed in the tavern the night was still young though so perhaps they were elsewhere can i help you a soft voice asked squinting peb saw a petite woman further in the shadows long brown hair curled around her neck and she smiled at him with such delicate pretty features i think you can he said smiling gods those eyes just staring at them would have him done in no time hed be able to go charging ahead of thren feeling on top of the world as they tore victor from his room and beat his face to a pulp he reached into his pocket as she beckoned him closer how much he asked fearing the normal rates might not apply to someone so clearly of a higher class not much the whore said her eyes twinkling in fact cute as you are i might pay you she was just flattering him he knew but peb liked hearing it anyway his hand reached for the sash of his pants that so he asked how much you think im worth that smile darkened and those delicate features suddenly seemed far less innocent two silver and two gold peb was too stunned to even move by the time he saw the small crossbow it was too late she pulled the trigger and the bolt thudded into his neck he opened his mouth but no sound came out his stomach heaved and he dropped unable to maintain his balance he tried to run to scream but his muscles ignored every command poison he realized his terror increasing the bolt was poisoned i know you cant move the whore said kneeling down beside him covering the front of her brown dress with dirt maybe you think that means you wont feel anything youre wrong i just want you to know that youll feel everysinglething a knife flashed before him held aloft so he could see the sharp edge in the moonlight then it turned and peb felt tears run down the side of his face the tip pressed beneath his right eye slipped deeper it cut through nerves muscle and then with a sickening plop pulled free with his remaining eye he saw her holding aloft his severed eyeball a thin bloody strand of tissue still attached to the back satisfied the whore put it into a pocket of her dress then leaned forward dagger leading hungry for his remaining eye it was true he felt every bit of it the hours passed the sun setting and the moon rising all while haern watched the tavern after tarlaks departure lord victor had remained inside as night approached more and more of his men filtered back increasing the protection of their lord while he slept haern shifted his weight back and forth so his legs never fell asleep the tedium wore on him but he was used to such things most nights he patrolled the city he saw nothing and accomplished little but he knew tonight would not be one of those nights the hawks had drawn first blood but someone else would come in for the kill he had a sneaking suspicion that his father would elect himself the one to do it come on he whispered glancing up and down the street from his spot i know you want him now come and get him opposite victors repurposed tavern were several businesses including a smith in the recesses of the smiths doorway haern waited hunched over with a ratty blanket covering his body he kept his hood off for amusingly enough he was less likely to be noticed and recognized with his blond hair and blue eyes showing just a drunk thats all he was with his sabers hidden beneath a blanket and his cloaks bunched into a pillow to ease his back as he leaned against the door from where he sat he could see the main entrance to victors home plus one of the sides based on what tarlak had told him after placing the runes the only possible way of entrance was through the front door the windows were too heavily boarded the roof and walls solid and tarlaks runes ensured no magical means allowed someone to bypass them a frontal attack then where many of victors guards waited armed and armored no there was only one person who would be mad enough to do it and it was the one man who might succeed as well haern closed his eyes took a deep breath patience he had to have patience thren would leave nothing to chance he had to keep ready to plan ahead cracking his eyes just enough so that hed still look asleep he watched and waited minutes crawled by turning into another hour he shifted again grimaced at the tingles that shot up his leg waited too long leg asleep he was getting nervous and he knew why ever since faking his death during the bloody kensgold nine years ago haern had never crossed swords with his father yet if he was right about tonight there was no avoiding that possibility growing up haern had known his father was one of the best in the world when it came to swordplay certainly the best in veldaren that was a long time ago and now the thieves whispered that it was the watcher who deserved that claim but what if they were wrong movement in the shadows forced his mind away from such worried thoughts there thought haern a scout from the spider guild peering from around the corner of a building far to his right by his guess the scout could just barely see the guards at the doorway taking in positions looking for patrols confirming numbers that was threns way haern wondered if his father had prepared for him as well and shivered a grown man yet he still felt like a child when he compared himself to that stern imposing figure more than anything he did not want to face him swallowing that fear down he watched the scout all while being careful to make no movement that might give away his presence after less than twenty seconds the scout was gone a hunch made him shift so he could watch the other way and sure enough another scout appeared along the rooftops checking the other direction of course as well as seeing if there was a patrol the first might have missed no doubt they both saw the same thing a wellboarded protected tavern with the lone entrance guarded by four soldiers in armor two wielded swords two others long spears the scout vanished and haern shifted so he might have easier reach for his sabers as an afterthought he touched the pendant of the golden mountain that hung beneath his shirt please help me ashhur he whispered i have a feeling im going to need it oh and protect victor if you think hes worth protecting that done he readjusted so he was on his knees instead of his buttocks tilting his head to one side he let his mouth drop let his breathing slow with a single eye he watched waited but the attack didnt come haern felt his patience tested why not everything was ready the scouts had checked the guards at the front look tired and bored why did he not see their approach the soft creaking of wood gave him his answer above him the massed spider guild had traveled across the rooftops and now overlooked the tavern same as him suddenly uncertain haern lay there as the silence of the night was interrupted with the sound of crossbow strings a deadly barrage of bolts sailed towards the four guards their aim was true piercing through throats and eyes all four men dropped unable to call out the sound of their chainmail rattling was the only warning they gave to those inside haern bit down a curse ropes rolled down in front of him and then the thieves descended haern kept perfectly still hoping his presence might go unnoticed through a crack in his eyelids he counted their number twentythirtyforty thren felhorn landed before him and haern stopped counting his father looked almost exactly like he remembered his strong jaw his coldly intelligent blue eyes his reddish blond hair cut short so it would not interfere with his hearing or vision the only differences were the wrinkles and the way his skin looked stretched and thin it was a strange thing realizing how much his father had aged but peering up at him haern still felt like a child for a brief moment of terror he thought thren might see him and without his hood hiding his face recognize his long lost son if he did turn and draw his shortswords haern didnt know if he would be able to react in time to save himself the first of the thieves reached the door and thren followed after haern slowly exhaled his hands were shaking and as he sat up he relied on his years of training to steady his breath and calm his heart this is what hed expected what hed known would happen in times past haern had stormed through the mansions of the trifect slaughtering mercenaries and thieves alike to bring about peace hed fought the most skillful of opponents from the wraith to dieredon he would show no fearnot here not now the spider guild must fear him not the other way around should have kept tarlak with me haern thought one wellplaced fireball and the entire fight would already be over with so many of the thieves backs to him it was tempting to rush into their ranks but he knew thren would not be so foolish as that instead haern slunk to the side of the building then ran to the back scrambling to the top he drew his swords and pulled his hood over his head letting its magical darkness hide his features four men with crossbows remained on the rooftop guarding the flank haern crossed the shingles without a sound two were already dead before they knew he was there another fell to the hard stone below blood gushing from his throat the fourth managed a single scream before a saber took away his voice and his life in the tense silence that scream was enough standing to his full height haern held his swords out wide let the spider guild see him there looming a promise of death in the dark night the guards inside had started to shout for several thieves had jammed thick iron crowbars against the hinges and begun to jar them loose those in the back turned though and they readied their weapons at least fifty on one thought haern could be worse the door shook men rammed against it and then it broke the spider guild rushed the opening and from within the tavern haern heard the sound of combat he knew soldiers protected victor but how many and would they hold below a line of thieves remained about ten left to protect their flank from the lurking watcher haern smiled despite himself now that was better he leapt into the air his cloaks trailing silently behind him sabers eager he twirled so that they could not guess his direction upon landing theyd cut in try to bury him in sheer numbers and hed be ready his feet touched the ground and he dropped rolling to help soak up his momentum he felt his shoulder connect against a mans legs and when the thief went down haern pulled up leaping again avoiding frantic cuts this time he was fully in control parrying away hits with vicious speed pirouetting on one foot he lashed out cutting down two nearby thieves more rushed in but they were simple attacks thrusts and chops that showed their lack of formal training most could only dream of training with the masters thren had brought in from around the world on a monthly basis hed wanted haern to be his heir his lord of the underworld as the spiders died around him haern felt in himself the fulfillment of that destiny in a way his father never could have anticipated parry shift counter and another two fell spinning he let his cloaks flare out let them disguise his movements one thief slashed only to miss stabbing into gray cloth instead of flesh haern lunged at him knowing him vulnerable his sabers pierced the mans belly and a twist sent the contents spilling the remaining men wanted no part of him and turned to flee haern let them knowing he had bigger problems to face looking to the door he saw the entirety of the guild had managed to force themselves inside he still heard combat which was a good sign long as men were fighting victor had a chance when he reached the broken door an eruption shook the ground along with a bright flash that lit up the night haern shifted his feet to keep his balance then swore from above the rooftop he saw smoke billowing into the night sky damn it tarlak do you not know the meaning of subtle the last bit of defense tarlak had told haern about was in victors room which when activated would explode the wall outward giving the lord a chance to escape obviously it had been triggered no time left haern dashed through the door and his recklessness nearly killed him a sword thrust pierced the space before the entrance shockingly fast yet haern was also fast collapsing to one knee as he twisted away the tip of the blade cut across his chest just a nick that would scar at worst a faint spray of blood flecked across the ground as haern continued his turn bringing up his sabers in the process thren stood before him bent into a ready stance he twirled a sword not yet attacking only staring behind him his guild members battled a slew of guards making their stand atop the stairs all around lay corpses of both thieves and soldiers this is no concern of yours thren said the man is a fool and he threatens the balance youve killed so many to achieve fool or not id rather keep him alive ill have no war in veldaren not again thren shook his head took a careful step forward if you dont want a war then victor must die tonight stand down watcher haern felt his pulse quicken felt his breath catch in his throat no he said thren leapt closing the distance between them with the speed of a demon shortswords stabbed in their angles deceptive only instinct kept haern alive his hands feeling like they moved of their own accord his sabers parried both aside and a shifting of his feet made it so his shoulder met threns when they collided his father was strong but haern kept his feet planted firm just long enough to halt threns momentum hoping for surprise he then rolled aside toward threns back and swung for his neck thren ducked it with ease this time they both rushed one another their blades clashing together with a steady ringing of steel haern felt his nerves settle as he blocked and parried skilled as his father was he was slower than haern and not as strong not by much of course but in a contest so close even a little advantage was crucial you can still flee haern said his riposte cutting a thin line across threns shoulder when haern tried to follow it up thren fell back his shortswords batting aside every thrust youre a puppet of the trifect thren said pulling his swords together and settling into another stance you wont defeat me i am what youd become if they cut your strings haern narrowed his gaze the tips of his sabers pressed against the wood floor as he took in heavy gasps of air before their combat could resume a thief rushed down the steps the last of the guards were dead and whatever fighting there was continued higher up victors made it to the street the thief cried out as if oblivious that his guildmaster faced off against the watcher haern met his fathers gaze and a halfsmile tugged at his lips they both sprinted for the door haern sliding to one leg just as he reached it as he thought a dagger sailed over his head thrown by thren when he realized he could not keep pace leaping back to his feet haern ran on desperate not to fail a quick glance behind showed thren at his heels his own gray cloak billowing behind him together they rounded the corner and saw the mess tarlaks spell had created the entire side wall of the tavern was gone the wood was blackened and burned along the edges as if pushed out by a great fire rubble lay scattered across the street thieves had given chase and haern saw at least twenty of them running ahead of them all was lord victor a distant silver shape no escort remained with him despite his lead haern knew the thieves would catch him most of them younger and unburdened by armor just keep going haern breathed as he ran knowing thren followed dangerously close he was faster than them all knew how to maximize the push of every swing of his legs but the moment he stopped to fight thren would come crashing in haern saw little hope but it didnt matter he ran on catching up to the tail end of thieves he slid close and swung his saber hamstrung a man toppling him head over heels while screaming another stopped to strike but haern veered aside and continued past too many ahead the homes on either side flashed by in blurs haerns pulse thundered in his ears when they caught victor theyd tear him apart overwhelm him with the street exploded before him rocks each the size of a mans fist thudded into the homes smoke billowed from the crater that now separated haern from lord victor over half of the thieves had been caught in the fire their corpses now lying scattered about their clothing aflame the rest staggered aimlessly bleeding from the ears and then from the smoke emerged deathmask a pale gray mask covered his face and hovering about his head hiding his features like a dark cloud was a swirl of ash fire danced from his fingertips nows not the time to be a hero deathmask said to them pointing at the nearest spider fire shot from his finger and bathed the man in flame his screams did not last long but were still terrible to hear at the same time a woman leapt from the rooftops two daggers glowing a soft violet in her hands she landed amid the stunned thieves making short work of those who tried to defend themselves haern recognized her as veliana deathmasks second in command not that he had many to command only two others were in his guild twins he found them beside victor in the distance haern feared they would hurt him but from what he could see through the smoke they only stood at his side as if to protect him shaking his head haern turned behind him realizing he had forgotten the threat of his father if thren had wanted he could have born down upon him but instead he stood far back the look of anger on his face chilling even to haern you have none to blame thren said meeting haerns eye whatever games weve played they end tonight he fled into the night and haern had no desire to chase sheathing his sabers he neared the crater which was slowly dwindling down in the amount of heat and smoke deathmask crossed his arms over his chest by the way his eyes twinkled haern had little doubt the darkhaired man was enjoying himself since when do thieves protect the lords who hunt them haern called out as he approached we have no fear of the hunt deathmask said removing his mask with a snap of his fingers the ash fell to the street revealing his features he was a handsome man his dark hair down to his neck his tanned skin smooth and clean most noticeable were his eyes the left a deep brown the right colored red besides you know i enjoy a bit of chaos every now and then veliana joined his side her daggers still twirling in her dexterous fingers her dark hair was pulled into a ponytail she might have been beautiful but for the wicked scar that ran from forehead to chin cutting across her right eye and leaving it a bloody orb you dont mind if we take him for a while do you veliana asked him victor asked haern why just somewhere safe deathmask said giving haern a wink dont try to follow us besides i think you have your own mess to clean up deathmask nodded to the tavern that victor had been using as a home haern glanced at it saw the bodies and dwindling fire when he looked back he realized the twins were gone and victor with them deathmasks smile grew dont worry watcher he said we wont keep him long they stepped into the crater and smoke wafted over them when it cleared they were gone haern took a deep breath let it out whatever was going on it was currently beyond his control but it seemed like the ash guild wasnt ready to see lord victor killed at least not by someone other than them damn it all haern said shaking his head he looked to the fire the bodies and heard the screams of the injured who had yet to die far away a trumpet sounded the call of the city guard arriving far too late a rock settled deep in haerns gut whatever peace veldaren had known it died that night threns look had promised war and in time decimated guild or not he would have it saying a prayer for the entire city haern returned to victors place to wait for the rest of the eschaton to arrive whatever their motivations the ash guild could not be trusted one way or another haern would find them before the nights end zusa waited atop the eastern wall of the city hidden in the recesses of a watchtower whenever a guard lazily wandered by she clung to the stone ceiling and let him pass underneath without a clue to her presence then she dropped down returned to the edge and waited it had been many years but she knew she would recognize daverik the moment he arrived what shed say to himthat she was far less certain of perhaps shed just kill him she wanted to almost needed to the night wore on but she forced herself to be patient she had given daverik no specific location for she didnt want his faceless to set up an ambush if they tried following she would spot their movement no matter how good they might be at slinking through shadows they were young and zusa was better are you a coward now zusa wondered aloud as the night wore on daverik had been many things but at least he had never been one to give in to fear but itd been over a decade since theyd lain in each others arms perhaps she was naive to think he had changed so little a distant thunder turned her eyes west she saw hints of a fire and a lot of smoke curiosity tugged at her to go but she refused no matter what she would not have daverik wander by unnoticed left to return to the temple thinking that she had been the one who was a coward wherever the fire was she could tell it was nowhere near alyssas mansion and that was enough to keep her there when he finally did show she nearly missed him instead of priestly garb he wore plain clothes dull brown pants and a gray shirt he carried no torch the moonlight sufficient for him when once his hair had fallen past his shoulders now it was gone completely his head smoothly shaved time had wore on his features hardened them but when she cast a second glance at him while he passed beneath her she saw the cheeks shed kissed the large lips that had kissed her in return a test she realized nothing about him revealed himself as a priest only someone familiar with him would know him for who and what he was that she had passedshould she be pleased or disappointed daverik she called out as he turned she slid down the wall silently landing in a crouch scanning the rooftops she saw no sign of the other faceless good her attention turned to her former lover who smiled at her and opened his arms katherine he said and the sound of his voice was the key to a vault of a hundred memories my god katherine is it really you she stood to her full height pulling her shoulders back and turning her head to the side though the wrappings were originally meant to hide her beauty they also revealed every curve of her body let him see the woman she had become let him know what the priesthood had denied him for ten long years not katherine she said they took that name from me when they covered my face lashing it out of my soul with their whips and barbs i am zusa now a soft smile spread across his pale face the moonlight added a blue tint to his green eyes that she noticed at all annoyed her in all my memories you will always be katherine he said but if i must i will call you zusa he laughed then shook his head in disbelief i had heard one of the faceless had revolted and turned away from the order i had hoped it might be you you were never one for rules or limitations neither were you or did the priesthood taint you convince you that every time we fucked it was my fault that smile of his faded he took a step toward her and she recoiled away they tried he said softly they said you seduced me that your beauty was unveiled sin at times i almost agreed you are beautiful zusa perhaps without equal but what we didwhat we hadi would never diminish it in such a way such charming honest words daverik had always known what to say to her and she felt her old wounds bleeding anew theyd been in each others arms when the priests had discovered them theyd needed no trial no council to confirm the obvious while she watched theyd lashed daverik before the altar let his blood bleed across the ancient stone as for her the order of the faceless awaited theyd stripped her naked and while daverik watched bound only her mouth and eyes with the wrappings that would become her ceremonial dress and when they carried her away hed said only two words whose meaning she had always feared and never fully understood forgive me why are you here she asked forcing a cold edge into her voice daverik was just a phantom from her past a boyhood love theyd both been so young so foolish and naive i thought youd been banished to mordeina i was daverik said glancing about when he saw that they were still alone he walked over to the wall and leaned his back against it crossing his arms but it was only for ten years and now my time has come to an end they gave me one last task as penance a way to redeem my insult to our god your god zusa corrected i have no love for karak this clearly pained daverik but he continued without remarking on it the betrayal of the faceless women has weighed on the priests in mordeina though pelorak initially refused he finally accepted my return here along with the reopening of the order i am their teacher their master why you because they felt i would best understand their weaknesses having fallen for them myself zusa shook her head and to show her opinion on the matter she spat at his feet his explanation sounded hollow the reasoning unlike what she knew of the priesthood hed be forever branded as a man weak enough to give in to his passions why would they put women also believed to be weak and willing into his care the order should have remained dead and gone she said how many women have you enslaved it is not enslavement i asked how many daverik sighed four i doubt any are as skilled as you but theyre learning karak has blessed them greatly and i think they might even surprise you with the gifts they possess zusa smirked im sure i have a few surprises for them as well keep them far away from me daverik the very sight of them sets my blood to boil if youre wise youll leave veldaren immediately she turned to leave but he reached out and grabbed her arm her free hand moved for her dagger but their eyes met and she saw the incredible force of will there for a moment she remained still lost in time remembering a seventeenyearold girl hiding in a dark alley with a pretty boy willing to touch her kiss her in ways the priesthood had forbidden they say you work for alyssa gemcroft now he said is that true it is she said pulling her arm free she wanted to hurt him to shock him and she didnt know why i am her sister her protector and at times her lover why do you ask daverik swallowed and she could tell he was struggling to choose his words these are dangerous times he said i dont want to see you hurt theres much beyond my understanding but i know lady gemcroft is not safe from the coming storm stay away from her and all her family is that a threat only a warning he said i wish i could do more she took three steps and leapt high above his head to the rooftop of a nearby home she landed without a sound then spun to face him youre a smooth liar she said but i am no fool why did they really bring you to veldaren daverik sighed and ran a hand across his bald head i was to find you bring you back into the fold now that the order was no longer disbanded alyssa felt her neck flush with anger and if i refused he met her gaze let her see the pain in his eyes i was to kill you the words were a dagger but they did not surprise her did not even make her flinch will you daverik will you try to kill me my love or my god do not make me choose katherine i chose you a long time ago im not sure i have the strength to do so again she let the shadows swirl around her drawing them to her as if they were liquid and she the bottom of a drain did you not hear me before she asked katherines dead my name is zusa send your little girls after me if you must ill kill them all but dont you dare bring alyssa into this or try to harm a single hair on her head if you do not even the walls of the temple will keep you safe from me she ran just a swathe of shadow in the night far behind she heard him call her name this time the right one zusa she ran harder faster whatever shed expected she felt a fool for doing so they were no longer children no longer lovers he had no right to set her heart racing by his mere touch on her arm trying to think of something anything else she still failed his words echoed in her head coming storm she wondered what did he mean by that what did he know that she did not the idea that karaks priesthood wanted the gemcroft family destroyed was a frightening one but with all else that had happened she could not dismiss the possibility she felt trapped in a web just one of many in the strands but who was the spider spinning in the center of it all she didnt know but she must find out alyssas life was in danger the city passed by her a silent blur and it was only when she reached the gemcroft mansion that she realized she was being followed turning she drew her daggers but by then they were already gone the four faceless women vanishing into the night like the ghosts they were dont you dare zusa whispered standing at the closed gate as she issued her threat not just to the faceless but to the entire city spread out before her you wont take her away from me none of you will in the distance she heard the roar of another explosion and as it rumbled she felt as if it were the citys heartless mocking laughter when they pulled the black cloth from his face victor found himself in what appeared to be a small cellar the walls made of uneven rock and lit by two torches in either corner he saw no windows and no doors his arms were bound behind him and his ankles were held firm to the legs of the chair he sat in before him looking far too amused to be harmless was deathmask and his ash guild how have you enjoyed tonights entertainment deathmask asked sitting across from him in the only other furniture victor could see a similarly old and worn chair im not sure about you but killing spiders always gives me a smile beside him a woman crossed her arms and leaned against his side from what hed learned her name was veliana his second in command im not sure hes worth it she said victor peered up at her he decided there was more compassion and mercy in her bloodied eye than the healthy one perhaps not victor said trying to remain calm course itd help if i knew what value my life was being weighed against coin said one of the two twins lurking against the wall their pale skin making them seem like ghosts in the dim light lots of coin said the other right victor said turning his attention to deathmask the clear leader of them all if anyone was to decide his fate it was him but as ransom or bounty or did you lie and there actually is something my soldiers will soon dig up on your little guild deathmask scooted his chair closer and his grin spread you think youre sharp he said you think your charm will keep you safe from what your soldiers cannot but youve come to a city that eats men like you for supper we spit your bones out in the gutters at most youre just gristle to get stuck in our teeth you arent a white knight come to save us all and the sooner you accept that the sooner you and i might start to get along youve never faced a man like me before deathmask shook his head and wagged a finger at him you see thats the thingwe have i daresay you remind me most of thren felhorn oh dont give me that look its true same cockiness same certainty that youll live forever without meeting someone better you know it might even be true but the problem is you keep acting like youre special you keep thinking that theres something unique about you he slid even closer and raised a palm to the ceiling purple fire burst into existence in its center and it swirled in an unfelt wind burned on fuel that was not there if i shoved this fire into your lungs said deathmask youd scream like anyone else youd die like anyone else and then your corpse would shit itself just like every other man and woman who has lived and died on this joke of a world when the worms are eating our bodies therell be no difference between you and i not a one victor took a deep breath and was glad that the tight ropes holding him to the chair kept him from shaking im not afraid of you he said tell me what it is you want or let me go deathmask chuckled and he clenched his fist banishing the fire what do i want i want you safe and alive thats what i want and for you to do that you need to start listening if we work together well both meet our goals and you might even live long enough to see the end victor tried to hide his revulsion and failed he thought of his words to the watcher and shook his head i will not have you drag me down he said no deals no bribes no sacrificing a shred of my intent you cant defeat me so you hope to make me like you cant defeat you veliana asked she grabbed his face in her hands and gave him an earful of her mocking laughter cant defeat you look around victor instead of removing that mask over your head we could have buried a dagger in your throat and been done with all this how about instead of spouting blind nonsense you start listening to the words youre saying she let go pushing his head back hard enough to hurt the muscles in his neck he felt his face flush and he caught the twins snickering in the background pride wounded he looked to the floor forced himself to think they were right of course his life was fully in their hands but that didnt mean he had to surrender it didnt mean he had to break i will not die a hypocrite he said softly ive come to veldaren to cleanse it of your kind i will not work with you to do it it is a poor executioner who relies on the condemned to swing their own axe are you so sure deathmask asked we now have a common enemy thren will never forgive me for what ive done and you well youre dead no matter what the only reason you lived through his first attack was with my help should you remain stubborn we may not be so generous the next time victor knew he was sealing his fate with his next answer but he forced away the guilt the frustration from failing so thoroughly in his goal deathmask wanted something most likely to use him as his own private army against the other thief guilds but he would not allow it he would not be so cowardly as to sacrifice everything he believed just to spare his own life meeting deathmasks eye he opened his mouth to answer and thats when the wall to his left exploded rock and dust filled the cellar the four members of the ash guild fell back to the far wall drawing daggers and readying magic i must say death im rather disappointed in you said tarlak as he walked through the rubble and into the cellar not a single protection spell against scrying i cast one on victor the moment i took him deathmask said as purple fire danced about his fingers not on victor tarlak said grinning on you but the nights late and such a mistake can be forgiven for how tired im sure you are ill take your guest off your hands so you can rest hes such a troublemaker isnt he more arrived through the hole in the wall some victor recognized some he didnt the watcher was the first his sabers drawn his face hidden in shadow with him was a priestess of ashhur the wizards sister delysia hed met her briefly when he first came to ask tarlak to cast wards about his home last was a short stocky man with a beard clunking down behind the others in a full suit of platemail the four faced off with the ash guild who almost looked eager for a fightall but deathmask who just looked amused such a dramatic display he said but truly unnecessary did i not tell your pet assassin he would be safe with me the watcher slipped closer and with a few quick swings of his sabers cut victor free from the chair his back stung when he stood but victor was thrilled to be able to move glancing to the ash guild he dipped his head low thank you for the hospitality he said any time deathmask said still looking more amused than upset that the eschaton had come to save him come see us again said the twins in unison victor stepped through the hole in the wall and an opened chunk of dirt to the surface the priestess took his arm asked him if he was injured shaking his head victor glanced back saw the watcher remaining behind the assassin said something to deathmask then left to follow take me to my men victor said to tarlak as he led them beyond the plain looking home and out to the street i must let them know i am safe and well well do that for you tarlak said but for now youre coming with us your home isnt safe i know your spell left a gaping hole in the wall tarlak glanced back at the cellar indeed seems to be my specialty tonight damn fools said the shorter fellow in armor what were they trying to do they were saving my life victor said remembering his flight down the street thieves in chase doubt that the man snorted quiet brug tarlak said he stopped them all there in the middle of the street victor didnt know why but the wizard was twirling his hands about in odd motions deathmask doesnt have an altruistic bone in his body the watcher said joining them if hes interested in you enough to keep you alive its probably far worse than if hed never noticed you at all thanks for the comforting words victor muttered my home was attacked at least fifteen of my men are dead and a madman has plans for me hes unwilling to share dont forget thren felhorn wants you dead brug said that should be up there too victor glared at brug who seemed not to care done tarlak said and with the word the street split before him like a torn painting victor stepped back stunned the tear grew swirling with an unnatural light until it was the size of a man without hesitation tarlak stepped through vanishing instead of appearing on the other side his sister followed then brug before victor could step through the watcher grabbed his wrist and held him still we put our lives at risk helping you he said do you understand that victor nodded i do good never forget it he shoved victor into the portal his vision flooded with stars gravity twirled and reversed and then he was landing on cold hard earth his stomach heaved and he vomited uncontrollably as he gasped for air he looked up to see a large tower built where rolling green hills met an expansive forest tarlak stood before him hand outstretched grin on his face welcome back to the eschaton tower the wizard said now that ive saved your life at least twice by my count i think its time we rediscuss my fee antonil surveyed what was left of the bodies and shook his head whats that put the death total at he asked sergan his most trusted friend the man was a ruffian in soldiers armor big features dirty hair and an even bigger axe across his back he was a good man though disciplined and always willing to tell antonil the truth no matter how little he wanted to hear it not the best at numbers sergan said turning to spit think were getting beyond what i can count about fifteen or so of victors men in and about his home twenty gray cloaks in there with them three or four on the way to here and now this sergan gestured to the crater in the street the corpses scattered about some killed by fire some maimed by heavy blunt blows what you think fifteen eighteen lord victor was a fool to think theyd let him go unpunished antonil said which of these bodies do you think is him sergan squinted at a few nearby frowned not seeing any wearing fancy enough clothes might still be alive and cowering under a rock somewhere though i doubt itll mean shit his fools quest is over once hes done wiping his ass hell take the first wagon out of veldaren i guarantee it question is what do we do pretty obvious the spider guild is the one responsible for all this think we could have the king declare them all under arrest perhaps if we wanted to send them all into hiding and make all our lives miserable for the next ten years who killed the spider guild though dont see any of victors guards having made it this far i dont know but whoever it was was doing us a service antonil let out a grim laugh dont let thren hear you say that id hate to have to find myself a new trainer for the guard more city guards arrived from the castle wheeling a cart behind them at sergans orders they began loading up the dead and shifting aside the larger stones to reopen the road for travel theyd been at it for hours all to clean up the mess the attack had caused and clear away the rubble and the dead the sun was rising above the city wall reminding antonil how tired he was and how long a day he had ahead of him antonil watched his soldiers work with a pall cast over his mood hed known this was coming it seemed everyone but victor had known it but expecting it and actually seeing the anger and power of the underworld rise up to strike were two different things and lest they risk allout warfare on the streets antonil could do nothing about it it used to be that the easy money made the guilds soft but no longer the watcher had been the one to keep the more troublesome in line but this was beyond him perhaps it was beyond them all something bothering you beyond the obvious sergan asked coming back over from the crater if necessary we could raise an army to battle off kingdoms perhaps even the wrath of the elves antonil said yet we are so powerless against these thieves how why once the worm gets in the apple its near impossible to get out sergan said smacking antonil on the shoulder our walls dont work against this enemy theyve got boundaries no diplomats no castles to take or crops to burn just men sticky fingers and a frightening amount of daggers much as id like to have every one of them thieves stretched out before me in an open battlefield they aint that stupid so well do what we can with what weve got to work with theyre killing everyone who talks to victors men antonil said revealing what had weighed most heavy on his heart thought you were posting guards it isnt enough it never seems to be enough my numbers are stretched thin as it is sergan shrugged youll think of something you always do and besides werent you listening victors going to be halfway to ker by this afternoon and all the way to mordeina by nightfall there wont be any more witnesses to protect in a few days itll all die down to the quiet little insanity weve learned to live with lately forgive me sergan but i have my doubts the weathered man raised an eyebrow spat again whys that in answer antonil pointed to where lord victor approached with a large retinue of his men their armor gleaming in the morning light antonil bowed at his arrival and victor responded in kind good to see you safe and well antonil said im surprised myself victor said before gesturing to his men whatever help you need my men are here to offer it much of this is my fault and i wont leave you to clean it up alone once its done we can resume the investigations antonil managed to hide the surprise from his face and voice but only because of a lifetime of discipline youre still to remain in veldaren victor clapped antonil on the shoulder i dont scare that easily well use more caution of course take things a bit slower now that we know what lengths they will go to antonil had sergan dole out orders then asked victor if hed join him for a moment so they could talk privately something wrong victor asked as they put their backs to their men and walked its the men and women youve been bringing in to testify antonil began ive tried posting guards but many go into hiding and even the ones i do protect have been killed often my guards die as well victor nodded while listening and antonil saw the hidden anger and frustration casualties of war captain the lord said but he couldnt quite keep the dismissive tone from wavering your war not theirs victor sighed what do you want me to do antonil i wont leave not after all this would you have me render their deaths pointless id have there be no deaths at all conduct these talks in secret give shelter among your soldiers for those who request it once weve weakened the guilds these measures wont be necessary but until then enough victor said his sharp tone startling antonil the guard captain watched as victor turned away for a moment and stared at the crater in the street and the bodies being loaded onto the cart i thought i was prepared victor said his voice softening i thought i could bear the burden and i still will antonil i will bear it but it is far heavier than i ever imagined it will get worse before it gets better antonil said i know victor said turning back to him i will do what i can to hide the identity of those we bring in whatever good it will do your king has already agreed to let me use his castle so i will question everyone there as for those in fear for their lives he gestured down the street where work had already begun in repairing the wall of victors repurposed tavern there are many rooms within as well as space on the floor bring them there until there is no room left will it be safe antonil asked thinking of the attack only hours prior from the outside yes victor said i can promise you that but insidei dont know i invite assassins in with every man i give shelter i pray you understand the risk i take and hope i never have reason to regret it ill have my men keep an eye on your place as well antonil said my liege would have me work with you help you in any way i can just ask victor and i will so long as it protects this city and the people in it victor offered his hand and antonil clasped it i would have us friends rather than enemies victor said but tonight has done me well i know how strong we must be to succeed trust me last night will not happen again antonil nodded wished the man well still when he left to join sergan he did so with a heavy heart something about the way victor had said that made the hair on the back of his neck itch victors response to near death and failure was not to doubt but to harden his resolve what could he do to the thief guilds that would be any worse than what he did now what do we do with the dead spiders sergan asked at his arrival hold them for a day at the castle let family members come and see if they recognize them antonil chewed on his lower lip bury them all in a common grave not a name given for any he said theyre enemies of the peace enemies of our king they deserve no better might piss em off antonil laughed and he waved his arms at the wreckage about them any worse than they are now bury them and forget them we have a lot of work to do and not anywhere near enough time to do it nathaniel hovered around his mother the early part of the morning but her mind was clearly elsewhere his attempts at talking to her always ended abruptly her answers terse and distracted henris the scribe sitting beside her seemed more important his questions given more thought terrance was also there looking nervous and incredibly young next to the wrinkled old scribe he didnt speak much only when the scribe directly asked him something nathaniel tried being more persistent until alyssa looked up from the table in her study and snapped at him must i make up tasks so i might have a moment of peace nathaniel flinched but hed listened to lord gandrems words closely and knew such childish fits were not becoming of him he grabbed his stump of a right arm just a small chunk of bone and skin coming down from his shoulder nervous he drummed his fingers atop the bone like he did when he needed to distract himself alyssa saw this and immediately softened come here nathan she said he walked closer and leaned his head against his mothers stomach as she wrapped her arms about him youve endured troubled times before she said this is one of them i havent forgotten you though tonight ill fetch us a bard and pay him to dazzle us with a dozen songs well listen together and you can tell me which is your favorite youd like that wouldnt you he nodded and she kissed his forehead go play she said otherwise ill have john find you something to do hell just make me practice with my sword he said he knows it gets heavy that just means you need to practice more until it feels like a part of your arm milady may i ask the source of these imports henris asked pointing to one of what seemed like a thousand pieces of parchment alyssa turned back to the man and nathaniel knew that was his sign to leave he wanted to stay to stomp his foot and demand attention but he imagined the way john would react should he hear about such a display yes mother nathaniel said even though he doubted she heard him at least her promise about the bard was exciting he loved listening to their stories most of them anyway some dwelt on lords and ladies and who was in love with whom they bored him to tears the ones about dragons paladins orcs wolfmen and other creatures of the vile wedgethose were the ones that kept him up far past his bedtime wideeyed in the lap of his mother he especially loved hearing of the war between the gods back during the creation of the world nathaniel left the study left the adults to argue and bicker about money and paper as john had once put it part of him felt sad knowing that that was the fate awaiting him when he got older not charging into battle on a horse like he dreamed his missing arm alone ruined any chance of that no hed bicker with old men and women count coins until the moon was high and trade things he did not have for things he would never see so much better the life the bards sang about while on his way to see lord gandrem nathaniel passed by the door to his grandmothers room she must have seen him for he heard her call his name rolling his eyes nathaniel turned around he always felt awkward in his grandmothers presence he didnt know her had barely even heard of her until her sudden arrival yet he was expected to act as if she were close family it left him confused unsure of how to act that and the way she looked at him her eyes always watery even if she wasnt crying made his stomach twist yes grandmother he asked stepping into her room which had been a guest bedroom mere weeks before his grandmother lay in the center of the bed as she often did alyssa had said she had gone through many trials and was left weak because of it but she didnt seem weak to nathaniel instead she seemed like a coiled spring wound up and unable to move please just melody she said shifting to the side so she might put her feet off the bed though it warms my heart to hear you say the word grandmother yes maam she laughed as if this amused her though hed purposefully chosen not to call her melody you look upset dear she said is your mother still busy with that worm of victors despite himself he cracked a smile thinking of henriss scrunched in face he doesnt look like a worm he looks like one of the gophers groundskeeper willis hates to his relief melody laughed instead of getting upset for him saying such a thing watch your tongue in their presence melody said gently easing herself off the bed but dont worry about me i spent too much time in silence to care for tempered words and padded halftruths i say if a man looks like a gopher call him a gopher dont you nathaniel nodded he still felt awkward but at least it seemed like he could trust melody to pay attention to him and not care if he said something john would claim was improper his grandmother walked over to her expansive closet and opened the doors can you can keep a secret nathaniel she asked as she peered into its darkness yes maam he said lord gandrem says my word should be my bond and to never break it johns a smart man melody said and you should trust much of what he says but ive spent a few afternoons with him and he is lacking in knowledge of the gods tell me nathan what do you know of karak and ashhur as she asked this she pulled out a small wooden box from the far recesses of the closet nathaniel stepped closer his curiosity too strong to resist her question itself though nearly deflated him his teacher of numbers had been devoted to ashhur always telling nathaniel lists of rules expectations and everything ashhur would be sad about for him doing my teacher made me memorize some things he reluctantly admitted i dont mean prayers and sermons nathan the gods are not figments not boring lessons with names they were real they wielded blades raised armies and conquered the wildlands dezrel used to be before their arrival nathaniels eyes widened now this was more like the bards songs than the dry lecturing of his teacher when melody opened the box his eyes widened further so much that he thought theyd bug out of his head it was unlike anything hed ever seen before the base was a circle made of dark stone with two soft indents on either side the center almost like a bowl but much too shallow laying in it were nine precious stones each with a thin silver chain encircling it attached it to the base the stones were all different ruby sapphire emerald topaz even a couple he didnt recognize each one was the size of his thumb when i was in the darkness this was all i had to keep me company she said your grandfather didnt want me to have it but a good friend gave it to me anyway pull the curtains across the window child we must make it as dark as we can nathaniel hurried to do as she said even with the lavish lifestyle he was accustomed to living in a house of the trifect he was still excited by the sheer wealth before him that melody held whatever it was it certainly was worth a fortune that she had somehow hidden it in a dungeon was stunning as he tugged on the curtains he thought to ask her of her time spent imprisoned at leon conningtons mansion but dared not deep down he knew that what he might hear was something he would not enjoy and involve things he was only starting to understand the curtains were long and sewn thick so when nathaniel returned to the closet he had to hold a hand against the wall to guide him there until his eyes adjusted remember nathan melody said you must tell no one of this this is a chrysarium and is worth more than i could ever replace ive long kept it hidden so do not make me feel foolish for showing such a young child im not so young nathaniel said puffing out his chest he caught a smile from her just a crease in the shadows and then she lifted the chrysarium her thumb and palms pressed against the grooves on the sides the rest of her fingers holding it from beneath melodys eyes closed and he heard her whispering the words were too low and quick for him to understand but he felt something strange and foreign building in his chest panic struck him and he wanted to flee but before he could work up the nerve the gems began to shine it was soft at first just a flicker of color like sparks of tinder on a fire not yet caught the emerald shimmered first a deep glow growing in strength from the very center of the gem next was the ruby its bloodred light swirling within as if each gem was filled with a smoky liquid one by one the rest lit up growing in strength as his grandmother continued to pray nathaniel reached forward pushed on by a compulsion to touch them but a sudden fear overcame him his hand dropped to his side they shine by the power of my faith melody said pausing for a moment to catch her breath even as she spoke the glow began to fade watch the center nathan and open your heart to matters beyond this world let the spirit guide you and you will see he didnt know what she meant didnt understand what to do or what the spirit was but then she prayed again louder stronger the gems shook in the chrysarium flared bright and then lifted in unison from the stone they floated in the air higher and higher until the length of silver chain holding them stretched tight halting their ascent nathaniel gaped mouth open in wonder so strange was this light though at times it was so bright that it hurt his eyes it did not spread the walls of the closet remained dark and even when nathaniel had brought his hand close to touch them their light had not shown upon his skin a strange hum filled his ears though where it came from he did not know it made his stomach tighten but he could not stop could not leave in the center of the chrysarium where it should have been brightest because of the gems it was darker than anything hed ever seen that is where the monsters live he thought not knowing why that is where the stars hide look deep his grandmother instructed her voice was a songbird over the din of a thunderstorm much as it frightened him he looked inside into the darkness and therein he saw the first of his visions he saw a man crying in darkness but when the man looked up nathaniel realized it was not a man but a woman her tears shone silver shadows turned and another woman held her her tears made of gold above them roared a lion and from the creatures throat poured a thousand stars they washed over the two bathed them in light and together they emerged as one being whose hands were stained with blood next came veldaren seeing it as if he soared high above like a hawk below the city burned a hundred suns igniting within its depths nathaniel tried crying out but he heard nothing of his voice and was only dimly aware of his own body another vision that of a hundred rows of wheat they swayed in the wind then withered and died as the moon rose reapers their faces hidden by masks collected the dead wheat gathering it together in a great pile when they set it aflame nathaniel felt the heat of it on his skin felt his sweat pour down his neck the bonfire split revealing a great canyon its depths endless stomach churning he spun about until he was standing on one side on the other a great army gathered muscular bodies made of darkness and shadow lifting swords and axes high above their heads and amid them laughing was a faceless man with eyes of fire no more he begged as the laughter filled his ears no more no more no more pain on the back of his head pulled him out scattering the visions he lay against the side of the closet melody cradling him the chrysarium lay beside her on the floor looking nothing out of the ordinary beyond the wealth of the gems you poor boy she whispered you poor poor boy im so sorry i didnt know its all right nathaniel said his voice coming out drowsy his words were an immediate response a desire to comfort her for he knew something hed done had frightened her what was it laughter rang in his ears and he felt his skin crawl no it isnt she said the chrysarium always showed me pleasant images fields of flowers and mountains in distant lands i didnt know it would work so differently on one so young i should have warned you i should have made sure she was crying he realized im fine everythings fine he said standing so he might hug her she kissed his cheek and he felt her tears brush against his skin thank you she said wiping them away i only meant to show you something wonderful i fear my god thought to use you for some other purpose i caught only glimpses but you saw a vision nathaniel you witnessed the future yet to come you should feel honored for few are blessed with such a gift you truly are a special child nathaniel didnt feel special or blessed he felt awkward again and the darkness of the room only made it worse i should go attend my duties he said rushing over to pull aside the curtains when the room flooded with light he trembled the warmth of it felt divine on his skin and it chased away the last image in his mind of those terrible burning eyes what duties are those melody asked slowly rising lord gandrem will have plenty ready for me he said drumming his fingers across the bone of his stump thank you grandmother she smiled remember it is our secret she said and please dont forget what youve seen a vision from the gods should never be ignored nor forgotten and if you need to talk about it i will he said still in a hurry he wanted out just out opening the door he fled the room eager to be back in john gandrems world of chores duty and learning hed had a taste of what it meant to deal with the divine and suddenly the tales of the bards seemed so far away from the truth come that night and the bards arrival nathaniel cuddled with his mother listening to stories of doomed lovers wars between lords and the fall of dragons only once did the bard a portly fellow in red try to sing of karak and ashhur nathaniel had frowned and begged his mother to make him tell a tale of monsters princes even thieves and murderers just anything else but that haern ran forfeiting the rooftops for faster travel upon the roads hed gotten caught up tracking what turned out to be a false lead just a guildless street rat trying to steal in the spider territory instead of being the widow as haern had first hoped the time wasted meant he might miss his chance to speak with alan legs pumping he raced toward the southern wall alans patrols varied but every eight days he made sure to swing by a long stretch of the south wall where there was little to steal and even less eyes to see for the most part that was the only place alan felt safe enough to talk and they certainly had much to talk about since the attack against victor the city had settled into an unstable peace a held breath before the next catastrophe victors work continued a steady picking at the various thief guilds and their numbers through it all the guilds remained quiet haern wanted to know what alan knew what thren was thinking after such a vicious loss that and the widow had struck again another spider found mutilated despite their best attempts none of the eschaton had been able to stop it the rest of the city was catching on to the murders and for most it was just a cruel joke another went to see the widow hed heard a guard say and the rest laughed as they picked up the body and pocketed the silver and gold it was a lead haern knew he should pursue though the task was daunting systematically questioning every prostitute both within and surrounding the spider guilds territory he shook his head even then it didnt explain the dead child on the gemcroft property perhaps a housemaiden cast off for some reason forced to work the streets for a living haern resolved to question alyssa later as he climbed to the rooftops too close now to risk being spotted even with the clouded sky hiding the moon and stars despite his numerous contacts alan was the only one within the spider guild willing to give information to the watcher so great was the fear thren felhorn inspired the two previous members hed contacted had died horribly as examples to the rest all the more reason to be careful haern told himself he slowed down his run and forced himself to carefully observe his surroundings far better he missed speaking to alan for a few more days than to get the man killed by his carelessness the southern district was the poorest of them all and against the wall were dozens of little shanties homes made of thin wood that looked like a stiff breeze could knock them over for a few months king edwin had tried to scatter them but they always came back the hungry and homeless too adept at fleeing too desperate to fear threats because of this few thieves bothered to patrol the area what was there to steal or prevent another guild from stealing with the night so deep all there were asleep all but alan with a leisurely stroll he passed them by only after a quick whistle from haern did he turn about heading toward a corridor where shadows were at their deepest you spotted alan asked as haern dropped to the street before him if someone had spotted me do you think wed be talking alan grunted confident arent we you have my coin haern tossed him another bag hopefully you have something more useful than last time alan caught the bag stashed it away and then leaned against a wall depends on what you consider useful you just pay me to sing anyway not my fault if you dont like what you hear haern fingered his sabers not eager to have their meeting last any longer than alan did less arguing more talking he said hows thren handling the loss terribly hes planning something big against victor but hes not telling us what other than it has something to do with the trifect as well i think this widowwhoever it isis starting to wear on him our numbers are thin as it is we dont need some crazy whore killing even more of us shit its even making me a little nervous to do my rounds whyd the ash guild ruin your attack alan shrugged grudge amusement maybe he was bored i dont know i find it a poor use of time trying to guess what deathmask is thinking might as well go hunting ghosts or searching for dragons haern frowned will thren turn on the ash guild for it alan shook his head not yet not unless they provoke him again says thats what everyone wants to have all our guilds killing each other while victor goes about picking off the remains he aint falling for the bait haern figured it also might have something to do with the catastrophic casualties thren would suffer if he tried storming the ash guilds territory deathmask was as dangerous as he was elusive at best itd be a waste of time at worst a death sentence haern kept such thoughts to himself instead pulling his hood low and preparing to leave should you learn anything of the widow anything at all make sure i know he said i learn anything you can be sureshit get down before the curse was even off his lips haern had seen the widening of alans eyes and begun to roll even then it was too late a heavy weight struck the back of his head stomach lurching he fell forward fighting off the coming waves of darkness his sabers drawn by instinct he turned to face his foe grayson followed after alan with the ease of a man who had shadowed others a thousand times before it had been years since he walked the streets of veldaren but they came back to him like an old friend when thren felhorn was first establishing his reputation grayson had been there at his side the two a vicious team every rival learned quickly to leave them be and those too slow to learn that lesson died painfully as for this songbird alan the man had only a fraction of the talent thren had at masking his movements at sticking to the shadows with an almost unnatural awareness of the flickering of light across cloak and flesh go sing your pretty song thought grayson i have my own bird to catch by the time they reached the southern wall grayson let the thief slink further and further ahead the watcher had told alan theyd meet there and unless their conversation lasted only seconds grayson knew hed have time but his presence couldnt be known skulking through alleys he found a spot where he could watch alan patrol the wall at last they both heard a whistle together they headed for the same building albeit from different angles finding a way up grayson climbed to the rooftops and carefully made his way to the alley though his weight was great he knew how to space his steps how to shift his body so that no sound might alert the two below at last he reached the edge he drew his shortswords crouched low he saw the watcher and alan talking a smile spread across his face given all the rumors the borderline worship the man received all the way to mordeina surely it would not be so easy to kill him grayson leapt already disappointed as alan let out a frightened cry but the watcher was faster than he expected unable to slash with his swords grayson kicked out his leg as he fell his heel connected with the back of the watchers head sending him sprawling grayson landed rough unable to brace because of his kick alan took the brief respite to flee to the entrance of the alley but he still remained nearby watching the watcher spun to his feet drawing his blades as he did the man turned and vomited i know a concussion when i see one grayson said settling into a combat stance his two swords tilted looking almost puny compared to the rest of his large frame you should be running that so the watcher asked his voice was like a whisper but grayson heard it clear as day instincts told him it was magic and the way shadows hid the watchers face regardless of the direction of the light hinted at the hood as the source consider it friendly advice from an equal assuming you live up to your reputation that is he stepped in and slashed careful to keep one blade back to block in case of a counter the watcher spun into action and with dizzying speed slashed at his attacks grayson found himself retreating his eyes widening to take in the sight he could tell the man was off balance but that didnt stop him from pressing hard pushing grayson to his limits to keep up the blocks the sound of steel hitting steel rang in his ears grayson kept circling countering only when the moment presented itself a realization grew in the back of his mind becoming stronger and stronger with every cut and parry the fight melded into something familiar something grayson knew all too well from years ago the watcher fought like thren felhorn not exactly of course but the fluidity of movement the constant motion the ability to turn from the defensive to the attack within the blink of an eyeit was thren it had to be his build was the same his height even the reach of his arms but that didnt make one lick of sense why he asked as he forced himself closer reach should have been his advantage given his longer arms but he knew from a thousand spars with thren that shrinking the mans room to maneuver easily outweighed any advantage as simple as reach the watcher batted his sabers left and right then spun about so his cloak blocked his movements no fool grayson fell back ready for the attack but it did not come instead the watcher retreated falling to one knee as he vomited a second time what madness leads you to this grayson asked welcoming the reprieve himself his chest ached and his heart pounded in his chest was it a ploy to save face did you need someone else to blame for ending your little war or do you like the idea of being paid twice to keep the peace what are you talking about the watcher asked dont lie to me take off that hood and show me your damn face thren i know its you at first he thought the watcher had fallen into a seizure the way his whole body shook his shoulders bobbing up and down and then the sound of laughter reached his ears thren asked the watcher as he stood his sabers hanging low at his sides you think im thren i dont know who you are or what stupidity sends you after to me but if you think i am him then you are a greater fool than i can possibly imagine grayson tensed for another lunge last chance he said take off the hood show me your face and ill let you live otherwise more laughter wild almost mad so perceptive he said yet so stupid you want to remove my hood come cut it off yourself grayson charged his long arms swinging this time the watcher was not so fast his footing not so sure the effects of the blow to his head were starting to grow more prominent twice he slammed into either side of the alley miscalculating the angle of a dodge grayson pressed on hammering him with his swords the watcher had speed but grayson had strength to back up his own skill and with every blow he saw his opponent growing weaker the watcher knew it too and his sudden reversal nearly gutted grayson where he stood spinning again to set his cloaks in motion the watcher lashed out once twice to keep him at bay and then lunged if hed been a hair faster his sabers would have connected but grayson twisted at the last moment he felt pain across his side but it was only a mild flesh wound not the vital organs the tip had been aiming for letting the pain fuel his motions grayson weaved his swords in a complex series of attacks the watcher tried to parry but grayson kept shifting the angles making it harder and harder at last when victory was apparent the watcher tried to flee it was sudden quick but hed been ready for it out went his foot the watcher stumbled struggling to regain his balance too late graysons shortsword pierced his cloak his shirt stabbed through ribs lung and then out his back when he yanked it free blood splattered across the street the watcher let out a gasp kept stumbling grayson did not hurry knowing such a wound was most certainly fatal your choice remember grayson said slowly stalking after but you never knew when you were beaten did you thats why you let your fight against the trifect last until you were too weak to stop it thats why you let marion die he expected the name of threns dead wife to elicit more emotion than it did but then again the man was clearly bleeding out before him the watcher continued limping one hand along the wall the other clutching his wound notbeatenyet he said his voice sounding wet strangled grayson saw the glass vial only a second before the watcher flung it to the ground smoke exploded out in all directions thick enough to fill the alley grayson covered his eyes with his arm and swore he knew the concoction a fairly simple mixture any wizard could make and sell hed guarded his face quick enough to avoid any of the burning sensations but it would be a good thirty seconds before it dissipated pushing through he emerged on the far side the watcher was nowhere to be found die in private if you must grayson said wiping a few stubborn tears from his eyes because of the smoke i wasnt going to mutilate your body were friends remember back in the alley alan was gone as well grayson turned away hardly caring whistling a tune he traveled back to the spider guilds headquarters the lone guard there saw him and wisely let him through grayson thought it would be quiet empty but inside were over twenty men drinking themselves into a stupor thren had cancelled most of their patrols he realized wheres thren he bellowed interrupting their stories their songs and their games of chance a few shot him looks the rest unwilling to meet his gaze i said where is thren here thren said emerging from his private room what is so important that you must shout like a buffoon no blood on his clothes no wounds not even a limp grayson grunted surprised that hed been so wrong i killed him grayson said as thren approached him the watcher hes dead for a moment total silence filled the tavern every man looked his way grayson saw the turmoil in threns eyes saw the way he tightened the muscles in his body to carefully control his reaction are you certain he asked grayson held up his shortsword still covered with blood gutted front to back grayson said yeah hes dead and with that the cheers began calls for drinks and cries of celebration that were beautiful to graysons ears and all the while thren glared unwilling to show a shred of joy or gratitude youre free of him grayson said your slavery to the trifect ends tonight if you wish it to or has the legendary thief grown afraid youve done what you wished thren said just loud enough to be heard over the din when will you be returning to mordeina grayson accepted an offered drink downed half of it i dont know thren he said grinning im the man who killed the watcher i feel like a bit of a hero maybe i should stick around enjoy the rewards the two stared each other down grayson knew thren was no fool and could see the plans arrayed against him you cant stop us grayson said softly well see about that when he turned to leave thren grabbed his arm and held him grayson tensed and he shot the thief a cold glare the watchers body he asked where is it grayson just gave him a smile just thought to be sure thren said itd be terrible if he somehow survived youd truly look the fool grayson pulled himself free marched for the door just by the exit he noticed alan drinking himself stupid at one of the tables alans eyes met his and the man jerked to his feet grayson stepped in his way preventing him from escaping in my guild youd have your tongue cut out inch by inch each piece shoved back down your throat until you drowned in blood grayson said and he took a rapid step closer startling the man but then againthis isnt my guild is it he laughed shoved open the door to the outside lifting his arms to the moon he let out a whoop feeling so damn alive the watchers dead he shouted his deep voice echoed throughout the night praise be the watchers dead we are free he heard no cry in return but he felt it flowing through the citys veins day was near and when it arrived theyd all listen all wait to hear proof against the claim but if none appeared then come nightfall four years of pent up rage and vengeance would be unleashed across the city this was everything hed hoped for letting out another primal cry he punched the air his heart still pounding from the fight the watcher had been good no question but hed been better and if he was better then nothing in veldaren could stop them not when the suns came in from mordeina slipping through every crack and window the city was ripe for the taking within days they would pluck it from the soft hands of the current guilds and in an iron fist show all of dezrel who should truly be feared when the sun went down it wasnt thren it wasnt the watcher it was him when word reached antonil he pushed aside his morning meal and hurried to his room a knot in his stomach he put on his tunic with trembling hands over it went his armor needing the hard metal against his body to feel safe if it were trueif the watcher were dead he didnt want to think about it didnt want to acknowledge the cold truth victor had already stirred them into a frenzy with the watcher gone his ability to keep the peace whether it was symbolic or real was over antonil sergan said spotting him as he exited the castle i have matters to attend to antonil said not slowing the kings looking for you sergan said hes talking about calling in soldiers from all corners of dezrel even leaving his throne tosir please listen to me it sounds like edwin needs comforting antonil said spinning about and grabbing his friend by the shoulders shame you werent able to catch me before i left the castle sergan swallowed and his jaw clenched understood sir he said in peace and without escort antonil passed through the streets he looked like any other guard and earned himself hardly a second glance ears open he listened to the conversations the hushed whispers of the marketplace all wondered the same thing the watcher was dead what did that mean a few were glad and some blamed all the bloodshed on him but most understood most remembered the chaos of threns decadelong personal war antonil passed through the western gates of the city then hooked off the beaten path it wasnt often he went to the eschaton mercenaries only when he needed a matter dealt with quickly and quietly but this was something he had to know rumors and questions would not suffice nor would he entrust this knowledge to a messenger either eyes downcast he approached their tower along the edge of the kings forest pausing a moment before the door he took a breath then knocked i am sir antonil and i come to he hesitated a moment i come to speak with the watcher the door opened halfway and tarlak peered out from within you alone the wizard asked i am good then come in antonil stepped into the wellfurnished bottom floor of the tower a fire burned low in their fireplace their blacksmith brug sat beside it a full mug of ale sitting ignored beside him as he stared into the fire both the priestess and the watcher were gone you must know why i am here antonil said as the door shut behind him i know tarlak said as he headed toward the stairs follow me on the fifth floor tarlak opened the door and they stepped into the sparse room of the watcher he lay on his bed pale eyes closed a blanket pulled all the way up to his neck his hood was off and antonil looked upon his face he was a handsome man and that made his sickly look all the more noticeable beside his bed sat delysia dark circles under her eyes blood covered her white robes try not to disturb him the priestess said he needs his sleep so hes alive antonil asked trying to keep his relief in check barely tarlak said his voice low per delysias request weve been out the past few nights trying to find this widow killer at alyssa gemcrofts expense last night haern got himself in a fight with whom i have no idea throw a dart into a crowd and odds are high youll hit someone who wants him dead it took antonil a moment to realize the wizard had given him the watchers true name did that signify their trust or how much he was truly worried for his friend of course antonil had already seen his facedid his name really matter he looked to the wounded man repeated the name in his head haerna simple earthy name for some reason hed always imagined the watcher coming from a line of kings or assassins but carrying the name of poor farmers howd he survive antonil asked rumors are saying his killer watched him die who tarlak asked his voice rising his fingers twitched and they sparked with fire who do they say it was his name is grayson i know little more than that tarlak nodded repeating the name as he looked down at haern if you pull down his covers youll see burn marks around his middle finger it was a ring i had brug make for him if he ever got in trouble all he had to do was break the gem on top and id know where he was sort of like a beacon found him hiding on a rooftop down in the southern district bleeding like a stuck pig how bad are his wounds they would have been fatal delysia said slowly standing she looked beyond exhausted whoever this grayson is he was right to think him dead hed been stabbed through the side pierced his lung so that it was filling up with blood something also hit the back of his head and hard if i hadnt been there if id shown up even a minute later she fell silent looked back to where haern lay asleep tarlak hugged her kissed her forehead sometimes it pays to have a priestess of ashhur as a little sister he said forcing a smile delysia smiled back then took her seat once more at his bedside tarlak took antonil by the arm and led him from the room how long until hes better antonil asked as the door shut behind them dels been praying at his side every few hours tarlak said shes a miracle worker but this is taxing her far more than id like by the time we found him i honestly thought haern was dead itll take two days maybe three before hes a shadow of his former self thats two to three days too long antonil said as they returned to the bottom floor everyone thinks this grayson killed him the truce between the guilds and the trifect was already fraying it is all but torn without him what do you want me to do tarlak asked his temper flaring prop him up with some rope and dance him about the rooftops hes not leaving that bed announce to the city youve seen him hes alive and well and that you expect everything to go on as normal they wont believe me and you know it then get every soldier out into the streets because tonights going to be anarchy will you two shut your traps brug called from over by the fire making it hard for a man to enjoy his drink tarlak looked away as if ashamed antonil frowned and felt the same forgive me he said i only fear for the people i must protect i understand tarlak said whatever peace of mind this gives you just know well be out there tonight doing what we can just endure and mitigate this when haerns fine and well hell come storming into the underworld like a demonspawn of the abyss making every one of them cowardly buggers regret celebrating the watchers death antonil nodded giving the wizard a halfsmile youre a good man tarlak he said ill do what i can to make sure the kings treasury pays you well thought never crossed my mind tarlak said giving him a wink good luck and pray to ashhur we escape this madness unscathed antonil bowed low then stepped out as the door shut behind him he saw a strange woman sitting crosslegged just off the path her dress was plain simple but it looked poorly fitted as if never worn by her before she had olive skin and hair cut short two daggers twirled in her hands does he live she asked him antonils hand drifted to the hilt of his sword who he asked the woman stared at him her head tilted to one side haern she said at last im a friend knowing his name had to mean something antonil decided though he still kept his hand on the hilt hes alive but hurt he said i dont know how long until he recovers the woman nodded stood her daggers slipped into her sash i will try to quell the rumors she said but it will not matter they want to believe hes dead even if for only a night blood will spill when the sun sets guard captain do what you must to make it of the underworld and not the innocent lazily she stood and began walking toward the city antonil waited not wanting to be near her as he traveled something about her wasnt quite right shaking his head he banished the thoughts and headed down the path seeing no sign of her upon reaching the gates of veldaren he saluted the guards and denied their offer of an escort antonil was not yet ready to return to the castle instead he hurried to victors tavern where he was allowed entrance with hardly a glance over inside victor sat at a table a map of veldaren unrolled before him sef sat beside him pointing at various districts and muttering upon antonils entrance they both stood forgive my intrusion antonil said im sure youve heard the talk of the day we have said victor i hate to do this but my guards will not be enough i dont know what coin i can guarantee but save your words victor said sitting back down at the table my men will be out there and i with them well do everything we can to save this city you wont be doing this alone thank you antonil said feeling a brief glimmer of hope between the eschaton the city guard and now victors men they just might endure i am relieved to hear it you shouldnt have doubted in the first place victor said even if you never asked id still be out there you should know that by now antonil im here for you for all of the city by my life or death we will see brighter days antonil bowed low convinced of the mans sincerity and honored by it the watcher is alive he said before leaving we only need to buy him time thats good victor said i feared his death would one day tear down everything but i thought it many years in the distance shame on him for giving us such a scare ill have harsh words for him the next time we meet i daresay i might even yell and call him selfish for nearly dying on us so early the lord grinned and antonil grinned back protect the peace he said you as well antonil left and finally ready he went to the castle to endure his kings frightened rants and calls to action tarlak adjusted his hat smoothed out his robes and made sure his bag of spell components was fully stocked in case he needed some of his trickier spells taking in a deep breath he let it out and then stepped into haerns room delysia still sat at the edge of his bed her red hair a rumpled mess she saw him straightened up are you leaving she asked suns almost set the party should start soon enough his sister nodded ill get ready she said tarlak took another deep breath this was the conversation hed been dreading youre not going he said delysias eyes narrowed and he saw her stubborn streak surfacing i am not afraid she said nor am i helpless you need all the help you can get tonight and you know it i will not sit idly by while you risk your lives thats not it tarlak said sitting down at the edge of haerns bed he gestured to haern who still slept youre needed here if you get hurt or captured then his recovery will only take longer not sure how this happened but haerns the most important man in the city right now weve got to get him up and stabbing people with the pointy end of those sabers he pulled off his hat ran a hand through his hair besides sis im already in over my head haerns the one who knows these people who their leaders are what theyll do i just plan on roasting anyone who looks at me funny and praying to ashhur that i got a bad guy delysia shifted so she sat beside him and he wrapped his arm about her im tired of this room she said letting out a tired laugh i know you dont look too good either she elbowed him and he mussed her hair in return their cheer was forced and it died quickly tarlak looked to haern and he felt the weight of the night pressing on him i think hell wake soon he said someone should be here when he does and i think hell be happiest to see you let him know whats happening hell try to be stupid and leave the tower before hes ready so dont let him sway you with his masculine charms delysia kissed his cheek ill be praying for you she said thanks ill need the help and dont you worry me and brugll be back by dawn he waved goodbye then climbed down the stairs to where brug waited the man was trying to adjust his platemail and grumbling all the while be hard to sneak up on them with you making a ruckus tarlak said earning him a glare you see this armor its perfect made it myself no daggers slipping between these creases rather be last to the fight and live than first and dead how much all that weighs there wont be a fight left by the time you arrive anywhere brug shrugged ill still be alive tarlak chuckled couldnt argue with that you ready brug gave his breastplate one more hard twist then readied his punch daggers lead the way magey or are we taking a portal were walking tarlak said expect a long night ahead of us and need to conserve every shred of energy i have brug grunted del not coming shes staying with haern so just you and me against the world eh brug asked a cocky grin spreading across his face tarlak nodded looks like ill have to rely on you to keep them off me must say brug i think i miss haern already haern felt the darkness peeling away into layers of dreams that came and went within were friends and foes even those long dead as the dreams faded he realized he slumbered and a pain in his head suddenly roared to life slowly he opened his eyes almost regretting the return his skull throbbed and the pain in his side was frightening in its strength he tried to remember where he was what he was doing he was on a rooftop hiding from his unknown assailant no there werent any stars so where haern he knew that voice something soft and warm took his hand and he looked down delysias hand it was her face he saw next tears in her eyes del he said and despite his pain his exhaustion he smiled you found me my brother did to be fair how do you feel like i was run through by a bull do you have any water a moment later she handed him a glass he tried to sit up but the movement was unbearable carefully he lay back down and sipped the cold water it felt divine on his parched throat how long he asked setting it aside almost a full day you lost a lot of blood as well as took a vicious hit to your head yeah haern said the attack replaying over and over in his mind i remember that felt like an ox kicked me could hardly see straight afterward wheres tarlak he saw a shadow cross over her face dont worry about that right now you need to rest haern frowned something wrong is he all right she nodded but still refused to say anything he tried to think through his headache hed been bleeding inches from death by the time he fled from his attacker what was the point what was the goal and if tarlak was out and about what for hes not searching for the widow he said youd tell me that whats going on del she dipped a washcloth in a basin at her feet then wiped his forehead the cold water felt glorious and he tried to relax as she dipped it again this time moving it across his neck the man who attacked you she said hesitantly his name is grayson he told all the guilds that hed killed you and they believed him haern felt his blood chill how bad is it out there he asked do you even know she shook her head clenched her teeth into the basin went the washcloth i can see the fires from the window she said beyond thati dont know haern curled his hands into fists as his heart pounded a bright light flashed across his eyes and his headache intensified tenfold he clenched his eyes shut let out a gasp immediately delysias hands were upon his face still cold from the water he heard whispers of a prayer and a distant ringing of an unearthly bell waiting out the pain he focused on her touch until at last her fingers pulled away and the pain with it i know you were stabbed deep he heard her say but the blow to your head worries me more i never saw this when at the temple but i did hear of warriors who suffered symptoms such as yours it can last for days if not weeks or months you need to rest ill do what i can i promise the thought of enduring such headaches of feeling that pain throbbing from the top of his head down to his feet was horrifying he remembered how when fighting grayson his balance had consistently eluded him and at times his vision even went blank how could he be the watcher under such a handicap how could he tame the chaos tarlak was out there struggling against while he lay there stricken he was right haern said his voice a harsh whisper damn it he was right who she asked victor he said this would happen he knew id fail like this one day he knew it i was a fool to think i could control them to think i could do this forever a sudden cough hit him and he turned to one side each sharp breath hurt and he coughed louder harder blood spat across his white sheets the rest dribbling down his lip shit haern said seeing it he lay back down and closed his eyes as he felt the beginning of another headache forming tears swelled and he was too sick to stop them delysias cloth went back to work cleaning away the blood even dabbing at his tears what am i doing he wondered aloud was it ever right it isnt my place to tell you delysia said but i dont think youre a fool i dont think youre a failure youre allowed to err haern no one would believe you human otherwise and what if tarlak dies out there tonight does that make me even more human it was a cheap blow but it was the truth and what weighed most heavily on his mind it should be him out there bleeding and dying to protect his city hed given his life away as an orphaned child swore it while watching the connington mansion burn years ago during the bloody kensgold he could have kept killing he could have continued his attempts to wipe them all out but instead hed forced peace a fools peace the weight of it solely on his shoulders and now it was breaking and it seemed all the world but him had seen it coming stop this delysia said her voice was soft wavering from the anger and determination behind it this isnt you i didnt sit at your bedside praying so you could wallow in misery and doubt i didnt do it because you are a fool or i feared for my brothers safety then why in answer she knelt down over him her hair cascading across his face and then pressed her lips to his his eyes still closed it took him a moment to realize what was happening he almost resisted almost turned away but could not he kissed back gently lifting a hand so he could touch her face his mind whirled too sick and tired to think of anything beyond the softness of her lips when she pulled back he finally dared open his eyes to look she was tired her eyes swollen and black from exhaustion but through it all he saw a strength greater than him and he clutched her hand tightly as if to never let it go the world will continue without you she told him people will kill steal bleed and die whether you live or not stop judging yourself by what youve done with your swords if you would despair remember those who love you let your life by judged by that instead do you love me delysia he whispered she met his eye and he saw the hardness in her soften she nodded and he reached for her she curled against his chest and he let his hands surround her let his face press against her hair as he kept his breathing controlled so he would not cough blood upon her together they lay there not moving not talking the comfort of their presence was enough i dont know if i can haern said after a time ive hurt everyone i loved and i cant hurt you delysia i could never live if i did i know she whispered but ill still be here i always will be a memory came to him from when they were just children and he still in the care of his father together theyd met in secret on a rooftop for thren had denied him any knowledge of faith or love all to make him the perfect killer with delysia haern had glimpsed a life with meaning with purposeonly to have thren shoot delysia with an arrow her bleeding body falling into his arms that shed survived at all was a miracle a parting gift from another woman hed loved before thren killed her as well he thought of that moment of how his cruel life had so vehemently rejected such a light as hers he couldnt bear the thought of it again he couldnt hold her in his arms and watch her die whatever good in him existed would break did she know that did she understand let me sleep he said her fingers went to stroke his cheek but hesitated just before before she could pull away he leaned forward forcing the touch turning his face so she could cup him with her hand she said nothing only held him for a moment before leaving him alone in his room to sleep but instead of sleeping he turned to one side and watched the distant flicker of flame that spread throughout his city burning away like a hundred candles lit in memorial these damn idiots have a funny way of celebrating brug muttered as he kicked a corpse that lay at his feet tarlak had to agree whatever they dont want theyre burning tarlak said rubbing his throbbing temples good thing they want nearly everything the two stood near the center of town before a home with wrecked windows and a smashed in door tarlak could only begin to guess why theyd chosen that particular place the owner lay at the entrance dragged out and throat cut theyd arrived too late to do much of anything other than give the dead man vengeance three dead wolvesjust a fraction of the guilds roaming the night its all meager pickings brug said wiping blood off his punch daggers been out here for hours and only smalltime stuff one of thems got to have something bigger planned maybe the conningtons place or alyssas might not have any place big to hit tarlak said walking aimlessly north both have got their places crawling with guards its the rest of the city thats vulnerable but victor and antonil have got their men running round like mad still a big city brug grumbled tarlak shot his friend a look you sound disappointed brug shrugged was hoping to gut a bunch of thieves only seems fair given what they did to haern instead theyd rather set fires burn down some stalls and then run like cowards pathetic thieves tend to not be known for their bravery they followed the road listening for sounds of combat and keeping their eyes open for signs of fire much as he might mock brug for it he understood how he felt theyd expected far more chaos a true call to arms in celebration of the watchers death the night was half over and all theyd seen was little worse than the food riots theyd had in years prior maybe all the patrols are actually working tarlak said voicing his thoughts havent seen anything by the spider guild brug said ash guild tore them up pretty bad they might be sitting this one out brug laughed yeah i believe that tarlak shrugged can always hope right a deep explosion roared from near the castle hard enough to shake the ground they stood upon brug tapped his daggers together nope they hurried north passing by wrecked stalls broken windows and dark alleys that all seemed filled with men and women lurking within the shadows tarlak couldnt help but feel like they were waiting for something just stalling for the true celebration if anything perhaps they were wondering if the watcher would appear and prove the rumors untrue every spreading fire every theft unpunished only confirmed his absence but then again that explosion had been really loud they rushed faster and tarlak saw smoke billowing near the castle makes no sense he muttered why attack the castle not the castle brug said and thats when tarlak realized what theyd done stepping out to the wide space before the castle where victor had held his interrogations he found the area filled with rubble and dirt several guards lay about all dead the west side of the citys prison had blown open and tarlak recognized a magical explosion when he saw one what could be more symbolic than freeing all captive members of their guilds from a prison too much time had passed between the explosion and their arrival whatever combat had taken place was long over men in tattered clothes flooded out with a few armed and dressed in the colors of the hawk guild amid their ranks revealing the guild responsible with the guard scattered across the city too few must have been here to stop them brug said clearly nervous at seeing so many tarlak nodded in agreement he lifted his hands let fire surround them stop as many as possible he said will do brug charged ahead trusting his platemail to keep him safe the prisoners and hawks were fleeing west away from their road knowing he needed to slow them to have a chance tarlak hurled a ball of fire over their heads detonating it in the road beyond it set fire to the street as well as a nearby home tarlak winced but figured one more blaze wouldnt hurt the city too badly he hoped their route cut off the prisoners veered various directions many having to turn about and retrace their steps to find another road tarlak clapped his hands and a bolt of thunder struck in their center killing two more important was the confusion the light and sound made giving brug his chance to reach them he barreled through their numbers head low helmet leading he punched and kicked with wild abandon tarlak knew his friend was not the best of fighters but what he lacked in skill he made up for in eagerness and stupidity he didnt try to block attacks nor avoid blows just let them hit his armor and slide off blood soon covered his punch daggers the escaped prisoners fled but the hawks among them converged daggers and shortswords ready keep em busy tarlak said hurling bolts of ice from his palms they slammed into the thinning crowd bowling over men and women and then freezing them to the ground a glance behind saw a squad of soldiers rushing their way tarlak grinned glad for the help brug wouldnt last much longer with a few wellplaced spells he flung small stones at blinding speeds striking the hawks that surrounded him and knocking them unconscious or dead then the soldiers were rushing past the symbol on their tunics that of the kane family it seemed they were smart enough to realize who was friend and who was foe ignoring him and brug they spread out to chase down the thieves tarlak ended his casting watched as the soldiers pulled two thieves off of brug who other than a multitude of bruises was no worse for wear one of the men gathered a group of five and then passed by abandoning the chase and tarlak recognized his face well victor he asked victor turned hand on his sword until he realized who it was the people here are in your debt victor said saluting quickly before hurrying on wait tarlak said falling in step whats going on you need to help us find the escaped alyssa gemcrofts mansion is on fire victor said over his shoulder what riot broke out completely surrounded their estate i went for the castle first for the king and his guard are of more importance time is not on our side wizard and unless you have a spell to turn it backward this night will not end well its the thief war all over again gods damn it i should have returned years earlier tarlak glanced back saw brug hurrying to catch up sighing the wizard began casting a spell if you want to get there now then come with me he said as a portal ripped open before him without waiting for their answer he stepped through to see the chaos that had overtaken the gemcroft mansion zusa watched from the window of their second story room as the crowd gathered about their gates alyssa stood beside her a cold expression on her face do they blame me for this she asked have they not forgiven me for the chaos my mercenaries caused people have long memories when they are suffering zusa said scanning the crowd she could not hear their individual cries but she spotted those most vehement and shouting the loudest a few wore guild colors all the same the spider guild is behind this she said thren is turning their fear to his own ends it doesnt matter who is behind it melody said she stood at the other set of windows in the room nathaniel at her side they wont harm us no matter who it is i know it my guards will be enough alyssa said and zusa caught the way her eyes narrowed when seeing how melody tightly clutched nathaniels hand in hers they once tried to burn my home to the ground they failed and they will fail again of course they will zusa said kissing alyssas cheek you have me she pushed open the window and leapt through the cold wind blowing across her hair landing with a roll she sprinted until she reached a tree climbing its limbs with ease she neared the top and hidden among the leaves scanned the crowd anew taking in numbers and weaponry they were in the hundreds far outnumbering alyssas house guards they were poorly geared though very few wielding any sort of weaponry beyond a torch or a knife more worrisome though was how she saw more than just the spider guilds cloaks among them lurking at the outer edges of the crowd hawks wolves serpentsit seemed every guild but the ash had come to play many more foes might be hidden in the nearby homes and alleys and could strike from any angle so far their gate held despite the throng that pressed against it torches could do little to the stone fence surrounding the estate so long as they did not bring out ladders and rope or found a way to no she whispered daverik no she could not move too stunned by the betrayal four faceless women leapt over the crowd their gray cloaks billowing behind them they sailed over the fence with ease landing among the handful of guards at the gate three of the four formed a perimeter cutting and slashing with their daggers shadows bled from their bodies giving them an unearthly terrifying image the fourth slashed the lock with both blades black sparks fell to the ground the women leapt away just like that the gates were open and the furious crowd poured in like a wave the house guards closed the gap as quickly as they could their shields locking together and their swords stabbing but they would soon be overrun zusa knew she must help them but there was no way she could the four faceless had rushed the mansion leaping at various windows and smashing through she thought of them running the halls searching their daggers eager to take away the life of her love she thought of daveriks warning hed told her to stay away hed known this would happen damn you she said as she leapt from the tree arms wide she sailed across the yard propelled forward with strength born of magic karaks magic which she would turn against his blind foolish servants alyssa had closed the window but zusa crossed her arms at the last moment and crashed right on through glass cut her skin tore at her wrappings but she ignored the pain rolling to a stop on one knee she looked to alyssa saw the growing fear in her eyes its not lost zusa said rising not yet the door opened but it was not a faceless only lord gandrem in his polished armor in his left hand he held a sharpened sword milady he said tilting his head toward melody gemcroft might i have the honor of standing at your side and protecting you with my life its only an honor if you keep her alive zusa said by the window now window do as she says please alyssa said zusa was glad to see that nathaniel was back at her side john glanced between them still clearly confused but he accepted the order of his host he stood before the window zusa had smashed his weapon drawn and overlooked the fight below putting her back to them zusa closed the door to the room and leaned her side against it closing her eyes she focused her senses listened for the slightest sound that might reveal their presence she heard screams from all about the mansion servants and guards fighting fleeing dying getting closer from the other side she heard a soft exhalation of air zusa somersaulted as the door was kicked open she was curling in midair when the faceless woman rushed in searching melody screamed nathaniel cried out before the woman could attack zusa landed between her and alyssa stay back she screamed at john who had turned to help stay at the window the faceless lowered her body tensed for a lunge zusa recognized those hazel eyes that small frame theres ezra thought zusa where are the others ezra leapt at melody but it was a feint and she curled back in zusa met her charge fully expecting it she knew ezras hatred of her knew that she would attack no one else while in her presence their daggers collided engaged in a dance zusa knew she would win like she had before but if the previous defeat weighed on ezras mind it didnt show for she pressed her attack with an unexpected ferocity zusa parried twice tried to knee her foe but ezra shifted aside zusa continued on rolling until she hit the wall then used it to kick off they met again their bodies contorted and twisted in ways only they unarmored and limber could do steel rang against steel they collided together elbowing striking each twisting to absorb the hits of the other as their daggers continued to dance seeking an opening zusa found it first her dagger slashed across ezras thigh as the injured woman tried to retreat zusa somersaulted foot catching the underside of her chin ezras head snapped back and she fell rolling on instinct to avoid any followup attacks when she came to her feet blood spread across the wrappings of her face she hesitated and her eyes flicked once to the window for zusa that was all she needed she was halfway there when another faceless came leaping feet first through the shattered window lord gandrem was unprepared for the attack which caught him full in the chest he stumbled back but to his credit he kept swinging his long blade forcing the new attacker to keep her distance zusa didnt slow in the slightest in her approach and when close enough she leapt slamming into the other woman with her shoulder together they tumbled out the window falling still holding the other tight zusa closed her eyes they were falling at night toward a ground littered with a hundred shadows cast by the few torches of the mob shed done this before but never at such a great distance never with another demanding the power whether it be from karak or herself she focused on a corner of the room shed just leapt from where the shadows were deepest shadows were but doorways to her if she was strong enough and instead of hitting the ground she and her opponent fell right through they reappeared in the room falling from the corner zusa twisted so she landed on top her daggers piercing the faceless through the breast and throat abandoning the blades so she could continue moving without slowing she swept the feet out from ezra who had turned on john following her departure john as surprised as he looked was still no fool his sword stabbed down but ezra was too fast spinning on her back the stab missed and with impressive strength she pushed off in a backward somersault zusa kneed and kicked her felt bones break but still the woman made it past crumpling at the door to the room and at that door appeared two more faceless shadows rolling off them like water zusa looked to her daggers still embedded in the corpse you will not win tonight she said shifting so she stood beside john the two of them protecting alyssa and her family karak has decreed you an enemy of the faith ezra said standing with the help of the other two her hazel eyes glared with a feverish intensity your fate is already sealed without your faith you are nothing strange for a god of order to ally with thieves and rioters alyssa said what have i done to earn your ire they received no answer the three faceless fanned out forcing the group tighter against the window zusa reached out a hand to john her eyes never leaving her foes cut my palm she said john did so though he clearly did not understand why as the blood poured across her hand zusa clutched her cloak her body ached from the blows theyd exchanged but despite it she grinned you think i am nothing she asked as her gray cloak turned the color of blood it spreading like dye in a glass of water you think i must beg karak for strength come faceless come slaves i will show you what power i have in unison the three attacked and zusa met them head on clutching an edge of her cloak she twisted and spun weaving through their thrusts and slashes so that none could cut her deep her cloak itself billowed and curled as if it were a sentient thing its edges hardened like steel whenever touched by the womens daggers zusa kicked to her left spun low then slammed both her fists against ezras chest the others tried to trap her but she vaulted high landing by the corpse of the one shed killed yanking free her daggers she leapt fully into the offensive her cloak was just another weapon and it cut into their skin like razor wire the faceless retreated parried and dodged their blood covered the floor they all forgot john gandrem all but zusa who forced one of the faceless into a retreat his way his sword pierced her back punched out the other side the woman convulsed on the blade and then died only two left and they were in full retreat now fleeing to the door zusa let them for she felt her strength ebbing and a headache growing deep in her forehead with their absence zusas cloak returned to its dull gray color and she limped over to alyssa a dozen shallow cuts bled all across her body youre safe zusa said and she smiled alyssa caught her when she leaned forward and zusa accepted the embrace the sound of combat continued unabated despite the emptiness of the room looking out the window zusa saw the house guards completely overwhelmed only a small force holding fast at the crowded entryway before the mansion door the rest were dead or had retreated all the way into the building windows smashed in from all directions and nothing could be done to stop the rioters from pouring in and looters rushing out with treasures in hand the castle guard will arrive soon john said wiping blood from his sword surely they will not allow the city is like it is because the city guard has allowed it melody said stepping away so she too could watch from the window zusa pulled free of alyssas embrace kissed her forehead shut and bar the door she said to john without waiting for a response she leapt once more from the window the many below were just unarmed men angry confused whipped into a fury by the thief guilds despite this she had no pity for them as she descended a whirling tornado of blades they trespassed upon land not theirs seeking to take what never belonged to them and snuff out the life of those she loved let them die let them bleed out upon the grass and that is what they did those that did not scatter in time life after life she ended losing herself in the flow of combat at first most fled from her unable to overwhelm her with numbers and unable to defeat her with their simple weaponry zusa cut a bloody swathe toward the guards at the door who despite their many wounds held firm go within she screamed at them protect those inside i will hold the door none looked happy with the command but they knew her closeness to alyssa and the danger her daggers possessed retreating inside only zusa remained in the yard turning about she stared down the rioters many had begun to flee overwhelmed by the carnage strewn about the place the house guards had done their work well men and women still rushed the mansion but most avoided her choosing to crawl through the glass of broken windows than challenge her blades zusa shook her head almost disappointed but at least the mansion would be safe the remaining house guards could handle a few looters and this city is in the throes of a new birth boomed a deep voice outside the complex zusa looked saw a large man dressed in clothes outside the norms of veldaren a triangular hat on his head his left ear glittered with many rings running up and down the cartilage that there is blood and pain should not only be expected but welcome our slavery ends tonight the watcher is dead and the false peace of this land breaks destroy those who once pretended to be your lords as he spoke men of all guilds gathered around him having hidden in alleys and homes to watch the carnage while letting the hungry frustrated and destitute do their work for them they were at least two hundred perhaps more and they brandished crossbows and daggers laced with poison zusa stood before them her whole body trembling with every tired breath whoever the strange man was zusa marked him let his face burn into her memory it would be him that she hunted down even if she must return from the dead to seek her vengeance those who pass through those gates die zusa cried back pointing a dagger her voice seemed miniscule compared to the giant that led them come then if you are so eager to enter the abyss with so many against her and the city guard nowhere in sight they were not afraid they rushed in all but their leader who remained back to watch zusa flung open the door and pressed her back against it using it as a shield as the crossbow bolts came flying they thudded like a heavy rain zusa closed her eyes felt tears in them damn it not like this what theyd do to alyssa to nathaniel when the footsteps were almost near she kicked the door back open and charged willing to bleed to die to keep them safe for just a minute more but to her surprise she was not alone landing before the door his body shrouded in gray cloaks was a man that should not have been able to leave his bed let alone tear into the forces assembled against them haern zusa asked in her brief pause before she rushed to join him they were terribly outnumbered but they moved through their ranks with blinding speed taking advantage of the sudden doubt and terror the watchers presence inspired he should have been dead this was their night to celebrate his execution to have him appear sabers hungry suddenly put every plan of theirs in doubt after about thirty dead their progress slowed shock turned to fury and desperation and now it was their turn to retreat weaving side to side to avoid the occasional crossbow bolt instead of putting their backs to the door they fled inside and slammed it shut needing the brief reprieve to catch their breaths zusa looked to the watcher still unable to believe it he looked similar had a similar build and height but something was wrong much of his face was hidden in the shadows of his hood and even his grin had that same amused yet tired edge to it his hands she realized they were older more calloused and scarred who are you she asked you cant be him i am who i need to be said the imposter he kept his voice low but it was rougher than haerns whisper or would you prefer to fight them alone the barred door halted them only a moment the remaining house guards had retreated further into the house most likely to the upper floors where they could narrow down the conflict to a few chokepoints at the stairs this left the windows unguarded and the thieves leapt through them in a sudden wave zusa took one side the watcher the other she parried a clumsy thrust kicked her shin against the mans groin and then slashed out his throat as he doubled over two more neared and she flung herself at them her exhaustion increasing her recklessness both scored minor wounds but she accepted them to cut them both down each of her daggers burying into a throat an explosion roared from the outside and suddenly there were no more coming through the windows whats going on zusa asked turning the watcher stood at a window grinning not everyone is so willing to play along with graysons farce he said not understanding she opened the door to look out lord victor fought at the entrance to the mansion grounds a squad of his men surrounding him amid his group she saw the yellow robes of the wizard tarlak powerful magic flew from his fingertips bolts of lightning and boulders of ice slamming across the corpsecovered yard the various guilds turned on them hoping to bury them quickly but then the ash guild arrived as well somehow theyd gotten over the wall and they methodically moved through the yard wiping out those who neared dark fire leapt from deathmasks hands and veliana shredded terrified men with her daggers whirling about them were the twins preventing anyone from flanking lets rub salt in their wounds the watcher said rushing out zusa followed and together they chased down thieves who knew not where to retreat for they had enemies on all sides eventually they fled toward the entrance enduring tarlaks assault so they might push back against victors men and dash for the safety of the dark streets the watcher leapt to the wall and climbed up balancing himself so he stood in the gaps of the spikes without harm as the chaos died down and men fled in all directions the watcher lorded over it all let every eye look upon him zusa sheathed her daggers the battle over as the ash guild met up with victors men the watcher leapt to the street and vanished deathmask gave a mock salute and then he too made his exit zusa waited feeling so tired that standing seemed a burden as victor made his approach we are safe she told him my thanks to your arrival i dont know how you lived victor said glancing about gods it reeks of shit and blood youd think we fought a war hundreds of corpses all throughout the yard and mansion it would take months to clean it all she knew and to completely banish the odor we did fight a war zusa said looking up to the window to see alyssa peering down but we won if you say so tarlak said his attention still drawn outward she knew what he had to be thinking it seems the watcher is not dead after all she said baiting out a response seems like it tarlak said but she heard the doubt in his voice the confusion it was no ploy of his whoever the imposter was the eschaton were not involved what did that mean i must go to my mistress zusa said bowing low i should return to my patrols victor said though i think the bulk of the trouble has passed give alyssa my regards tarlak tipped his hat and then they trudged off with their soldiers leaving alyssa to deal with the mess zusa tried not to think about it entering through the door she gave a quick scan of the mansion looking upon the destruction paintings were slashed or stolen furniture broken every shred of silver or gold from the candles to the dinnerware was taken the bodies of servants and guards lay in every room side by side with thieves and looters at the foot of the stairs she found alyssa come to survey the damage well rebuild replace it all zusa offered your loved ones survived that is what matters alyssa slowly wrapped her arms about her leaned her head against her breast and cried ten years she whispered gods help us ten years not this time zusa said stroking her hair not this time it was shallow comfort a weak promise but right then she had little else to offer grayson knew he should be furious by the defeat but he was far too amused for that hed gathered together men of all guilds united with promises of the watchers death and a luxurious future at each guild hed been treated like a prince and cheered with raised glasses despite them knowing so little about him only a few had glanced his way with untrusting eyes realizing what the others did not he was a fearsome man and a thief but a thief from a distant nation and of foreign guilds foreign guilds eyeing veldaren with hungry mouths open to the watchers killer said one of the members of the spider guild as grayson stepped into the guilds tavern the man lifting his glass in a mocking toast grayson grinned at him the look sapping away whatever cheer the man had i stuck my sword through his gut and out his back grayson said perhaps this watcher of yours is a devil after all no man lives through that the thief was smart enough to say nothing only shrug and resume drinking still grinning grayson looked about the tavern counting numbers a pathetic remnant of what theyd been especially compared to when he and thren had been working together so many years ago hardly a merchant would quake at seeing the ragtag group of fifteen men drinking and bandaging wounds thren would recruit like mad to replace his numbers but it would take time with so much death and conflict and so little coin in return hed gain only the desperate and delusional now that he thought of it he found thren drinking with a group of four in a far corner stealing a drink from the man who had mocked him grayson guzzled it down as he walked over to threns table slamming his empty cup atop the hard wood three of them jumped but not thren so how goes your night grayson asked grin spreading as poorly as your ill conceived plan thren said leaning back and looking as if he had not a care in the world he couldnt pull off the image completely though thren was never much of a bluffer grayson knew never had been and never would be his eyes always gave him away too much intensity that so grayson glared down at the man opposite thren who glanced at his guild leader go check and see if any others have made it back martin thren said martin shrugged and gave up his seat so grayson could take it i must say i thought things would go differently grayson said his elbows on the table with the rioters loosening up the guard shouldve had easy pickings sadly looks like the looters got the bulk and we just shed the blood blood that shouldnt have been shed thren said tilting his head slightly his eyes narrowed you are no master here no leader whatever your influence with the suns this is veldaren not mordeina dont remember you forbidding it grayson said and he laughed at the way thren twitched he was furious he could tell but something kept him in check was it the way the attack had failed perhaps but with his guild suffering such losses that couldnt be enough had to be something more had to be so where were you during all this grayson asked looking over to the bar and frowning when he realized he would have to fetch a drink himself with you at our side i daresay we still might have broken through with ease might have even taken down the watcher thren stared him in the eye not moving not answering so smug it was answer enough yeah guess its foolish of me to think youd have helped grayson said standing you couldnt kill the watcher all these years doubt youd be able to now shit youd probably take his place if you could it was as direct a challenge he could make without proof instead of rattling thren it only made him smile youve attempted to usurp control of my guild thren said as the thieves on either side of him stood reaching for their weapons you lied about killing the watcher and led my men to their deaths in a battle you had no stake in you are no longer welcome in my home go elsewhere old friend for you cannot stay here graysons hand drifted to his sword all about the tavern had gone deathly quiet hopelessly outnumbered grayson knew he could not win not then you fear me a threat yet cannot run so you would banish me instead he said you are a coward youve never had the strength to face an opponent that might defeat you keep pretending you are strong thats what you did when marion died why not continue thren was on his feet in a heartbeat shortswords drawn say it he said ice in his voice say what youve always wanted to say so i can kill you say what grayson asked purposefully putting his back to thren and walking for the door that you killed my sister i would if it was true but it aint he stopped at the door no one with the courage to get in his way he looked over his shoulder gave thren one last smirk she killed herself the day she married you the door slammed shut behind him and grayson laughed itd been so long hed forgotten how great it felt to raise the ire of one so focused and controlled but his humor hid the scars that grayson himself had nearly forgotten his poor marion in love with that fool now she was dead and all her sons as well all because of thren it would be such a pleasure killing him entertaining the image of him plunging his sword through threns throat grayson made his way toward the southern district he might be late but that was of little concern to him the others would not leave theyd need to hear of how things went whistling a tune he cut through the alleys until he found one in particular of little note but for the two men already there i thought you wouldnt show daverik said whys that asked grayson because of how complete your failure was said laerek tugging at the hem of his priestly robes grayson chuckled and shook his head laerek was his and daveriks liaison from the west speaking for the nameless man moving the various pieces in the game they currently played grayson was unaware of his full reasons but so long as his suns got to make their move on the streets of veldaren he really couldnt care less it was neither a failure nor so complete grayson said unafraid of laerek he was a wisp of a man thin his nose long and his tongue sharp he had no real power just a glorified messenger for someone who had the gold and influence to bend both the guilds of mordan and the priests of karak to his will all the guilds suffered tremendous casualties daverik said victors patrols kept them from causing too much chaos as for lady gemcrofts place well should have been there laerek grayson said crossing his arms and leaning against a wall dead as far as the eye could see doesnt matter that alyssa still lives her mansion is in pieces and the guilds are no threat to us anymore then who is a threat laerek asked the trifect still is daverik said and grayson noted the uncomfortable look on his face as he said it that and victor his arrival hascomplicated things trifect should have been taken care of laerek said you assured me your faceless could kill alyssa without difficulty there were complications complications grayson laughed out loud he means that devil woman in the gray cloak i watched her tear through her enemies like they were straw men love to have an hour with her in bed but so long as shes guarding alyssa i doubt anyones killing her laerek looked to daverik for confirmation who nodded she killed two of my faceless he said her name is zusa she was once a member of the faceless herself years ago then she needs to be eliminated laerek said if your faceless cannot handle her then perhaps i will send our third after her grayson grunted theyre calling him the widow now he said some sick joke he is not sure what you think hell accomplish against leave that to me laerek snapped grayson shrugged laerek had made it clear that there were three key players working together in veldaren two were grayson and daverik but as for the third hed never met him nor even seen his face he only knew what everyone else knew he killed members of the spider guild took their eyes and mocked them in rhymes written in their blood we have more problems to deal with than just victor and the trifect daverik said glancing up and down the alley the ash guild for whatever reason is actively working to protect victor the other is the eschaton mercenaries that wizard of theirs kept victor alive and their arrival turned the fight against us at the mansion the watcher is also in their pay assuming he glanced at grayson that hes still alive of course laerek nodded palm pressed against his mouth as he thought we have more enemies than allies he said at last looking up the guilds and the trifect will break each other in time its these interlopers that must be dealt with and how do you plan on doing that grayson asked going up to them and asking nicely to stay out of our way by hiring the bloodcrafts they are already here in neldar simply awaiting my orders that earned a surprised look from grayson you brought them all the way from mordeina i did laerek said given the scope of our ambitions i thought it likely we would need their help in some aspect especially with how much our plan relies on the abilities of a mudborn thief the bloodcrafts come highly regarded and their success is all but guaranteed grayson chuckled pulled his hat tighter on his head so his hands had something to do instead of throttling laerek for the mudborn comment if by success you mean killing their target and everyone remotely related to them then sure he said but the bloodcrafts arent exactly subtle neither are the eschaton or the ash daverik said grayson shrugged he had a point there hed seen the fire unleashed by that yellow bastards spells and pretty much everyone knew of the crater left by deathmask in the middle of the damn street continue on as we have laerek said grayson ready your men we must prepare this city as karak has demanded in this we cannot fail go and be blessed by the lions protection grayson didnt give a shit about the lions protection but his gold was real enough he tipped his hat then trudged off into the night laerek said he wanted the city prepared and somehow that involved plunging it into total chaos so be it with the guilds destroyed and the trifect weakened no one would have the strength to stop him didnt matter if laereks secret master wanted veldaren taken over to worship of karak or was planning some sort of war with one of the other three nations in mordeina grayson had overcome both wars and gods in veldaren he could do the same besides once the suns claimed the city laerek had an ugly surprise awaiting him if he thought he could still call grayson mudborn and live victor looked up at his tavern and sighed with relief hed left only a token guard and come morning he fully expected it to be a burned heap instead of safe and sound his head ached and his armor felt like it weighed a thousand pounds but the night was done the sun rose above the walls and at last he might have some rest get men sleeping in shifts all that you can he told sef well need to be rested for tonight theres no guarantee this one will be any better than the last course it wont sef said victor thought to reprimand him for the lack of respect then let it go they were all exhausted their nerves shot pulling off pieces of his armor victor strode into his tavern within were around thirty men and women people given shelter for fear of the guilds overnight itd been closer to a hundred crammed in there but most had work to do and mouths to feed cowering all day was just not an option a few looked his way and he nodded to them in return one in particular a man with long dark hair rose from his chair several of the guards reached for their weapons but the man lifted his hands to show he was unarmed a word with victor the man said i know things things youll pay much to know but i speak only to him two of the guards were on him then each grabbing an arm they looked to victor seeking confirmation one way or the other victor rubbed his eyes and stepped off the stairs to the higher floor his boots thudded in the crowded tavern come over here and tell me your name the guards brought him near the man bowed low i wont give you my name not with so many near he said but for the past six years i have served thren felhorn and the spider guild victor glanced at the people under his protection all watching with rapt attention he frowned check him thoroughly for weapons he told his guards then send him up they saluted and without another word victor climbed the stairs to his room hed planned to change completely but instead only removed his outer armor leaving on the inner padding despite it stinking of sweat and blood the washbasin had been filled recently steam still rising from the top he washed his hands and face the warm water feeling divine on his skin when the door opened he turned about and leaned against a wall of his room well were alone victor said still holding a washcloth in its folds was a slender dagger which he kept carefully hidden i assume this is when you try to kill me not at all said the man as the guards shut the door behind him killing isnt something im good at talking really and listening thats what i do my names alan pleasure to meet you at last victor youve caused quite a stir victor chuckled i think others have caused greater wasnt my men who stormed lady gemcrofts mansion last night no i do believe that was you alan shrugged i wasnt there myself told you killing aint my thing victor didnt care if he had or not and given how badly his bed was crying out for him he had no desire to argue why are you here alan he asked my time is short and my temper shorter speak your mind and then be gone victor noticed alan held a copper coin kept it turning between his thumb and forefinger a nervous tic perhaps i dont know what youve been hoping to accomplish alan said but i doubt last night was it if thren rallies the guilds were looking at another war thats something i dont want and truth be told most people dont want but so long as everyones scared of thren well hell bend people his way eventually a few rants a few murders and everyone will be foaming at the mouth hes good at that make your point thief victor said still holding the dagger tight my point fill my pockets with enough silver and ill tell you where he is not just him either the entire guild everyone knows the spider guild is responsible for the attack on alyssas and youre daft if you think the arrangement the watcher created will last one second beyond his death you want to stop this now before it gets out of hand then pay up and make your move victor frowned tried to think through his exhaustion the man was rightthe spider guild was widely being blamed for the attack and there didnt exist a parchment long enough to list all of threns crimes hed not made any significant move on thren yet because he wanted to weaken his guild and all the others as well letting them think hed only take the small timers and that his crusade was doomed to fail bought him precious time to slowly whittle away at their strength but now things had come to a head and blood soaked the streets when he first marched into the city hed sworn to never work with any thief but with such possible gain for so little can you promise hell be there victor asked you know i cant alan said but theres a good chance you got the guts to take it victor felt his pride being challenged the copper coin spun faster between alans fingers ill pay you thirty silver now thirty after we verify no alan said shaking his head all now or nothing to be honest victor i dont trust you to let me be after you have what you need you pay me i talk and then we never see each other again and what prevents me from imprisoning you now and torturing the information out of you alan smirked because that aint you is it heard a lot about what youre capable of but tortures not part of it and if you think you can make me sell you thren by tossing me in a cell well youre a damn fool pay me or watch veldaren burn victor rubbed the stubble growing on his face then pushed a knuckle against his lips at last he moved to the door walking past alan if there was to be any attack it was then but alan just let him by after a knock the door opened and the guard peered in bring me a bag of silver victor told him sixty pieces now hurry the guard snapped to attention when the door shut again victor turned to the thief now what he asked isnt it obvious alan said we wait and they did victor returning to his bed and setting down the cloth and dagger alan paced before him trying not to look nervous but seeming so anyway victor watched him at all times still not trusting him it burned his gut to pay for information that should have been given over freely but times were growing desperate another knock and then a guard entered holding a brown leather bag victor retrieved it then tossed it over to alan there he said now talk corner of iron and wheat alan said its made to look like an innthe thirsty mule everyone should be there recovering from last nights debacle now be a man of your word and let me pass victor sat down on his bed stretched his arms out at his sides go he said but before you dohow do i know you dont lie a faint smile tugged at the side of alans mouth theres easier ways to make money than this victor safer too go to the thirsty mule you wont be disappointed victor chuckled his hand slipped inside the washcloth grabbing the hilt of the dagger with a burst of speed he caught alan flatfooted slamming into him with his shoulder together they rammed against the door the tip of victors dagger pressing against the thiefs throat guards cried out from the other side but victor called them off with a word where is thren victor screamed into his face his dagger pressed harder against flesh threatening to pierce through at any moment where is he really i told you where he is alan insisted victor stared into his eyes daring him to lie to give the slightest twitch revealing his guilt one last time victor said his voice dropping whereisthren alan met his gaze and he leaned closer so that the dagger drew a drop of blood threaten all you want he said my words arent changing hes there victor let him go then shouted another order to his guards get out of here he said alan was all too eager to oblige with him gone victor tossed the dagger atop his dresser and then rubbed his eyes truth or lietruth or lie form an escort he said at last exiting his room and kissing goodbye his morning of rest i need to speak with antonil antonil met him in the castle courtyard looking as tired as victor felt good to see you escaped last night unscathed antonil said his clothes were clean but unkempt victor figured hed dressed quickly at his request most likely wanting the same sleep victor was denying himself a shame the rest of the city cannot say the same victor said clasping antonils hand in greeting please forgive me for interrupting your morning but i must act soon and i need the help of your guard a note of caution entered antonils words act on what i know where thren is victor said him and most likely the rest of his guild antonil turned aside and swore you realize what this will do he said i know this isnt some minor thief or merchant thren has killed kings before and yet still he lives victor said crossing his arms antonil frowned but could not argue that point pacing a few steps in either direction he mulled over the thought what is it you want he asked at last this is something we cannot fail between your city guard and my soldiers we can seal off a dozen streets and surround his hideout with a wall of swords and spears last night was the end of whatever peace veldaren has known thren will not let this pass how do you know that i heard nothing of thren last night nor did anyone report his actions to my guard victor shook his head hardly believing what he was hearing the man is a thief a criminal and a madman who has terrorized this city for years every shred of history says he will take this opportunity to make things worse and you want to argue about how in a single night no one happened to see him what are you afraid of what am i afraid of antonil stopped his pacing and stepped close you werent here at times i could barely patrol the streets because we were too busy pulling corpses out of homes and gutters i had to put men at every single window of the castle for edwin was convinced hed have his throat slit in the night no matter how bad the killings i could not get men to talk to me nor my guard to investigate thoroughly for doing so would just result in more dead every night it took a little piece of me to convince this city that just maybe they could sleep well despite it all and now i see the same chaos erupting before me and you call me a coward for fearing youll fan the flames instead of smothering them victor endured his rant and as memories flashed before his eyes he breathed in deeply to stop his fists from shaking i saw more than you think he told the guard captain i know all too well what veldaren was like but you misunderstand me i am doing this regardless of what you say all i ask for is your help if i must i will bear the burden on my shoulders alone damn it man antonil said my men are exhausted was there not enough death last night this time it was victor who could not control his anger not enough he asked no there wasnt enough murderers and thieves still live they still hold the heart of this city in their hands and even brave men quiver at the thought of what they might do no the dying must go on the blood must continue to flow until the guilty are the ones filling the graveyards not the innocent now will you help me or not antonil swore again clearly unhappy victor waited him out let him fume and think at last the guard captain met his gaze all on you he said at last if this burns us ill have edwin banish you faster than you can blink have i made myself clear clear as day victor said though you make it sound as if my men were not out there last night and did nothing to help keep the peace since your arrival this city has gone to the abyss antonil said shaking his head forgive me for not being so sure youre more help than burden victor swallowed down his frustration and pride time would be his judge not a mere soldier regardless of his rank keep your faith in me he said once more offering his hand to antonil our freedom is coming trust me letting out a sigh antonil clasped his wrist then stepped back so he said where is that bastard hiding anyway thren leaned back in his seat feet up on the table he drank alone martin had tried coming over to talk but hed waved him away the rest had gone to various rooms of the inn to lick their wounds rest their eyes and sleep with their whores he didnt blame them not that hed ever find himself a whore to have his desires overcome him so fully that hed pay to have them satisfied no he had better discipline than that besides marion was fresh in his mind and it would be an insult to her memory to bed another woman now do you miss me marion he asked his glass or do you watch me even now how many tears have you shed shed been a stunning woman her beauty almost exotic while graysons parents had both borne the dark skin common to those in ker marions father had been a soldier from neldar instead shed inherited his brown hair and her skin had softened so that no matter where she went she stood out his beautiful angel with sapphire eyes shed been no stranger to the life of a thief and behind her wellcrafted act of tenderness and humility thered been a will of iron of all the women hed met shed been the only one he fully respected the one time hed struck her shed slapped him right back in return never told you he muttered i wasnt mad not then i just wanted to know how youd react by the gods you were fire in a dress hed had too much to drink he knew what had started as a celebration had settled into quiet reminiscence as the guild turned in one by one much as thren didnt want to admit it graysons comment had cut deep but of course the man had known it would even though itd been many years since their parting few knew him better than his old friend former friend thren thought correcting himself things had changed ever since marions death even then hed known grayson would never forgive him more than a decade later he now had his proof his wife was dead and his sons were lost to him whatever remnants of her that remained in this world were in thren and graysons memories staring into his glass he felt his stomach twist had grayson told the truth about the watcher was he really dead if he was that was just one more piece of marion gone from the world forever denied to him thren let out a bitter laugh grayson had killed his own nephew would he even believe it if he told him the door opened and the look on the mans face upon entering was enough to startle thren what is it he asked as the thief shut the door through his alcoholaddled mind thren forced a name to match the face ricki that was it something aint right ricki said his squished oval face glancing about the empty cellar wheres everyone we need to get out now calm yourself thren said as he rose from his chair speak clearly and tell me what is going on city guards closing off streets all around here ricki said tugging at the collar to his shirt was coming back from the market spending what little i got from the gemcrofts place you know just barely snuck past while they was setting up yelling at people to get in their homes you think they will come for us thren asked struggling to believe it how would they even know of their location let alone have the guts to make a move they aint alone ricki said pulling open the door i saw victors men gathering far up iron street dont take much to figure out what theyre doing looks like someone decided to take us out that was enough to spur thren to action he pushed ricki aside dashed up the stairs and burst into the proper rooms of the inn wake everyone he yelled at the innkeeper now you too ricki both rushed toward the rooms the innkeeper the ones on the lower ricki the upper thren pulled his cloak tight about him and pulled its hood over his head the more he looked like every other thief the better he was no fool victor had no interest in scum like ricki or even martin no they wanted him of course they wanted him question was how did they know who had sold out their location men and women began stumbling down the stairs and into the main hall most drunk or in a stupor ready your things thren yelled to them our lives are in danger soldiers come with swords this awoke a fire in them the inn grew more chaotic and amid that thren went back to the door and glanced down the street in the far distance he saw squads of soldiers in approach he had thirty seconds perhaps a minute at most before he was surrounded thren ducked back inside found what was left of his guild anxiously awaiting orders he looked to them all and feeling his insides hardening into stone he gave them this is not the end of my guild he told them but wherever you go whoever of you lives toss aside your cloak and colors i know your names your faces and will forever remember your vows listen and wait the reaper cannot take me the guard cannot break me and no whoreson of a noble will defeat me not now not this day he saw the shock in their eyes the disbelief but thren could see the writing on the wall whether it was carved into the stone or written with blood someone conspired against him perhaps it was victor perhaps it was one of the trifect it might even be the widow that killed his men and mocked him afterward whoever it was he needed to be found and killed the lesson of the watcher weighed heavy on threns mind free of all ties one man alone could accomplish so much if he had the strength and will to do it go he told them and that one word broke the spell the shattered remnants of his guild rushed to the doors a few returning to their rooms to grab their things thren did not wait nor did he make for a door instead he climbed the stairs having prepared for such an event in a far room he stood on the bed and pushed against the ceiling lifting several boards to reveal a hole to the roof climbing up thren replaced the boards then slunk to the edge from there he looked down and surveyed the forces arrayed against him it wasnt good theyd brought at least a hundred armed men if not more every which way he looked there was a squad of six to ten guarding a street no doubt more lurked in the alleyways closer to the inn only the rooftops remained open to him though the crossbows he saw the various soldiers holding made him nervous crouching lower he waited just a moment to see how the chaos played out his former guild members fled in all directions like rats abandoning a sinking ship the squads closed in and more worrisome none gave chase it was a perfect net tightening in those that tried to make it past were attacked and while thren watched he saw several shot dead with crossbow bolts and then the main force from victor reached the inn many carrying torches they didnt enter they didnt try to flush anyone out instead they set it aflame oh shit thren muttered whatever time he had was done hed hoped to lurk perhaps even hide on the rooftop until the search ended but now he had no choice every way was guarded every direction he turned he saw armed men waiting one after another of his guild surrendered those not fast enough to avoid the squads others dove into windows and forced open doors as soldiers chased after thren wished them well then drew his swords either theyd kill him or hed kill in return there would be no capture not for him the fire grew the smoke of it reaching the ceiling and the heat of it warming the wood beneath his feet despite it all thren pulled his hood lower and grinned grayson had claimed thren feared facing an opponent strong enough to defeat him feeling the way his senses lifted the sudden clarity of his sight perhaps itd just been too long since he had faced a truly worthy opponent with victor grayson and his suns and now the widow perhaps he finally had a plethora to choose from before he only had the watcher and his presence had been a blanket across his ambitions smothering him now it was gone and the weakness in his heart with it the city was once more an enemy a thing to cower and break his complacency had nearly killed him but it was not too late he was not too old to face this not yet a thousand soldiers might swarm the streets but they would not catch him his son had burned bright and in his own way made him proud but at last it had come to end arms out he descended upon a squad of four that circled his side of the inn two died before he even landed one sword piercing a soldiers back the other slashing out anothers throat when he hit the ground he kicked out the legs of the third the fourth turned on him and he cried out here that cry was the last word he ever spoke thren batted aside a hasty block and then shoved a short sword through his mouth that done he pulled it free and ran though the various alleys would be guarded he knew they were still his best bet in the main streets they could surround him call in help when they realized who he was rushing a nearby home he leapt through a window as crossbow bolts thudded against its side his landing jarred his shoulder but he rolled to his feet almost amused by the terror he saw on the faces of the family living there cutting through one room he kicked open a back door emerging into an alley three men hurried toward him one with a raised crossbow thren rushed them leaping to one side to prevent a clear shot catapulting himself into the air he kicked off the wall sailing over the soldiers while upside down his sword lashed out cutting the string of the crossbow as the soldier tried to follow him with his aim landing he spun swords weaving so that the remaining men fell back expecting an attack but it was just a feint and before the group realized it he was already running another squad moved to cut him off up ahead but thren used a heavy barrel as a step ladder catapulting himself high enough to grab the edge of a roof momentum swung him higher as more crossbow bolts pierced the air all about him rolling onto the roof he took a moment to gasp for air then lumbered back to a stand his city his life he knew it all too well far better than any soldier without slowing he ran for the edge of the roof legs pumping heart pounding leaping off he sailed through the air crashing down atop an awning stretched out from a building on the opposite side of the street the fabric tore but slowed him enough before he landed hard on the wares of a petty jewel crafter thren laughed rolled off laughed some more tossing aside his cloak he vanished into the thick market crowd leaving the soldiers and the burning wreckage of his guild far behind nathaniel did his best to help but given his diminutive size and the sheer amount of things being transported over from their mansion to lord conningtons he was just a burden to those lifting and carrying so instead he decided to entertain his mother and keep her mind off whatever bothered her as they rode together in the litter he sat beside her wrapped in her arms and asked a thousand questions will there be any children there who was the first lord of the connington family what did their family crest look like whered they get their money would his things be all right did they have any interesting pets dear if youre nervous you can just say so alyssa said as he continued to ramble and she struggled to keep up with her answers nathaniel shrugged and grinned at his mother im not nervous youre nervous i bet youve never slept anywhere but your room but i stayed at lord gandrems his mother laughed and it made all of nathaniels world brighter with it i was fostered at various homes when i was your age and older but youre right i am nervous would you be a gentleman and hold my hand lest i faint nathaniel stood up straighter put on his most serious face whatever you would require milady she laughed again and his face cracked into a smile so long as his mother wasnt crying hed be all right theyd be just fine his mother was strong deep down he knew that seeing her upset seeing her afraid when zusa fought against the other strange ladies had been far more frightening than anything the litter stopped and in through the window climbed zusa having ridden on the top she ruffled nathans hair then turned to his mother were here she said and true to his word there are many many guards they stepped out and it seemed like an army of servants awaited them the gemcroft servants met them exchanging looks and words with each other in hushed quick tones nathaniel watched them feeling like he was seeing a hint of a world hed been sheltered from some handed over belongings others followed guides inside carrying bags and armloads of clothes shoes belts jewel boxes and dusty heirlooms burlier men carried heavy trunks smaller women food and supplies for baking it was a whirlwind of things to nathan a stunning amount all to keep him fed keep him happy keep him well he thought of the simplified existence lord gandrem lived in his castle and wondered what he might say seeing such a chaotic sight but john had stayed behind so he might ride with melody to their new temporary home the thought made nathaniel uneasy for some reason he couldnt identify ill speak with stephen about arrangements alyssa said to zusa see if you can find him a room zusa frowned but did not object she offered nathaniel a hand he stared at it she wore plain clothes as if she were a servant try as he might he could not ever remember having touched her bare skin before just her wrappings feeling the eyes of his mother upon him he took it nodded for her to lead the way he did his best to hide his surprise at how soft zusas hands were his mother kissed his forehead and then they were away crossing the expansive yard surrounded by fences and weaving through the bustle of servants and guards once inside zusa looked down both sides of the hallway and frowned stephen has little family she said surely there must be plenty of rooms worthy for a little prince such as you im not a prince zusa smirked at that given the wealth of your mother you might as well be one nathan a few of the house servants ushered past them but zusa seemed reluctant to bother them instead she picked a direction and together they traveled deeper into the mansion nathaniel stared at the walls mesmerized by the many paintings some were of fields and mountains crystal blue streams running through green hills others were of grim men and women dressed in fine clothing of times past smiles seeming such a rarity in these people of wealth nathaniel frowned maybe it was just the way they wanted to look to be remembered why was it so wrong to be remembered laughing to be thought of as kind of course he knew what john would say to that those with power had no time for games and smiles too many others might suffer for it anywhere is fine nathaniel said when he realized zusa was still searching for a room he might use for you perhaps zusa said stopping a moment so she could duck her head between large double doors opening into a vast room but i will be keeping an eye on you while were here and i would have you sleep somewhere safe theres guards all over nathaniel said as she tugged on his hand mother said lord connington even hired extra why wouldnt we be safe zusa stopped she pulled free one of her daggers and then spun low so she could grab his neck with one hand and press the tip of her blade against his throat with the other nathaniel didnt react too stunned and confused there in the dim long hallway they were alone the mansion strangely silent there are a hundred guards swarming about outside these walls zusa whispered to him but not a one could stop me from killing you this second guards dont mean safety walls dont mean safety we are safe only when we are strong enough to protect ourselves and right now you are but a child until you are grown i must protect you as well as your mother she stood let go of his neck but youll protect me he said how is that any different than lord conningtons guards i protect you because i am loyal to your mother she said putting away her dagger but who are stephens guards loyal to toto stephen but that doesnt mean theyll let something bad happen to us zusa shook her head always know the loyalties of the hands you put your life in you will one day be a lord of the trifect nathan you cannot rely on the honor and decency of men to stay alive so i should trust no one he asked it sounded like a cruel lesson of an even crueler world awaited him when he grew older zusa stared at him and he saw a bit of her hard facade fade she knelt again put her hands on his shoulders trust those you love and that love you in return she said it will hurt more if they betray you but at least youll still know joy zusa nodded toward a simple door that looked almost quaint compared to most of the rooms theyd passed in there let us see what we find she took his hand again and they stepped into a fairly plain room just a small bed a dresser for clothes and a washbasin with a mirror in the corner zusa looked about analyzing things in a way nathaniel doubted he would ever understand she checked the window the door beneath the bed and then nodded i must look outside first but i feel this will be safe she said the door is sturdy and you can bolt it from within the window is high but you should be able to crawl through and land outside without breaking any bones those unfamiliar to the mansion will not think to find you in such a small unadorned room theres also a lot of shadows near the ceiling nathaniel said and his look made zusa smile theres that too if you are ever afraid trust me to be in the dark corners always ready to save you now stay here ill fetch some servants to bring you your things she left him there and he stood before the plain bed and white sheets and tried to pretend it was his home it wasnt zusas words continued to haunt him and he closed his door shut the lock the room was quiet and dark nathaniel sat on his bed and drummed his fingers against his stump time ticked along and finally unable to stand anymore he lurched to his feet flung open the lock and began wandering the halls in many ways the mansion felt familiar similar in style to his mothers but the tiny differences in the color of stone the texture of the carpet added up to something that was a constant reminder of his status as a visitor a large woman passed him by arms full of dirty sheets and she gave him a glare she said nothing and didnt stop him so he hurried along the hallway came to an end at a plain door similar to the room nathaniel stayed in the main difference was that a small image had been carved into the wood though he couldnt quite make it out a cat perhaps curious he tested the doorknob found it unlocked unable to stop himself he pushed it open and stepped inside it was a childs room similar in size to nathaniels the bed was smaller the window lower all about the floor were scattered toys little animals carved out of wood each the size of his fist there were no paintings no markings and something about the place made his hair stand on end hurrying to leave he rushed through the door and bumped into a man his head driving into the mans stomach as arms pushed him back nathaniel let out a yelp convinced that zusas words were prophetic and that he was about to be murdered within walls surrounded by a hundred guards but instead it was a welldressed man not much taller than him he was young and had a softness to his face that immediately removed any of nathaniels initial fear of harm im sorry if i startled you the young man said he looked him over his eyes lingering on the stump of his arm you must be alyssas boy right nathaniel nathaniel nodded selfconsciously clutching the stump with his other hand i am he said im stephen so glad to meet you stephen nathaniel realized who stood before him and nearly panicked here was their host kind as could be and nathan had plowed headfirst into his stomach because hed been spooked by a few old childrens toys nathaniel fell to one knee and bowed his head milord i am honored to meet you please forgive my poor greeting he wanted to say it and nearly did oh and please please dont tell my mother nothing to forgive now stand up it seems you wandered off and others were starting to worry nathaniel felt his neck flush hardly ten minutes into their new home and he was already in trouble not a good start to the day i didnt mean to scare anyone he mumbled stephen put a hand on nathaniels shoulder guiding him back down the hall im sure you didnt your mother is just nervous what with the attack on her mansion most understandable really right before turning a corner melody stepped around and she sighed with relief at seeing the two you shouldnt run off like a little street urchin she said but her words felt perfunctory nathaniel caught her eyes stealing to stephen was she trying to gauge his reaction see if he was upset he was only studying the layout of the house like any smart child would do stephen said smiling down at nathaniel isnt that right nathaniel couldnt nod his head in agreement fast enough stephen let go of his shoulder and at melodys approach he opened his arms so the two might embrace it is good to see you again melody said and i have no doubt as to the boys intelligence though he could use a bit more sense but i should be kind anyone graced with visions should be expected to have their head more often in the clouds than on where one foot goes after the other stephen cocked his head at that visions do you mean with my chrysarium melody said and there was a hint of pride in her voice truly i have never seen one so blessed his mother has taught him little of faith and never taken him to temple i think the chrysarium awakened his soul with a hunger something about this seemed off and nathaniel didnt like it at all he kept hoping to see zusa coming around the corner to join them daggers in hand they spoke of the chrysarium and the visions and it made his mouth dry and his testicles shrivel thinking of what hed seen stephen knelt down before him a subtle change had overcome him that youthful innocence replaced with something more something nathaniel didnt understand what did you see he asked did you see veldaren he swallowed melody and stephen were on either side of him blocking the hallway he felt trapped and worse the vision was returning dominating his sight against his will i did he said at least i think it was what of it did it bloom or burn burn like a thousand suns he thought but did not say it melody and stephen shared a worried look and he saw his grandmother take stephens hand he was so frightened melody said i think stephen seemed to get it immediately and he turned once more to nathaniel you saw him didnt you he asked his eyes like fire terror gripped his heart he didnt want to think of it didnt want to remember it tears ran down the sides of his face i did he whispered stephen wrapped his arms about him pulled him close against his breast shush now he said gently stroking his hair its all right you poor child you havent slept well since have you ill pray for you so that you can stephen stood and again he and his grandmother shared a lingering moment were almost out of time he said im not sure ill be able to save the city he stopped as alyssa came around the corner nathan she said and stephen parted so he could run to her he wrapped his arm around her leg felt her gently stroke his forehead nathan are you crying he felt guilty for running off stephen said i think he feared he embarrassed you because of it or that i might be upset which i can assure you i am not my home is his now as it is yours until everything can be made right the eyes thought nathaniel unable to stop the memory the tears had been of silver and gold his face a shadow but the eyesthe eyes the eyes of fire burned focused on veldaren their essence consumed with fury and craving destruction more and more gathered under the shadows banner and the silver tears fell like rain across the city he heard a child crying crying by the time the vision ended and he came to he was laying on his back his mother kneeling over him all he could say was the same thing over and over im sorry im sorry im so sorry haern woke to the sound of scraping steel he bolted upward in his bed and immediately regretted it a moment of vertigo doubled him over and he coughed and heaved as his insides twisted beside him brug sat up in his chair dagger and whetstone in hand easy there brug said reaching over and pushing haern back down onto the bed haern lacked the strength to resist and he slowed his breathing so his heartbeat might return to normal wheres delysia haern asked brug lifted an eyebrow at him and let out a grunt forced her to take a rest he said been at your side nearly all night its midday now in case you cant tell you were out all morning haern remembered the fires hed seen the chaos unfurling at his supposed death howd everything go he asked brug scraped the stone across his blade well he began talking and haern listened intently he heard of the smaller fires the delay and then of the larger attack on the dungeon haern shook his head at this thinking of so many hed put away managing to escape it seemed the guilds were not just eager to celebrate but wanted to wipe away every shred of his accomplishments in a single night it was all just a feint though brug said putting down one dagger and grabbing the other the real fight was at alyssas id say you should have been there but from what my eyes were seeing you already were haern frowned confused what do you mean i mean someone dressed up as you grabbed similar swords and went to town killing thieves to protect the gemcroft mansion saw him or you or whatever fighting alongside that zusa girl whos always protecting alyssa damn good too might have fooled me if i hadnt seen the gaping hole in your chest earlier that morning not even delysia can get someone up and running just a day after that haern lay down and closed his eyes to think someone impersonated him but why the obvious reason was to convince the town he was not in fact dead but who benefitted most who had the skill and the physical ability to so closely imitate him it was a small list indeed and none made any sense what of the fight he asked trying to pull his mind back to other matters brug shrugged was just a huge mob for the most part plenty died but at least a good chunk were thieves as well which guild brug scratched at his beard now that i think of itall of em alyssa must have pissed someone off good grudge from letting all those mercenaries loose perhaps it was possible but didnt feel right threns the only one whos been able to unite the guilds before haern said i wouldnt doubt hed hold a grudge but this feels too similar to the failed attack during the bloody kensgold he would have learned from that and this may sound crazy but i think he likes things as they are thats why he attacked victor he attacked victor because victor was taking down his men and cutting off their heads small timers minor thieves he didnt like victor threatening the delicate balance ive created brug grunted rocked his chair back and forth youre starting to sound like that hit on your head really got to you worse than we thought listen to yourself are you saying thren likes having you lord over the underworld why next youll be saying that it was him pretending to be you last night haern gave him a look and brug closed his eyes and rubbed his eyelids with his thick callused fingers really you actually think he did if thats the case then i dont know whats going on in veldaren anymore everyones losing their damn minds you included haern laughed be useful and get me something to eat as brug left the room muttering to himself haern closed his eyes and tried to relax he felt the beginnings of another headache coming along and if it was anything like the last itd be crippling shifting side to side he tested his wounds the skin was tightening up though when he lifted the bandages he found his stab wound a deep purple and horribly scarred rocking back and forth didnt seem to strain it too badly though it did make his muscles ache worse was how his balance still felt off even that slight motion sent his stomach looping not too frightening a foe that keeps vomiting midfight thought haern brug returned carrying a small tray of food and it was more cruelty than kindness the smell was divine and haerns mouth watered but his stomach heaved and he turned to the side of his bed so he could vomit he saw a small amount of blood amid the bile but tried not to worry that he was sitting up and talking was enough of a sign for him that hed make it out all right thought it looked pretty good myself brug said glancing down at the plate of carrots and beef perhaps just some ale for now haern looked at the offered mug why not he said at least it would get rid of the foul taste in his mouth he took a few swallows just enough to clear his throat brug put the tray down beside his bed and settled back down in the chair tarlak said hes hearing some bizarre rumors coming in from the city brug said looks like victor moved against the spider guild those he caught are all claiming the same thing spider guilds been disbanded and threns vanished haern felt like hed been slapped with a wet towel you cant be serious he said dumbly im not much for joking haern im starting to think you might be right about thren pretending he was you because lets face it hes completely falling apart haern pressed his palms against his forehead what now brug asked headache haern said slowly breathing in and out feels like someone stuck a knife in my brain and every few minutes they cant help but give it a twist del did say that hit to your head was a nasty one what smacked you anyway a brick a foot brug snorted im not sure i want to meet that guy then he said stealing haerns mug and downing a third of it whats his heel made of stone the confrontation with the mysterious man came back to haern much as he didnt want it to his attacker had shown no guild affiliations at least not in any way haern recognized hed been a giant man darkskinned incredibly fast for his size cant stay like this haern said still in the dark about too much the spider guilds disbandment proves that i need to find out whats going on i need to know whos playing us all like puppets run run little spider you arent going anywhere as is brug said at least give yourself another night to haern caught brugs eyes glancing out the window and whatever he saw gave him pause what is it he shifted in bed so he could look out from his window in the tower they could both see the pathway stretching toward them from veldaren walking alone on that path was a man his lanky form wrapped in a thick red leather coat a widebrimmed hat colored crimson hung low over his face across his back easily visible despite the hundreds of yards between them was an enormous twohanded sword a red ribbon fluttered from the handle in a soft breeze friend of yours brug asked haern shook his head perhaps he knows tarlak something about the way he moved made both of them uneasy the fashion of the hat and coat suggested him an outsider far from veldaren brug fetched his daggers then moved to the door stay here he said ill find out whats going on haern chuckled as the door closed stay here he pushed himself out of bed clutching the wall to keep his balance vertigo came over him a second time but he fought through it hed been trained better than this he thought taught to overpower far greater his father had supplied him with tutors teachers masters of both mind and body so what if a man the size of an ox had nearly caved in his skull he was still stronger all that determination still felt small compared to the pain in his temples and it did nothing to reduce the obnoxious white glare that seemed to come off of everything but he forced it away thrust it into the corners of his mind let it ache but not distract he found his shirt lying beside the bed a hole still in it from where hed been stabbed he put it on then pulled his hood over his head as the shadows covered his face he felt his tension ease no matter the injury no matter all that had happened he was still the watcher he was greater than this a glance outside the window showed the man was almost to the tower so far he had not drawn his blade at the closer distance haern could see strange markings tattooed across his neck and hands set into the hilt of his sword was an enormous crystal clear as water haern could only guess its worth but the estimate was staggering stopping just shy of the path to the door the man looked up at the window right at haern a wide smile spread across his face which was half covered by lanky strands of blond hair that smile was like an icicle to the eye eschaton the man shouted his voice tore through the quiet afternoon and it was strangely highpitched i am nicholas bloodcraft and i have come to kill all of you if you surrender now your death will be merciful a swift painless beheading if not before the man could even finish the door to the tower opened and tarlak stepped out fire burning on his hands consider this my counterproposal tarlak said a ball of fire shot from his palm directly for nicholas haern tensed convinced it would not be so easy the strange man pulled his sword off his back and held it blade downward the hilt raised before his chest mere feet away the fireball suddenly winked out of existence without even a hint of smoke tarlak hurled a second ball of fire and it vanished all the same haern grabbed his sabers from beside the window as tarlak lifted his hat and scratched his head huh tarlak slammed the door shut after rushing back inside nicholas calmly approached the tower sword still drawn grin still ear to ear haern pushed away from the window and staggered toward the stairs the man was a professional there was no doubt about that worse he looked to be the perfect counter to their mercenaries if delysia and tarlak could not use their magic that left only brug haern shoved his door open pausing a moment to tighten the bandages about his chest no brug would not be able to handle someone of that skill his talents lay in smithing not combat he had to get down there he had to hurry step after step each one jolting him with pain the sabers in his hands shook and he felt the leather of the hilts starting to cover with sweat had to hurry had to be stronger the door smashed open as haern reached the bottom step nicholass massive sword cleaved it in two a feat that should have been impossible besides the enchantments tarlak had placed upon it the wood itself was thick but his minds feeble protests changed nothing as the man stepped inside red coat billowing as dusty air poured into the tower brug stood guard opposite him tarlak and delysia behind youre not welcome here brug said clanging his two punch daggers together he wore his platemail though haern wondered how useful itd be against a blade that could chop an oak door in half least he was polite enough to knock tarlak said ice swirling in his palm nicholas lifted his sword with a single hand and pointed it at the three last chance he said not that i mind the gore or a good fight but this wont be any competition wont be any fun kneel down offer me your necks and youll die easy haern saw more tattoos on his hand swirling lines almost like arcane runes they shone a soft blue pulsing along with the mans heartbeat everything about nicholas screamed danger but those runes told haern to expect more than the humanly possible from his opponent well that and the split door the only one dying today is you brug said stomping his feet just try it come on come on haern slipped further into the room hugging the wall brug was trying to be a distraction he knew doing everything he could to not look toward the stairs to the side just a few feet closer and haern could lunge nicholas whirled and his sword stretched out the tip aimed for haerns throat and you he said shouldnt you be dead brug leapt forward bellowing nicholas spun his blade cutting through the air with unnatural speed both brugs daggers smacked aside and he had to pull back to avoid having his head lopped off haern rushed to his friends aid before nicholas could finish him his sabers stabbed in and when nicholas pulled his sword close to his chest to parry haern pressed the attack weaving a continuous assault so the man would have no chance to counter a mindless roar exited his mouth a primal cry to overwhelm the pain in his side as blood dripped down his leg from reopened wounds but his foe was too good when brug went to stab him in the back he pretended to turn to block then flung himself at haern who had to twist to shift his aim the twist hurt too much and he let out a gasp as his vision turned white only instincts kept him falling back kept his sabers up to push aside the killing chop get back tarlak yelled and both haern and brug obliged flinging themselves away lances of ice crossed the room points deadly sharp nicholas turned to face him his sword spinning in his grasp so the hilt neared his face the lances vanished amid a subtle flash of the crystal within the hilt but that was not all of the attack delysia cried out the name of her god and from her outward palms shone a brilliant flash of white nicholas swore and he turned away rubbing his eyes brug came barreling in all clattering platemail he slammed headfirst into nicholas but instead of bowling the man over he let out a cry and bounced to the side his helmet was dented as if hed struck stone up went nicholass sword ready for the kill another flash of light from delysia but he squinted his eyes and shifted his head so it did not blind that halfsecond delay was enough though haern stretched to his limits his sabers cutting through the coat the leather was thick and heavy rendering it a shallow flesh wound worn out as he was haern did not have the strength to force the cut deeper blood dripped to the floor as nicholas clenched his teeth and brought his full fury to bear on haern im glad you are alive he said swinging his sword in wide arcs so haern had to remain on the defensive a bolt of fire shot in from tarlak but it winked out of existence not even giving nicholas pause at least you make this interesting you even made me bleed haern ducked underneath a swing then tried to roll to one side nicholas predicted the maneuver and haern screamed as a heavy boot slammed into his stomach his old wound tore it was like being stabbed all over again he tried to move to keep going but his body convulsed against his wishes doubling over amid his cries of pain nicholass sword lifted but a heavy brick slammed into his shoulder before he could swing startled nicholas fell back as two more flew in one striking his sword the other his chest dont like magic eh tarlak said still hiding on the far side of the room how about something more real more stones dislodged from the walls held in the wizards mental grip they flew at nicholas and though the magic propelling them died when nearing the man it did not remove the natural momentum of the stone nicholas dove side to side flinging his sword about to help block upon reaching a wall he leapt into it and kicked off into a dive straight at the wizard and thats when tarlak lifted the couch into the air and swatted nicholas with it as if he were a bug need some help here tarlak shouted as he flung more chairs and stones at nicholas haern saw that the wizard was losing strength the velocity of each one considerably slower than the last struggling to his feet he staggered into a run nicholas caught one of the slower stones flung it straight back at tarlak it struck his forehead and with a soft gasp the wizard slumped against the wall blood trickling down his face and neck haern ignored it couldnt afford to worry about the fate of his friend pushing through the wall of agony he thrust for nicholass stomach too slow nicholas parried the sabers then stepped in so that his elbow collided with haerns throat he fell gasping and the hard stone below him jarred his bleeding side further i see why your band was such trouble nicholas said standing over him blood dripped from his cut side and his tattooed skin was a mess of bruises but not any longer he jerked forward then collapsed to his knees as brugs daggers pierced his back in a flurry of punches why he shoved his daggers together into nicholass lower back does everyone twisted them left then right always yanking them free he clubbed nicholas across the head ignore me nicholas collapsed to the ground in a dead heap brug stood over him whole body shuddering as he gasped in air he kicked the corpse with his armored foot stupid bastard grumbled brug haern laughed where he lay despite the pain it caused delysia was soon there holy light shining on her hands youre an angel del haern said nearly delirious from the pain im all right tarlak said staggering to his feet having to hold onto an upended couch beside him to stay balanced with glazed eyes he looked about the room then grunted we need a new door who was that delysia asked as the healing light poured into haerns wounds haern did his best to relax and he let his sabers go limp in his hands nicholas bloodcraft haern mumbled he said it pretty clearly you know thats not what i meant but thats all that matters tarlak said walking unsteadily about his tower inspecting the damage both he and nicholas had caused the bloodcrafts are a bunch of mercenaries from mordan theyre ruthless powerful and apparently have terrible taste in fashion you mean theres more than one like him brug asked giving the corpse another kick for good measure delysia kissed haern on the cheek then went to her brother when she tried to inspect the growing bruise on his forehead he gently pushed her away ill be fine he said and yeah theres more than one if what ive heard is true theres always four haern scooted until he could sit with his back against a wall leaning his head against the cold stone he watched as tarlak knelt beside the corpse and inspected the sword with a frown he grabbed the crystal in the hilt and carefully twisted it until it broke free when he lifted it up haern saw that it had turned gray in color a damn expensive enchantment tarlak said peering at it banishes all magic in the area at least until the crystals thoroughly filled he looked at nicholass body and after a thought pulled off the cloak then removed his shirt as well tattooed all across the body were hundreds of runes some still shining a soft blue others having faded down to just black ink noticing this tarlak grunted lets see strength more strength speed a few blade enchantments heres one for balancethese tattoos were impervious to the effects of the crystal he banished all magic about him except for his own clever haern said id call it cheating tarlak muttered will the others be like him delysia asked cleaning off haerns blood from her hands i dont know tarlak said but someone wants us dead and they brought out the best we need to be careful if theres more of the bloodcrafts here were all in severe danger if theyre here why arent theywell here asked brug again i dont know tarlak chuckled but we might not be their only target in veldaren if so i feel bad for the other sorry bastards theyre after great haern said closing his eyes it suddenly felt like a perfect time for him to sleep his pain ebbing away and his headaches returning the last thing he wanted to think about was more frighteningly powerful men running about his city not to mention whoever it was that had brought the expensive mercenaries to bear against them justgreat half a mile outside the walls of veldaren grayson inspected his three wagons particularly their cargo all around his fellow suns gathered thirty in all each man and woman sported at least two earrings in their left ear for he would consider no less for such an important job the first few days would be crucial not a time for amateurs not sure ive ever seen so much leaf in one place said boggs the hefty man in charge of operations in graysons absence he scratched at the dark stubble on his face then sniffed how much we charging four silver five one grayson said as he hopped down from the last of the wagons inspection complete several others scoffed at that and boggs shook his head thats insane this trip to veldaren will cost us a fortune one silver on the first day grayson repeated two after that until its all gone the trifect wont be able to match and neither will any of the guilds were spending money now to make it all back later consider it an investment dont understand why we need to go through all this said pierce he was a thinner man and often complained but his ear was full of rings and hed proven himself one of the more adept killers for the suns you hear what they say back home every guild heres weak full of pussies too frightened to go after a coin purse lying open on the ground if we want territory i say we just take it and anyone who gives a shit can die i give a shit pierce grayson said grinning at the man you gonna kill me only if i get to take your earrings afterward grayson laughed well have our share of killing and pay no attention to the rumors youve heard the thieves here are dangerous even with their balls chopped off but well be better wont we well kill everyone we need to kill but for now no reason to fight when the money starts running dry the underworld will turn to us its only a matter of time before the other guilds crumble now ready up the oxen i want us at the gates before the midday trade is done get em harnessed boggs shouted the thieves scattered about gathering the few supplies theyd broken out for their rest and preparing the wagons to move grayson hopped into the frontmost wagon and leaned back in the seat hands behind his head think itll be easy getting through the gates boggs asked taking a seat beside him and grabbing the reins grayson fingered the medallion in his pocket then shrugged well find out he said no reason to panic until then never a bad thing to be prepared tracy said hopping up to join them as the wagon shuddered into motion tracy was boggs halfsister and far more pleasant to look at her brown hair was tied into a tight ponytail clearly showing her seven lengthy dangling earrings as she took a seat behind them if the guards give us trouble just flash them your tits grayson said and if theyre not into that she asked then ill show them my dick hardly complicated boggs let out a laugh grayson shot him a look care to share boggs dont you see boggs asked were the most dangerous men veldarens seen in ages and theyre going to let us right through their walls because of some tits and a dick dont forget a little help from on high grayson said pulling the medallion out from his pocket by its bronze chain just seems shameful boggs said shouldnt we be climbing over walls at night or something tracy kicked him in the back with her heel the hilt of the knife hidden in her boot jamming him hard in the kidney just shut up and steer yes sister they followed the road through the shallow hills enduring the jostle of the wagons grayson lay back so his eyes were free of the sun and did his best to relax getting through the gates would be trickier than he let on there was no room for error even if they were fast enough to get away thered be no way they could take the wagons with them in their escape drastically undercutting their rivals was one thing but losing all that product without any gain would be unacceptable remember grayson said sitting up as the walls of veldaren grew closer you keep your mouths shut and let me do the talking dont want anything to draw attention to us not our first time smuggling tracy said and all things considered id prefer it not to be our last either boggs said you got your wish grayson just hope youre right about your little helper grayson grunted he hoped he was right as well the wagons approached the west side entrance the portcullis open during the daytime traffic boggs stopped the lead wagon at behest of two guards who approached with hands raised been here before the first asked cant say we have grayson said need you to register your cargo as well as pay a fee if youre not with the merchants guild ill let you know the tariff once i look it over not sure thats necessary grayson said leaning closer to the guard he lifted the medallion given to him by laerek to ensure entrance to the city without incident the guards eyes widened upon seeing it and he glanced about back to your post he said to the other the man looked unsure but did as he was told youre asking a lot the guard said when they were alone we allow the temple to bring in supplies as necessary but three wagons and youre yet to tell me what it is you carry what i carry is of no concern grayson said reaching into his pocket he thought the priests of karak might not have enough sway to get all his men and crimleaf through but of course power wasnt the only way to get what one wanted in the world this however he said tossing a bag of coins at the guard who caught it i think this is what will most interest you the guard opened it saw the gold within the yellow sparkled in his eyes closing it he pocketed the bag and then nodded ill still need to inspect it he said grayson motioned to the others so they might know to leave him be the guard climbed into the back of each wagon giving only cursory glances and not once opening a crate after the third he returned to the front your tariff plus merchant fee is seventeen silver he said going rate for such low quality wheat you heard him grayson told boggs pay the man for our wheat boggs grumbled but pulled out the demanded coin from his own pocket that done the guard waved them through then went back to his station to hand over the tariff so much for your help from on high tracy said as the wagons rolled forward were through and untouched grayson said that we had to grease the wheels a little shouldnt be much of a surprise just preferred we used your grease instead of mine boggs muttered where to now head south i already have a contact there waiting once weve claimed the hearts of the citys most poor and desperate and established our territory well worry about moving north the quality of roads steadily deteriorated as they traveled deeper into the southern district the neglect apparent with potholes and even gaps where the brick had been covered with long swathes of dirt in halfhearted attempts to smooth out the passage the wagons slowed and the jostling increased grayson saw pierce hop out of the second wagon and come running at first he thought him just tired of the rough ride but it turned out not the case we got a tail he said walking beside them to be expected grayson said i doubt too many merchants travel south did you catch which guild pierce shook his head i dont know them well enough sorry just keep your eyes open grayson said and dont let them know we see them pierce nodded theyre running long the rooftops he said watch them if you can pierce returned to the second wagon grayson leaned back imitating his relaxed position earlier as he did he looked to the rooftops trying to see who shadowed them out of the corner of his eyes any of them a threat boggs asked as they shifted to one side to avoid a nasty stretch of mud not really grayson said just the ash guild but if that is them well they might have a tail of their own they continued until they reached their contact one of the few merchants still maintaining a presence in the far south of veldaren he was an overweight man sweaty and with his shirt overstuffed with his own fat afternoon billick grayson said as they stopped the wagons in front of his shop i assume no guards followed you billick asked furtive eyes bouncing between the wagons guards grayson asked hopping down from the front of the wagon no guards are the least of our problems my friend where can we store our merchandise space for everything billick said gesturing toward the open door to his shop carry it in and put it the back room you heard him grayson roared amused at how the fat man jumped at the volume of his voice one by one the wagons were unloaded his suns lugging the crates into their place of storage for their time in veldaren i wont be handling any of it billick said as he watched you know that right dont tell me what it is and dont make me sell it ill let you get it in and ill let any one of you suns get it out just make sure the pay is on time good man grayson said smirking at him so brave so noble youll get your pay just keep an eye on our wares i dont take kindly to those who help themselves to what isnt theirs billick got the message and he nodded fast enough to make the fat of his neck bounce i have business elsewhere he said shops all yours for the rest of the day i wont come back until morning once the crates were stored grayson gathered around his men and began divvying out smaller bags one silver he told them stay close and stay together let them come to you and ill drag back to mordeina in a bag anyone i hear charging more and pocketing the top the men began to scatter each eager for their first step in taking over the streets of veldaren pierce grayson called out stopping the man yeah grayson grinned at him go find someone in a guild dont care which or how old they are just find someone and then gut them i want to send a message that we arent to be messed with understood so make it brutal pierces grin was ear to ear that i can do he said twirling a dagger in his hand good go get to work as the rest scattered in groups only boggs and tracy remained behind not many places to stash three wagons boggs said climbing up into the first we arent leaving for a while grayson said glancing up and down the street should be an inn nearby desperate enough for coin to let us hole up all three for a few months at worst we can sell them at market come on lovely sister boggs said as tracy climbed up to join him let us find some clean comfortable beds for our companions tracy snickered so not too much lice in them then before they could move out the back two wheels of the wagon exploded and with a loud bang the wood hit the ground the oxen jostled startled but boggs kept them calm the fuck boggs asked looking back tracy hopped down to take a look but grayson could already tell what had happened smoke rose from a magical fire that burned out into nothing grayson drew his swords as a man in a gray cloth mask approached from down the street ash swirled about his face hiding his dark features grayson recognized him from the failed attack on alyssas mansion he gripped his swords tighter grayson tracy said also seeing him but grayson raised a hand gesturing for her to remain calm well now grayson said approaching the intruder in a way that got him nearer to the first wagon and therefore cover this is a surprise perhaps said deathmask but your arrival isnt ive been expecting one of the guilds from mordan to arrive for years honestly your delay proved irritating grayson let out a laugh no more than your interference what is it you want if youre here to protect your territory you might as well give up now our money leaf and coin are pouring in from mordeina like a flood you wont stop us i dont mean to stop you deathmask said crossing his arms other than your wagon of course i did mean to stop that as for your suns spreading across veldaren theyll encounter resistance soon enough though not from me the guilds wont go down quietly not unless things change not unless you have my help i cant decide if you underestimate us or overestimate your own worth grayson said speak plainly wizard i am no wizard deathmask said and he was surprised to see the anger glowing in those mismatched eyes and my offer is plain enough even for you let me help your guild take over the city every single brick and stone in return you split your profits with me how much grayson asked honestly intrigued what else would a split be half his intrigue died amid his laughter do you think i need you so badly that id sacrifice a fortune for a victory i will already achieve show some intelligence the ash swirling around deathmasks face slowed grew thicker i am no fool grayson the guilds are crumbling dying to both you and victor i can help you finish them off show you where to shove your sword what i ask for isnt much not when you consider that every coin you take from veldaren is a coin you didnt have the day before but do not think your takeover of these streets is inevitable not when thren still stalks the city not while im still alive well grayson said i guess we should take care of that shouldnt we fire was already surrounding deathmasks hands before grayson rolled to the side using the wagon as cover the expected attack from the wizard came a burst of fire that consumed where hed stood it was slow though and more flash than heat he was being played with grayson realized as he leaned his back against the wagon doesnt have to go like this deathmask said his voice drawing nearer we could be partners and work together bullshit grayson shouted his mind elsewhere tracy had rolled from the wagon to the door of the shop hidden from deathmasks view boggs crouched just above grayson within the broken wagon grayson held up three fingers to tracy counting them down at one they leapt out but deathmask was no longer alone mentwins by the looks of itstood before him each holding a pair of daggers grayson slid and he swung his arm in the way to knock tracy down as well four daggers sailed above them hitting nothing back grayson said as he turned and ran sheathing a sword so he could grab tracy by the arm no spells gave chase like he thought instead with a few words from deathmask his wagons caught fire one by one burning as if doused with barrels of lantern fuel tracy let out a cry for her brother but amid the smoke grayson could not tell if he escaped safely or not they ran for the door but instead of finding safety in the shop a woman with a wicked scar across her right eye met them there bearing the colors of the ash guild she held a dagger in her hand and it glowed with purple fire this is hardly the way to leave a negotiation she said nor the way veldaren will fall deathmask said calmly walking toward them the ash circling his head faster and faster his smile hidden behind cloth yet clearly visible in his eyes the four of us have held our territory for years against all challengers yet you would think to brush us aside like children boggs fell from the back of the nearest wagon coughing and hacking tracy tensed and grayson could tell she wanted to go to him his hands and face were black from the ash but his burns didnt seem too severe far more worrisome were the twins who hurried to his location still breathing said the first just barely said the second deathmask stepped closer and closer grayson could almost reach him with a lunge but he looked unafraid as if he actually believed he was the dread ghoul he appeared to be the scarred woman seemed far more tense and she kept her dagger at the ready dont you dare lay a finger on him grayson said to the twins or what they asked in unison in answer grayson flung himself at the woman catching her across the face with his fist as she fell back he tried to stab but she was faster than he expected instead of fleeing further she dove to the ground narrowly avoiding the downward thrust that would have skewered her continuing on she joined the twins who stepped before her protectively the woman fumed but deathmask only chuckled how is the burned friend of theirs he asked as grayson and tracy stood there still tense they might flee into the shop but that way was a dead end if they wanted to escape it had to be through the streets grayson had fought spellcasters before and he knew hed be pressing his luck trying to avoid their attacks in open streets for any length of time he looks like hes seen better days the woman said lifting boggs up with both hands her dagger pressed against his chest boggs let out a gasp at her touch a shame said deathmask veliana if youd so kindly put him out of his misery the woman was only too happy to oblige before grayson could think of what to do veliana pulled her dagger back spun it and jammed it through boggss throat tracy let out a choked cry part horror part fury veliana dumped the body to the street retrieved her dagger and then burned away the blood with more purple fire the twins shifted wider just outside sword reach blocking off the other side of the street only the shop remained and for some reason grayson felt like he was being herded inside glancing behind him he realized much of his merchandise was still within in the shop if he were trapped inside and the ash guild summoned the city guard then theyd be out their lives and their coin worse their guilds intentions would be revealed to the kings men when word reached mordeina none of it would be of the ash guilds involvement either the blame pinned on the city guard instead deathmask didnt want to just kill him he wanted to humiliate him and make life far more difficult for the rest of the sun guild all that smoke will be attracting attention soon deathmask said confirming graysons fears you bastard tracy said tears in her eyes ill kill you i promise it shouldnt make promises you wont keep veliana said last chance deathmask said partners or the executioners axe your choice tracy grayson said as movement across the rooftops caught his eye you do exactly as i say you understand she nodded lowering his swords grayson stood to his full height delaying as long as possible he had to time it just right just when the attack hit i guess i have little choice he said but im thinking id much rather have you dead spinning about he leapt into door of the shop smashing it open with his shoulder tracy followed without hesitation barging in they flung themselves to the side avoiding another barrage of daggers grayson rolled onto his back swords up to fend off an attack that didnt come explosions of fire rocked the street and they werent from deathmask shrapnel from the wagons clacked against the side of the shop and a long plank shattered a window tracy crouched low to the floor stunned by the sudden barrage of combat we should go help kill no grayson said either theyll live or theyll die im not foolish enough to step in the middle the ringing of steel on steel intensified from the window grayson heard a roar of wind and then what sounded like a battering ram slamming into a castle gate whos out there tracy asked stunned in answer grayson only shook his head in less than a minute the combat was over holding his swords at the ready grayson made his way to the door and stepped out to survey the wreckage their wagons were ruined each one exploded into pieces three of the nearby buildings burned and a fourth had a gaping hole in its front from what he could only guess there were no other bodies on the ground besides boggs tracy rushed over to her brother cradling his head in her hands tears flowed down her face but only for a moment what happened here she asked as she calmly removed the rings from his ear saw their coat for just an instant but the damage is enough to answer grayson said putting away his swords still think it was a mistake to hire them but at least they saved our ass instead of getting in the way what are you talking about the bloodcrafts grayson said if the ash guild lives through this itll be a miracle tracy paled at the name we need to check on the rest she said the ash guild might not have been the only one to no grayson said offering her his hand we need to move now the city guard will be here any second and we cant risk them finding our cache we must take whatever we can carry and then hide tracy nodded pocketed the last of boggss earrings she kissed his burned forehead and then whispered into his ear im sorry she took graysons hand and stood inside the shop they gathered every bag they could carry and as the first of many arrived to investigate the destruction the two ducked into the nearest alley and lost themselves in the darker parts of the city zusa was in her room when alyssa found her what are you doing alyssa asked zusa ignored her instead continuing to put on her wrappings inch by inch lifting one arm she began circling them across her breast around her sides and then back again loop after loop after loop alyssa grabbed her hands forcing her to stop look at me she said zusa i have to go zusa said gently taking alyssas hands in hers then pulling herself free so she might continue to dress go go where i need you here you know that whoever it isthis widowhe followed us here hes here and youre to leave me zusa turned her back to alyssa not wanting to see the worry in her eyes it was dark now but in the waning hours of daylight theyd found another body this one dumped against the walls of the connington estate a crossbow bolt still stuck in her chest it had been one of the servants left behind to care for alyssas mansion while it was repaired her eyes had been removed coins replacing them the rhyme had mocked alyssa directly yet again tongue of gold eyes of silver run run gemcroft whore from the widows quiver stephen had sent the guards into a frenzy searching furious that such a thing had been done without them noticing zusa though had only stared as the walls closed in around her shed calmly walked to her room stripped naked sharpened her daggers and then began to dress i only do what i must zusa said dont lie to me alyssa said i need you here my son needs you here without your protection we might dont you understand zusa said whirling to face her that is why i go it doesnt matter how closely i guard you youre still vulnerable the threat lurks and i must find it no alyssa said crossing arms this widow is just some sick fuck with a crossbow whoever it is cant be better than you its not the widow zusa said shaking her head that was only a reminder of the threats made against us its the other faceless theyre just like me alyssa no matter how many guards you surround yourself with or how diligent i remain they can still find you when i sleep or am separate from you for only a moment walls mean nothing and shadows are just doors alyssa stepped closer put a hand against zusas cheek you stopped them before you can stop them again they were foolish and revealed themselves before they attacked they wont be so proud again for whatever reason karaks servants want you dead dont you understand how dangerous a position that is they are powerful and they are relentless if i dont do something now if i dont find out why then i cant keep you safe and i wont let that happen i wont lose you i wont lose nathan so youll run off and get yourself killed instead tears were forming in alyssas eyes zusa hardened her heart best she could against them far better me than you she whispered alyssa kissed her cheek then wrapped her arms about her zusa tilted her head just the slightest opening enough for alyssa to press her face against her neck and let her tears wet her skin with everyone else i must be strong said alyssa with everyone else i must be a lie dont you dare leave me alone you come back understand me you come back zusa gently pushed her away then kissed her on the forehead help me put on my cloak she said that done zusa went to the door put her hand on the wood alyssa she said trying to find the words i want you to know whatever it is you think you should say dont alyssa said and her face hardened along with her resolve youre coming back remember zusa smiled at her of course my mistress she said then vanished into the corridors of the mansion she weaved through them like a ghost slipped through the courtyard without being seen by the guards and then vaulted over the fence she could only hope the other faceless would not attack in her absence shed searched the grounds for hours before leaving just to be sure but there was no way to know for certain it was a gamble but one she had to take shed made daverik a promise if he came after alyssa and her family then nothing would protect him it was a promise she had every intention of keeping she kept to the streets needing speed more than anything her strike had to come before the temple decided to act again the mob had failed to accomplish their goal and her daggers had protected alyssa from their faceless two failuresit would be too much to expect a third zusa slowed as she neared the temple to most it would have appeared to be a large wellfurnished private mansion but those who knew how to look who had bent the knee to karak saw differently they saw a great temple cut from black marble the path to it lined with stone statues of lions roared from atop various pillars their teeth sharp their eyes always watching zusa remembered her final day within it the day shed been stripped and banished the faceless unworthy of karaks presence were boarded elsewhere zusa had been tempted to seek out the faceless where they slept but they were just puppets not the real threat even with their deaths more would come priests perhaps or dark paladins she had to find the reason for karaks ire and see if she could somehow defuse it with a running leap she sailed over the fence drawing her daggers in midair she landed with a quiet whisper of bending grass and sliding dirt in the silence of the night she let out a single prayer a soft blasphemy against the temple she was about to enter i have seen no love from you ashhur she breathed but i ask for it now help me kill him help me save my family the wind blew and she took that for her answer like an uncoiling serpent she moved a sudden burst without pause or doubt she knew the layout of the temple knew where thered be guards priests young disciples and serving women they would not have changed a thing over the ten years she knew karak was not fond of change especially when it came to his most devout followers her feet barely touched the grass as she ran gathering momentum it was suicide she knew to attack the temple head on even at night with her prey unprepared suicide her grin spread at full speed she leapt feet first toward the door of the temple the entranceway was dark with nothing but the stars to give it light eyes closed she focused thought of the inner chambers theyd be lit with torches but not the door deep in the entryway her feet did not touch wood but passed right on through she emerged on the other side and her daggers lashed out cutting the necks of two guards positioned on the interior as they fell behind her she landed on the soft carpet and tucked into a roll to preserve her momentum pulling out she raced between the pews toward the great statue of karak at the end of the gathering hall before it had been the altar theyd bled daverik upon she felt an impulse to kneel before the imposing statue that towered so greatly above her but fought it down that wasnt her god anymore to the left was a door into the greater complex where the priests slept it was there shed find daveriks room and with any luck shed get the answers she needed through the work of her daggers upon reaching the door she slammed into it with her shoulders blasting it inward entering a hallway she lunged extending her body to its fullest as a priest turned from his seat beneath a flickering torch an old tome in his lap the words of a spell were on his lips as the tip of her dagger pierced his throat silencing him her shoulder absorbed the impact of her landing and then she rolled past pulling her dagger free along the way blood gushed across the carpet so far so good but zusa knew shed been lucky the slightest cry of warning and everything would become much much harder still running she passed silently through the hall her cloak a ghost of cloth following after she tried to think of where daverik might be staying there had been no man teaching them last time instead a fellow member eliora had been the trainer and spiritual leader of the faceless that meant daverik would have no official room prepared for him such as there was for the high priest at a cross section she peered around the corner looking left and right she caught a man changing candles as he moved down the hall she waited until his back was to her before approaching her left arm pressed against his mouth the other shoving a dagger through his back and into his heart as he shuddered she let him drop then glanced about too many rooms she couldnt just open them at random where would daverik be he was new there she realized little more than a guest and guests had a specific place they were given the rooms far more ornate the intricate paintings exaggerating the power and importance of the priesthood urging herself on she glanced back wondering how long until someone found a body not long she had to move faster at the guests room she stopped and pressed her ear to the door she heard no movement no sign of life within but it was dark and daverik would most likely be asleep gently she grabbed the doorknob and started to twist the door flung open with explosive force knocking her backward as she hit the opposite wall she rolled narrowly avoiding a kick from a faceless woman zusas daggers flashed out parrying stabs and then she was running down the hall back toward the entrance curses screamed in her mind when another faceless stepped in her way shadows curling off her body like smoke zusa knew it for what it was a trap laid out just for her you wont stop me she cried leaping at her foe they collided in a mess of limbs and daggers lashing and stabbing neither able to score a solid blow pulling herself free zusa dropped to her back ducking beneath a hurled dagger from the other hoping to gain some distance she ran again but doors started opening and she heard the deep thrumming of a bell located in the bowels of the temple alerting all to her presence one man tried to jump in her way but she slammed right into him her knees blasting him to the ground her daggers ending the spell hed tried to cast another this one a priestess remained in her doorway and at her passing she hurled a bolt of red lightning the power arced through zusas body and she screamed her agony away the spell slowed her movement and a foot swept beneath her falling she raised her daggers just barely blocking ezras downward strike pushing her away she rolled to her knees a bolt of shadow flung from another priest rushing to join them from further ahead she dodged it along with his followup but then the priestess caught her with a shadow bolt of her own it slammed into her body bruising flesh and sapping at her strength this time zusa gave no scream unable to muster the strength the two faceless women surrounded her each blocking an entrance as more and more priests and priestesses gathered zusa kept weaving side to side struggling to breathe through the pain she saw no way out but it didnt matter shed die fighting and would not die alone attack me cowards she screamed ignoring the pain it caused instead they fell back and furious she flung herself toward a group her daggers plunged and stabbed but she could not connect lightning and shadow swelled against her forming a wall she could not penetrate its very touch jolted her limbs the faceless women both chose that moment to attack kicking her with their long legs one took the air from her lungs the other connecting with her kidneys gasping zusa collapsed to the cold floor unable to stand a dagger slipped around her neck and pressed against her throat dont kill her through dazed eyes zusa looked up to see daverik pushing through the crowd he knelt before her and put a hand against her forehead as whoever held the dagger backed off you poor thing he said letting her go you poor foolish thing take her something hard struck the back of her head and then came darkness the first thing zusa noticed when she came to was the sound of running water it was constant and close as if a river fell in the same room the second was how her hands and legs were bound with chains the metal on the inside sharp and jagged so that the slightest movement drew blood open your eyes little doll whispered a sweet voice zusa did and saw an older man standing over her his face was wrinkled and free of any facial hair his eyes were a pale blue and when he smiled his serpents smile it was without teeth he wore the robes of a priest but instead of black they were a deep red who are you she asked does the little doll not remember me i am vrashka i was there when you were banished and your little boy beaten i held the whip do you not remember despite the years she did indeed remember more so she remembered the name of vrashka peloraks most favorite and ruthless torturer i know you zusa said looking beyond him to take in her surroundings she was in a small stone cell poorly lit the temples prison of course she sat on the floor her arms and legs manacled to the wall the only thing she did not recognize nor understand was that constant sound of water just a sick old man its been a long time vrashka said stepping back and crossing his arms over his chest so he could look down at her i have gotten older yes i have little doll but i have also gotten wiser too do you see this he stepped aside revealing the source of the water it was a strange sight as if a stalactite had grown from the stone ceiling stretching a foot downward it stopped its tip hollow so that water might run out in a constant stream it fell into a small spiral cut into the floor causing the water to swirl before dropping into a hole going how far down below zusa did not know perhaps to the depths of the world perhaps all the way into the abyss where it could trickle on karaks head am i supposed to be afraid of water zusa asked hoping to keep him talking she felt her strength returning and where she was manacled there were many shadows the chains would not hold her not for long vrashka chuckled and the sound made her skin crawl you have poor imagination girl you do not understand where you are or what we have daverik made this himself i know what you think that you will slip into the shadows he reached into his robe pulled out one of her daggers and cast it on the floor mere feet away take it he said smiling slip through the shadows grab it and cut my throat you can do that cant you little doll she smiled back then pulled in the power demanded it stole it with the strength of her soul falling backward she expected the same cold feeling but instead something grabbed her she felt like a bird trapped in a thunderstorm her body became a distant thing and lost in horror she watched her vision pulled toward the swirling water it was so thin like a single thread of silk before her eyes it grew larger larger and her whole form was swirling with it down into the void a boat doomed into a maelstrom colors faded only the water retaining vibrancy shining a brighter and brighter blue that made her entire body ache panic settled in and she yearned for her body to pull out from the shadows and then she was back in her manacles gasping for air vrashka knelt down and grabbed her dagger does she understand now he asked your magic will not work here nor that of any priest it will be lost into the funnel the holy water taking in every bit of karaks power you will not escape us little doll you are ours now to be made pure over the crawling years he knelt before her and pressed the dagger against the skin of her breast and i say years because i know you are stubborn i know you will resist much time much effort but i have little else to do at my age you wear the wrappings of your order but in your heart you blaspheme against karak you expose your face to the world and in doing so spit in the eye of our god he withdrew the dagger and walked over to the door beside it was a small bag and he pulled out a set of sewing needles when he turned back to her his pale blue eyes were feverish whatever you came here for you failed think on that as i do my needlework the chains held her as he took her hand in his and uncurled her fist she tried to tense but he held her firm with surprising strength struggling anymore would press her arms against the inner barbs of the manacles only hurting her further taking a needle into his mouth he softly ran a finger along her fingertip even old as i am it is never too old to learn he said i spent time with stephens gentle touchers not so long ago did you know that you will soon they are masters artists i hope my needle work can begin to compare there were many hooks along the wall and he looped the chains holding her arm through one so that it held her tight teeth grit she tried not to let out a cry even when he jammed the first needle underneath the fingernail of her forefinger karak is not my god she said struggling to keep her voice firm i will not repent he smiled at her perhaps but i have many needles one after another they jammed into her skin each was worse than the one before and she cried out in agony after the seventh leaving them in he moved on to her other hand even more slender needles pierced underneath her fingernails bleeding and tearing the soft skin tears ran down her face but he asked no questions and made no demands time became meaningless all she could think of was alyssa and nathaniel but their memories were poison for she was doomed in a prison which meant they would soon suffer death or even worse join her there in the pits of the temple the gentle touchers are artists vrashka said sitting back to observe his work so careful so clever they view whips and daggers as crude toys for children it is a mark of disdain for any of them to leave a bruise zusa kept her head low not caring to look at him or acknowledge his words her hands shook uncontrollably and she felt her blood trickling down her wrists as he crept closer she shut her eyes tried to imagine herself far far away his rough hands grabbed her face forced her to look up at him such beautiful eyes he said staring into them but you do not need them anymore just a tongue to pray and knees to confess upon he was reaching for another needle when the door opened and daverik stepped inside i would have a word with her he said vrashka stepped back bowing low of course he said she is yours to convert but it will take time and i have only started to break her she might see reason daverik said not looking at her vrashka bowed again then stepped out as the door closed the priest noticed the needles still in her fingers and frowned i warned you he said now keep still not sure i can she said she felt his hand close around hers pinning it to the wall one by one he removed the needles dropping them into a bloody pail vrashka had brought with him switching to the other hand he worked in silence zusa kept her eyes downcast let her mind focus on the pain as the needles slid out from within her fingertips when he was done he sat opposite her and pushed aside vrashkas bag tension filled the room broken only by the soft trickle of water you set a trap for me zusa said i thought youd come yes she shook her head feeling like a stupid child her warning had been clear so of course daverik had planned for her arrival eyes still downcast she wondered if she had anything to say to him but found herself strangely empty inside they want you executed daverik said he paused a moment as if waiting to see if she would respond she didnt im not sure i can stop them he continued you killed two of my faceless and you have blasphemed against karak many years now by showing your face when your order went rogue you also fought against one of our paladins sent to retrieve you his name was ethric she said i killed him in a river cut out his throat and then left him there so the fish could eat his flesh hed been sent to kill me not return me to the temple someone is telling you lies we did as we were told as we have always done and were branded outcasts for it but thats what karak does isnt it he finds ways to punish his faithful should they ever be an inconvenience to his temple our lives are nothing to him youre wrong daverik said karak showed you forgiveness he gave you a chance to repent to make right the wrongs what wrongs she laughed our love wasnt wrong it wasnt sin it was just against the rules it complicated things made people worry but you were lashed and i imprisoned and now you come here to remake the order that took me from you youre a disgrace they didnt take you from me he said it felt as if a fever had overcome her and she laughed again her hands were giant throbs of pain and she could not feel her individual fingers they didnt then who it was me daverik said and he looked away as if ashamed i told them of our affair the last words hed spoken to her echoed in her head im sorry you bastard she whispered you damn stupid bastard why why would you do that to us because we would have been caught daverik said standing so he might pace his eyes never met hers because it was only a matter of time and because it was wrong i neglected prayers i stopped paying attention in services i only thought about you cared about you when i should have been meditating i was thinking of seeing you imagining what i might do the next time we he stopped himself frustrated he struck the wall with his fist zusa wanted to feel fury to feel betrayal but instead she saw the torment deep within her former lover and suddenly she knew what brought him back you came to veldaren for me she said just for me he looked to the door nodded his head ive felt guilt every single night i lay down to bed i thought it would get better i thought the certainty of my faith would prove what really mattered and that in time with separation id know without a doubt id been right but it never happened that i am to train the new faceless is a cruel joke zusa but i did it for you you can come back we can be together perhaps not as we were but id still see you still be able to hear your voice he breathed in deep then let it out in a sigh my decision cost you your faith in karak i have committed no greater a crime than that zusas anger had been softening but those last words were like vrashkas needles only this time piercing her heart are you really still so blind she asked you carry guilt not for my torment but because i turned my back on karak what could be worse a crime he asked to see you lost to the fires of the abyss he approached her knelt before her so they might see eye to eye his hand gently stroked her cheek brushing away tears come back to me he whispered i dont want to lose you not again and not forever he looked so young then so much like the boy shed loved his face was leaning ever closer she knew what he wanted to do but could not stop him as his lips closed around hers she felt her insides twist and curl with turmoil she felt fury at his foolishness yet hope that he might free her she felt sick at his desires that he could find beauty in her while captive and tortured yet at the same time it was so easy to slip back into the past to escape from her cell into memories of him and her young foolish and clumsy she felt pain sorrow and betrayal her lips did not kiss him back when he tried to kiss her again she turned to the side and steeled her gaze at the wall youre a cruel evil man she whispered you dont mean that i do you were a fool a naive child to have done what you did but that was then for you to still think it now to kiss my naked face while begging me to have it covered shows just how sick your soul has become his whole body tensed and for a moment she thought he would strike her but he did not only stood and went to the door so he could lean his back against it i warned you to stay away from alyssa he said that she still lives is a miracle but it wont be long before her death its inevitable zusa you should know that we are the servants of karak and we will not be swayed what has she done to you its not what shes done but what she represents the world is changing and we are paving the way for the end times the order has been given to take her life and bring the trifect crumbling down who zusa asked despite her situation she had to know if she was to die at least she could know who desired it who gave the order daverik stared at her for a moment thinking im sorry he said i cannot speak his name good night zusa ill buy you some time before vrashka returns claim that im giving you a day or two to think on my request come back to the order and all will be forgiven they wont let me come back zusa said as he opened the door you know that what would stop me from leaving once i am free of the temple what would keep me chained and bound to the faceless the moment i accept myself into the faceless is the moment i die but thats what you want isnt it at least my soul would be saved she could not deny the hurt she saw in daveriks eyes at her words someone will bring you food in a few hours he said rest well the door closed plummeting her into darkness the water glowed a soft blue yet it cast no light about the room the sight of it sickened her so she closed her eyes shifted her arms as much as she could given the constraint of the manacles and tried to sleep one after another died to the executioners axe and the sight slowly calmed victors nerves the deal hed made with the thief alan had left a bad taste in his mouth the results however were undeniable the spider guild was all but crushed except for one niggling detail that kept victor pacing everywhere he went somehow thren felhorn had escaped the one person that mattered and he had gotten through their lines its been a good day said sef joining him there in the shadow of the castle as the sun began to fall could have gone better victor said nodding toward the executioners block thren could be up there bound and gagged well have his head hanging from the city gates soon enough sef said but the whole citys buzzing about it our men are reporting people far more willing to talk now their lips loosening i think after last night everyone expected a war for something like what happened before but instead they got a bunch of dead thieves and their symbolic leader broken and in hiding so what youre saying victor said finally cracking a smile is that it was a good day thats correct sir victor laughed was there something you needed sef nodded our majestys advisor is ready to speak with you hed said hed meet you in his chambers in the castle to discuss your request tell gerand ill be there shortly victor said turning back to the raised platform theres still a few more awaiting the axe sef bowed low of course enjoy your show thieves murderers and lowborn thugs trudged up the steps their crimes labeled categorized and proven to the necessary extent then came the axe for victor it wasnt enjoyment and truthfully he would have been disturbed to feel that way upon seeing another man die no as the axe fell and the head separated from neck he felt his city taking one tiny step closer to peace it carried the same satisfaction as pulling a flea from a dog or yanking a weed from a garden a sick immoral life was snuffed out they would commit no more crimes frighten no more innocents and take no more lives step by step up the stairs before the executioner and then the chopping block step by step when it was done victor went into the kings castle and trudged up the stairs to gerands room he knocked on the door and was quickly let it gerands room was a tidy place well furnished for its small size taking a seat at his desk gerand motioned for victor to sit in the only other chair which he did it was overly stuffed and far from comfortable i thank you for coming to see me so late gerand said i should be thanking you for not making me wait another day victor said gerand smiled at the comment but he didnt look amused it was almost like a trained response to anyone attempting wit ive gone over your request gerand said leaning back in his chair and while your results are impressive and the costs you listed for hiring your soldiers fair i am not sure the kings treasury is ready to pay just yet why is that victor asked have i not crushed the strongest most dangerous guild in your citys history surely that is worth a partial advance on the compensation i was promised perhaps gerand tapped his fingers together collected his thoughts you see victor while his majesty might be rash and willing to agree to things without much thought i try to be a bit morepatient i like to peer deeper into things and ive done so with your family i know who youve done business with from every major trader and merchant victors eyes narrowed is that so it is when the kings advisor comes calling people tend to talk no one wants to let things becomeunpleasant and since youve given me the costs to train and hire your men it was a simple matter to compare that to what i learned of your wheat trade do you know what i found out what is that advisor gerand breathed in deep wrapped his fingers together his face was emotionless a wellcontrolled mask to hide whatever it was he felt youre broke victor you cant afford your own army the words sent a chill down victors spine but he did his best to hide it just like gerand thats preposterous he said is it asked gerand his eyebrows lifting your lands are not large and such skilled men as yours are not cheap especially for the danger they face and the time youve committed them to perhaps a few youve promised a pittance of land but you dont have much to give even if youve been saving for the past five years or so which i honestly believe you have within a few weeks your men will want another portion of their pay and you simply wont have it which of course brings us to your request for an advance gerand leaned back clearly giving victor an opportunity to speak he tried to think to know what was expected of him what ive done has helped this city he said deciding to be honest in his appeal you have to know this after everything ive accomplished surely his majesty can issue in good faith a portion gerand waved a hand interrupting him his majesty will do as i say in this so long as i convince him hell sleep safer at night i am the one you must convince so direct your arguments to me what makes you think i should trust you with such wealth youve seen my men combing the streets youve seen the scum ive brought to your judges even the trifect has opened their books to me for what reason would you doubt me gerand waved a hand at him stay calm friend i have no time for anger or personal insult and forgive my mannerswould you care for a drink the advisor poured them both a glass of wine and victor accepted it reluctantly once gerand had taken a sip victor did so as well it was fine vintage and despite himself victor drank half the glass so you wonder why i should doubt you after all ive seen gerand said setting his glass beside him at his desk that is exactly the point ive seen you driven to put your life in danger risking every shred of your wealth to hire and train men to accomplish this fanatical quest i can only imagine how many moneylenders are eyeing your wheat fields even as we speak yet what i dont know is why what could possibly drive you to such lengths why does it matter my reason so long as my motives are pure victor asked are they pure i dont know and i dont much care but it matters to me because i do not like entrusting the streets to a madman and to me you carry the look of a madman it sparkles in your eyes sane men do not give up everything for others im sorry that is something i do not trust in my gut so tell me something i can believe that will convince me to open the treasury to you and i will do so you dont trust someone to give everything to sweat and bleed for others victor said you are a sad bitter man if that is true but if you dont trust that then what of vengeance gerand is that something you can trust perhaps then know that what i do i do for the honor of my parents i do so to avenge my childhood the crimes these guilds have committed against me are loathsome and if you have looked into me as you say then you know what theyve done my parents did not deserve that it should never have happened never and i will do whatever it takes to break every person involved and lay their corpses before the memory of my mother and father victor crossed his arms and he felt like one awaiting judgment so tell me he said am i still a madman gerand chuckled perhaps but if you are youre a madman i can understand that is all that matters i will give you the advance you requested plus half over but i want you to remember something victor if you are wise youll listen well if you accomplish what you desire if you keep breaking the guilds one by one then ill make sure your men remain paid in secret and quiet so none will know of his majestys involvement but if you fail then ill suddenly discover how you attempted to defraud the castle and lied about your wealth in vain hopes of having our treasury pay for your illconceived crusade in short either they hang or you do have i made myself clear victor swallowed down both saliva and his pride then nodded i do he said gerand waved a dismissive hand good now go ill send the gold sometime in the next few days once its clear this peace will actually last victor stood and bowed to the advisor you are most gracious he said each word like a bee sting on his tongue you can hate me if you wish but you shouldnt gerand said sensing his frustration im your friend in this i have no love for these guilds either theyve threatened my life plenty even in this very room but my friendship extends only as far as your usefulness i have faith in you and i do have hope that youre the right madman to create something good in veldaren besides with the watcher dead someone needs to inspire fear in the heart of thieves victor chuckled hes not dead he said gerand shrugged then well have two madman spilling the blood of the underworld instead of one try to get along they had the bar to themselves just as carson bloodcraft preferred he sat facing the door his back to the wall no one would sneak up on him a fool might try to prevent his exit thinking him trapped but such a fool was no threat to him just an inconvenience at best given how young the night was the tavern should have been teeming with activity but some coins and a few simple words had changed that i think we might have underestimated our foes carson said pushing powder into his longneck pipe it was the finest leaf available in mordeina and hed brought it with him all the way across the continent to veldaren just their tenacity for survival said nora bloodcraft his wife she sat opposite him trusting him to alert her to any threat unlike his short dark hair she had beautiful blond hair tied into a tight ponytail that ran across her neck down her chest and to her waist they both wore crimson coats made of the finest leather and then stained to identify their mercenary band nora seeing his pipe full leaned forward and snapped her fingers the leaf smoldered and began to smoke leaning back carson drew in a long breath and then sighed need to ration this better he said looking down at his pouch hed used too much on the trip over last thing he needed was to go bartering for whatever shit they grew in neldar and perhaps youre right they present no greater threat than we thought but their ability to survive is admirable they seem to lack any pride or honor at least when it comes to fleeing a fight pride and honor would just get them killed anyway we should have known better its our own fault for trusting that weasel laerek said percy bloodcraft carrying three drinks from the barkeep who stood behind the bar skin pale hands shaking theyd told him only once to leave them be and made it clear what might happen if he did not the chubby fellow kept glancing at the door where the bodies of two men lay both having been foolish enough to ignore the bloodcrafts request for privacy one had bled out from a gash running from belly to throat the others face was a charred husk with faint flecks of white bone showing percy sat beside nora put down the drinks and then leaned back in his chair he had no biological relation to nora and carson but like all members of the bloodcraft mercenaries since their creation percy had been adopted into the family once his skills were proven suitable he looked like he was nothing but bone and hair but he was fast hidden in the folds of his crimson coat were dozens of knives of all sizes and he could make each one fly like a bird on the wind his hair was a soft brown the only thing beautiful about him were new to this city carson said ignoring the drink set before him we must make do with the information we are given sure thing father but wouldnt it make more sense to doubt everything instead carson and nora were not much older than percy but hed taken to calling them mother and father ever since joining the bloodcrafts something about it amused him perhaps how it managed to get underneath carsons skin with how our day has gone nora said tasting her drink and then frowning at it perhaps it does the ash guild avoided our ambush with nary a casualty even worsewhere is nicholas nicholas is dead percy said smirking you know it i know it we all do i told you i should have gone with him his abilities were a perfect counter to the eschaton carson said breathing in more from the pipe the ash guild was more of an unknown and posed the greater risk well it looks like you calculated wrong nora shook her head that or the watcher still lives if his rumors are to be believed he could have achieved victory surely it took someone of his skill with a blade to kill nicholas laerek assured us the man was dead carson said i might have a word with him his poor information has cost us dearly if the watcher killed nicholas then we need to hunt him down and return the favor percy said leaning forward in his seat and drumming the table with his fingers carson saw the eagerness there and it amused him greatly theres little word on who he is or who his loved ones are carson said all we know is of his allegiance to the eschaton percy shrugged someone will talk someone has to know all we have to do is find out and do a little knife work and well have him helpless the door opened carson leaned to the side to see better past his wife it was a woman slender with long brown hair that curled down around her shoulders her dress was plain but clean and of a soft blue miss the barkeep said please you should go no men here to buy a whore percy said glancing back and seeing her go on your way the woman stepped around the two mutilated bodies seeming unfazed by them carson narrowed his eyes and then he began to laugh my my he said i think weve found our widow the woman did not sit at their table but the one beside them as if uncomfortable with their presence she kept her hair low over her face and when she talked it was a strained whisper that carson had to struggle to hear laerek said i could find you here well thats the first thing laereks been right about so far percy said but he was the only one to laugh the city seems to know you well nora said carson could tell his wife was examining her closely trying to reach an opinion of some sort he trusted her ability to read someone and when their talk was done hed listen well to what she had to say yet i wonder why all youve done is kill a few members of a guild others do it all the time why are you so special to laerek or to us people die all the time the strange woman said i give the city something to remember to both fear and enjoy whats your real name carson asked putting aside his pipe dont you know im the widow the woman laughed and something about it unsettled carsons stomach he shifted in his seat and his hand reached for the sword strapped to his belt keep your secrets then nora said whatever laereks plan is let him keep it but why are you here what business do you have with us im here to help you she said percy laughed and even carson had to fight to keep down a chuckle is that so he asked who are you to help us and help us do what exactly i know this city the widow said know it far better than you ive seen its gross underbelly know its scabs and scars if you want i can draw the watcher out youll have a clean shot all of you all i ask is that you kill him quickly i dont want him to escape and trouble me further carson looked to the other two noras nod showed she approved her gut told her that the widow was to be believed percy merely shrugged its either the watcher or the ash he said we need to stick together no matter who we go after carson nodded but percys remark about trusting no one still echoed in his head he looked to this strange nameless woman then gestured for her to continue go ahead he said lets hear your plan the first night was terrible but nathaniel managed several times he woke up thinking hed heard a noise or that hed seen movement in the shadows zusa he called out each time squinting to see always nothing but he couldnt help but think monsters lurked within the dark corners of his room normally he told himself it was zusa but he knew it wasnt shed left somehow by the way his mother had kissed him goodnight he knew she was gone the night crawled along until at long last daylight met his ragged eyes the day came and went him sleepwalking through most of it at one point he fell asleep at the table his uneaten food beside his face one of the servant women had scolded him harshly for that and hed only been able to offer the most meager of apologies all the while he waited for zusas return and waited the servants whispered of how the previous night had been far safer and that victor was winning over the city nathaniel knew this should have made his mother happier but it did not night came again and zusa still hadnt returned nathaniel once more tried to sleep alone in his room but this time he heard monsters scratching and every shadow bore a blade he squeezed his eyes shut and pushed his face into a pillow but then they were all around him stepping closer mouths drooling claws reaching zusa wasnt there to protect him his mothers guards werent about to rescue him it took all his courage to pull down his blankets and look and no matter how many times he saw his room empty he knew without a doubt they were there at last hed gotten up and left he felt like a thief sneaking through the dark halls but at each corner stood a house guard looking somber and dangerous in the lantern light they watched him as he passed and it made his skin crawl at his mothers room he stopped and gently pushed open the door with his arm mother he called out at first nothing then louder mother im here nathan she said and he saw a feminine form lean up from the pillows nathaniel curled his shoulders together and he grabbed his stump with his other hand as if he were cold im scared he said the question within was implicit and his mother heard it well come here she said the beds big enough he climbed up and then crawled forward until he reached the top his mothers arms wrapped about him as he curled against her and lay his head on a pillow immediately he felt his fears ebbing and his exhaustion clawed at him with pent up fury getting too big for this alyssa said as she moved to give him room im sorry she kissed the back of his neck to show she wasnt angry nathaniel shifted and slid his legs underneath the blanket momwhen is zusa coming back for a long while she did not answer i dont know she said at last nathaniel closed his eyes glad to be safe from the monsters glad that he could rest still the question nagged at him she is coming back isnt she he asked an even longer pause his mother sniffed and he realized she was crying it made his stomach queasy and he pulled himself into a tighter ball to fight the uncomfortable feeling growing in his chest i hope so his mother said he felt her fingers brushed against his face lovingly touching his features with her fingertips gods i hope so he didnt know what to say but he wanted to comfort her he wanted to make her feel better i hope so too he said he closed his eyes and slept come the morning he awoke to find himself alone in the bed feeling embarrassed he slid out from the blankets and hurried back to his room to change on his way there he passed by his grandmothers room the door was cracked open and he heard voices from within the past two nights had left him wary and something about the hushed tones made him slow pressing against the wall he peered inside to see lord gandrem talking with his grandmother melody sat on the bed and he could just barely see her hands as they gestured along with her words john stood before her arms crossed his face was turned away so he could not read his expression i cannot leave my lands unprotected john was saying surely between stephen and your daughter the house guards are sufficient they arent melody insisted alyssa lost so many and is yet to rehire instead focusing on repairing her mansion she puts her faith in that strange woman zusa i dont trust her john i just dont and stephens guards are loyal only to him john sighed and looked away right toward the door nathaniels breath caught in his throat and he pulled back and pressed himself tighter against the wall counting to five before peering in again he saw his grandmother had stood and put her arms around johns waist my lands are tame and my steward is a good man and runs my affairs well he said nathaniel could hear weakness in his voice a bending of his will toward his grandmother are you really so sure we need more men to protect us what of lord kane they say victor has done much to make the city safe im scared john melody said pressing tighter against him i came back from such a dark place i dont want to be scared anymore victor cant be everywhere and those thieves are like rabid dogs you saw what they did to our mansion theyll come again theyll come with torches with daggers withwith she buried her face into his neck and as she shuddered john wrapped his arms about her i just want to feel safe she said is that so terrible of me of course not john said ill send for my footmen theyll stay until all of this business in veldaren settles down in response melody kissed him across the mouth thank you she said then kissed him again thank you her hands were at his belt tugging john reached down and grabbed one of her breasts nathaniel ran scared and confused and wanting to see no more thren watched as the men and women gathered about the entrance to the alley all thin and meager looking they surrounded the hooded figure who kept looking for guards as he took in silver and gave out his crimleaf as if guards would come to the southern district they were too busy in the north and west protecting the trade and homes of the wealthy no guards thren knew no control the suns had come into the lawless anarchy of the slums and it was time they paid for it he kept his walk lumbering as if he was just another overworked member of the city barely staving off his hunger each day hed discarded his guild colors instead wrapping a thin coat about him it was dark brown stained and had many holes but it hid the swords strapped at his waist which was all that mattered there were three men still buying when thren joined them lurking at their backs shit man wasnt it just one silver argued the closest his eyes were bloodshot and lice crawled in his hair its two now said the sun thief dont act all pissed off either you know you still cant get it cheaper elsewhere not by a mile i wouldnt buy from him thren said stepping closer piss off and mind your own the thief said glaring my leafs good and my prices fair thats not why thren said taking another step its just not wise to buy from a dead man he leapt forward shortsword drawn it rammed into the mans stomach a twist and a yank sent his innards spilling out across the ground two of the three men fled while the third made a desperate lunge for the falling bag of crimleaf a single wellplaced kick knocked the man out sprawling him beside the corpse cleaning his blade thren then sheathed it and knelt down to grab the bag save your coin for food he said to the unconscious man spitting on his chest leaf pocketed he ran back into the alley hooked a right and then emerged into heavier traffic where he allowed himself to slow one by one hed been taking out the sun pushers always on the lookout for the ones who strayed too far from the rest or were too foolish to have others with them for protection it was slow work but hed killed five so far in a few more days hed have another five and by then another fifty suns might have moved in from the west he shook his head it was a losing battle perhaps but hed still fight it until he knew of a way to really hurt grayson out of instinct he traveled toward his old territory now claimed by three separate guilds not that he was surprised with the city turning wilder by the hour such a vacancy would never last long a thought hit him an image of other guilds using his former base as their own and it stirred an anger in his chest heading that way he found the old tavern now shuttered and closed down after victors raid the upper levels were ruined by the fire but what of the underground portion it was a risk doing so in daylight but he went ahead anyway what did caution matter now that his guild was disbanded he opened the door to the stairs downward and found everything dark sighing with relief he stepped further in grabbing a lantern hanging from the side he checked it for oil found a little and then nodded in a gap in the wall he pulled out some flint and after a few sparks had the lantern lit holding it aloft he stepped down into his former headquarters everything was in disarray tables were overturned chairs broken guards had torn it apart in their search the small slanted windows near the ceiling were covered with cloth and one by one thren yanked them off letting in more light at first he was confused as to why the guards would have done so and then he saw the lone upright table in the center no he whispered feeling his fury rise damn it how dare you do this now one of his former members lay on the table arms and legs spread wide an arrow protruded from his chest carrying the lantern over he felt stones turn in his gut as the light glinted off silver coins in the mans eyes alan thren realized his name was alan after the raid all of the captured spider guildmembers had been questioned and brought before judges those who turned on others had been spared and sent away alan had been one of them pulling open his mouth he found the two gold coins there as always lifting the lantern he looked at the opposite wall for the message silver silver gold and gold here in the thief den where are you spider where are you thren it was written not once not twice but a dozen times all along the walls checking the body thren found a slit across alans neck no doubt where this madman had gotten the necessary amount of blood and thren knew for certain it was a madman unlike in the streets he or she had had time in the basement and theyd indulged themselves with the display everywhere he cast his lantern light he saw the message and it left no question as to whom itd been intended for the killings had nothing to do with his guild nothing to do with power or territory someone wanted him to suffer whatever vendetta they had it was personal im here thren shouted kicking the table so it slid a foot and rocking the body atop it you want me here i am think youll take my eyes think youll shove gold coins down my throat here right here childish outburst out of the way thren forced himself to calm down to think if the widow had taken his time then so could he first he needed more light than the little coming in through the windows much of their things had been ransacked but he found a discarded skin with a bit more oil in it and he refilled the lantern set it to burning brighter that done he dug through the scattered mess in the supply room scavenging a few candles that he lit and placed about that done he began his investigation he started with the body looking it over for any sort of clue he found no sign of clothing no dropped personal items moving on to the floor he looked but again found little too much tramping about by guards too much activity prior to their arrival next he scanned the messages each one he read them all to see if they said the same he looked for any hint to the mindset of the widow even something as basic as whether or not the man or woman wrote with their right hand or left on the sixth message he checked he at last found his clue pressed against the wall and held there by dried blood was a long strand of brown hair clearly that of a woman thren pulled it free and then wrapped it around his finger at least he had a color to go on a flash of thought and he grinned no he had far more than that returning to alans body he took the silver and gold before rushing out the council of mages presence was weak in veldaren but they did have a few members they were unanimously unimpressive failures to master the craft thren viewed them as little more than charlatans taking the coin of others and offering petty fortunes and trinkets in return one such charlatan however had been somewhat useful in what felt like an age past a wizard had once been a member of the spider guild it was his shop thren went to the hair still tightly wrapped around his finger inside was cramped with hardly room for three men to stand side by side the fat wizard sat on a stool only a table separating him from the door a few odds and ends hung from the walls and behind the wizard was a shelf full of jars each containing a strange organ or insect from experience thren knew little of them were necessary for spells only kept there for looks welcome welcome said the wizard most of his clothing was simple dull browns and grays but he wore a thin green robe over it no doubt meant to impress the simpletons thren snorted at the sight hello cregon thren said how has business fared since you tossed aside your cloak cregon leaned closer and then his eyes widened as he realized who was before him yyyou let me go willingly he stammered and i know my protection moneys not been consistent but business comes and goes drop it thren said taking a seat opposite the wizard if i wanted you dead id just kill you i have a use for your talents talents cregon asked he was already sweating the sight of it disgusted thren sure hed been useful but hed let the man go just because he couldnt stand the sight of his bloated self talents of course whatever you need im sure i can help what spell would you like or do you need some sort of enchantment i need a scrying spell thren said cregon licked his lips who is it if theyre unknown to me ill need a drawing or strongly personal object to see them i dont know who she is and dont care about her name or what shes doing i just need to know where to find her cregon nodded but thren could tell he was starting to worry thats better but still not cheap nor easy do you have anything of hers in answer thren tossed the silver and gold hed taken from alans body then put the strand of hair atop it thats for the cost and thats for the spell thren explained just a location cregon pocketed the coins then grabbed the hair he frowned at it as he wrapped it twice around his beefy hand not a lot to go on he said but i think i can manage this person important to you in some way thren chuckled you might say that i want her dead but to do that i need to find her cregon nodded the movement shaking his fat jowls of course of course just wait a moment ill see what i can do he put his hands over the hair closed his eyes and began murmuring the spidery words of magic thren waited wise enough to not interrupt such an incantation a soft light surrounded cregons fingers and then it plunged into the hair it shimmered yellow then faded cregon frowned what is it thren asked i found her he said but its somewhere dark not a buildingi dont know its outside the city though not far from the wall not good enough cregon i need to know where to look im telling you its just beyond the west wall little bit off the road into the city i cant tell you how to get there when there is nothing maybe its a camp thren stood and his hand fell to the hilt of a shortsword can you find the way he asked cregons eyes widened and he nodded good then close up shop youre leading me there cregon locked the door to the shop pocketed the key and then hurried off thren followed lurking a few feet behind him pick up the pace thren told him rolling his eyes the man looked like a pregnant sow trying to waddle on two legs i dont want this widow to move before we get there the widow cregon asked glancing behind him thats who were looking for it is now move cregon hurried faster huffing and puffing as they made for the west gate a few passing by recognized him and said hello and the wizard tipped his hat in return at the gate the guards waved him on by without a word thren followed looking much like the poor commoner and hardly earning a second glance how far thren asked as they traveled the road not far cregon said very much out of breath not he swallowed not far quarter mile from the city cregon turned sharply off the path realizing where they traveled thren quietly drew his shortswords thinking the wizard leading him into a trap cregon stopped just short and he gestured before him in there he said im sure of it hed taken them to a paupers graveyard where the city guards buried the nameless dead without a single copper in their possession to earn them a gravestone or marker this widow is still alive thren said youve made a mistake you must have no mistake cregon said i assure you she must be here thren pointed a shortsword toward the graveyard then find her cregon held the fist with the hair to his lips and he closed his eyes after a few whispers he opened them follow me near the far corner he stopped and with his heel he made a small x right here he said thren wanted to believe the wizard was lying to him but hed always been a coward and the fear in his eyes was genuine surely hed made a mistake but cregon appeared convinced otherwise go on back to your shop he said leave me be cregon was more than happy to obey when he trundled off thren remained staring at the mark in the dirt at last he returned to the city and swiped a trowel small enough to hide underneath his thin coat once more he walked to the graveyard and without a care for time began to dig the day passed by hour by hour as he unearthed the grave at last he hit bone and then started digging around it by the time the womans skull was revealed the sun had begun to set exhausted he sat back and viewed the results of his work the body was far from fresh at least several years buried to his untrained eye the dead woman still had her teeth and her fingernails as for her hair though he broke the skull free and lifted it up to the waning light all across the bare skull he saw tiny marks scratches as if from a small blade a wig thren said tossing the skull back into the shallow grave what is it you hide widow who are you really still he had a few clues now however meager standing he kicked dirt into the grave until the body was covered then looked back to veldaren her lanterns were starting to twinkle into existence one by one there was a time when thren had considered veldaren his city all his how far had he fallen to be outside it digging up a poor womans corpse while the rest of the guilds and trifect plotted and maneuvered hands clenched into fists he stabbed the trowel into the earth to serve as a burial marker alone he walked toward the road veldaren would be his city again he swore it once he had his vengeance once he knew who was out there pulling the strings of puppets he would retake his city brick by brick my city the thought put a grim smile on his face for a while hed accepted that the city was no longer his but his sons that was over the rumors of the watchers survival meant nothing to him hed started them playing the sham in a failed attempt to shame grayson in the eyes of the underworld but victors arrival had shifted things beyond his control had made it so grayson needed to only watch as threns guild was broken darkness settled across the land as he walked his path hed take it all back hed rebuild fight for it with every last measure of his skill he would find victory and if he couldnt then hed burn it all to the ground my city thought thren my city or ashes and rubble victor stepped inside his makeshift home and let out a sigh of relief another day over another twelve gone to the executioners blade the light was fading as the sun dipped below the walls of the city but inside was well lit and crowded with families still seeking refuge from the vengeance of the thief guilds wheres your guard sef asked sitting at the bar where victor joined him you did have a guard right what business of yours is that victor asked accepting the drink sef slid over to him my business is to keep you alive and to kill the rats of veldaren so far i think im doing better at one than the other victor shrugged the streets have grown calmer you know that sef rolled his eyes so no escort then at victors chuckle sef shook his head going to get your damn self killed victor i thought youd learned better cant help it i am no helpless child sef stroked at his beard a habit victor recognized well it meant sef was growing frustrated with him our foes arent so helpless either but if you want to go about trusting only your sword arm then go right ahead victor stood patted sef on the shoulder you know the gods have a better fate for me than dying to some soulless vagabond stay safe on your patrols tonight sef grunted thought you said the city had grown calmer victor grinned at him as he headed for the stairs did i but my advisors insist the world is still a dangerous place and i feel it best to listen bastard victor waved without looking at the top of the stairs were the two guards watching his room to ensure no one entered during his absence victor nodded at them then waited for his door to be unlocked sleep well milord said one as he pushed the door wide thats the hope as victor removed his armor he glanced at the far wall which was now plain and bare wood without painting or decoration the carpenters hed hired had rebuilt it at an impressive pace repairing the gaping hole tarlaks spell had left victor chuckled next time hed make sure he learned all the details of any spells that that wizard placed for his protection hed expected a few planks to fall loose or some magical porthole of sorts to open up when the wall had exploded out as if a dragon let loose its rage against it hed nearly soiled his armor of course it was his own fault for expecting subtlety from a wizard who dressed in bright yellow after checking underneath his bed victor climbed in lay down and tried to sleep try as he might sleep would not come tossing and turning he felt time crawling along the sounds from the tavern below quieted as those under his protection settled in as well that helped but only a little sleep had grown steadily rarer during his time in veldaren the faces of the men who died that day flashed before his eyes and he remembered them all joining the ghostly choir that wailed in his nightmares they all had something different to say some plea or explanation when they knelt before the chopping block it was as if they could never admit theyd done their wrongs for themselves to satisfy their own greed and lust they cried of children mothers families debts mistakes made and long forgotten histories they always insisted they regretted victor tossed and turned tossed and turned perhaps he needed to have the executioners use a gag on them the only other option was to not be present but he refused he might not swing the blade but he was the reason for their deaths and his pride demanded he be in their presence cowardly hiding might make it easier but that was the last thing he wanted he wanted it to be hard he wanted every death to weigh on him despite what he showed others the final moment when there was no one left to give to the executioners axe would be that much sweeter for it the night dragged on victors thoughts turned to his parents of brighter memories in his childhood lost in them he almost didnt hear the soft clink of armor hitting the floor almost victor tensed not once doubting his instincts and the danger they cried it might have just been his guard shifting positions but it didnt sound right it almost sounded like a guard had chosen to sit down something hed never ever do his sword was beside him on the floor just within reach trying to make little noise he reached down and lifted it still in its scabbard as the door crept open a crack he managed to slide it underneath his blankets victor halfclosed his eyes so that his intruder might believe him asleep with the smallest movements possible he held the hilt with one hand and pulled the scabbard down with the other didnt want to let them know didnt want to scare them off especially if there was more than one the door opened wider victor clenched his jaw to prevent any giveaway stay calm he told himself just wait still he quickened his pace with the scabbard the blade of his sword was halfway exposed but itd be cumbersome to use in the cramped quarters stupid stupid why didnt he just keep his dagger with him instead two men stepped inside each one carrying a small blade victor choked down his fury at his guards for letting such things pass by their scrutiny theyd slacked on their precautions because of how many came and went he had no doubt victor waited until they stepped all the way in and were just starting to move to opposite sides of his bed before he struck in a single motion he freed his sword from his scabbard and flung aside the blankets giving him freedom of movement if the men were surprised they showed no sign of it victor lashed out with his sword a long arc that had far more reach than they did with their daggers the one on the right tried to block but he lacked both the strength and weapon to do it victors sword bounced off angling it higher so the sword hit his neck instead of his chest it hit his neck bones with a wet chop victor tried to swing back to the other side to where the second thief was lunging but his blade had caught between two vertebrae panicking victor let go and fell back narrowly avoiding a slash he rolled away and off the bed trying to gain some distance theres no hope for you the assassin said his voice a whisper the crossbow bolt thudding into his neck seemed to say otherwise the assassin slumped to the bed and bled out on the sheets as victor scrambled to his feet a third man stood at the door miniature crossbow in hand he was an older man and wore the plain browns of a commoner friend the man said when victor reached for his sword that so victor asked putting a foot on the dead mans head so he could yank his blade free then who are you friend no lie milord im here to help my names gart antonil put me here to protect you the light was dim but victor saw gart pull down his shirt revealing a city guards tunic underneath as proof antonils keeping his eye on me is that it victor asked you expressed concern with the families staying here he thought it best to help keep an eye on them gart nodded at the two bodies caught them sneaking toward the stairs when they thought everyone asleep killed the guards at the stairs by your door real pros victor rolled over the one at his feet using his heel then looked him over any idea the guild victor asked not really not like theyd have been foolish enough to send people with colors or tattoos identifying them it made sense but was still frustrating standing he looked to gart and frowned at the crossbow howd you sneak that past my guards gart stood up straight i told them it was with the authority of the king and that they were to tell no one not even you if it makes you feel better your men were most displeased and i feared they might inform you despite my warnings victor felt his anger growing not only had two men come into his place of safety and nearly killed him but antonil was spying on him as well and hiding things from him its no longer safe here victor said grabbing his armor i told antonil bringing in civilians would put me at risk i told him they will not stay here not any longer and much as i owe you gart i still resent that your presence was kept hidden from me just following my orders milord i know its those orders i plan on questioning armor on sword buckled to his waist he stepped into the hall his guards lay slumped against the wall throats opened and tunics stained with blood victor closed their eyes with his fingers offered a silent word of thanks to the men who had given their lives to protect him and then he was moving on gart in tow summon your guard and have them clean up this mess victor told him after that start gathering the people here and bring them to the castle if antonil wants them kept safe and wants to position men in secret to guard them then let him take their responsibility in full i need no more assassins in my bedchambers milord im not sure if i should do that until victor spun on him while still halfway down the stairs i will speak with antonil myself and i assure you i will not have my request denied take them to the castle do you understand me the older man nodded as you wish milord they continued down the stairs to where the commoners slept all across the floor victor navigated around and then he and gart stepped out into the night four men stood guard at the door and they saluted when they realized it was him city guard will soon arrive victor told them help them in any way you can he started toward the castle unescorted one of his men called out after him milord victor glared back silencing his comment gart followed him a little ways then stopped nearest guard station is this way he said gesturing east i will be at the castle victor said not slowing safe travels gart didnt look happy but he left anyway victor knew he was being proud but he didnt care he was a skilled fighter and he wore his shining armor piss on anyone that thought him vulnerable the scum of the city needed to catch him sleeping in his bedclothes to even have a chance marching down the quiet night streets he made his way toward the center of the city then hooked north toward the castle only a few times did he see signs of life those of taverns burning their midnight oil to fill the poor and destitute with enough alcohol to forget their dreary lives victor both pitied them and despised them theyd be either fodder for thieves or new recruits once their lives continued to fall apart once they lost enough to believe they could never replace it without taking by force several times he thought he saw someone following him out of the corner of his eye a gray blur along the rooftops every time he turned back he saw nothing just nerves he told himself but his instincts said otherwise so be it he would show no fear it was the thieves that must fear him as he passed by a row of homes not much more than a quarter mile from the castle he heard a soft voice call out to him sir victor slowed and he glanced to his left a disheveled woman leaned against the side of home at the entrance to an alley bruises covered her face and there was blood in her long brown hair miss he asked taking a step toward her theyre taking everything she said starting to cry as she limped closer please theytheyplease help theyre in my home victor saw her torn clothes and felt his anger grow how many he asked drawing his sword and have they gone far theyre still back there the woman said please sir dont theres two of them i need the guard help me find the guard just stay here victor said hurrying past her ill bring you justice im not sure you can victor victor stopped cold in his tracks at her words he didnt want to believe it but there was no other way slowly he looked back and saw a crossbow in the womans hands her delicate lips were pulled into a smile justice she sneered pulling the trigger stupid thought victor as the bolt hit his side just below the curve of his breastplate proud and stupid he took a single faltering step then collapsed to his knees he felt his muscles going limp his armor heavier than he could carry his sword fell from his hand as he rolled onto his side only his eyes able to move with mounting dread and disappointment he watched the woman approach her smile growing there was no doubt as to whom she was he tried to whisper the word to call her the widow as was proper but his lips would not cooperate victor thought of the other bodies of their missing eyes and the messages written along the walls dimly he wondered if she wrote the message first or last and whether hed still be alive to watch her writing with his own blood i know you cant move she said kneeling down beside him from within the folds of her dress she pulled out a knife its sharp edge reflecting the starlight you might think you wont feel it but i assure you you will youll a gray shape descended upon her and she let out a cry as a heel slammed against her chest her momentum carried her until she hit a wall just beside the door to a lightless home victor felt hope stir in his chest the watcher loomed over him sabers drawn ive found you he said to the widow about damn time instead of showing fear the woman started laughing the sound of it chilling no watcher she said ive found you the door blasted open and out rushed a man in a long red coat he had short dark hair and he wielded an ornate blade in one hand he crashed into the watcher his sword a blur their combat continued behind victors head and he could not watch only hear the shockingly loud clash of steel from where he lay he saw two more on the rooftop of the home both wearing similar red coats one leapt to the ground just a wiry thing that barely filled out his coat the air pulled the coat open in the fall and victor saw dozens of small throwing knives the man threw several as he fell a vicious barrage victor heard them clink and ping against the wall and ground he could only hope none hit flesh still outnumbered and surprised could the watcher fight off so many it appeared he could at least for the moment as their fight returned to his line of sight the watcher was a twisting confusion of cloak and blade his sabers fending off the advance of the man with the sword he kept flinging side to side his motions nearly impossible to predict as was evident by the daggers thrown by the other man in chase each one missed by inches amid the chaos victor watched the widow flee deeper into the alley wanting no part of the chaos victor wanted to scream out his fury at seeing her escape but he could do nothing not even lift his fingers as if the two on the ground were not enough the third up top suddenly clapped her hands and just like that the alley filled with fire it burst along the walls feeding on nothing victors eyes watered for he could not squint against the sudden barrage of light and heat the watcher went on the offensive crashing into close quarters with the swordsman the man with the daggers closed as well wielding them instead of throwing them the skill on display took victors breath away hed thought himself capable hed thought he could handle any foe but what he saw wasnt human more fire burst around the alley roping the watcher in so far none had scored a solid hit but victor could sense the watchers desperation ice lashed across the fire and white light bathed the woman upon the rooftops eliciting a shriek of pain victors hope increased tenfold the eschaton had arrived victor tried to follow but so much was going on and he couldnt shift couldnt look the dagger thrower turned on brug who came barreling in decked out in his thick plate daggers flew and they bounced off unable to penetrate the watcher upped his intensity his sabers twirling as they battled outside his line of vision meanwhile spells flew through the air ice and lightning crashing together as delysia and tarlak exchanged attacks with the woman on the rooftop the sound was deafening magic shook the walls of the homes and amidst it all victor felt so helpless so insignificant the battle split traveling both deeper into the alley as well as back out into the main street victor had no idea who was on the offensive and who was in flight he could only lie there waiting and hoping as he found himself suddenly alone when he felt the touch of a womans hand against his face he feared it the widow but then he looked up into delysias beautiful green eyes blood matted her red hair to her face but the wound looked superficial can you not move she asked he looked left to right with his eyes as a way of answer i will see what i can do she reached down and pulled free the bolt from his side the pain was intense but did not last long her hand touched the wound and he heard a soft ringing in his ears slowly growing stronger as she whispered words to a prayer he could not understand when it faded he felt a fire flood through his veins followed by the tingling sensation of a waking limb with it all across his body he grimaced nearly overwhelmed a soft flutter of cloaks signaled the arrival of the watcher two fled but it might be a feint to try to isolate tarlak he said how is he im fine victor said his tongue feeling thick get him to safety delysia said standing i cant lift him are you sure the priestess nodded ill find brug and my brother theyll need me in case youre right for now take him somewhere safe until he can recover cityguard victor said sounding slurred as if he were drunk you saw what those people can do haern said putting his arms around him you think a few guards will protect you from that a good point however frightening the watcher pulled him to his feet and began carrying him deeper into the alley whereare we going victor said grimacing against the overwhelming sensations it was as if a thousand wasps stung his exposed skin the watchers touch was like fire to be honest said the watcher i dont have a clue but anywheres better than here victor felt his legs regaining strength and he worked them as best he could so they might move faster the watchers eyes constantly scanned the environment about them both rooftop and street if one of the attackers returned theyd be in a sore spot for sure after a moment he shook his head then pulled them back around never mind he said i have a better idea the watcher carried him to the building that the attackers had been hiding in pulling him in through the busted door inside was a meager home bodies lay about brutally slaughtered victor let out a gasp at the sight even children cut down and left to die all so they might wait in ambush the watcher said nothing about it but the rage rolled off of him like a physical presence who are they victor asked as the watcher pulled him into the next room where only a single body that of a woman lay facedown on the floor a family in the wrong place at the wrong time was his bitter response i mean their murderers the watcher helped him sit in a corner then turned to the womans body theyre a group of mercenaries known as the bloodcrafts the watcher said now give me a moment the watcher dragged the body out to be with the others then came back in and leaned against the opposite wall victor studied him finally noticing the blood pooling at his side are you hurt he asked its an old wound the watcher said he shifted so that the blood was hidden by a cloak its nothing i can endure worse what of you starting to feel like myself a child could probably beat me at fisticuffs though the watcher looked back at the door and victor could tell he wanted to be with the rest of his friends victors guilt grew a trap laid for him an innocent family dead the eschaton fighting perhaps even dying and all for what reason when the watcher turned on him suddenly his guilt magnified tenfold why are you here he asked youve driven this city insane infected it with your own madness whats going on victor attempts on my life yours the trifectis it all worth it for your pride your attempts at power i had this city under control control victor laughed control if you say so but thats not what i saw what do you know of veldaren youre an outsider some foreign born no victor shook his head and he forced himself to sit up no this is my home watcher i was born here raised here it was the thief war that drove us out it destroyed everything i had watcher everything you know nothing and i wont dare let you disgrace me so the watcher fell silent and he resumed scanning outside the building as if unwilling to speak the silence wore on victor and when the watcher returned to the room he did his best to push away his anger i dont know how old you were victor said gesturing toward his hidden face for all i know you were a child or an elderly man even then do you remember when the thief war started that first night was the worst the trifect had bargained and bartered for months trying to establish certain boundariesrules of engagement you might say they were fools to have done so and because of that all of veldaren paid the cost my mother and father heard of leons failed attempt to kill thren and knew everything was about to go to pieces we tried to flee the three of us our belongings crammed into a coach victor sighed and a shudder ran through him the streets were chaos he said every single guild rose up determined to shock and cower the city into submission mercenaries ran about with hardly any orders beyond killing anyone they caught looting or vandalizing i watched from the window of our coach buildings aflame people screaming and they hated us for it the lowborn folk of this city i didnt understand it then but i do now we had failed them with all our wealth all our power we had failed to prevent the carnage my family is not part of the trifect but we had dealings with them we visited their homes and we basked in the light of their coin to veldaren we were just like them they blocked our horses flung stones and screamed a thousand curses as we tried to flee the watcher shifted pulling his cloak tighter about him i was just a child but i do remember he said it was on that night my older brother died victor grunted rubbed his eyes with his forefinger and thumb nearly everyone lost someone that day and the commoners released that anger upon us i still remember my father pulling me back from the window telling me to ignore them that isnt them he told me that is their fear talking their sorrow their anguish dont hate them for it we are as much to blame as they a noble man said the watcher a kind man victor said gentle compassionate scared the shit out of me sitting across from him in that coach and seeing the fear in his eyes theythe mob surrounded us i saw the thieves among them those damn cloaks even now they wear them without fear arrows hit the sides of the coach along with rocks i still thought we could push through our driver he just urged the horses on i remember the first person we hit the sound i heard as the wheel crushed bone victor felt his memories threatening to overwhelm him and for once he was too tired to fight them away his tears swelled and he let them fall what did it matter if the watcher saw weakness after all that had happened i still thought wed make it out safely he said but then they killed the horses that was when i knew my mother was crying but my father he never hesitated he grabbed my shirt and tore it then yanked the boots off my feet i didnt understand but he knew what was to happen he knew and then he struck me again and again until i bled across my clothes i was too stunned to respond he did it all so i could hide i could be just one of the mob right before they tore off the doors he had me crawl through a small window in the back and then roll to the ground i thought theyd notice but there were too many people all focused on the doors without a single copper to my name i ran i didnt look back those thievesthose bastardsdo you realize what they did to me it isnt the coin it isnt even the murder he smashed his fists against the floor pressed his head against the wall my last memory of my father is of him striking me the watcher had remained silent throughout and he let victor calm himself let him sit there with his fists shaking how did you survive he at last asked i left veldaren victor said walked on bare feet north begged for food whenever i met strangers and hitched rides with a few that seemed kindly when i reached our familys castle i walked into the court muddy faced and bleeding feet and announced my presence victor shook his head and he wiped his tears away you ask why i do this you ask what madness drives me that is it i want revenge against everything the guilds took from me i had to flee my childhood home while the beaten corpses of my parents were stripped naked robbed of every possession and then left to rot beside our dead horses he wiped away his tears and as he did he chuckled do you know the worst part he asked the greatest insult i found out thren used our mansion as his home when he discovered it was vacant for years he tunneled out holes and boarded up windows and that scum lived and slept in the bed of my father and when he left he burned it all down to the last brick and board thats when i knew thats when i swore to come back to make every man bearing the colors of a guild tremble in fear of my name day after day i trained my family is not the wealthiest but i saved money like a tightfisted miser this is my purpose this is how i will honor the memory of my parents before i die i will rid my beloved city of the rats and vultures that have done nothing but destroy the watcher stood over him staring thinking something burdened him greatly but victor could only guess at what i understand more than you can possibly believe he said i am sorry for the loss of your parents and your home victor closed his eyes and shook his head it doesnt matter not anymore what i saw out therei am nothing to you to your kind i thought veldaren full of thieves cowards men with daggers and poison and little else but i was wrong now i see the monsters how can i stop men who summon fire with a wave of their hand how can i hunt down those who move faster than my eyes can follow whose skill borders on that of gods ive done nothing but throw stones into a cave and at last ive woken the beasts within it im a fool watcher a damn fool no the watcher said kneeling down before him and grabbing his shoulders his blue eyes pierced out from the magical darkness of his hood you are what we need you can be where i cannot you can fill the streets with a hundred men while i am but one one man can be stopped but a hundred a thousand you told me i would inspire fear from the shadows yet you would be the light to banish all shadows you still can be stronger than them be stronger than any of us prove to veldaren that you can stand against the darkness without mask or cloak and live can you do that for me victor victor took a deep breath and he thought of his mother and father sitting opposite him in the coach as the mob surrounded them no one should be that afraid he decided not ever again i will he said forgive my moment of doubt the watcher grinned good continue on as you have as for me well a change came over the watcher hardening those blue eyes a chill swept through victor as he realized he saw what others must see when the cloaked man descended from the rooftops sabers drawn fury in his every movement ill handle the monsters zusa had no measure of time nothing to go on but when they fed her twice a small boy adorned in gray robes arrived and gently spooned gruel into her mouth as for drink a young girl came bearing water every few hours or so every time it was a different girl and zusa looked upon them with pity how many might soon hide their beautiful faces beneath rags and wrappings she felt herself weakening felt her muscles tightening and her back ache constantly so far vrashka had not returned daveriks promise appearing true but her time was almost up the door creaked open and she stirred from her daydreams of life and freedom at the gemcroft mansion as if to confirm her fears daverik stepped inside and he looked vaguely worried are you well he asked her crossing the room a cruel question to ask a woman in chains zusa said perhaps i have stretched my influence to its limits zusa i can protect you no longer what is your answer will you return to karaks bosom will you embrace the faith once more zusa shook her head you know i wont what is there for me daverik in answer he knelt before her and brushed her face with his hand theres me he said theres a life free of imprisonment and torture can that not mean something the temples laws will keep you from me temple laws can be changed zusa laughed is that what you tell yourself he shifted closer leaning so close that she felt his breath on her neck his hands brushed her arms her sides her breasts his cheek pressed against hers as he whispered it doesnt matter come back to me katherine she knew what he was trying to do his lips pressed against her neck as he cupped her face he was trying to reignite a distant flame a flame that perhaps for him had never died and while she felt it too it was nothing compared to the sudden flare of shame and disgust that overwhelmed her it was one thing for him to touch her in a distant alley a secret meeting between long lost loversbut here while manacles held her wrists to a wall while her whole body ached from the imprisonment and she sat in her own piss and shit katherines dead she said pulling away from him best she could you killed her when you betrayed her to the priests remember he stood and she saw the haunting memory in his eyes i know he said i guess im a fool to still believe otherwise daverik walked toward the door stopping just beside the strange flow of water falling from ceiling to floor i learned this enchantment while in mordeina when i knew i might have to imprison you or even one of my new faceless he said observing its flow its a marvelous thing channeling all the powers of karak into its water and away from its surroundings yet even the slightest disruption will momentarily break it so powerful yet so weak is that not how we all are zusa he left without waiting for an answer zusa finally allowed herself to relax and with his departure she damned him for hurting her so damned him for the tears that started to flow hardly a minute later the door reopened she expected her elderly torturer but instead one of the faceless entered from what she could tell it was not ezra but the other the woman said nothing only stepped around the stream of water falling from ceiling to floor so she might stand before zusa with her arms crossed she tilted her head to one side staring analyzing her like she might a strange animal like what you see zusa asked grinning despite her exhaustion the other woman slapped her then knelt down so they might see eye to eye carefully she removed the thin cloth over her eyes then pulled back the wrappings of her face revealing her blonde hair and beautiful face her blue eyes stared into zusas and they held a frightening intensity who are you zusa asked when her visitor still said nothing deborah she said and who were you before you were deborah the woman shook her head that name that person is lost and gone i will not speak it to you zusa shrugged her shoulders best she could given the chains about her if you insist deborah shifted their faces so close to one another she continued to study zusa looking over her dark eyes skin and hair why did you reveal your face deborah finally asked why did you turn against our god zusa smirked at her visitor are you having trouble with your faith deborah deborah grabbed her neck shoved her against the wall and held her there you know nothing of me zusa so do not insult me i know you wouldnt ask if it were not so zusa said with what little breath she could manage the hand about her throat released and deborah shifted a step backward do not question my devotion i merely wish to know what it is that broke you so i might better protect my own faith whywhat made you decide to turn away at this zusa laughed laughed until she could hardly breathe deborah struck her twice but it did nothing to remove her dark humor you want to know why i left she asked why i abandoned karak i followed the orders given to me to find and protect alyssa gemcroft years ago but then pelorak decided we were an insult to his temple a wealthy member of this city decided we were a risk needing to be eliminated a dark paladin decided we were blasphemous to his god unworthy of forgiveness i did nothing deborah none of us did we simply turned one day to find karaks followers arrayed against us faceless i never decided my beloved friends died until i was alone and lost i never abandoned karak karak and his temple abandoned me the same will happen to you deborah youll spend your life told you are shameful and weak until one day you pull the cloth from your face look into a mirror and wonder what is so sinful about that beautiful blonde hair so terrible about those icy blue eyes deborah struck her with a trembling hand they warned me to not listen she said unable to hide the fury in her voice i should have paid heed to those warnings you are beyond redemption beyond reason never could i have guessed how foul a snake you are i can see it in your eyes zusa straining against her chains so she was mere inches from deborah deep down you believe every single word ive said every single word deborah struck her with her fists again and again zusas face swelled and blood welled on her tongue she kept her jaw clenched tight and let deborah burn out her fury when her grin never faltered deborah finally reached for her dagger and pressed it against her throat i will cut the blasphemous tongue from your mouth she said ill burn it on karaks altar while i sing psalms of praise you are a sick broken thing and it shames me to think you were once of my order open your mouth zusa shook her head in response deborah struck her with the hilt of her dagger the metal rattled her teeth and she tasted more blood as a single tooth jarred loose zusa bit down hard tearing the tooth free with a crack i said open your mouth deborah said the tip of her dagger once more poking against her neck after slowly filling her lungs with air zusa spat the combination of tooth blood and saliva it arced over deborahs head through the air and then broke the stream of water daverik had created deborah had only the briefest moment to realize it before zusa flung herself back while summoning the power that was hers the entire room was awash with shadows and this time when zusa fell through the wall nothing stole her away nothing pulled her into the swirling depths of the abyss she emerged on the other side of the room free of the manacles deborahs back was still to her and she turned far too late zusa rolled once then leapt her heel slamming the other womans head forward it hit the wall with a loud crack blood dripped down as her body collapsed to the hard stone zusa knelt for a moment catching her breath and then checked deborahs pulse still there however faint despite the danger zusa kept her calm slowly she removed deborahs wrappings then used them to replace her own feeling far cleaner far more human she took deborahs daggers then spat a glob of blood onto deborahs pale naked breasts ill let you live she said because one day you will see just how right i was the stream of water had resumed and standing close to it made zusa felt strangely empty glancing about she found her tooth then jammed it into the hole in the ceiling water continued to trickle down but it was different somehow lacking the proper hue zusa felt immediately better though still physically weak her food and water had been rare her movement limited holding the daggers made her fingers ache after the torture theyd taken so that she had to grip them tighter for fear of losing control itd take a few days before she felt like her old self the door cracked open without knock or warning given how is my little doll vrashka asked as he stepped inside he froze at the macabre sight before him and zusa gave him no time to recover she grabbed him while simultaneously kicking the door shut with ease she flung him against the wall a hand against his mouth to muffle his frightened scream this little doll is leaving zusa whispered into his ear as she pressed a dagger against his belly i suggest you stay calm and answer me quietly and truthfully if you want to live you understand vrashka nodded if he was frightened he didnt show it zusa couldnt help but be begrudgingly impressed how many guards are outside the door she asked then slowly pulled back her hand none he said she sliced a gash across his forehead the shallow cut bleeding profusely that done she pressed her hand once more against his mouth every lie you tell me i cut lower she whispered soon it will be your eyes then your nose dont make me reach your neck how many guards none at the door vrashka said eyes closed against the blood that ran down into them theres only one exit from the prison up the hall thats where the guards are i did not lie little doll i swear my name is zusa not doll she said cutting across his eyebrows how many guards at the exit it took a moment for the old man to gather his breath five he said there are always five is it night or day the sun has just set the temple is settling down for bed myzusa zusa clasped a hand over his mouth tried to think if it were night then her escape would be far easier her prison was deep underground she knew with no other exit besides the one with the guards five armored men would be difficult especially with how weak she felt but perhaps she might catch them off guard but escape was not the only thing on her mind where is daverik she asked is he in his room the old man shook his head i passed him on my way down he said he felt unwell and needed fresh air he was hiding something i could sense it looked troubled did you say something to him little doll did you make him doubt himself she tried to cut across both his eyes but her dagger caught on the bridge of his nose so only one was split in half when she pulled it free vrashka screamed and her hand did little to muffle the noise knowing time was short zusa hoped that the scream if heard would be mistaken as hers instead of his blood was pouring from his face now and vrashkas strength drained with it despite all the pain he must have felt he bore a smile on his face youyou make me sad he said when she flung him to the floor you could have withstood so much breaking you would have been my greatest accomplishment even the gentle touchers would be proud he stared up at her with his lone eye and she could tell he expected her to take his life she almost obliged but something about the sick satisfaction on his face turned her stomach it was as if he viewed dying to her as a privilege youd never have broken me she said grabbing the handle of her cell door but i broke you in seconds youll be back vrashka said laughing as she left youll still be mine little she flung a dagger through the air straight through his remaining eye walking over to it she yanked it out and shook off the eyeball stupid bastard she said you could have lived with the door open there was no way her escape had gone unnoticed taking a deep breath she ran out the cell hooked a right and then charged straight down the corridor there were only four total cells with each door on her left shed been put in the furthest from the stairs from what she could tell at the far edge of the stone corridor was the exit vrashka had spoken of five men stood guard all with a lion painted across the front of their armor they wielded a combination of short spears and swords and four scrambled at the sight of her to form a defensive line a fifth rushed up the stairs no doubt to signal an alarm zusa sprinted faster her breaths blasting in and out of her lungs halt one screamed laughing at his cluelessness she launched into the air her body twisting like a dancer spears and swords pierced through the gaps in her arms and legs catching nothing zusa jammed one dagger through a neck and the other she rammed into the stomach of the man she slammed into together they fell a heap of arms and legs she rolled free in a heartbeat spinning so that the nearest guards downward stab hit stone instead of flesh her heel caught his jaw her left arm parried a desperate thrust and then she was running up the stairs after the fifth leaving the confused rest behind him in his heavy armor her in her wrappings there was no chance not for him her daggers pierced his back before he could finish opening the thick door at the top pushing the body behind her she let it roll and tumble as an obstacle to the others chasing after the door was not locked and she flew through it beside the door was a heavy bar and she wedged it into the nailed handles on either side of the entrance the dungeon sealed she had time now perhaps enough to escape for a moment she forced her exhausted mind to think of the layout to piece together where she was the dungeon was located near the back of the temple she stood in a short hallway one way leading toward storage for various supplies and dried foods the other was toward the barracks fists pounded on the opposite side of the door behind her but she laughed at their helplessness the temple was dark quiet getting in might have proved difficult especially with a trap laid for her but getting out she ran nothing but a shadow she slipped through the barracks with only a single young priest walking the halls he never saw her coming her dagger cut his throat and her hand muffled his dying gasp on she ran until reaching the grand worship hall peeking out from a door she saw three men kneeling in prayer at the statue of karak his enormous presence bathed in purple fire zusa thought to kill them but escape was her priority now not vengeance crawling along the floor she slipped through the pews careful to make not a sound two guards watched the door spears in hand when she reached the final pew she sprinted out deriving sick pleasure at the stunned look on the guards faces at her sudden appearance in such close quarters the spears were useless against her daggers she cut them down kicked open the door and then rolled to avoid the bolts of shadow that leapt from the hands of the three priests who had been in prayer now in open air nothing would stop her she ran across the courtyard vaulted over the gates and then left the temple far behind zusa wanted to return to alyssa ached to be in a place she could call home but did not vrashka had said daverik felt unwell and sought fresh air zusa knew there was more to it than that with her balance teetering she ran her path weaving side to side through the street as if she were intoxicated her stomach ached her tongue thirst for water but on she went until at last she reached the secluded gap by the wall where theyd first met just as she thought daverik was there leaning against the wall with his arms crossed instead of his robes he wore the plain clothes hed had when first meeting her i hope you didnt kill too many he said smiling at her arrival why she asked why tell me how to escape daverik shook his head it saddens me you have to ask do you think i lie to you zusa that my feelings are false i traveled across the entire continent to see you once again i have slept with nightmares of our last moments together for ten long years to see you beaten humiliated tortured into submission he sighed you know i cant do that no matter the blasphemy you might speak no matter how hardened your heart is against me and you were right zusa even if you came back theyd have killed you i cant accept that i wont theyre wrong about that wrong about you and i will stop them zusa bit back her retort unwilling to spit in the face of the man who had helped her escape what is going on she asked what role does the temple play in all this that i cannot say for i do not know then what do you know that you have a choice one im not sure youll be willing to make something about the sudden shift of his tone made her throat clench what do you mean daverik crossed his arms and he looked to the sky so he might stare at the stars when he spoke i know the man who has been playing puppeteer here in veldaren his name is laerek a priest from mordeina he was to meet with me tonight very soon but i have no intention of going i have no desire to maintain this position i am in to be taskmaster over the faceless zusa clutched her daggers tight and had to fight back her excitement at finally having a name a person to hunt you said there was a choice indeed he said pulling his gaze back down from the stars to her if you come with me we can flee the city tonight hide where not even the temple can find us ill leave all gods and kings behind i only came back here for you zusa just for you no one will know no one will have reason to think you didnt vanish into hiding back at alyssas he took a step toward her reaching out a hand we can be together he said i know i erred revealing our love to the priests i know i was a fool to feel guilt and shame please this is all i know to do to make up for it is that all you have to offer me zusa asked she tried to ignore his words his apologies she thought of herself in her filth him kissing her neck thought of how oblivious hed been to her situation she was just a memory to him a perfect memory im not sure i can she said youre a stranger to me daverik now perhaps but not before we were our firsts katherine surely no flame has burned brighter for you than i anger she thought keep the anger fresh keep the betrayal fresh i cant she said at last i cant leave alyssa daverik sighed but despite his obvious disappointment he let out a bitter laugh i know id hoped otherwise but i know im sorry katherine if youd only said yes id have never told you id have spared you the heartache zusa felt her heart begin to race as her mind immediately went to the most dire of assumptions what do you mean she asked daverik shook his head i am not the only one to meet with laerek tonight the widow was to meet him as well but only after her racing heart stopped her stomach clenched after what she asked after killing alyssa gemcroft zusa flung herself at him grabbing his neck so she might slam him against the wall why she screamed what have we done to deserve this i am not the one you should be angry with daverik said clutching her wrist i didnt set this in motion alyssa represents something that is an affront to karak something that must be brought low to make way for his return return whose return daverik shook his head no time zusa the widow is just a puppet a minor player in all this even laerek is but a mouthpiece for the real force working behind everything alyssa is already dead ill tell you where to find laerek but you must hurry take vengeance on him before he leaves veldaren forever zusas grip tightened and she almost strangled the life from her former lover dont be a fool he said in a raspy voice fighting to breathe through her grasp kill the one responsible then come with me well leave this all behind youll never feel pain again not like this dont go back you dont want to see it no she said letting him go youve never understood me daverik and you never will with every last bit of strength she ran toward the connington mansion daggers at the ready long cloak billowing daverik watched her go and his heart ached at the sight he loved her so much he loved her but time and trials had changed her warped her into something he only vaguely recognized such a shame he whispered he heard ezra land behind him quiet as a cat landing on padded feet she still will not accept you will she she asked daverik shook his head zusa is too far gone and whatever love she has for me is not enough to bring her back he looked over his shoulder saw her drawing her daggers daverik once more thought of the softness of zusas skin the way his lips had brushed her neck and then cast aside the sinful memories so he might give his faceless her order shell interfere if she can kill her and if the widow cannot fulfill his task then kill alyssa as well ezra stepped closer rubbing her wrapped face against his shoulder while leering up at him you risked much for an old love she said deborah just barely lives and others of the temple are not so lucky the dead go to karak their souls claimed and protected daverik snapped zusa is greater than any of them yet she will burn only burn i had to try ezra smirked as she stepped away to give chase tell me she said would you have risked for my soul as you have for hers he could not answer and he felt his neck flush with the shame i thought not ezra said dangerous games daverik you play such dangerous games she ran to murder the only woman daverik had ever loved the act was just of course a necessary fate for a woman who had blasphemed against karak but he would find no comfort in it no solace forgive me zusa he told the night perhaps after an eternity i might one day hold your body against mine but ive given you enough chances i wash my hands of this your fault not mine dear katherine stephen connington stepped into the tiny room holding a candle to give himself light as hed hoped she was already waiting for him there mother he said seeing her sitting against the wall surrounded by little toys carved out of wood im here child melody said stephen went to her curling up in her arms as he closed his eyes he was getting too big for it he knew but he did so anyway with his eyes closed he was once more lost in darkness lost in a past hed thought hed escaped sadly it seemed he never would do you think father loved me he asked you know he did he thought of the years of darkness amid months of light of the beatings and the hunger followed by leons lips on his neck do i stephen asked hed been a bastard of leons birthed by a lowly servant girl who had aroused his fathers attention melody was not his mother not by blood no matter how much he might wish it be true thered been times leon had treated him well had laughed and told him stories as they walked through the mansion other times thoughother times he told you so didnt he melody said stirring him from his thoughts his fathers voice echoed in his head distorted over time so he couldnt be sure if the love he heard in it existed or not you know they would kill you stephen they dont think youre good enough to be one of them to take over everything ive built they want some boy pulled from a prissy nobleladys cunt instead but youre my daughter you hear me you never forget it my blood so dont you worry when i put you down there its for your safety stephen your safety no matter the love he felt from his father those long months spent in the cell had wore on him bathing him in darkness as he grew up isolated and alone but then when he was almost six an angel had been delivered to him it was his mother the true mother that owned his heart melody had been placed in the cell adjacent to his the first hed ever known of her was the songs she sang to pass the time in that deep darkness that voice had carried him given him comfort so he could sleep without crying alyssas supposed to be next stephen said laerek insists on it before she might discover our plans i understand melody said gently stroking his hair not his real hair though but the long wig hed put on prior to entering he still remembered the night hed taken it hidden in shadows while watching the whores pass oh some didnt ask for money might have even claimed they were proper women noble ladies or faithful wives but they were all whores his father had made that clear all women are whores stephen even you its in their blood and its stronger than anything else in this world thats why you shouldnt feel bad its not your fault you just cant help it always looking at me like you do but youre my daughter my precious little daughter now come here stephen had sliced the womans beautiful brown hair off at the scalp all while the venom of the brown widow spider kept her paralyzed shed been unable to move but hed seen the screams in her eyes when he finally pulled the last of it free it was her beauty he knew she hated to lose her beauty to see someone stronger someone more deserving take it away are you sure you dont mind stephen asked ishes my sister isnt she your daughter melodys careful stroking of his head paused and he felt his muscles tense he hated when she did that one of those subtle things to let him know her displeasure shes not my daughter melody said her bony fingers tightening around his shoulders making him feel like a disobedient child shes maynards daughter he kept her from me stephen he wanted her for himself because he was selfish because he was weak he knew the strength karak gave me and would not let her know it as well thats why he sold me to your father stephen felt fury burn bright in his chest of course it was maynard keenans fault leon had made that quite clear hed come to his father multiple times whenever he was given freedom to leave his cell and roam the mansion whenever he asked for melody to be released hed been given the same answer if maynard finds out hell kill me shes supposed to be dead stephenyou know what dead means right it means not walking around talking to my servants being seen by guests eating food cooked by women with more mouths than sense i love her dearly but down there she has to stay if you want her to survive for five long years hed asked until the bloody kensgold came hed been in his cell not allowed to join the festivities when the thieves had come and set the mansion ablaze the smoke had been thick as the building burned above them the heat swelled and stephen had huddled by the floor sobbing in terror melody had kept him calm singing through the noise and chaos her voice echoing across the stone to give him comfort anytime he woke in the night heart gripped with horror he still recalled those songs deep underground theyd survived while the rest of the mansion collapsed itd taken two days but at last theyd been dug free stephen still remembered staggering out into the light stinking of filth his body drained and dying for a drink of water hed reached for his father only to have leon take a step back his nose crinkling in disgust that was when stephen realized just how ugly he was how wretched a body he inhabited when his mother had been pulled out it was she whom hed held she whom hed pulled close against his body i was never his daughter stephen whispered every time he called me that he lied hush now melody said putting a hand against his cheek and forcing him to look up at her you cant help how you were born so dont blame yourself your father was a troubled man but he loved you he loved us never doubt that he nodded then tugged at her shirt may i he asked if you must she unbuttoned her blouse then pulled free a breast stephen latched onto it with his lips rubbed across the nipple with his tongue and then began to suck no milk came out not like the earliest years in the prison but he was long past needing that physical nourishment it was the attention he needed now the soothing sensation of being cradled by his mother he suckled for a while felt his nerves gradually ease he was anxious about killing alyssa he knew it was that bodyguard of hers that heathen woman zusa laerek assured him shed be occupied that night but he knew enough of zusa to not trust that promise when he killed alyssa hed have to make it quick not enjoy it like the others but laerek had made him another promise one that still got his blood racing when he thought of it laerek said hell have thren ready for me soon he said releasing melodys nipple and then pressing his face against her breast he was given orders to leave him alive just so i can kill him i cant wait mommy i cant she stroked his face and he heard her chuckle as if hed said something amusing you shouldnt let him trouble you so she said stephen shook his head how can you say that you loved father too didnt you of course and he killed him mother thren killed him hed just taken power a little over a year ago his right as firstborn son finally acknowledged despite him being discovered within leons cells not long after laerek had come to him asking questions about things stephen had never wanted to think on again do you know who killed your father laerek had asked stephen had not been told so hed been left to rumors i assume it was the watcher hed replied is that not what the whispers say laerek had shaken his head and given him such a condescending smirk a man in gray wielding matching blades came into your fathers home slew his guards and then executed him without mercy hed brought a companion with him who died unable to escape his name was senke a longtime member of the spider guild thren felhorn killed your father stephen then why does the watcher take the credit he thrives on fear why would he not stephen had had nothing to say to that hed given no thought to leons murder only in regaining his power upon doing so his very first act had been to free melody she had been with him teaching him the ways of high society guiding him through the pitfalls that might have ensnared him and hearing laereks question shed leaned down and whispered into his ear you have the name of his murderer what will you do stephen how much did you truly love him he thought of that now as she held him seemingly uncaring about the death of leons murderer why do you not hate him as much as i he asked her his face deep into her cleavage he inhaled deeply the smell of her sweat and sex so familiar to him you were the one who urged me to meet laerek who asked me to seek vengeance i do this all for you melody gently pushed him back and before he could protest she fully clothed herself you would doubt me then question my emotions she said a stern edge overcoming her voice truth is leon is dead if avenging his murder gives you peace then i support you but most important is that we remain faithful to our god that is why i wanted you to listen that is why i urged you to do as laerek says the end of days is coming my sweet little child veldaren must be made ready will you fight for it or will you sit here in your room with your toys and your shadows and hide from what you have been called to do by our glorious karak tears grew in his eyes and he fought to keep his voice under control please dont be mad at me he said i will i promise i will ill kill her and ill leave her in darkness just like her father left you melody took his chin in her fingers tilted him close and kissed his forehead several times feel no shame she said and fight your doubt just like we must fight the chaos of this world karak has given you a grand purpose and i couldnt be any more proud go do what must be done and know that i will always be here for you behind her was a closet and carefully he stood and pulled it open inside was a crossbow loaded with a single arrow its tip coated with poison all prepared and ready for him with his mothers loving hands he took it smiled at her ill make you happy he said i owe you so much im not sure i can ever repay you now holding the candle melody lifted it to her face so the light shone across her smile youre my beloved daughter she said the one i should have had and raised if not for maynards pride you have nothing to repay me for stephen reached for the door and as he pulled it open melody called his name stephen she said when you take her eyes tell her the truth tell her youre my daughter now more than shell ever be do that but remember dont harm nathaniel karak has blessed him for a reason once free of alyssas influence his gift will blossom like a flower and we must do whatever we can to nourish it he is no threat to my ascension crossbow shaking in his sweaty hand stephen nodded to his mother i will he said i promise i will he left shut the door behind him and then hurried down the hall to where alyssa slept victor leaned against the back wall of his tavern arms crossed body covered with shining armor his fingers drummed the hilt of his sword but he forced himself to remain calm and leave it sheathed gathered together in both the tavern and two nearby streets were the bulk of his forces they were all equally impatient but victor had no choice much as it left a foul taste in his mouth true to his word deathmask arrived twenty minutes after sunset he walked alone his face unclouded by ash or cloth his smile was wide and it unnerved victor further im here and my men ready victor said what is of such great importance deathmask bowed low in greeting forgive me if i inconvenienced you he said when he pulled up from his bow there was a sparkle in his red eye but if you want to keep a hold on veldaren you need to act now without delay what are you talking about speak plainly deathmask looked to be in no hurry despite his urgent message he paced before victor tapping his lips with a finger im sure you know much of this citys guilds but what about elsewhere victor shook his head i must profess ignorance in this and other things as well deathmask said grin growing but then let me remove your ignorance there is a guild in mordeina known as the suns over the past few years theyve spread their influence first into ker then omn and now theyve set their eye on neldar theyre coming here into veldaren so they might strike at the heart of this nation and then branch out like a disease victor frowned not liking what he was hearing are you afraid of losing some profit thief he asked dont be naive veldaren is already spiraling out of control and the suns will destroy it completely they wont rest until every guild mine included is wiped out so far i dont see much reason to hate them a bit of amusement left deathmasks eyes enough victor you know as well as i that the guilds here are weak and can be controlled but not the suns this is not some distant threat nor someone that will bow to the trifect or pay heed to the watcher theyve come to conquerand theyre already here information hed received the day before suddenly clicked and victor felt a pit grow in his stomach the cheap crimleaf he said id heard of the bottoming out of prices the new dealerthats them isnt it not just crimleaf deathmask said other leaves and powders far worse have your men not found the bodies all across the southern district wars begun so far silent but for the bloodcrafts each day their numbers grow members of all guilds sensing the coming tide and abandoning their old allegiances for the new victor shifted leaning more of his weight against the wall he tried to think to understand what it meant slowly he was bleeding the guilds dry of both members and coin it might succeed too but only a fool would think someone else wouldnt try to fill the void if the suns were as dangerous as deathmask claimed he looked up at the thief what do you want of me he asked deathmask pulled a cloth from his pocket and tied it across his face help me he said his other hand pulling out a handful of ash swallow your pride and send your soldiers flooding into the suns newly acquired territory under my direction well crush them here now before they gain more than a foothold with a wave of a hand the ash scattered about his face then hovered there hiding his features the city is mine victor but i am a kinder lord than the suns will ever be do not doubt your decision not in this victor closed his eyes thought of the carnage hed seen the day prior while being protected by the eschaton you say the bloodcrafts have been hired to protect the suns he asked it seems that way if not for them id have already crushed their initial push victor shook his head anyone who would bring in such dangerous beings just to protect their drug trade was someone he couldnt allow to gain prominence in veldaren ill help you he said but know that i will watch you closely and do this only for the good of the city the good of the city deathmask chuckled how quaint he whistled and the rest of his guild appeared from further up the street approaching in their similar colors monsters thought victor as they gathered you said youd protect me from the monsters watcher but what happens when the monsters turn on each other ready your men deathmask said its time for a slaughter victor left without a word trying to not think about the company he kept or of the bloodshed to commence the peace at the end was all that mattered he told himself the final victory the safe streets and unviolated homes milord asked sef at his arrival prepare our men to move out he said milord something troubles you i can tell what i said prepare them to move out sef took a step back then bowed low forgive me he said victor sighed put a hand on the mans shoulder no he said youve done much for me and now i must ask for more prepare them all a new threat has entered our city and we must crush it while we still have the chance sef tensed as the ash guild came around the corner of the tavern weapons drawn and shimmering with magic victor shook his head and motioned for his soldiers to stand down i do this with a heavy heart he said pointing to deathmask but it must be done follow this mans lead once more into the underworld we go beneath the ash and cloth deathmasks smile grew and grew haern spent the day following the bloodcrafts ambush in disguise acting like any other hungry tired commoner as he bounced from tavern to tavern someone as new and strange as the bloodcrafts would have left a trail he knew and it did not take long to find it many were frightened to speak of them but when haern flashed a little silver all of their tongues opened at last he found what hed dared not hope for the tavern in which they stayed and even the rooms in which they slept the innkeeper had been terrified to say their names but his son had been a different matter three silver coins and the young man had joined haern in an alley pointed up to some windows and then ran back inside before his father noticed ive found you haern whispered hurrying back to the eschaton tower he revealed what hed learned to the rest as they gathered in the lower floor of the tower youve got to be kidding tarlak said shaking his head that nicholas guy alone nearly killed all of us and it took everything we had to chase them off during their last ambush now you want to go charging into a fight with them head on haern shrugged if were going to fight id rather us be the ones doing the ambushing or would you rather wait for them to come to our tower while we sleep or assault me when im alone upon the rooftops theyve made their intentions clear delysia said taking her brothers hand theyll kill us no matter what it takes you saw the bodies how many innocents they killed i say we do it brug said hopping up from his chair ill get my armor youre with this insane scheme too tarlak asked brug shrugged what i killed one of them already nothing says i cant do it again haern grinned at his friend thats more like it he said so what will it be tarlak ready for us to go on the offensive for once tarlak lifted his hat and scratched the back of his head that means ill have to face that one lady throwing all the fire wont i probably fine a devilish grin spread over his face removing his pout but this time im coming prepared come on brug ill need your help with this over the day they prepared and then before nightfall they hurried back haern felt confident the bloodcrafts were like most thieves sleeping in the day and going out at night and if not well then theyd catch them sleeping hardly the most honorable kill thought haern but hed dealt worse punishments than that the tavern was at the corner of iron a major trade route heading north to south through veldaren and raven a far smaller dirt road that jutted off into the remnants of homes most shuttered down as the wealth had traveled steadily north over the past decade haern watched the entrance from an alley on the opposite side of iron this gave him a wide view of the tavern as well as the positions of the rest of the eschaton tarlak waited atop the bakers shop beside the tavern haern could not see him for hed cast a lengthy spell of invisibility across himself before climbing up the wizard directly faced the windows of the room and precautions were necessary for such close proximity brug and delysia were up raven street so that if anyone fled away from tarlak and haern theyd be there to intercept no exits went unwatched no pathways unprotected none of them liked the potential collateral damage but the ambush was set and at least no innocent families would be butchered like last time when the bloodcrafts prepared their own ambush time passed and haern felt his nerves start to fray slowly the sun fell behind the wall come on haern whispered come on come on they sky turned red then purple and then at last the stars winked into existence one by one still no sign with every passing moment haern knew something was wrong had the innkeepers boy lied or perhaps just been misinformed no doubt the rest of his friends were as anxious as he maybe he should call the ambush off or try to sneak into their room to confirm it was only instinct that saved him he saw a flash of something high above a shadow that didnt feel quite right and without thinking he dove to the side down fell a man in a red leather coat longsword slamming the ground where hed been haern pulled out of his roll sabers drawn but his attacker remained back surprise gone he seemed in no hurry hello watcher said the man he was middleaged handsome with dark hair cut short haern tensed hed crossed swords with him once already and been stunned by his near inhuman speed id greet you in return haern said but i dont know your name the man grinned carson bloodcraft consider me honored to meet you a second time few have the skill to match blades against me and live i could say the same carson chuckled indeed let me make this quick watcher we knew youd come for us after our last ambush and we have prepared one of our own we know where your friends are all of them yes even the wizard foolish enough to think we couldnt see through a simple invisibility spell with but a signal theyll attack the man was too confident the tone of his voice and pull of his smile too consistent no lie tarlak delysia brugthey were all in danger what do you want haern asked subtly tightening the muscles in his legs for a leap do you wish to mock me before you try to kill me carson shook his head our mission is to eliminate you as a threat watcher this can be done a lot of ways but you see your mercenaries killed one of our members which leaves us with an opening your skill is incredible with your reputation and your abilities youd make a fine addition to the bloodcrafts carson stood held his sword out to the side something sparkled in his brown eyes and it made haerns head ache what do you say to that leave this pathetic group you serve whatever coin they pay you i promise we can increase it tenfold they only hold you back haern took a single step just enough to shift his weight so he might leap with greater speed carson saw it and he held his sword before his chest if you agree well leave the rest of your group alive decline wellyoure still a threat needing to be dealt with make a choice watcher but do us both a favormake the intelligent one youre too good to be weighed down with petty morality and friendships despite the danger haern let out a laugh you think i do this for the coin he asked you damn fool give your signal well see who dies tonight it was a bold bluster a way to keep the fear for his friends hidden he had to trust them trust his own abilities to finish off carson in time to help the others carson shook his head looking disappointed their eyes met and there was death in them and you call me the fool he said something about his voice had changed as if he were suddenly hurrying his words his free hand lifted and when he went to snap his fingers haern lunged at him sabers leading sword a blur carson parried both to the side then shifted so his elbow slammed into haerns chest as he came crashing in breath lost haern swung twice in a futile attempt to keep the man on the defensive while he fell back gasping in air carson parried them with ease holding his sword with a single hand his movements showed no slowing no panic he didnt even look like he was breathing hard he cant be that good haern thought trying to decide his next attack pattern ive fought thren the wraith dieredonhe cant be greater than them during his indecision carson snapped his fingers then winked time for some fun he said again in that clipped rapid speech and then the roof of the bakery erupted in flame before he could react carson stepped in sword slashing haern blocked always a fraction of a second away from missing he kept his swords out wide using the only advantage he had no matter where carson thrust or slashed haern had a blade ready just a flick of a wrist away from parrying not that it mattered carson thrust looped his sword around thrust again and when haern tried to block the second he batted both sabers aside as if haern were a child the tip of his sword continued unabated piercing through haerns shoulder rolling away before it could punch deeper haern knelt on one knee fighting off the urge to clutch the wound with a hand his sabers shook in his grip as blood ran down the front of his shirt how haern wondered how can he be that fast carson stepped closer and in desperation haern employed his most skillful delay spinning he grabbed his cloaks and flung them into the air turning faster and faster so that his movements were a blur the location of his hands and swords undecipherable to any but the most skilled it should have worked but carson only shook his head as if disappointed something felt wrong haern noticed it just before carson attacked unnerved by the cloakdance the cloaks were hanging lower than they should seemingly falling faster than usual unable to maintain momentum flinging himself back haern realized what was wrong it wasnt that carson was moving faster it was that he was moving slower while the magic affected him it did nothing to the cloaks all of his senses were dulled delayed the slurred speech he realized even his hearing was affected it didnt appear to be much just enough to sap away his greatest advantage carson stalked closer unworried about haerns sudden retreat and why would he could haern get away if he ran as if pushing through molasses forcing himself to stay calm he continued his backward retreat high above smoke blotted out the stars the results of the fire that continued to burn heavy concussion sounds rocked the building tarlak was still alive but for how long have you given up already carson asked steadily approaching youve yet to make me break out a sweat you fought so well earlierwhat happened watcher have you lost your nerve what had happened hed fought both carson and the dagger thrower simultaneously yes hed been pushed to the limits but still hed endured what was different now what slowed him so come carson said look me in the eye so i can see your fear as you die the eye haern stared into those brown orbs and again he felt an ache grow in his forehead tarlaks words echoed in his ears id call it cheating something about carsons gaze be it spell or hypnotism was digging into him pooling into his mind haern looked down forced himself to watch carsons hands and hands only normally he might read a mans face to gauge their tension to watch for tells and signs of impatience but not now gaze low haern breathed in deep he didnt know how it worked or how long it might last but he had to endure until the effects waned the first time theyd fought hed had his attention split between two opponents no doubt weakening the effect if he could survive then he could survive now he had to carson stepped close and he repeatedly thrust for haerns chest pulling back every time haern tried to parry haern watched more and more aware of the sluggishness of his reactions he felt robbed of speed robbed of strength whats the matter watcher carson asked haern noticed the strange hurried aspect to his voice was not quite so prominent haern gave no answer only grinned it seemed carson suddenly realized the shift he pushed his attack this time without mockery no longer playing with him haern kept his eyes down watching only carsons hands and the movements of his feet carson was a viper trying to mesmerize his prey with his gaze but haern was no mouse no hed been raised a spider side to side he shifted avoiding thrusts smashing aside cuts carson tried to step in and strike him with a fist but haern ducked underneath whirling so his cloaks hid his movements this time when he stood he counterattacked the tip of his saber slashing open a bleeding wound across carsons cheek much as he wanted to enjoy the shock and fear in carsons eyes haern pulled his hood lower across his face and stared at the ground whats the matter bloodcraft haern asked arent you going to kill me in his childhood during the years of training by threns hired tutors haern had spent several months learning how to fight in pure darkness he knew how to predict the most common sword placements how to listen for the movement of feet the intake of air that marked an attack in his minds eye he could visualize where carson stood and from their fights he now had a feel for his favored routines the man was good but he was used to having speed on his side hed never been pushed to his limits but haern had fought so much better hed met his limits and surpassed them eyes closed he lashed out and the sound of metal on metal brought a smile to his face he pressed forward his sabers whirling so that he could control the placement of carsons sword forcing his defenses and countering his attempts to pull it close his speed had returned in full his strength was back he thought of the rest of his friends battling for their lives and he would not fail them have you lost your nerve haern asked so close to carson that he could smell the sweat and blood on him you havent beaten me yet you his words confirmed his location and more importantly how carson was falling backward to gain distance it was all haern needed he lunged one saber thrusting the other swinging wide to parry the desperate counterthrust he knew carson would try metal hit metal and then his thrusting blade met resistance just for a moment blood poured across haerns hand and he felt the closeness of carsons body to his only then did haern open his eyes to see carson gasping for air a saber pierced through his chest and out his back look me in the eye haern whispered the fear you see is your own carson opened his mouth to speak but he could only cough blood he slipped back and haern yanked free his saber carson collapsed mouth still moving eyes still locked on haerns the ornate blade fell from his hand and clattered upon the hard stone the ground shook and haern brought his attention to the other battles still raging hold on tar he whispered im coming tarlak sat on his rear legs folded underneath him as he leaned his chin against his palm and watched the inn so far an hour had passed yet no sign of life or movement through the windows some ambush he thought i think ill be killing myself from boredom before the night is over the bloodcrafts will win by default he sat on the very edge of the bakerys rooftop and he kept bouncing his attention between the windows and the alley beneath him there was always the possibility they were out in the day and would return sometime soon he knew he had to be ready but still boooored tarlak muttered he leaned back to stretch and as he did he caught sight of a woman on the roof of the inn her slender frame dwarfed by the red leather coat she wore tarlak froze midstretch wondering where in the world shed come from hello she lifted her palm toward him and fire leapt from it as if it were the gullet of a dragon tarlak flung himself onto his back crossed his arms and enacted a protection spell the fire swarmed around him bathing the rooftop but it did not touch his skin the strength to keep the protection going weighed on tarlak and the spell of invisibility around him vanished not that it was doing much good when the fire subsided tarlak rolled to his knees then pushed to his feet not bad he said wiping some ash off his yellow robe my turn shards of ice flew from his hands their points deadly sharp a dozen shattered across the rooftop of the inn each one missing their mark as the woman dove side to side faster than tarlak could adjust without slowing she ran for the edge and when tarlak hurled a bolt of lightning she vaulted into the air over the blast and across the thin gap between the two buildings before landing she crossed her arms and another wave of fire lashed out like she was the center of a great explosion tarlak braced himself once more summoning a protection spell the fire hit and this time he felt the heat of it on his skin he gritted his teeth poured more of his strength into it when the woman landed she pressed her palms together and the burst of fire was tremendous but tarlak had had enough remember this he said pulling out the sword hilt from his pocket the crystal on it flared to life and all about him the fire died as if it had never existed you have nicholass sword she said at the womans shocked expression tarlak grinned just the hilt he said twirling it in his fingers hed had brug remove the blade and then over the course of a few hours hed replenished the magic in the crystal turning it back to clear i must say i thought it cheating shame nicholas died before i could tell him so the woman rushed him abandoning the fire tarlak took a step back but she was faster and her kick connected with his midsection he let out a gasp as the air was blasted from his lungs she swiped at the sword hilt but he clung to it as if his life depended upon it she unleashed a flurry of punches half of which he failed to dodge her fists struck his face his chest and when he collapsed onto his back she fell atop him tarlak tensed every muscle in his body as she put his head into a lock her slender arms choking tighter and tighter what good is that sword if you cant cast either you damn fool she asked driving her knees into his stomach so she might apply more pressure on his neck the hand holding the hilt was caught by her legs but his other was free and he pressed it against her chest in a futile attempt to push her off as the arm of his robe fell back he saw her eyes go wide catching sight of the blue tattoo glowing across his wrist i can cheat too tarlak gasped as her panicked grip loosened the magic within the tattoo enacted flowing through his hand and into her chest it was a solid force like an invisible battering ram blasting her entire body and it hit with a tremendous boom her head arched back her arms flailed and tarlak winced at the sound of a dozen breaking bones her body flew several feet back landing in a sprawl atop the roof tarlak stood tossed the sword hilt aside and rubbed his bruised neck think i might have overdone it he muttered he glanced at the tattoo which was already fading from his skin his entire arm ached and it itched where the ink had been never again he swore haern leapt up to the rooftop landing silently mere feet away from the body he was bleeding at the shoulder but seemed otherwise fine dead too he said letting out a curse need someone alive he turned and leapt back off toward the alley where brug and delysia had been waiting tarlak rushed after and he peered off the rooftop to see where the fight continued below brug stood protectively before delysia hunched over with several daggers sticking out from the creases of his armor he still held his punch daggers and he kept them up at the ready behind him delysia cast a barrage of spells blinding and disorientating their opponent the rail thin and final member of the bloodcrafts come on brug was saying you can do better than this the bloodcraft seemed to agree he flung several more but brug kept in his way most bounced off his thick platemail except for the one that sailed wide missing because of a blinding white light that flared from his sisters hand tarlak shook his head relieved the two could fight in such a odd but effective pair the man pulled out several more daggers and through rapidly blinking eyelids tried to find a way around to get close without enduring the priestesss barrage or brugs daggers he apparently saw none and then his chance was gone haern emerged from the shadows behind him striking him hard on the back of the head with the hilt of a saber the man dropped his body going limp tarlak cast a spell to slow his fall then stepped off the roof and gently floated down when his feet touched ground he crossed his arms and glared at haern some ambush he said haern shrugged at least we won right despite delysias insistence brug marched over to haern and smacked him in the chest with a mailed glove i had him he said clearly unhappy haern lifted an eyebrow sorry get over here delysia said grabbing brugs shoulder youre bleeding all over the place tarlak gestured toward the unconscious man as his sister pulled brug away so she could remove the knives and work her healing magic what do we do with him haern sheathed a saber then tapped the man with the other we get some answers he said i want to know who hired them tarlak frowned think hell talk a dark edge entered haerns eyes and tarlak didnt like it one bit get delysia out of herebrug too his friend said i dont want them to see this and yes hell talk tarlak put a hand on haerns shoulder be careful he said hes no threat to me thats not what i meant haern looked away sighed i know but someone wants us dead and i intend to find out who if it comes between this mans life and all of yours just be careful tarlak said turning to the others lets go home he said and ashhur help us you really are bleeding everywhere brug thren lurked at the edge of the newly acquired sun territory watching the people come and go night had just fallen but deep in the southern district it seemed a new life blossomed ignorant of the light men and women were flocking to the new guild thren knew hed even spotted several adopting the fourpointed star and casting aside their cloak very little ceremony or fanfare hed done his best to cull their numbers but it was beyond controlling now with the promise of coin trade power and overthrowing of the trifectwhat did the rest of the guilds have to offer against that tread lightly thren whispered to himself as he watched yet another man throw off his cloak how many of his own spiders might now be with the suns and when he put out his call would they come to him or dare hope they might go unpunished thren chuckled of course theyd ignore him loyalty was bought with power there was a changing of the guard in the underworld and until something happened to shake everyones confidence in the suns none would dare return to his side which is why thren lurked hidden beside a building where there was no light so he could watch and wait only one thing could slow down the suns at least in his mind just one killing grayson to do that he needed to know where the man was hiding where hed chosen to set up his base so far hed been patient not wanting grayson to even know he was being hunted at least by him the other guilds would no doubt be doing the same but theyd be hesitant about out and out warfare thren knew their leaders knew how cowardly they were deep down in their black hearts theyd want to know if they could make alliances if they could grab hold of the suns rise and use it to reestablish their own dominance in the city they didnt realize the fire they played with didnt realize grayson had no intention of letting a single guild other than his own operate within the walls of veldaren thren tensed the sight before him jarring him from his thoughts one of the original members of the suns that had come over from mordeina was meeting with two others at the street corner he passed them a bag no doubt of some cheaper leaf and then whispered a few words thren watched to see if hed return the direction hed come from or move elsewhere and then prepared to follow when the man continued on thren slipped in behind him just a shadow in the street the sun walked as if in no hurry then suddenly burst into a run hooking a sharp left into an alley thren chuckled and he calmly drew his swords hed been spotted which meant the man was skilled that hed given away this knowledge by bursting out in a run meant he was overconfident and hasty for one so skilled would not panic easily nor be spooked by a simple tail the man had no intention of running only giving the appearance of it which meant an ambush one thren willingly entered six steps into the alley thren spun sword slashing as hed thought the sun member had crouched behind a barrel at the entrance and leapt out with dagger ready thren batted it aside stepped closer and then thrust to his surprise the man managed to pull back in time to parry skilled indeed but not enough thren flung at him with the ferocity of a wild animal he had the man trapped against the wall and with the greater reach of his blades had every advantage ten seconds later the daggers fell from bleeding hands thren pressed the tip of his sword against the mans neck your name he asked pierce said the thin man well pierce said thren how much pain do you wish to feel the man licked his lips as if he were facing a trick question little as necessary he said a wise answer tell me where grayson is and that is what youll receive only a dead man turns on grayson pierce said thren pressed his blade tighter against pierces neck you are a dead man he said but thats not what matters thats not the question the question was and still ishow much pain do you wish to feel finally he saw a hint of true fear in pierces eyes you cant do shit to me he said you do and youll get it back ten times worse veldarens our city now go back to whatever guild you serve and tell them that thren laughed i am my guild he said i serve none but myself and i can do a lot pierce so much in so little time it took a few minutes but he got his answers billicks oddities wasnt too far away and he knew the shop well the man was a notorious cheat and he showed no loyalty to any guild because of that everyone liked him and everyone used him to deal stolen goods with him gold was all that mattered which meant you knew exactly how far to trust him thren grinned at the thought it looked like billick had found a partnership worth far too much for him to turn down pierce had said they only used billicks place to store their goods not stay themselves but thren had a feeling grayson would always be nearby his takeover of veldaren depended on his product he wouldnt leave it unguarded thren approached cautiously watching for any inquisitive pairs of eyes he couldnt rely on cloaks and colors anymore with so much in flux everyone could be a snitch when he was at the top of the road leading down to billicks and almost within sight of the store thren heard the first of the horns he stopped confused by what they meant when a second sounded further away he realized what it was but could hardly believe it what madness is this he wondered aloud troops marched into the southern district coordinating their movements with the blows of trumpets it couldnt be the city guard at least not alone the king was too cowardly for that only one person made sense and given the audacity hed already shown thren knew he shouldnt be as surprised as he was victor was coming to play thren rushed toward billicks he wouldnt let victor get grayson that was his kill his chance to send a message west to the guilds in mordeina they would never fear victor no matter how many men he had he was still an outside lord a man not of their world no matter how bright he shined he would never find them all in the shadows for it to matter thren had to be the executioner sounds of combat reached his ears first little then gradually louder the marching of feet soon followed screams scattered and few accompanied the progressive movement south as thren ran he saw suns joining him on the street all fleeing to the same place thren drew his swords stabbed a man beside him wearing their colors without losing a step he shifted to the side overtaking another fleeing woman she sprawled headfirst into the dirt after he slashed out her heel at the doors of billicks oddities several men gathered simultaneously dispersing as a squad of ten armored men turned the corner one of the soldiers lifted a horn to his lips and blew thren hooked a right finding the alley occupied with a man furiously pulling at a scrap of cloth sewn into the sleeve of his shirt that identified his guild allegiance having second thoughts he asked the dirty man grinning thren cut out his throat before he could answer his fingers still in the hole hed torn in the fabric glancing side to side he gauged the cramped distance between the two buildings decided them close enough he leapt from wall to wall constantly kicking himself higher so that on the third kick he landed atop the building directly adjacent to billicks as hed expected grayson was up there surveying the movement of the troops thren knew well how he felt for hed done the same when victor stormed his headquarters but how had victor discovered graysons place a black fire gave him his answer firing up from the ground toward the rooftop grayson dropped to his stomach avoiding deathmasks attack glancing over the edge of the roof thren saw the ash guildmaster leading a squad of six armored soldiers victor at his side grayson looked up from where he lay saw thren watching his lips were grinning but his eyes promised death thren grinned right back the two were about to be kindred spirits in their homelessness grayson as if imagining his thoughts only shook his head in disagreement thren turned and ran still shaking off surprise that victor would ally with someone as despicable and unpredictable as deathmask and his ash guild on the only safe path out he raced across the rooftops toward the edge of the sweeping net victor created and sure enough when he glanced back grayson was in chase they understood each other well knew neither would settle for capture by the meddlesome lord they had a score to settle behind them smoke billowed into the air as billicks shop went up in flames burning away the last of the suns leaf thren ran ran leaping over the gaps between buildings without slowing in the slightest his shortswords grew heavy in his hands as he held them grayson had often defeated him when they sparred and hed near fatally wounded his son as well could he win now digging in his heels thren came to a halt spinning on grayson like a deer turning on a chasing wolf hed made a promise sworn his vows he was thren felhorn how could he lay claim to a city yet fear to fight one making similar claims he would not let grayson be right no running not from this standing firm he held his swords together in an x eyes locked on the giant man barreling toward him they crashed together graysons weight and momentum pushing him back in the light of the stars upon the rooftops the two battled thren constantly circled refusing to give grayson a chance to bring his full strength to bear the ringing of their swords was a song and the battle felt so comfortable so familiar that only the pounding of his heart in his ears assured him that it was not some old training match not some unimportant spar but a meeting to the death this stops nothing grayson said hammering at threns defenses his shortswords dwarfed by his enormous arms moved with both speed and unmatched power veldaren is ours thren thren dove underneath a swipe circled to his left then slashed upward at graysons side one sword he parried but the other cut into flesh it was a minor wound like a bee stinging a bull but it angered him nonetheless its mine grayson thren shouted as he retreated once more leaping back and forth in the constrained limits of their chosen place of battle veldaren its people its fearmine and i do not share liar wretch grayson continued on showing no impatience despite threns stalling tactic he knew better than to give thren any sort of edge when thren fell too far back grayson took the moment to catch his breath and rebalance his stance before slowly approaching youve lost that title that respect the watcher took it from you i fought him thren whatever miracle kept him alive doesnt change that he should have died and by my hand you could have killed him at any time yet you havent you coward thren stood there hunched low ready to spring into an attack at any time grayson shifted his feet ready to meet it coward thren asked is that so you let him live why threns grin spread ear to ear and despite his exhaustion despite his inability to score more than a single scratch on his opponent he laughed because hes my son he said your son grayson froze just for a moment as he realized all that meant marions son thren said your blood as well as mine you damn fool the watcher and i are two sides of a single coin every man woman and child of this city fears one of us together we own the night you are nothing to him nothing to me he lives as do i come grayson lets see if the same can be said of you come the dawn thren leapt at him every ounce of his speed sending him flying toward the giant man once more their swords clashed but graysons mind was overcome for just a moment unable to maintain the balance needed against such an opponent but thren had cried his tears for marion and hed long since buried her in his heart graysons wounds though theyd stayed fresh and because of it new ones slashed across his chest as thren pressed harder and harder he felt rage boiling in his veins and it gave him strength looping closer he slashed through graysons left wrist severing tendons the blade dropped to the ground thren hammered the other staying close denying him the chance to flee the other fell its handle soaked with blood as thren hacked into his arm grayson tried to sweep out his feet with a kick but thren leapt into the air his knee catching graysons forehead the man fell back and thren stabbed through his side the blade puncturing the roof so it held him there like a stake grayson screamed and he pulled against the blade another stab this one through the shoulder kept him down thren leaned close so they were mere inches away you know who he is he said your arrival was not coincidence youve spat in my face and for that youll die but first youll tell me who what are you talking about grayson asked still struggling against the two blades thren had purposefully made sure neither punched through a vital organ wanting to control graysons death to have it be exactly when he desired it the man mocking me he said the one who has killed my members taken their eyes and left his words written in blood tell me who he is i dont know grayson said he reached toward thren with a shaking hand and despite his wounds tried to grab his neck to strangle him thren admired his dedication but had no time for that he released the hilts of his swords grabbed graysons wrists and held him down you lie i was never told his name threns eyes narrowed told by who grayson shook his head and he laughed despite his pain its all a game thren and i played along because it suited us well his names laerek a priest of karak it made no sense but he detected no lie a priest he asked what have i done to them that karaks followers would hate me another laugh i dont know and i dont give a shit thren grabbed graysons neck with a hand and pushed his head down tell me where to find him are you going to kill me thren swallowed and then he nodded yeah i will grayson let out a soft sigh his dark skin was turning pale yet he kept total control of his voice so be it hell be waiting for me in an alley off songbird road by that shoemakers place thren again sensed no lie he stood and his hand closed around the hilt of his sword thren grayson said and for the first time his voice wavered yes grayson grinned darkly make sure that bastard suffers thren yanked the blade free spun it around and then slashed open graysons throat his body convulsed for a moment as blood spilled across his neck and chest and then he lay still thren stood over him breathing heavily and despite himself he felt tears run down his face you loved marion more than i he told the corpse a shame it cost you so he yanked the other sword free not bothering to clean off the blood he still had work to do laerek thren whispered as trumpets sounded the raid on the sun guild nearing its end alyssa tossed and turned but she could not sleep zusa had still not returned and with the setting of the sun she felt her hope dwindling with every creak of a board she sat up in bed looking to see if zusa was opening the door or climbing down from the ceiling always nothing shed give so much to have the faceless woman climb into her bed to wrap her arms around her and tell her everything was well everything was safe despite her wealth and fortune she could not buy the one thing she so desperately needed still feeling anxious she at last gave up on sleep and slipped out of bed she threw a robe over her thin nightgown then stepped into the hallways it was dark despite the many candles something gnawed at her tired mind but she couldnt place what it was even more impatient she hurried to nathaniels room if she were stuck awake at least itd be with her son seeing him asleep and at peace was often what it took to reassure her troubled mind that all was well shed done it plenty when he was a newborn and though it felt childish to do so now that he was older she didnt care reaching his door she again felt that gnawing fear an awareness that she was missing something both troubling and obvious opening the door to her sons room she stepped inside and was surprised to find that he was still awake mom his head tilted higher and he clearly looked relieved two candles burned on the other side of the room filling the room with yellow light is something wrong she asked sitting down beside his bed he sat up which revealed the stump of his arm it was scabbed over with several spots bleeding from him picking at it nathaniel seemed oblivious just scratching repeatedly with his hand as he shuddered and looked away alyssa felt the worry in her gut strengthen i dont want to sleep he said you know you need to i can see how tired you are its not that he said ii dont want to dream i keep seeing him mommy and i dont want to anymore him alyssa frowned what do you mean he looked feverish yet when she touched his face he was bathed in a cold sweat every time i dream i see him laughing he said veldarens burning and he laughs alyssa kissed his forehead then gently pushed him onto his back tucking him in she tried to hide any of her own fears hed had night terrors before particularly after hed lost his arm and itd taken over a year for them to go away yet this seemed different hed never really been aware of what frightened him back then why hed awaken screaming how long have you had these dreams she asked trying to sound more tired than worried ever since grandmother showed me the chrysarium alyssa forced herself not to frown chrysarium what in karaks name was a chrysarium it sounded like something a wizard might conjure up that her mother had exposed him to it without checking with her first immediately made her angry honey what did grandmother show you he shrank into the bed scratched harder at the stump of his arm she made me promise not to tell you can tell me you know that you can always tell me everything she reached down and grabbed his hand to stop the picking tell me she said letting a little of her earnestness come through i saw visions he said grandmother said they were from the gods and it meant i was special but i dont want them theyre horrible and they wont let me sleep alyssa swallowed and a hundred things she might scream at melody ran through her mind listen to me nathan she said theyre just visions they cant hurt you and they dont mean anything i want you to lie here and try to relax you dont have to sleep if you dont want to im going to talk to melody and find out what happened if she did something maybe she can fix this but shell be asleep a dry smile stretched across alyssas lips then ill wake her she kissed his cheek then stood when she reached his door she stopped for she heard shuffling on the other side for some reason her heart froze and she remained perfectly still as the sound slowly faded away peering through a crack she saw a young woman with dark brown hair heading down the hall alyssa frowned she didnt look like a servant nor dress like one yet alyssa could not place her despite their time in the mansion nathan she whispered turning back to her son when i step out i want you to lock the door all right no questions and dont open it for anyone but me you understand with that she entered the hall and then waited until she heard the rattle of his lock satisfied she hurried the opposite direction as the unknown woman and came upon stephens room the door slightly ajar was the woman a prostitute perhaps not that she cared to judge stephens actions but it seemed odd the guards would not escort her and then it hit her the obvious fear that had gnawed at the back of her mind the guards there should have been guards stationed all around the home at her door nathaniels and especially stephens but there were none a chill spread through her veins why were there no guards her instincts were to run to her son but his door was locked and shed checked it the first night hed stayed in there alone itd take a solid beating by grown men to break the bolt swallowing the instinct down she instead slipped into stephens room always before it was locked and guarded shed assumed it wellfounded paranoia of assassins now though inside she found a room similar to her own well furnished and with an enormous bed in the center its lavender bed curtains pulled back moonlight streamed in through three windows faintly illuminating the room in a soft blue the bed itself was empty in the far corner she saw a door also open yellow light shone from within flickering off an unseen candle curious she walked toward the door glad her feet were bare on the thick carpet she made hardly a sound with her passing stopping just before the entrance she drew a deep breath and prayed it was all nothing all a strange misunderstanding thered be nothing within but clothes finery maybe some old armor alyssa stepped inside three candles in a golden candelabra rest atop a small stool on either side of her covering the walls of what appeared to be an extraordinarily large closet were portraits of leon connington drawn in various styles and skills she recognized them well for theyd once decorated the walls upon her last visits before leon had been killed by the watcher she remembered zusa remarking upon their absence and the implied dislike the son might have carried for the father but there in that room she knew it was the reverse a clandestine revering of the man whose eyes glowered down from all corners every instinct of warning fired off in her mind the mansion was no longer safe to her turning to leave she stopped for on the ground nearly hidden from the light of the candles was a jar the mere sight of it twisted her stomach despite being unable to identify the contents within with shaking hands she knelt down grabbed it and lifted it up to the candlelight it was made of thick clear glass swirling within a syrupy liquid of some kind were over a dozen naked eyeballs it took all her control to hold back her scream the jar fell from her hands and landed with a dull thud on the carpet alyssa left it there and rushed for the door she needed her son so they could flee even the wild streets at night would feel safer than the enclosed walls of the connington mansion before exiting she had the presence of mind to stop and check the hall first from the crack in the door she saw the approach of the same unknown womanexcept now she wasnt quite so unknown alyssa recognized those eyes the softness of the nose and chin it cant be him she thought but knew it was she ducked back behind the door was he coming back to his room she had no blade no weapon and none appeared to be in his room in her indecision she tensed waiting for the door to press open it did not holding her breath alyssa once more peered out through the door and saw that hed continued on she could see the small crossbow in his hand pressed against his side as he walked sticking her head out she could just barely see her own door down the hall and sure enough stephen slowly pushed it open and slid inside without making a sound the moment he vanished within alyssa ran once more thankful for the bareness of her feet when stephen found her room empty there was only one place hed think to go and it was the one place she had to beat him to at the door to nathaniels room she stopped knocked twice the noise seeming unbearably loud and then waited for a sound of movement its me your mother she said not waiting for him to ask unlock the door now he did and she shoved it open hard enough to send him staggering backward stepping inside she spun shut it and then pressed in the bolt that done she grabbed nathaniel pressed him against her and wondered what in all of dezrel she could possibly do now mom he asked when she said nothing only held him shush she said blowing out the candles to plunge the room into darkness dont make a noise he nodded the two backed away slowly as if a monster lurked on the other side of the door one did except it wasnt a creature of legend or fireside tales this one was real its venom deadly its appetite sick and deranged the doorknob turned alyssas breath caught in her throat and she pressed a hand over nathaniels mouth the door pressed inward just a fraction before the bolt caught it for a moment a pause and then the knob returned to its resting position two knocks followed nathan she heard stephen ask from the other side his voice was gentle as if embarrassed to impose nathaniel its me stephen are you awake i need to tell you something about your mother she clutched her son tighter nathaniel more knocks heavier his voice took on a firmer edge nathaniel i said open the door this is important alyssas mind raced there was the window but it was fairly high and only nathaniel could fit through it she held little doubt that after her death nathans would follow guards crawled along the outside could her son escape especially without her help she didnt think so she commanded a presence an implied threat of house against house warfare nathaniel was a small boy with a severed arm born of a disgraced father his disappearance would bother no one but would stephen hurt nathaniel if he wasnt certain about her own fate it was a horrible gamble but she saw no other way listen she whispered into her sons ear desperately praying that stephen would not hear through the door my life depends on you get in bed and pretend youve had a nightmare no matter what i am not here you understand me im not here he nodded she kissed his forehead as stephen banged on the door nathaniel open the door this instant though her son was small his bed was still plenty big and alyssa crawled underneath and backed as far as she could against the wall despite every logical part of her telling her this was her best hope to survive she still felt a horrible guilt smothering her crushing her chest if stephen did something to nathaniel while she hid under his bed like a damn child no time taking in a breath she held it as nathaniel undid the bolt the door flung open and she heard footsteps as stephen entered im sorry she heard her son say i was scared i hadwhy are you dressed like that a pause before the answer i um its just a game nathaniel a game adults play is your mother in here i was hoping you were her nathaniel said i keep dreaming of him of that horrible man a good lie thought alyssa especially for off the cuff should they get out of this alive she knew shed have to watch him more carefully stephen stepped further into the room she could see his feet from where she hid and for some reason it horrified her to see a shaven leg in a longheeled shoe was it just a disguise or something more did she truly know so little of the man whose house shed been living in and what was the reason for his hatred of her household and of the spider guild i thought i heard whispering stephen said was that you iwas praying praying to who nathan he seemed to have no answer stephen continued further into the room out of her sight the closet door opened shut still she waited the lighting was incredibly poor just what little moonlight came in through the curtained window perhaps in the darkness he would not see stephen knelt before the bed her whole world froze he was looking right at her everything about him was solid black just a feminine shape peering underneath the bed alyssa didnt move didnt breath didnt even dare think she felt like a rabbit cornered by a wolf and then after a few agonizing seconds he stood just checking for monsters he said to her son slowly she let out a breath as tears ran down her face is it safe nathaniel asked as stephen headed for the door no monsters stephen said go back to bed oh and nathanif youre to pray pray to karak hes the true god of this world youre old enough to be accountable for such things now yes milord another pause and then the door shut alyssa clutched the carpet with her fingers trying to push away her lingering terror her son sat on the bed his feet dangling off rolling out she got to her knees and wrapped her arms about him she was still embracing him when the door reopened and stephen stepped inside a terrible smile on his painted face alyssa froze too stunned to act something so simple so stupid had cost her terribly nathan hadnt relocked the door hello alyssa stephen said lifting the crossbow zusa flew through the streets legs pumping and head bobbing with her gasping of air too much she thought she was pushing herself too much shed undergone hunger and torture the dagger in her right hand mostly numb as it clutched her dagger yet she dared not waste a precious second resting or recapturing her breath a hundred images flashed through her mind and every one of them was too painful to dwell on for long she saw alyssa lying on her bed or the floor or out in the garden of the estate her eyes open but empty silver coins staring up at the stars through it all the words of vrashka echoed in her head seemingly innocuous at first but now so far from it i spent time with stephens gentle touchers not so long ago did you know that why would stephen have any connection with the priests of karak let alone have his familys personal torturers training someone of their faith there was an easy answer but she didnt want to believe it didnt want to acknowledge how it explained why the widow might be able to get inside the mansion so she ran and prayed to any god other than karak to let her beloved alyssa be safe and nathaniel as well shed promised him shed always be there in the shadows to protect him what if it wasnt just alyssa she found with eyes of silver and a tongue of gold zusa stumbled her concentration broken by such nightmarish daydreaming the empty streets spun before her and she landed on her shoulder hard enough to elicit a cry of pain laying there tears swelling she saw a shape flying through the air behind her solid dark but for the faint gray of the cloak trailing after no pause no hesitation zusa rolled to her right her cloak wrapping about her upper body ezra landed her knee and dagger striking where she should have been zusa kicked at ezras legs but the woman leapt over it diving toward her with both daggers leading arms trapped by her thick cloak she pushed the fabric outward ezras daggers punched through it but the handguards snagged when zusa twisted and shoved to the side again she kicked this time connecting with ezras midsection the faceless woman fell back so she might regain her balance zusa staggered to her feet let her ragged cloak unfurl about her did daverik decide it was time for me to die zusa asked he still loves you ezra said crouching down as she circled her looking like a strange animal ready for the pounce even her eyes were wide and wild but even he knows that the loyalty of our faith must come before those we love some faith zusa said grinning to hide her exhaustion and worry is that what they told you when they stripped you naked and forced you into the faceless loyalty before love ezra thrust but pulled it back when zusa moved to block it another thrust this one equally prepared for ezra was testing for an opening gauging her reaction speed zusa felt her nerves fraying she didnt have time for this you dont deserve his love ezra said youre wrong zusa said he doesnt deserve mine zusa took the offensive and was surprised when ezra did not move to block instead she remained still even when the daggers closed in on her neck but zusa did not cut flesh instead her daggers moved right through as if hitting a mirage from behind her she heard laughter and spun to find ezra there twirling her daggers in mockery i have karaks blessing she said behold his gift as zusa watched ezras form grew still then blinked away just an afterimage it was like when staring too long at the sun the seeing of something burned into the eye that wasnt actually there zusa tensed for an attack but could only guess where it would come from i prayed ezra said off to her left zusa spun but again just an afterimage when ezra spoke again she was on the right all night i prayed for the strength to defeat you and now i have it the image of her shifted and suddenly she was mere inches away leering toward her i can move faster than the eye she told zusa laughing what hope have you now zusa swung at her and their daggers connected for a moment it was an old familiar dance a give and take of position that zusa knew she could easily win but when she tried to finish her opponent to thrust through an opening to pierce ezras heart ezras form turned blurry and then she was ten feet away down the street damn it zusa whispered she didnt have time for this but she had to remain calm had to think slowly ezra approached reeking of confidence will you always run zusa asked her stand and fight and stop using karaks gift as an excuse to hide your cowardice ezra shook her head still walking toward her every slow footstep ate away another second each one perhaps the difference between life and death for alyssa and ezra knew it too zusa could see it in the mocking glint in the womans eyes zusa flung herself forward a rash attack that ezra would expect from her with her skill it might have been enough to overwhelm ezra but zusa had something else in mind at the last moment just before their daggers clashed she dove to the side making a run toward the mansion ezra spun and zusa trusted her to react on instinct to believe her frantically running toward her loved ones a mere two steps toward the mansion zusa flipped her left dagger so the blade faced downward in her fist then dug her heels in so she might fling herself backward it was a blind stab a gamble as her dagger thrust through her own cloak ezra collided with her caught unaware of the sudden change in her direction the blade of the dagger punched through cloth flesh then belly ezra gasped her upper body collapsing against zusa her head on her shoulder zusa twisted keeping the position awkward and their bodies entangled so ezra could not thrust zusa gasped ezra as her body shivered you should have listened zusa said pulling her dagger free you could have found freedom you could have prevented this when she pushed away the other woman had nothing to lean against and no strength of her own to stand zusa ran on leaving ezra to die alone slumped over in the dirt and darkness alyssa lay on the floor of nathaniels room slowly breathing in and out as blood trickled down the side of her chest to the carpet the small bolt had caught her right breast and with each breath it flared with pain despite every desire to move to scream and fight she could do nothing immobilized by the poison coursing through her veins dont cry nathan stephen said a second bolt readied in the crossbow and aimed straight at him i know youre young but melodys said much of you youre a bright child a wise child i think youre ready for this ready to see the ugly truth behind the lies of this world a tear ran down alyssas face she could see her son crouched on his bed struggling not to cry his entire body quivered with fear a fresh wave of seething hatred flushed through alyssa and she tried to stand to move her disobedient limbs still nothing dont hurt her she heard her son whimper shush now stephen said lowering the crossbow odd as it was it seemed as if he meant the comforting words he spoke i didnt say this would be easy but this must be done it must do you love your grandmother nathan nathaniel glanced at her their eyes meeting the terror there was so deep but he was still fighting still trying to think of what to do and what to say shed never felt more proud and her heart ached that shed never see what type of man hed become yes he said i love her too stephen said he straddled alyssas waist while on his knees the crossbow he placed beside him and from his pocket he pulled out a slender knife he leaned close to alyssa peering down at her with heavily painted eyes the wig hung loose from his head and at such a close distance she could see flakes of dead flesh i love her more than your mother does he continued more than anyone ever has yet do you know what your grandfather did do you know what he put her through alyssa thought of the story shed been told of maynard giving melody over to leons gentle touchers she tried to make the connection to understand you dont know stephen whispered leaning closer so that their noses touched youre trying but you dont know leon loved her just like i loved her but he couldnt do anything howd you put it your father would have killed my father if hed found out such a sick man sick and do you know whats worse nathan he glanced at her son your grandfather paid for your grandmother to be tortured paid like she was just another common whore needing to be put in her place do you know how much alyssas terror deepened she knew the amount knew it before the words even left stephens lips two gold and two silver the knife slipped closer pressing against the underside of her left eye panic flushed her mind but she couldnt move couldnt move she looked to her son knew it was the last time shed ever see him the knife pushed in twisted cut the pain was white hot and she felt tears and blood pour down her face with a plop the eye came free and stephen held it in his soft delicate hand nathaniel let out a cry and stephen whirled on him with a fury you watch he cried damn you you little child you watch they left me in darkness when i was your age just like they left her i had to listen to her screams as they tortured her and stuck in their pins like it was all just a game mom nathaniel said face red nose and eyes running she wanted to go to him wanted to hold him but stephen was not yet done darkness he said turning back he was speaking to her now not her son he twisted the bolt back and forth in her chest just to make sure it still hurt years and years in darkness always alone but for your mothers beautiful songs but she wont be your mother anymore shell be mine just mine in went the knife her vision swirled with a brief rainbow of colors that slowly drained away becoming nothing but black streaked with orange and red that throbbed with the beating of her heart and the horrible spikes of pain drool spread down her lips as she struggled to speak to say anything as she heard nathaniels sobs hot breath blew against her ear i should leave you like this stephen whispered put you in my dungeon to rot i still have my gentle touchers they could spend years on you years without running out of new ways to alyssa heard a gasp followed by a heavy thud you bastard it was too horrible not knowing what was happening had nathaniel attacked stephen she heard a sharp intake of air and then something hit a wall how dare you strike me stephen asked her son had defended her it had to be dont she pleaded the words came out a slurred moan but it seemed to steal stephens attention back to her dont he asked dont what your son struck me woman blessed as he is i think he needs to learn his place ill scream she heard nathaniel say scream and i cut your throat to silence it your choice if lord gandrem heard or melody what would happen would he kill them or would they talk him down alyssa didnt know didnt want to know but it seemed her son was braver than that he let out a single bloodcurdling scream at such a high pitch and volume that it pierced the night like a siren damn it stop stephen said she waited for the killing blow but before it came something heavy blasted open the door and then stephen let out a cry an object perhaps a body slammed against a wall she heard the sound of metal then a cracking of a bone how dare you she heard zusa ask where is laerek where is your master hiding stephen let out a moan and it ended abruptly with a wet smack where hehes waiting for me by eddletons what street songbird stephen cried alyssa heard crying and then she felt a soft hand take hers it trembled despite the poison she gently curled her fingers about it the weakest support she could offer nathaniels face pressed against her chest then lifted back no doubt realizing how close he was to the arrow still embedded there with an abruptness that startled her stephens cries came to a halt alyssa she heard zusa say and then wrapped hands touched her face im sorry im so sorry i never should have left you zusa alyssa managed to say but that was it lips kissed hers and then out came the arrow her scream was a pathetic whisper of air exiting her lungs more movement at the door plus a surprised gasp what insanity is this asked johns booming voice oh godsalyssa stephen youre safe now zusa whispered hurriedly into her ear hes dead but one monster still runs loose i have to find him please understand i have to zusa left her more voices more people cries for a priest or a healer nathaniel stayed pressed against her through it all at some point melody arrived her sharp feminine cry easily discernible stephen she heard melody say alyssa oh you dear you poor dear nathaniel clutched her tighter despite the soothing words and her mothers hand brushing against her forehead while she whispered comfort all alyssa could think of was zusas absence and how it had been stephens name melody cried first upon seeing the bloody carnage not hers haern dragged the unconscious bloodcraft through the alleys knowing it would only be a matter of time before the city guard arrived to investigate the noise and chaos that had been their battle and despite his trust for antonil haern didnt want the city guard to be the ones to discover the name he sought no he wanted that for himself whoever it was had made it personal in attacking the eschaton and hed deal with it personally in return at last he reached a nice secluded spot tucked against the outer wall of the city thered be no patrols and anyone who heard screams would be wise enough to keep the matter to themselves haern propped the man against the wall then opened up his red coat to see the rows of leather loops for holding knives half of them empty removing the rest haern cut strips of the coat into lengths then bound the mans hands and feet the throwing daggers he left in a pile nearby having every intention of using them if the need presented itself ready he started slapping the mans face and pinching his nose to disrupt his breathing it took a bit but at last he awoke gasping for air where the fuck am i the man asked haern drew a saber and smacked him across the face with the flat side im asking the questions he said lets start with your name percy the man said and thats the only question you get an answer to haern grabbed him by the throat and slammed his head against the wall for your sake id hope not he said percy grinned at him despite the blood that dripped down his neck you think you can frighten me he asked you got veldaren fooled but you wont be fooling us youre nothing us haern asked theres no us not anymore the rest of your group is dead youre the last this seemed to shake him a little but not much percy bit his tongue then turned and spat fine he said not much point protecting anyone if what you say is true what is it you want who hired you to kill us i want a name and where to find him percy shook his head cant do it if im to have any chance as a mercenary after this it cant be with the reputation of a snitch bad enough a bunch of pussies like you beat us a mercenary haern asked leaning in closer you think ill let you live if you dont what reason i have to talk in answer haern grabbed one of the throwing knives and jammed it into percys leg percy winced but held down his scream you think you can break me he asked after gathering his strength i dont think its in you too soft a second knife an inch higher up the leg this time percy did scream but not for long you he said laughing despite being out of breath you think this will work ill bleed out too quick dont have much he winced as haern jammed in a third practice at this do you tell me his name haern said grabbing percy by the shirt and pulling him close hed frightened others before often with just the intensity in his eyes but this man seemed to be close bedfellows with pain and fear you try to act the monster percy said spitting in haerns face but i grew up with monsters i know who they are how to smell em youre not a monster thren is carson was but you another laugh youve killed so many watcher yet youve somehow prevented it from changing you why you think it makes you a better pers haern jammed his saber into percys stomach then twisted it the moment he removed the blade blood would gush out along with intestines now percy said slumping against the wall now thats the monster were you hiding it watcher howquaint tell me where haern said his names laerek percy said a priest hell be he launched into a coughing fit each cough weaker than the last his skin was turning pale haern felt sick in his stomach realizing how far hed gone the man might die before giving him more than a name all because hed lost control all because hed wanted for whatever reason to prove that he could be the monster percy doubted he could be down on songbird percy said hesatshop more coughing his eyes had turned glassy too much blood lost haern knew damn it he whispered tell me where quickly percy shook his head pull out the sword he said and go look for yourself haern yanked it free blood gushed out and as it did percys body began convulsing in his last death throes haern watched feeling strangely guilty for the act at last when all life was gone he sheathed his sabers and then ran songbird ran for about a mile there were only so many shops on it but itd take a lot of time to search them all still time he had at least to try starting at the southern edge of the road he followed it north his mind racing why would a priest hire the bloodcrafts to kill the eschaton that a priest of karak would want them dead wasnt much of a stretch and tarlak tended to be meddlesome when it came to their darker affairs but there had to have been some specific reason as haern ran he checked each shop those of bakers jewelers smiths makers of cloth and wool most were dark and their doors locked feeling his desperation grow he continued on until he heard a man scream from an alley behind him spinning about haern rushed into it only to come to a halt thren felhorn was there swords drawn laying at his feet was a priest wearing the black robes of karak so far he was alive but his face was covered with blood haern realized why when thren tossed the mans severed ear onto his chest i said talk thren told him laerek hearn said grabbing his fathers attention this man is laerek isnt it thren looked up and his expression was one haern could not read was it anger or amusement it is thren said do ghosts have business with him as well so far hed made no overtly threatening actions but he still held his swords which was enough to make him incredibly dangerous haern slowly stepped into the alley with his weapons drawn im no ghost and no dead man despite what rumors you might have heard haern said making sure his hood was pulled low to hide his face in its magical shadows this man hired mercenaries to kill me and my friends i want to know why laerek refused to look his way he was a thin man with a long nose and now missing an ear thren kicked him once blasting the air from his lungs it seems youve been messing with very dangerous people thren told the priest before turning back to haern this man sent the suns after my guild id appreciate knowing why as well laerek rolled onto his back and pressed against the nearby wall karak be my strength he prayed not pain nor death nor threats of this world thren kicked him in the teeth to stop the prayer karak will not help you thren said kneeling before him and you will feel pain so much pain before your death if you want to do something useful with your words then talk the more you talk the less you suffer haern watched as thren grabbed laereks hand took his shortsword and slowly sliced into the tendons of his wrist laerek let out a cry yet as haern watched he felt no pity no remorse instead he felt himself back as a child watching his father cutting off the hand of a man that had cheated them despite the passing of time thren was still in charge still holding the lives of others in his hands haern knew he should object hed spent his whole childhood rebelling against everything thren had taught him yet this priest had played with all their lives everyone haern knew and loved would be dead if hed had his way and so he watched the blood drip to the ground and hardened his heart against it had he not just thrust his own blade into the belly of another all for a name start talking thren said as he continued to saw he kept his fist clenching down against the veins so hed not bleed out his sword reached bone and its sharp edge began to pry into the joint why the suns why did you have to send grayson after me after all these years i didnt laerek cried the suns were willing thats all i know then why the widow haern crossed his arms and frowned the widow laerek was behind that as well hes just a spoiled wealthy brat laerek said by karak please it hurts who is it pressed thren stephen connington said zusa from the rooftops drawing their attention her way death was in her eyes and her gaze frightened haern more than threns he was the widow your little puppet let me guess priestyou told him thren killed his father not the watcher laereks skin was already pale but it somehow turned paler thren pulled away his sword put the bloody tip against his throat you claimed i killed leon he asked id have gladly done so but i wasnt given the privilege the watcher here took that from me so why what has my guild done to you alyssa as well zusa said leaping to the ground with daggers drawn you tried to have her killed i cant forgive you not for that laereks eyes bounced between all three of them and he saw no comfort in any no signs he might live closing them he began praying again until thren shoved his shortsword between his lips the priests clattering teeth rattled against the steel thren leaned close and haern saw how easily his gaze broke the man so much easier than it had been against percy why thren asked were all here now tell us why i only follow orders laerek said when thren withdrew the blade tears ran down his face im a messenger just a messenger messenger for whom asked haern laerek looked at them all for a brief moment he paused as if afraid to say but his will was weak hes a powerful priest laerek said his name is luther he sends me his orders by letter from the stronghold and i carry them out thats all i know luther thren asked and he looked to the other two both shook their heads not recognizing the name i swear its true laerek insisted seeing their doubt one more question zusa said moving closer thren stepped away and bowed as if he were a gentlemen making way for a lady zusa knelt before laerek and glanced down at her daggers you blinded my beloved she said looking up at him i hope you burn for an eternity her dagger thrust into his throat twisted and then tore out taking flesh and blood with it laerek flailed at her with shaking hands but she held him as she watched him die when at last he went still zusa stood and spat on his corpse i thought you had a question haern said zusa looked to him and shrugged i lied haern didnt know what to say but meanwhile thren laughed and laughed epilogue no one had slept the rest of the night in the connington mansion guards rushed about suddenly without anyone in charge and each one nervous about what the death of stephen meant to them lord gandrem assumed control with ease settling into a role hed known his entire life zusa respected him yet feared him as well for every time she looked she saw melody there at his side his hand in hers zusa walked down the hallway glaring at any guard who looked twice at her morning had come yet the tension remained itd been a long couple years establishing leons heir with no remaining sons illegitimate or otherwise itd be a terrible squabble among the scattered remnants of the connington family she felt anger in the guards directed at her guards who had been treated and paid well all potentially ending by her single thrust of a dagger through their masters eye alyssa lay on her bed nathaniel at her side when zusa stepped into the bedroom is all well she asked nathaniel glanced up at her and she saw the exhaustion in his eyes which were bloodshot and wet with tears zusa smiled at him wishing she could lend him strengthnot that she had much left to lend ive known better days alyssa said a cloth was over her face hiding the empty sockets the priests say they can do nothing ive sent terrance to find the finest glass smith in the land i may not be able to see but ill have eyes damn it beautiful green eyes she was crying and no squeezing of her hands by her son seemed able to stop it zusa felt a burden growing in her chest she wished she could say something do something to make it all better but she could perform no miracles with her daggers and cloak nathan i need a moment with your mother she said nathaniel instinctively held his mother tighter and zusa smiled to show nothing was wrong it is no worrisome matter she insisted i just wish a few words in private you can wait outside the door alyssa told him nathaniel nodded then blushed upon realizing she couldnt see it yes mother he said zusa shut the door behind him then turned back to alyssa hes so frightened alyssa said putting a hand on her forehead i cant blame him even with stephen dead he thinks the guards will turn on us at any second a wise boy to fear it zusa said sliding up beside the bed we should return to our own mansion whenever you are well i would entrust your life to them no longer alyssa nodded ill tell terrance to make the preparations zusa sat down and she struggled to find the proper words i killed him she said not just stephen but the man who ordered him i tried to make it painful but i didnt have time i had to get back to you alyssa reached out her hand and zusa took it pressed it against her cheek im sorry zusa whispered i should have been here i should have been faster shouldnt have gotten caught its not your fault alyssa said i shouldnt have been soblind she laughed laughed even though she could hardly breathe even though she still sniffled from her tears which soaked into the cloth zusa squeezed her hand tighter then kissed her fingertips not again she said i wont let you ever be in danger again i failed you before but i swear to fix this i swear ill find a way forget me alyssa said nathaniel is all that matters his role in our dealings needs increased tremendously every vulture will be circling if nathaniel is to be my heir he needs to take it now and show dezrel his strength but hes so young and hes endured more than most have in their lifetimes gods help me im blind and hes lost an arm the vultures wont just be circling theyll be pecking at our corpses another bitter laugh zusa hated to see her so but she also couldnt deny her argument everyone would be searching for weakness now potential replacements for nathaniel would come out of the woodwork ill kill them all zusa whispered any challenger any threat i wont lose you alyssa i dont think i could endure it alyssa reached out and zusa leaned close so she could wrap her arms about her as they embraced alyssa kissed her neck then pressed her forehead against her breast you cant kill the world alyssa told her and they must come to fear nathaniel not you just promise that if something should happen to me youll raise him as your own alyssa promise me zusa swallowed and it felt like nails caught in her throat i promise she said alyssa leaned back in the bed and it looked like she relaxed for the first time since her encounter with stephen i need some rest she said send nathaniel in if hes still upset yes milady zusa left and she felt a pall settle over her the walls of the mansion confined her and she headed for the exit wanting fresh air wanting to be alone at the doors to the mansion zusa stopped for a great commotion had started soldiers at least a hundred were streaming into the mansion shouting and joking with one another as if theyd arrived for a feast every single one bore the gandrem family crest servants ushered them down various hallways trying to find spare rooms in the center of it all stood john gandrem greeting his men and with her arms wrapped around his waist was melody our family will be kept safe melody said noticing zusa standing there amid the sea of confusion do not worry for my daughter nor her son youve done much to protect us but its time we do this the right way zusa said nothing just continued to count the men when the number reached two hundred she returned to alyssas room and hid above the door her body awash in shadows her daggers at the ready never again she thought tarlak could hardly believe what he was hearing and even if he believed it he certainly didnt like it are you sure he wasnt lying he asked plopping down in his chair haern stood at the door to his room hands on the hilts of his swords you know priests of karak arent exactly known for their truthfulness trust me on this haern said shaking his head he didnt lie whoever this luther is he set his sights on nearly every major player in veldaren the gemcrofts the conningtons myself the thief guilds why thren in particular you think haern shrugged thought thren would be the least likely to fold seemed there might be some sort of familiarity between thren and the suns too not sure tarlak frowned while rocking back and forth every major player he said every single one but the king haern chuckled perhaps he thought the king too inept to pose a problem tarlak shot him a look this is no laughing matter what youre talking about is beyond dangerous i know i dont think you do tarlak insisted you want to travel all the way to ker so you can infiltrate the stronghold to interrogate a priest whose name you cant be sure is real and who might not even be there and this isnt some ordinary building either this is the dark paladins home their training ground their own little private fortress damn it haern ive heard horror stories about their dungeons that make thren seem like a pretty butterfly he stood waved a finger and most importantly of all about this nonsensical plantheres no money in it the wizard plopped back down in his chair and rubbed his forehead with his fingers i wont help you he said none of us will i thought not tarlak sighed youre still going arent you haern nodded they wanted us dead tar you know i cant leave us in danger like that what happens if he tries again we still dont know what luther wanted to accomplish other than plunging veldaren into chaos so youll go alone theyll kill you you have to know that haern seemed far too assured far too confident nothing of his rant was rattling him something was up and it stank i know its suicide to go alone his friend said thats why im not going alone haern stepped away from the door revealing thren felhorn leaning against the doorframe behind him arms crossed an amused expression on his face i must say he said glancing about tarlaks room i think i expected something more and forgive me if i may be so bold wizard but i dont think anyone has ever referred to me as a pretty butterfly in my entire life he smirked as tarlaks jaw dropped open so pleasedont do it again
