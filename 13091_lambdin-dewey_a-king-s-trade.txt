on every hand the north atlantic was as vast and grey and desolate as it was the morning before the lord said let there be land a slow chill rain sullenly fell pattering as light as catfeet on the freshscrubbed decks a rain so light that it could be mistaken for heavy dew shaken off the masts and sails and the miles of rope rigging by a listless westsouwest wind a wind that had a definite late autumn nip to it the seas had moderated from a halfgale past midnight and were now only slowly heaving the wavesets between crests now nearly twice the overall length of the frigate that lay fetchedto into that wind her bows aimed at halifax from which she had departed three weeks before the sun was up there in the overcast somewhere smothered by a drab pall that hung like an oxided pewter bowl above the frigate stretching from one horizon to the other with darker banks of clouds to the east where last nights gale had gone there were here and there promising thinner lighter patches to north and south definitely to the westward perhaps by the next sunrise there would be clear weather it had been a week since they had seen a clear sky for the noonday reckoning by sextant their position had been guessed by the miles run from noon to noon the compass course steered with an educated guess of the magnetic deviation rate the farther they had sailed eastrd perhaps even a dabble in the arcane arts for all capt alan lewrie rn knew his sailing master mr winwood that humourlessly dour prim and ponderously long suffering fellow had been taking the auspicious auguries of seagull guts down in the dark of the orlop however he did it winwood had lifted his nose just after sunrise and had requested that the ship be fetchedto for trial casts of the deepsea lead line after the insistent icy fury of the half gale theyd suffered fetchingto to relative stillness had sounded like a fine idea and an opportunity to dry things out below relight the galley fires and cook a hot breakfast for the weary bangedabout and chilblained crew for the first time in days and brew coffee most especially coffee mr winwood now stood on the starboard gangway amidships with two of his quartermasters motte and austen amid a horde of curious expectant sailors who had no duties to perform while hms proteus was cocked up to windward and only making a slight halfknot sternway men of the duty watch offduty men wakened by the sudden stillness and the sounds and slack motion of an idling hull found cause to gather round below in the waist and watch or help with the hoisting winch onduty men on the gangway itself casually joshed and japed in soft tones with those poor fellows selected to go overside to tend the deepsea plumb who had to wear the chestdeep harsh canvas hawsebreeches and leggings with the corksoled feet on them and work on the mainchains platform just feet from the curling chilly sea tend the safety lines that kept their mates from being plucked away or drenched by an errant roll or a rogue wave even so the men overside had to be changed every quarterhour or theyd be frozen stiff and be hauled back inboard drenched to the skin their hands numb and fishbelly white from guiding the leadline and counting the knots as it was retrieved from the icy waters think i can hear their teeth chatterin from here lewrie told himself as he took off his cocked hat his battered secondbest with the gilt lace gone mouldy green and tucked it under his left arm he gave his scalp a good fingernail scrubbing ran spread fingers through his thick slightly curling midbrown hair as a welsh comb and took another look about longpracticed longtrained eyes swept over the sails weather braces and rigging finding nothing amiss the wind on his cheeks as he cocked his head left and right steady and the ships head was in no danger of falling off to leeward of a sudden for the two hands tending the large doublewheel helm were studiously alert oblivious to anything outside their duties greyblue eyes swept aloft again the commissioning pendant pointed aft and nearly eastrd curling lazy sinuous snakecrawls the lookouts posted at the crosstrees of upper masts were keeping their eyes outboard on the horizon on their feet not slouching and would sing out if they had anything to report but they didnt of course this patch of the north atlantic and just which part of it they still had to discoverwas yawningly empty of anything not a rock not a wavebreaking shoal not even a lone seabird that might have presaged their awaited landfall surprisingly given the longitude they estimated their frigate had attained there wasnt even a hint of another vessels sail either as close as they supposed theyd come to the british isles there should have been dozens of merchantmen fishing boats by now unless capt alan lewrie cynically imagined theyd missed it altogether and were somewhere to the west of scandinavia south of the shetlands or orkneys for it was certainly cold enough for those climes closerto lewrie was pleased to note the steelgreyness of the sea the milkwhite curlings of the wavetops the sea was scending no more than five or six feet now was no longer green with disturbance and didnt smell like fresh fish any longer craning over the ships larboard windward bulwarks near the shrouds of the mizenmast lewrie took a moment to be satisfied even a bit pleased as the longishset waves troughs sank beneath his frigates waterline and bared a bright glint of spankingnew coppering on her quickwork the halifax yard had done them proud with so many naval stores warehoused and too few of his majestys ships now based at newfoundland and nova scotia in need of them the north american stations labourers only got seasonal work these days when the twodeckers from the caribbean fled north to avoid hurricane season and had seemed happy to have work there was no drydock at halifax but there had been strong tides and good beaches on which to careen proteus highanddry then fire and scrape the weed and marine growths off her bottom replace rotten or seawormed outerplanking that even the bosun or the ships carpenter mr garroway had not suspected then paper felt linseed paint and copper her afresh flight from the threat of prosecution it seemed could have its beneficial moments top up yer coffee sir lewries cabinservant aspinall intruded from his inboard side the towheaded fellow had mounted to the quarterdeck from the galley up forward holding a black battered twogallon pot by its bail with a towelwrapped hand beneath his breath steamed in the chilly air nigh as lustily as the pots spout though nowhere near as enticing a scent as the hot coffees lewrie cynically thought aye thatd be handsome lewrie quickly rejoined with a faint smile of pleasure holding out his empty mug a right nippy mornin sir fer certain aspinall said with a long established and casual familiarity there were no secrets twixt employer and servant master or slave mighty captain or the fellow who quietly managed his life belowdecks and any brusque standoffish and aloof dignity on lewries part would have been pointless by then and pretentiously cruel to boot mmm good and hot lewrie happily exclaimed after one sip it was a continual disappointment to go ashore even to the best establishments in london where the coffeehouse had been king for years on end and get a tepid tiny but expensive cup of semiopaque gnats piss aboard ship it came from the galley stove still halfboiling as stout and black as the strongest irish brew captains second but to god at sea lewrie wryly told himself as he took another welcome sip and i ordain coffee fit twake the dead nothin yet sir aspinall felt fit to ask casting a glance at the activity on the starboard gangway no not yet lewrie told him grinning once more a trifle i assure you when it happens you cant miss hearing it i see mister catterall licking his chops best top up the others too lad aye sir aspinall cheerfully replied then turned and walked forward to the others gathered near the crossdeck hammock nettings by the break of the quarterdeck overlooking the ships waist forward of the helm and the compass binnacle cabinet and traverse board he held out the pot in silent offering gaining glad looks from the rest the first officer lt anthony langlie a handsome young man with what women said was romantically dark and curly hair with a month or more between shearings or washings though and with a weeks worth of whiskers those ladies might not exactly swoon over him any longer lt catterall the second officer their wryly waggish and sarcastic bear of a fellow was licking his lips in avid expectation his battered tin mug held out in two mittened hands like a dockside mendicant whining for alms wiry and slim lt adair longago a midshipman when proteus had first commissioned at chatham a lessdemonstrative and bettereducated young scottish gentleman waited his turn with a good grace taking the time to thank aspinall for his services with mr winwood and midshipman grace busy on the gangway there was more than plenty for their resident lout the thatchhaired and permanently unkempt little bogirish midshipman larkin and their newcome but much more salted gift midshipman darcy gamble who had come aboard at the behest of viceadm sir hyde parker back in the early spring after lewrie and proteus had gotten him a pot of spanish silver from those french creole pirates in barataria bay on the wild coast of spanish louisiana lewrie hooked his left arm through the larboard mizen shrouds and cupped his everyday mug in both bare hands sticking his snout into the rising steam sniffing deep before sipping did he gulp down the scalding coffee quick enough he might temporarily dispel the chill he felt even with his undress uniform coat doubled over his chest and the nine gilt buttons done up even with his heavy grogram boat cloak draped over his shoulders and clasped at his throat he shivered for he had spent too much time in warmer climes and had yet to be inured to north atlantic or british weather even three months of a nova scotian late summer and early autumn hadnt quite done the trick not for inuring anyway he silently scoffed recalling long weeks spent swinging at anchor at halifax awaiting the yards attentions after coming in with despatches the boresome nature of a naval village of fewer than five thousand residents the unending diet of cod and moose one and two and three and away the bosun cried as the deepsea lead the heavy pound hollowbottomed cone was armed with tallow at last swung out and dropped into the sea with a loud splash and the twocable line went thrumming out through the mainyard block the sheave keening and the long flakes of the line laid out atop the starboard gangway twitching back and forth one end to the other watch yer fackin feet boys an irish sailor cautioned or davy jonesll swig yer rum ration is fair mairnin whipwhipwhip went the flakes racing in pursuit of the plummet as it dove for the stygian depths one hundred fathoms of it gone already the tenfathom sets of knots passing in a blur and the bosun and his mate mr towpenny already looking towards the bitter end on the light horizontal barrelwinch to assure themselves that it would not go overboard yet the whipwhipping slowed one last flake lazily shortening from bowtostern on the gangway then stood upright to the block its longstored kinks no longer being stretched out then the outboard length kinking then went limp and still feeding out mere inches more with each slow roll or toss of the ships hull a hunerd an twenty hunerd an twentyfive an a quarter less tthis line one of the freezing hands hung in the hawsebreeches shrilled able to count the dozen spaced knots just below the water and the single halfway knot bobbing just above the mean surge soundins insoundins at a hunerd an twentyfive fathom the cheer that that news elicited could have split the heavens nearly equalled the volume of a wellcontrolled simultaneous broadside from the starboardside guns or shivered the main course hoist and haul away mr winwood roared as the din died off note carefully the time mister grace he told his assisting middle to whom he had already loaned his large pocket watch long minutes it took to winch up the length of sodden manila line for the pair of sailors on the mainchain platform to guide the line and the heavy plummet to the surface then up the ships flanks and tumblehome to the entryport where mr winwood mr pendarves and mr towpenny knelt down and looked at the muck caught in the tallow in its hollow bottom insoundings of somewhere lewrie thought as he finished off a last cool sip of black coffee he drifted forward to the binnacle to join his officers who were already intently poring over the seachart pinned to the traverse board tracing mittened fingers over the iffy contours of the fathom line which line bespoke an host of possibilities from danish iceland to french ushant somewhere there are law courts bailiffs accusin letters courtmartials and nooses lewrie quietly despaired and it had been such a promising career hed had too twenty bloody years of his life pressganged into the navy with nothing better open to a gentleman of his station well there always had been pimp and captain sharp and gaggles of the gullible to fleece but nothing quiet so certain so boresomely certain as the life of a kings commission seaofficer dammit aye though he felt like groaning aloud make one little mistake try tdo just one good turn an see where it gets you and it was in the cause of keepin this ship manned an efficient too yed think thatd earn a man a pat on the back or someth ah hmm the sailing master announced after a long furrowedbrow study and a peer at his seacharts once hed attained the quarterdeck without lewrie noticing a bluegrey ooze sirs a clayey muck at that i am bound stap me if i do not believe were within twenty leagues of cape clear on ireland sixty or so seamiles souwest of cape clear to be more exact ah ha the souwester gale blew us further north than we had thought lt langlie gayly opined nodding his head sagaciously if we wish to round the lizard not put into the bristol channel captain sir mr winwood ponderously stated drawing himself fully erect in my humble opinion we should shape a course abeam the westerlies til we may take a second sounding towards evening due south lewrie replied nodding himself so theres not a risk of grounding either on the scillies or the lizard who knows by dawn and a clearer sky your tables will give us the time of sunrise t go by with any luck at all the weather will clear enough for the suns height at noon sights just so captain winwood agreed with a slight bow then we wont have to embarrass ourselves by speaking the very first ship we see lewrie japed and hoisting hold church service location and interrogative flags sir mr midshipman gamble dared ask at last with a look of a young man ready to be amused by his captains wit willing to be the goat who supplied the rhetorical question if the others wouldnt but not exactly sure where his superiors jest was going stands for oh god where am i mister gamble lewrie quipped with a wry chuckle very well mister langlie secure the sounding gear get our frozen sailors inboard and aspinall he bade the lad who still hovered nearby in his heavy woolfrieze boat with his white apron dangling below its hem a cup o hot coffee for all who assisted the sailing master hands to the braces and make her course due south mister langlie wear her about aye aye sir lewrie paced aft to the taffrails to get out of the way while the crosscocked jibs and foresails were eased over to starboard and the helm was put over the hardangled set of the principal sails was eased from trying to go full and by too close to the winds to loosecupping what wind there was as proteuss bows swung leeward the wind came more abeam then from astern at the precise proper moment and with the efficiency of a welldrilled crew with enough experience for two ships by now the yards were hauled about the courses topsls and tgallants began to draw and hms proteus began to cleave her way through steelgrey seas her clean quickwork slipping through the icy waters and gaining speed rapidly he left the taffrails and paced up the starboard side of the quarterdeck which was now the windward side and a captains rightful station alone til he was by the mizen shrouds hooked an arm through them and oversaw without interfering in such a wonderous display of seamanship from all officers and hands til the last brace halliard or jear was coiled flaked down and belayed on the pinrails and mr langlie released all but the sailors in the forenoon watch from their stations a quick cast of the knotlog proved that even on this light wind proteus was loping along at a decent seven knots easily riding the quartering seas slowrocking more than hobbyhorsing and heeled no more than ten degrees according to the newfangled clinometer with the winds nearly full abeam the next midday might prove them level with the lizard half a days sailing after that might if the winds remained out of the west or souwest move them far enough below englands westernmost headland to turn east and scud up the channel to portsmouth there to deliver despatches from halifax to the port admiral there to be stripped of his sword of honour and bound in irons then hauled off to an ignominious fate liam desmond on his uillean lappipes the ships fiddler and a marine fifer began to play a semilively old hymn unfortunately for lewries alreadyfretful nerves he recognised the title as i want a principle damned if he didnt though he might have left it a tad late he pursed his lips frowned heavily and headed below and aft aspinall was still tending to those in need of his coffeepot lewrie tossed off his own boat cloak hat and undid his coat then sat down at his desk and dug his personal log out of the centre drawer dipped one of his precious steelnibbed captured french pens in the ink and noted the time and date of soundings of shaping a new course catching up on what the halfagale had carried away what sails had split and had to be replaced which mr rayne their sailmaker thought he could repair and what the cost in materials would be when the time came to pay proteus off in a home dockyard the war with france ended that saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now am found twas blind but now i see mister winwood has a sense of humour lewrie was forced to gawp two years or more and the sailing master couldnt seem to catch even the broadest jape now this waggish witticism for the suggestion for a thanksgiving hymn surely had been his lewrie knew the words as a poem written by a former liverpool slaveship captain john newton who had been shipwrecked and enslaved himself on the african coast the tune though sounded suspiciously close to nottingham ale not a ditty hed think popular with the fervently religious apt though he decided now we know where we are he could understand british tars singing so lustily this close to home but his free black volunteers too the root of his troubles those volunteers a round dozen of them whod really been encouraged to meet his ships boats one night in portland bight on amazing grace also known in hymn books as new britain was not set to the tune we know virginia harmony until jamaica s south coast and escape a lifetime of slavery chains whips and cruel misery to join the royal navy under new aliases as free men seemed like a great idea then when his ship had been so short of hands after so many of his british tars had died of yellow jack but now though many dangers toils and snares i have already come tis grace hath bro t me safe thus far and grace will lead me home something should lewrie muttered lead em home very far from me he added under his breath listening to the harmonies of his black sailors no matter how loyally and stoutly they had served he could not help but add a fretful damn em chapter two in retrospect perhapsand one could safely assume that retrospection was an activity at which alan lewrie had come to excel over the course of a few months and just might have been acclaimed as the champion retrospector of the age were prizes given for such of coursehe really should have twigged to the fact that something was rotten in denmark when he received that extremely odd dare we say outre invitation from capt nicely back in the summer when he was still based out of kingston jamaica to wit capt nicely requested that he be dinedin aboard proteus by capt lewrie not the other way round well nicely was a kindly sort though a bit of a bull in the china shop an aggressive but me not buts sort so lewrie had thought little odd about it at the time capt nicely had played dutch uncle to him since their first meeting at portauprince in and had supported his activities dismissing the vituperative charges that the dyspeptic capt blaylock had tried to lay against lewrie for not breaking off his bombardment of the rebelslave army besieging the port of mole st nicholas and giving blaylock his mooring to try his hand at it nicelys dislike for blaylock might have had a hand in it for theyd heartily despised each other as hotly as the devil hates holy water since their midshipmen days ever the encouraging and supportive sort was nicely even when hed as good as pressganged lewrie into a knighterrants crusade against those french creole pirates whod stolen one of lewries prizes from the anchorage at dominica even when hed usurped proteus right out from under him to be nicelys squadron of one to chase them into spanish louisiana then sending lewrie up the mississippi in civilian guise to hunt them on their home ground shivering and farting with dread and but no lewrie had blithely shrugged it off as just one more quirk of a neckornothing man after all hed survived it barely and the expedition had fetched them all to share gained all participantsthe leaders most especiallyplaudits in london papers and the gratitude of their superiors for a job well done as for capt nicely it had gotten him out of the dry and thankless post of staff captain ashore in admiralty house on kingston harbour s palisades and gotten him back afloat in command of a mighty gun frigate and let nicely hoist a broad pendant as commander of a wee squadroneven if said broad pendant still bore a white ball to show nicely was not yet a commodore due a flagcaptain to run her better yet hms proteus had received orders assigning her and her suddenly moderatelywealthy captain to be part of that squadron of two frigates a sloop of war and two armed brigs which would soon sail off on a new expedition to prowl the coasts of french guiana and the dutch isles off the shoulder of south america and the spanish main and as captain of the only other frigate in the squadron was not lewrie secondincommand to nicely no matter that he had not yet attained the right to wear a second epaulet on his shoulders and was still a postcaptain of less than three years seniority given capt nicelys knacky wits and his bellicosity when it came to trouncing the kings enemies it had promised to be a fruitful cruise so long as nicely didnt order lewrie to sneak ashore as a spanish grandee or muleskinner and play spy one more time that is little wonder then that lewrie had cocked his head over that invitation had muttered something akin to hmmpf well o course and had tossed it into the scrap drawer and didnt give the matter a second thought except for what he should serve for a working dinner and for how many and given how badly capt nicely had fared aboard proteus with toulon and chalky whilst lewrie was away in new orleans what he should do with his cats it did strike lewrie as odd that capt nicely came aboard alone with nary a one of the squadrons other captains in tow not even his own first officer which had prompted two thoughts in lewries head first oh good more leftovers for tonights supper followed by oh shit hes got some harumscarum plan in hishead again a plan which might indeed require lewrie to swot up on his spanish dutch or french and quickly master plausible skills at donkeytending capt nicely had proved to be popular with the crew his recent exploits earning every man jack a pretty penny so it was with happy smiles and waving hats that proteus s hands had turned out to welcome nicely aboard beyond the formality of the sideparty the shrilling bosuns calls and the stamping of marines in full kit hallo lads capt nicely had joyfully cried waving his own hat back at them spent your prizemoney yet you rogues ha ha or did you owe your purser too much for tobacco what that had gotten him a laugh and a jeer or two at their nipcheese mr coote as all pursers were termed seeing as how tis just before seven bells of the forenoon nicely had further said and proteus is wellanchored with none but the harbour watch to stand with your captains permission he had looked over at lewrie cocking a brow til lewrie nodded his agreement i propose that you splice the main brace nicely had cried down to the waist giving leave for every man and boy to have a full rum issue with no sips or gulps owed among them to lower the brimming measure and do you come this way sir lewrie had offered gesturing aft well splice our own ive a case of fine french claret delighted nicely had cried though his eyes had been shifty once below with aspinall and andrews lewries longtime black coxn to take charge of hats swords and such capt nicely shied a bit peering about intently though managing to hide most of his nervousness deuced well it ahh youve repainted lately have ye lewrie nossir not in some time why lewrie said as he did honours with the first readyopened and breathing bottle with his own hands it smells fresher than i recall nicely tentatively allowed accepting a semiconical lowstemmed and footed glass from him oh the cats dye mean sir lewrie replied with a wellhid simper dont know quite what got into em when you were aboard a tribe that dont brook change all that well ive discovered a new person where their master usually is pining for me as well sir my apologies again for what harm they did your things far aft in the bedspace lewrie could espy two pairs of ears two sets of hardslit and wary eyes perhaps even two noses one with pink nostrils the other grey lurking over the top of his extra pillow and the foldedup coverlet in his wideenoughfortwo hanging bed where he fervently hoped at that moment they would be content to stay muttering only the faintest spiteful mrrrs scheming nothing delightful creatures nicely intoned without even attempting to sound convincing and didnt they take to you just sir lewrie couldnt help saying as he led nicely to the diningcoach and a seat at the table ummm yayss nicely rejoined and arent you so fortunate high summer in jamaica even with wind scoops erected at every hatchway the awnings rigged tautly over the quarterdeck against direct sunlight and all the transom or coachtop windows of the greatcabins opened mitigated against a heavy repast theyd begun with a thin but spicy chicken broth which was followed by freshlycaught red snapper with lemon and clarified butter sauce and boiled carrots green salad with shredded bacon and oilandvinegar cleansed the palate for a main course of deboned pork chops served with fried potato wedges and middling dollops of mushy peas which repast required the opening of some hock with the fish soup and salad and a second bottle of claret with the chops not a single word was said about their coming mission far to the southrd of french and spanish foes sheltered at aruba or curacao at caracas or cartagena nor what dangers lurked in the port of cayenne or the marshy inlets of french giuana and lewrie had begun to squirm a bit waiting for a particularly ugly but inspired shoe to drop it was expected of course that naval officers never discussed politics religion women or work in the mess so perhaps after it was only once the tablecloth had been whisked away the sweet biscuits and mixed nuts and the port bottle had been set out that a nighbroody capt nicely had appeared to wince or steel himself for a secret discussion requesting that aspinall make himself scarce secret doings lewrie had wondered or look out here comes another of his brain storms with me up tmy neck in the quag again so what is it to be sir lewrie had prompted scooting up closer to the table expecting to hear capt nicely whisper revelations about secret sailing times sealed orders for rendezvous out at sea so the french who still had informers on jamaica despite efforts to root them out would hear nothing of the squadrons destination or its formation til it was much too late that or another miserable spell of dirtywork for lewrie these walnuts nicely had grumpily asked instead with his face screwed up like a hanged spaniel as he nibbled on one uh no sir lewrie said topping off his glass of port and passing it downtable american pecans he informed nicely saying it the way hed heard it from capt randolph of the uss oglethorpe from whom hed obtained them peecans georgia peecans hmmpf nicely had muttered clearing his palate with the port and pouring himself another rather quickly too tossing that one back uncharacteristically quickly he poured himself a third but let that one sit twixt his hoary hands and gave it a long glare before looking at his host uhm bad news i fear lewrie nicely had begun at last a matters arisen which ah may preclude your participation in my squadrons mission dye see some other duty then sir lewrie had asked feeling in the following order disappointment to miss a straightforward adventure some relief that hed not be handy did nicely get a wild hair up his nose and need some derringdo done who the devil had requested him for something else and how much worse might that be not ah quite nicely had struggled on obviously loath to bear bad news but i shall be we shall be sorry to lose your inestimable services on the west indies station im tgo somewhere else sir suspicious indeed that far and fast i fear nicely had gloomed he wriggled as if the crutch of his breeches had suddenly pinched a testicle theres the matter of all those damned samboes of yours lewrie your cuffy sailors more to the point where and when you got em dye see ah hmm hey lewrie flummoxed like to cough up half of a lung suddenly that was not the ugly shoe hed expected to be dropped i did note and wonder where yed found so many free black volunteers the weeks i was aboard whilst you were away but his squadron commander had said doing some fidgetting of his own theyre going to hang me the irrational part of lewries brain screeched at him the rational half was too stunned to put forth any opinion im caught redhanded christ shit on a tis the beauman family dye see nicely had carped a dozen of their slaves ran off one night nothing too odd about it at first glance one of the risks of slaveholding with all the tales of the maroons whove fled into the cockpit country or the blue mountains where the beaumans thought theyd run even was that plantation right on the sea on the south coast and rather far from maroon territory ah gerk had been lewries sagacious reply and his heart banging away like billyoh about two inches below his tonsils it felt like bother ye for the port if youre he asked trying damned hard not to stammer then so sir he managed to state organised as the maroons are nicely had gone on it wasnt beyond credence to think that they couldnt arrange an escape for any number of slaves determined enough to join them and god knows word can pass secret twixt house and field slaves and runaways quicker than their masters could manage no lewrie twas only after the beaumans managed to find witnesses who said that a darkened ship was in portland bight that very night that they began to suspect that the runaways might have had some help and the exslave maroons are not in possession of many boats none larger than canoes and such so perhaps a french or spanish privateer that lewrie tried to say with a puzzled shrug then there was all that folderol twixt your friend colonel cashman of that west indies regiment the beaumans raised to put down the slave rebellion on saintdomingue and the family capt nicely had gravelled reluctantly on the duel that followed the accusations slung about after that potmess of a battle outside portauprince just before the withdrawal of all british forces cowardice charges by cashman gainst the younger beauman ledyard beauman was it lewrie could only vaguely nod he did not trust himself to speak incompetence charges in reply then that duel nicely sniffed in gentlemanly outrage at what a shambles that had turned out to be ledyard beauman too scared or drunk to obey the niceties firing at cashmans back before kit could turn stand and receive cashman drilling the foppish bastard in the belly ledyards second a cousin captain sellers from the disbanded regiment tossing ledyard a second pistol and drawing his own and lewrie as cashmans second shooting him dead too and your friend sold up and sailed for america right after uhm aye he did sir lewrie answered sensing a reprieve if kit cashman was suspected good lord captain nicely ye dont think that christopher had a well im damned if the beaumans did at first nicely had intoned so solemnly that lewrie felt that faint hope shrink like a deflating pig bladder spite sir pure and simple lewrie managed to declaim spite perhaps on colonel cashmans part nicely countered a parting jape on the whole detestable beauman clan and an expensive one for wherever your friend cashman lit in the united states the dozen fit and young slaves would prove useful in a new farming venture or a source or ready funds if not but nicely had drawn out that but turning it into a descending glissando worthy of a dying divas final aria nailing the first spike into the coffin lid by adding of late though hugh beauman head of their clan has heardtell that your crew has quite a few more cuffy sailors in it than the usual frigate so long on station in the caribbean why those bastards lewrie spluttered summoning up every shred he could muster that even resembled righteous indignation and wheyfaced innocence cashman slew ledyard killed one of hughs cousins so before your time sir in my midshipman days during the american revolution lucy beauman and i were ah friendly we even considered a union should i earn a commission but the beaumans would have none of it almost had tduel one of em then barred the house lucy and i cut off he pointedly didnt supply that hed been rogering a scandalous older grasswidow on the side whilst trying to squire lucy that he had escorted hughs married sister anne about town unchaperoned one day and not his fault that faux pas in gentlemanly behaviour so i have learned lewrie nicely had sternly muttered just as im aware of the beaumans threats on your life following the duel which mister james peel of the foreign office took seriously enough to discover to me and get you and proteus safely out to sea and out of their reach we are all aware of that ah we sir a stalwart capt lewrie had quailed well of course we sir nicely had barked obviously grown weary with tiptoeing and shillyshally me peel admiral sir hyde parker the island governor lord balcarres he ticked off on his blunt fingers spiteful vengeful calumnies laid against you by men whove held grudges against you since the s may not be deemed sufficiently actionable beyond an initial enquiry but the dying diva warbled again didnt know he liked german operas lewrie fearfully thought at the mere mention of enquiries one look aboard by the beaumans and hed meet up with captain swing and why the hell had he thought the theft of a dozen slaves no matter how perishingbad hed needed hands to man his ship could escape notice forever a semidrunken evening with kit cashman after the defeat and withdrawal from saintdomingue as cashman was closing his accounts and preparing to emigrate kit sniggering as they schemed a way to punish the beaumans and indeed it was meant to be an expensive parting jape against them hitting them where it would hurt them the worst in their pocket books a way for lewrie to flesh out his understrength crew with cashman even offering to urge some of his white exsoldiers from the disbanded regiment to sign aboard as marines such scurrilous charges gainst a commission sea officer and one so successful and valuable to the crown well capt nicely had sniffed again with prim anger baseless charges of course well we feel that the repute of the royal navy should not be tainted with such so that is why we thought it best all round were you and proteus to be sent away on other duties lewrie as he said that capt nicely had squirmed on his chair like a hindoo fakir trying for a comfortable spot on his bed of nails ah hmm lewrie had responded with an audible gulp of relief so how far dye think i theres despatches in need of transport to halifax nicely said with a vague wave of his hand and a cuttyeyed expression on his face hellishly boresome place halifax fogs rocks and shoals deuced hot summers for that far north mosquitoes big as wrens swarms of them as thick as well fogs nothing much there but for their dockyard and store houses what the town was settled for to service ships on the north american station and a seasonal haven for lineofbattle ships from our station as well excellent yard facilities i know though and isnt proteus in need of a bottom cleaning and a recoppering well there is that sir lewrie had perked up of course with our liners from the caribbean ready to head up that way soon halifax might be a tad too busy fulfilling their needs so you may end up swinging round the anchor for a considerable bit of time before they get round to your case oh dont say case lewrie had most illogically thought ready to titter with relief did i say case silly old me so i should look to closing my shore accounts dye mean sir lewrie asked sure then that his departure would be something quicker than instanter and he didnt need to add dunnings from tailors and chandlers to his troubles may you achieve all that by dawn tomorrow itd be best dawn ah ha lewrie had gloomed with a benumbed nod frivolous detestable spiteful capt nicely had mumbled intent on nibbling georgia peecans giving them his whole attention unable to look at lewrie or unwilling to do so and lewrie wasnt so sure whether nicely had been griping about the beaumans or him hed also noticed that nicely hadnt or couldnt put lewrie to a question of whether the beaumans suspicions were true what nicely didnt know he could not testify to in a court of law should it come to it well of course they are sir lewrie had spat nicely had squirmed some more his eyes nicking about as if in search of a basin of water and a towel like a roman governor about to remand a felon back to the court of the sanhedrinor so lewries fervid imagination could conjure at that instant sail under admiralty orders nicely had grunted fly colours of an independent ship all that written orders sir lewrie had had wit enough to press the last thing he needed was to be charged with stealing his own frigate oh most assuredly sir capt nicely had chirped meaning that viceadm parker would treat his departure as a trivial matter of a minor refit for a hardused frigate which could carry despatches to halifax at the same time and could later swear that hed known not a blessed thing about any legal charges nicelys signature would not be on those orders either nor would lord balcarress or peels or anyone elses cant have you just swanning off whenever damme nicely might have said more anent the matter but was startled by faint brushings of fur against his wellblacked fashionable boots as lewries cats toulon and chalky took that moment to gird up their not very considerable courage to make musky rencontre of their former cabinmate though the cats had made a fuss over nicely when hed first gotten aboard to supplant lewrie once their master was gone it was another matter and theyd tormented the man mostly with piss stockings shoes linens sheets and mattress dressing robe abandoned on the back of a chair uniforms laid out near tohand atop his seachests and the contents of the chests too if carelessly left open all had gotten toulons and chalkys liquid blessings teeth and wee claws had marked nicelys boots swordbelt and leather scabbard covering too and his bright brass or gilt brassards buttons or sword fixtures had gone a gangrenous shade of green by the time lewrie had come back aboard why those nicely had barked like to lift his boots from assault draw his knees to his chest or climb atop his chair and let out a screech like a lady whod seen a mouse why there are the little darlings hed pretended to coo instead after hed gotten past the urge to kick them as far as the stern transom settee only to be polite to his host aspinall lewrie had called out i assume weve nothing more private to discuss captain nicely so i might aye have him in nicely had quickly agreed thought you were keeping an eye on the cats lad lewrie said as his steward returned oh i woz sir twoz feedin em tasty scraps but if youd herd em aft for a bit longer id be grateful lewrie had gently bade him o course sir here lads come toulon come chalky an heres more bacon shreds for ye theres th good littlun aspinall coaxed as they trotted for the daycabin tails fully erect once by lewries desk though the cats did take a moment to gloat over their little shoulders lick their chops and seem to grin at each other as if highly pleased with themselves ill see you to the deck if that is all you ah lewrie offered dabbing his mouth with a napkin and rising ah well aye nicely had replied with a sigh setting aside his own napkin and getting to his own feet one last thing sir aye sir hyde and lord balcarres both bade me relate to you that they appreciate all youve achieved since coming under their command lewrie nicely had whispered to him they and i think you much too valuable an officer to be sacrificed though we all consider you the damnedest fool should the beaumans suspicions hold even a drop of water sir hyde particularly stressed his approval of your fighting qualities your ah unorthodox way of achieving whatever youre set to accomplish we all of us wish you to know that should you have need of patronage in future you may should the beaumans insist on laying false charges count on our support and were the charges true lewrie would end swinging in small circles in the wind at the end of a fresh new rope it went without saying ill miss ye lewrie deed i shall nicely had said by way of gruff departure best of luck young sir he added offering his hand for a fierce shake thank you for that sir for all youve done for me in the past truly lewrie had soberly answered realising that the thing was still afoot that formal charges for grand theft could follow him wherever a mailpacket could go and unless he walked away from his ship in a foreign port there could always be a british court near to hand to find him and haul him before its bench i really do like you lewrie nicely had declared then as fiercely as privacy allowed that was as far as he could go though that was all hed allow himself to say on the matter i hope we have the chance to serve together again sir he had replied to that goodbye sir may you have a successful cruise down there against the frogs and dons and continued success in your career thankee captain lewrie thankee nicely had gruffly said then it had been time for them to call for their swords hats and marks of dignity then go out onto the main deck up to the quarterdeck then the starboard gangway as the sideparty had assembled and the strict ritual for the departure of a senior officer was performed proteuss crew black and white still mellow from that rum issue and their own midday meal had doffed their hats and raised a second cheer for good old capt nicely and lewrie had stood by the entryport hat raised high over his head in salute to watch capt nicely enter his barge and be rowed away to his bright new frigate and had suddenly never felt so alone in all his born days book i dulcis inexpertis cultura portentis amici expertus metuit those who have never tried think it pleasant to court a friend in power one who has tried dreads it horace epistles i xvm chapter three hms proteus lay peacefully at anchor in the sheltered waters of spithead north of the isle of wight just a bit soueast of gilkicker point taking her bearings from the monkton fort on the point the buoy marking the no mans land shoals and a windmill on portdown hill it meant a swim of over two miles to the point and just over a mile swim to reach the isle of wight and a hard slog cross the ride sands when the tide was low to deter desertion desperate as proteuss crew was for diversion and the pleasures of the shore hungry as they were for solid land reunion with wives sweethearts children and their parentsfor freeflowing kegs of beer tall tankards of grog or unwatered neat rum for ladies of the town alley prostitutes ready to dole out kneetremblers for sheep or goats if they were too eagerit was not to be lt langlie had already posted fullyuniformed and fullyarmed marines along the bulwarks the beakheads and taffrails to keep any inspired seamen from slipping over the side in the wee hours when no one was looking proteus had come in allstanding her best and second bower and a kedge anchor ready to loose if a permanent mooring buoy was not available with a flashy show of seamanship the welltrained sailors had rounded her up into the wind as soon as the bearings to shore were satisfactory had swarmed the masts yards and running rigging to take in all sails at once and one sidebattery of her guns readyloaded and thinly manned to fire a slow metronomic ritual salute to the port admiral the last discharge timed to be fired at the same moment that not a scrap of canvas remained unfisted unfurled or not harbourgasketed whether such a scalyfish display actually impressed anyone or not well under the circumstances which might obtain ashore lewrie hoped with crossed fingers that coming to anchor man o war fashion might mitigate his later reception from his seniors crossed fingers as well that they could actually pull off the stunt it helped of course that in the sheltered lee of the isle of wight the winds force had been blunted and the harbour waters were much calmer had the sea and wind been up he wouldnt have attempted it no matter how badly he needed to make a good impression he stood about midway aft twixt the helm and the taffrail in his very best shoregoing uniform with all his brightwork polished as glossy as his boots and the gilt lace of his coat and hat fit to blind the unwary he glanced aft to watch one of proteus cutters as it was rowed out astern with the kedge anchor aboard and a messenger line bound to the stern cable which was laid out on the quarterdeck ready for feeding the cutter made slow but steady progress over the harbour chop which today was heaving barely two feet beg pardon sir lt langlie reported casually touching the front of his cocked hat but the best bowers down firm in nine fathom same for the second bower and weve veered off near ninety degrees between em fourtyfive fathom of chain and cable to each sir you might dismount both ninepounder bow chasers for later mister langlie lewrie decided lash em ready to be bound to the cables should the weather make up tis winter after all i shall see to it directly the kedge is bound and set sir his first officer crisply replied your gig is alongside the entryport too sir and coxn andrews has your boat crew standing by he informed lewrie with a glance down to the largeish canvas bag sitting on the deck near lewries feet that held the mail and despatches from halifax slung off lewries shoulder was a second smaller bag that one held lewries orders journals and reports thankee mister langlie lewrie replied with a satisfied nod though he secretly felt extremely loath to quit the relative safety of his frigates decks they cant take me up long as i have artillery he told himself and a foin marnin fer it as our irish sailorsd say hmm lewrie posed with a faint sarcastic grin it was england they smelled over yonder it was england on which they hungrily gazed it was grey gloomy and raining of course the sullen sort of fickle showers that could come and go come and go for weeks on end seemingly timed to concur with every second chime of the ships bell which was to say at every hour and perversely coinciding with any human need or urge to go outside any signals from shore mister gamble lewrie asked turning to face their oldest and mostsenior midshipman who was getting upwards of twenty compared to their other tweenyear snotties they acknowledged our signal when we made our number to them sir mr gamble replied brisk and efficient as usual as hed proved to be since joining months before have despatches was also acknowledged but nothing since ooh canny lewrie sourly thought ready to suspect a hearty good morning as a veiled threat by then lure mine arse ashore all unsuspectin then slap into irons and under the gaol business as usual lt langlie surmised with a yawn and too busy to fret over a single frigates appearance well then lewrie announced heaving a heavy sigh of resignation seeing as how there was nothing to keep him aboard i should be on my way expect tbe back aboard a few hours hence but keep the bumboats and doxies away til i return or send you word mister langlie and when we do hoist out of discipline make sure no more rum or spirits get smuggled aboard than we may help hmm lewrie glanced forward towards the larboard gangway where the bosun and his mate mr pendarves and mr towpenny and the master at arms mr neale and his ships corporals burton and ragster already had their heads together neale had been born burly and gloomy but a shipboard liberty in a british port mostlike had his guts in knots in dread of what riotous excesses that could mean belowdecks sideparty then mister langlie lewrie bade forcing himself to take the first step forrud towards the starboard gangway the entryport the manropes and battens alongside the mainchains towards his gig a dock ashore then ignominy and courtmartial his feet felt suddenly leaden as did his innards a courtmartial and a quick dismissal from the navy could turn out to be the least he could expect lifelong shame and the life of a haplessly ignorant tenant farmer a veritable exotic stew of the village drunk wastrel idler and a blacksheep shame all in one bootheels drummed on snowyscrubbed oak deck planks with an ominous thudding sounding very much like doomdoomdoom carolinell file a bill of divorcement o course lewrie sadly thought as he passed twixt the twin rows of the sideparty doffing his hat to all assembled she and her brother governour came from old slaveholdin folk in north carolina why theyll curse me as a traitor to the natral state o humankind of late with not an inkling of his crime yet revealed to her of course his wife had actually begun to respond to his letters again a chary sort of reply to be sure after that stillunknown scribbler who had filled her head with tales of his overseas doings with a mistress in the mediterranean phoebe aretino a tussle or two with the bustily alluring claudia mastandrea in genoa and leghorn even if she had been a french spy hed been ordered to bed and blab lies to about theoni kavares connor the ionian greek widow with the curranttrade fortune whod removed to london with his bastard son alan in tow since he and proteus had departed for the caribbean back in that vengeful gossips dirt had dried up but thered already been enough for caroline to stew over and shed made it quite clear that she was of a mind to shoot him despised him worse than cold boiled mutton and et cetera and et cetera so there you faithless bastard carolines aging mother charlotte chiswick would mostlike go into the wailing vapours brotherinlaw governour would recall all of his pantherlean and pantherquick reflexes of old lever his substantial arse from one of his overstrong fireplace chairs and toddle to a gun cabinet and her miserly spiteful uncle phineas chiswick his rasping cackles already rang in lewries fervid imaginings in point of fact being slung out of the navy into dreary civilian misery with all those vultures flapping round his head like a flock of harpies forevermore just might be a fate worse than death oh death where is thy sting lewrie mournfully chid himself dredging up a bible verse though not exactly sure from which book of the good book though as he turned his arse outboard and began his descent of the manropes and boarding battens he made a quick mental note to reread the book of job carefully and he thought as he took a seat in his smart gigs stern if its a criminal trial theres bound tbe a halfdozen dominees near to hand with bibles tloan just hot t weep o er my damned soul ready sah coxn andrews said in a low voice behind him at the tiller fetching lewrie up from his black study to take note that two of the six oarsmen waiting to row him ashore were black exslave sailors big and strong jones nelson as strokeoar and the wiry young george newcastle whod newchristened himself once free after their king and a bottle of beer hed seen but never sampled as a larboard oarsman on the middle thwart take out advertisements why dont we lewrie thought in a gawpish shudder right thenhe said in a proper seacaptains low growl of impatience after regathering his courage which had taken a very sudden tackabout shove off lads upoars andrews called let go dah painter and shove off bow man out oars starboard he ordered as he swung the tiller over hard a larboard dip oars starboard two short strokes now out oars larboard ready and longstroke tgether well i think that should about conclude things at last sir the aging flaglieutenant to the new port admiral confessed finally any other matters wanting he cheerfully enquired topping up supplies expended onpassage from halifax lewrie told him handing over a fair copy of his frigates lacks assembled by her purser mr coote the bosun master gunner sailmaker cooper and others though i spose the dockyard commissioners office would be the best place for it the commissioner captain sir charles saxton will be relieved to hear of it captain lewrie the flaglieutenant chuckled i note your ship received a bottomcleaning and recoppering at halifax did ye not sir we did sir lewrie agreed amiably amazin what can be accomplished on a good sand and shingle beach with such dramatic tides my word youll be more than welcome then captain lewrie i dare say the flaglieutenant gushed and proteus is at present unattached neither the north american nor the west indies station will be expecting you back anytime soon not that i know of no lewrie carefully admitted taking time to cross his legs the other way about guarding his wedding tackle as he did so and striving to sound breezily unworried well then i shall inform channel fleet of your availability sir as well as london of course the other officer gleefully said all but rubbing his hands our admiral nelson has said that there are never enough frigates to go round and isnt that the truth of it sir from the beatific look of heroworship that seized the lieutenants phyz nelsons repute had gone skyward like a seamortars shell after his victory at the battle of the nile so lewrie thought it politic and might improve proteuss future employment to make a boast or two about his connexions to that worthy served with him twice now sir he offhandedly tossed about grand turk island in just before the end of the american revolution then as part of his squadron off the italian coasts in and corsica too actually and saw him in action during the siege of toulon oh he cried fingering the medal for cape st vincent on his chest he dragooned me to follow him and repeat signals in at saint vincent as well that was a windy hour or so pon my stars captain lewrie you did the flaglieutenant responded with the expected gawp of astonishment giving lewrie a rare chance to preen and forget his impending troubles prosperin is he lewrie idly asked well aye sir the flaglieutenant sobered looking uneasy and skittish you knew hed lost his right arm when trying to force a landing at tenerife in the spanish canaries poor fellow never had a bit of luck at land expeditions did he lewrie said with the expected clucks of sorrow grand turk a head wound at the nile which i am told still pains him and causes sick headaches the other officer sadly intoned why theyll whittle him down to a nubbin he keeps that up was lewries rejoinder to that which gave the flaglieutenant pause for a leery second lately hes well there are rumours that hes come under the sway of the king and queen of naples and their corrupt court met him too lewrie interrupted runs his own fried fish shop old nosey does serves a grand platter italians well all sorts of difficulties with the neapolitans captain lewrie and theres scurrilous talk of the admirals dealings with the hamiltons the ambassadors wife most lady emma lewrie butted in again sitting up straighter for closer attention to the dirt he expected to hear the flaglieutenant dared cock a brow at him as if to ask you know them aw before getting cuttyeyed and breaking his gaze he is said to be led about by the nose like a prize bull by that lady captain lewrie that theyve uhm he gravelled actually turning red with embarassment or remorse for a heros seeming failings topped her has he lewrie thought and felt like snorting with derision took him long enough didnt it five years or more since he met her the way she went after me nelson mustve been numb from the waist down or held her off at swordpoint like a daft saint i am sure the rumours are indeed scurrilous and baseless my good sir lewrie pretended to growl in support of nelsons fame lady emma gambles sir the flaglieutenant bleakly sniffed uhm aye as i recall gambles to excess sir and a woman who wagers like a man is utterly lost the junior officer primly stated all but wringing his hands that his paragon would even associate with such a woman never been to bath have ye lewrie drolly thought seeing in which quarter the wind was blowing lewrie decided to trim sails to suit she came from low degree dont ye know sir an actress for a time so i heard mistress to sir william hamiltons own kin for a bit bought off him as token for gambling debts bedded risen in foreign societies then only properly married years later a dancer au naturel hey wouldve done her scantyclad impressions for the hellfire club shed been old enough and wouldnt t father have loved that lewrie happily considered tis a pity though sir that lord nelson cannot be more discerning of the company he keeps the flaglieutenant fretted a man so highminded and intent pon defeating the kings enemies might not even be aware of what people in england might construe from ah lie down with dogs at admiralty orders mind lewrie said to comfort the older fellow who mostlike would serve out his years as an humble catchfart to shorebound admirals never pace a quarterdeck and could but savour vicarious joy from newspapers that cited his hero and one cannot help but rising with a flea or two and havent i just lewrie told himself recalling all those sordid duties hed performed for king and country in the company of an host of foreign hounds though some of them had been handsomer than others and delightful temporary company i am certain you are right captain lewrie the flaglieutenant at last agreed though nowhere near happy about his hero being slurred as i said i do believe we have concluded our business may i congratulate you on your return to england and humbly wish you success in all your future endeavours whatever those may be lewrie said with a smile rising at the same moment as the other officer youve heard nothing of any foreign expeditions that need a stout frigate or not for me tsay sir though with that frog general that bonaparte just returned to france there still may be some actions to be taken to clean up the mediterranean again malta s still in french hands half of italy the adriatic and the ionian islands my word captain lewrie you may very well end up serving under our nelson one more time lewrie was about to blurt out that hed met that little prick napoleone buenaparte back at the siege of toulon too but after a quick second forebore the flaglieutenant had already looked at him askance for a braggart once he didnt wish to leave the impression of a falstaffno matter that flaglieutenants had no say in things a port admirals inkspotted clerk most especially still there was a chance that an offhand remark might linger ill call upon captain saxton then and thank you for all your help sir lewrie amiably said bowing his way to the door a brisk stroll cross the sprawling dockyards took him to the commissioners offices where he found half a dozen officers waiting ahead of him got told that an appointment could be made for the next day but his ships needs could be addressed had he the requisite ream of chits and documents handy a total refit will it be captain lewrie a weary clerk asked with a total lack of enthusiasm as lewrie produced a thick sheaf from his haversack as the waiting captains smirked among themselves just done at halifax stores mostly lewrie replied thank the good lord then sir the clerk brightened i may work you in tomorrow at shall we say nine sir nine itll be thankee lewrie quickly agreed fresh mail for proteus stuff not yet handed over to the packet yet might there be any and who do i see about it lewrie elleeedouble you arr eye eee proteus he said as the clerk penned scribbles in a ledgersized book atop his waisthigh desk post storage is down the hall to the right cross the yard to the redbrick building and there you are captain lewrie ah fine then see you tomorrow he left the offices went down the hall crossed the yard was presented by a row of redbrick buildings but found the one that had a postboy gridiron flag flying atop it and entered not much sir a grimy very old clerk finally told him with a limp canvas sack in his hands after a thorough rousting through the dusty shelves and hundreds of similar bags sign here sir then on this line then this un the mailclerk croupily required whilst coughing up a lung on the thick fug of coal smoke from a badly drawing fireplace lewrie thought of going back aboard proteus with the sack still bound of receiving dire news in the privacy and safety of his greatcabins where he could rant weep scream at the unfairness of it toss back several reviving brandies and plot a solo escape overside in the wee hours but a most dreadful curiosity took him after years in the royal navy hed been drilled to paw over the stacks of mail at once to separate the official from the personal then open and read the official first hed been whipped as a midshipman for not adhering to that nautical custom so near the piers was a lacklustre coffeehouse where lewrie knew the brew moreresembled dishwater but an establishment where a chap could sit and sip in relative anonymity were one not a nelson of course whose phyz was on everything from portrait prints to ale mugs by then once there he could sort out anything horrid addressed to him and mull over his prospects or a new career as a brothelmaster in calcutta oh wait one sir the grimy old clerk called out before hed laid hold of the offices doorknob thought there woz somethin come in i should a put in th sack the fellow said shuffling over to the pigeonhole racks and mumbling to himself come in is very mornin it did now whered i ah here ye go capm lewrie o the proteus frigate sign here sir yed be so kind an here an here thankee lewrie numbly said taking note of the creaminess of the paper the heaviness and expense of the bond as he turned it over and over in his hands fresh crisp newmailed corners still intact and not a jot of smut from being transferred from pillar to post except for the clerks coalsooted fingers of course it was sealed with a large blob of brown wax which wax topped and cemented two wide bands of black riband together grimlookin lewrie shudderingly told himself grim as a deathnotice and whoever had sent it didnt trust to mere wax to seal the flappedover papers corners to keep the contents private but had bound it northsouth then eastwest to boot a seal had been pressed into the wax but it was one he thankfully didnt recognise it wasnt admiralty and thank god it wasnt from a crown court not even a barrister or solicitor to hell with tepid dishwater once outside in the cold airs he sat proteuss mail sack at his feet and tremulously pried open the seal and ribands unfolded the flaps and sir upon receipt of this letter copies of which have been despatched to all major naval seaports where you could be expected to call you will at once attend me to discuss a matter which may are you not expeditious redound to your utter peril and ruin my address is enclosed and i shall make my self available to you at any hour you are able to arrive but be quick about coming to london z twigg twigg oh christ lewrie quailed with an audible groan whatd i ever do tdeserve his company again oh yes that but old zachariah twigg that coldblooded murderous dissembling smug and arch old cutthroat that malevolent foreign office spy had not james peel said hed retired at last so what good could twigg do him matter which may redound to your utter peril which meant that some word of his slavestealing had gotten to england but no one official had taken notice of it yet they might not if twigg still thought it secret and could do something about it oh but lord hed thought himself shot of foreign office plots and errands with his last time paying for all guillaume choundas in american chains his every scheme scotched the former french colony of saintdomingues new masters the exslave armies isolated unarmed and unreenforced by paris and sure to wither and fall into british hands sooner or later those french creole pirates from spanish louisiana slaughtered a raft of stolen spanish silver recovered and simply a grand scheme scouted out for a future invasion of that crown jewel of the mississippi river the city of new orleans delivered to his superiors at both admiralty and foreign office and getting shot in the process to boot wasnt that enough lewrie appealled to the heavens for did the hideous old zachariah twigg still own the interest to get him off lewrie would owe the skeletal bastard his soul nothing got done without incurring a heavy debt in english society and that meant that lewrie would never be rid of neckornothing schemes worse yet much as he heartily despised that noisome schemer twigg hed be forced to grovel lick his boots buss his blind cheeks fawn swallow shite and proclaim it plum duff and pretend to be nice to him chapter four away in the diligencecoach at dawn a day after meeting at the commissioners up portdown hill inland thence to petersfield a few miles away from wife and home at anglesgreen but there was no time for rencontre just a quick note to caroline from the postinghouse as the horse team was changed which note lewrie grimly surmised would be used to light the candles under the chafing dishes to keep her breakfast warm he didnt know quite why he even bothered onwards to guildford once more pretending to nod off too fretful to accept the usual invitation from sailors travelling with him to caulk or yarn passing up the chance for a rare once to brag about proteuss most recent exploits or share reminiscences about the caribbean and the west indies he harumphed himself deep into his cloak tipped his cocked hat low over his eyes closed them and thought about nooses and jeering crowds in london at last hed hired a horse at the final posthouse strapped his cylindrical leather portmanteau and softsided claspbag behind the saddle and set off northward following the instructions in twiggs demanding letter he found it vaguely reassuring that his route from the posthouse took him very near whitehall and the seat of admiralty parliament and the armys horse guards if twigg lived on a road that led directly back to town and that august warren of government buildings might he still have needful influence up charing cross til it became the tottenham court road then onwards til tottenham court crossed the new road and became known as the hampstead road with the dense street traffic and press of houses stores and such gradually thinning further onwards and the breweries metalworking manufacturies and craft shops predominated then those began to thin out replaced by market gardeners small farms estates of the middling nature and roadside establishments with fields and forests and pastures behind them hampstead like islington in the early days had developed over the years as the seat of weekend country getaway cottages manses and villas though hampstead catered to a much richer and select parttime population than islingtons artisantradesman clientele he could espy here and there stone or brick gatepillars announcing the presence of a grandish house up a gravelled and treelined lane set well back and landscaped into wellordered semblances of bucolic or gloomily romantic in that fallencastle overgrownbower mossyoldbutstillinhabited style that had grown so gothically popular of late and damn all moody poets and scribblers responsible for it and what it cost to be created by gimleteyed landscapers it was not for a bloody wonder raining that midday lewrie was not soaked to the skin cocooned in a frousty fug of wet wool and chafing canvas as it was england though it had rained recently thus turning the roadway into a gravelandmud pudding and his snowwhite uniform breeches might never be the same and every approaching dray or waggon and its mudslinging wheels was a shoal to be avoided like the very plague his fearful errand was so completely offputting that capt alan lewrie never a stranger to the charms of young nubile and fetching farm girls barely gave them a passing glance and rarely lifted his hat in salute to a shy smile of approbation in fact and must here be noted if only as a clue to his present state of mind here an humble cottage there an humble cottage a bideawe to the left a rooks nook to the right or so the signboards said to announce the existence of a destination up those lanes leading off the hampstead road larks nest a belle reve a rather imposing new twostorey palladian mansion set back in at least ten acres of woodsy parkland named villa pauvre which proved to lewrie that the rich could afford a sense of irony at last lewrie topped a long gradual rise atop which stood a pair of granite liontopped pillars flanked by a longestablished and nighimpenetrable hedge to either side here he drew rein and gawped at the house which lay about two cables off on the righthand side of the road up another gradual rise so that the house sat atop the crown of a slightly taller hill that sloped gently down on all four sides and the signboard read spyglass bungalow very apt for atop the villa was a squat blocky tower of stone open to all four prime compass points very much like the bell towers seen in a venetian campus or town square right down to the widearch form of the openings or a hellishfancy blockhouse atop a fortresss gate or corner lewrie decided with a gulp of dread he gazed about in search of a further signage that mightwell have read abandon all hope ye who enter here but couldnt find it he gazed fearfully at the house villa bungalow whatever and blinked a time or two in confusion for the house was light airy and its stuccoed exterior painted the palest cream set off with white stone its roof made of those sorts of overlapping redclay tiles more often seen in the mediterranean or spanish possessions there was a massy circular flower bed before the house encircled by a wellgravelled carriage drive which led under a wide and deep portico over the main entrance very much like his fathers sir hugo st george willoughby s hindooinspired house near anglesgreen which stood on the ruins of an ancient roman watchtower and villa that hed named dun roman two storeys and no full basement but perhaps a hint of a cellar so the front door and a galleryporch were sheltered by the overwide portico only four or five stone risers to the short flight of steps leading from the stoop to the ground it was altogether such a pleasant prospect that lewrie had to shake his head a time or two as well as blink a deal more to realise that this spyglass bungalow could actually be the residence of a soulless calculating murderous and callous son of a bitch like zachariah twigg he clucked his tongue shook the reins and heeled his mount to motion once more up that welcoming gravelled drive between the barelimbed trees that would in summer shade the wide lane with fresh green leaves there were dozens of abandoned nests in those limbs that told him that a springtime arrival would be greeted by the singing of hundreds of birds nice birds who hadnt a clue how dangerous the master of those trees could be poor things set downhill on all sides round the house indian bungalow was an inner wall of about six feet height topped with roundcut stone atop which lewrie could espy the glint of broken glass thats more like it he cynically thought aha inside the inner wall fortification lay a lawn unbroken by any trees or shrubs where an interloper might shelter lewrie knew a forts killingground when he saw one and began to hunt for a hidden ditch or moat a masking glacis a redan or ravenel or two where the sharpshooters or the grapeshotloaded small cannon might be placed at time of siege off to the left of the villabungalow was a coachhouse of a matching stuccoandstone though with an humble thatched roof that led back into the inner enclosure up against the wall as if the hayloft above the stalls and tack rooms held loopholes for marksmen it was only in the immediate vicinity of the house that greenery was allowed lewrie took note that a handsome coach stood outside the stable doors a groom or coachee swabbing the roads mud off it and a servant tending to a team of four matched roans getting even closer lewrie could make out a large enclosed equipage a lighter convertibletopped coach for good weather and short jaunts and a sporty twohorse chariot inside the building as well come at a bad time he asked himself does twigg have company a guests coach its team led out for oats and water gave him a small shiver of new dread for said equipage could belong to an official from a kings court and twiggs imperious letter the excuse for him to be lured into a trap he wouldnt put such past him for twigg had always played people false whether friend or foe ha ha go it girl heels down thats the way came a voice from behind the house and down the cobbled stableyard from behind the house came the clatter of hooves the shrill yoicks and imitations of a foxhorns taratara as a pair of ponies appeared both loping but no faster no matter the urgings of their riders a small lad and a girl child the boy appearing no more than ten and the girl not yet a gangly teen they whooped their way out of the stableyard onto the gravelled drive under the portico to cross lewries hawse then headed off cross the lawn for another exhilarating circuit of the inner wall about the house behind them afoot came a brace of adults a rather handsome woman in a dark riding ensemble and a much older spindlier man in a drab brown suit of ditto white shirt and stock and browntopped black riding boots and waving a crop over his head smiling beaming with enjoyment and pleasure twigg lewrie gawped to himself gapejawed for true he never smiled not a day in his misrable life but it was him to the life the spitting image of that coldly calculating chief spider behind a myriad of bloodyhanded schemes on the kings enemies and at that moment as he shaded his eyes with a hand to his browthe one holding the whip o coursemr zachariah twigg could be mistaken for the nicest sort of genial and wealthy country squire who couldnt swat a wasp without regrets aha zachariah twigg called out sounding so welcoming that lewrie for an instant thought himself the victim of a sorry supper and a bilious dream or wishing that he was captain lewrie you have arrived ha ha alight and let me look at you me lad spur away lewrie warned himself spur away now and ride like blades though he was so taken aback that he meekly let his horse go onwards at a sedate plod to the cobblings of the stableyard drew rein and swung down as a groom came up to accept the reins and tend to his rented horse honoria pray allow me to name to you one of my young acquaintances from the far east and the mediterranean captain alan lewrie of the proteus frigate captain lewrie my daughter mistress honoria staples id introduce you to my grandchildren thomas and susannah but i fear theyre having too much fun with their new ponies ha ha a stout fellow full of pluck and daring is captain lewrie my dear an energetic and clever champion of our fair land and a perfect terror to britain s foes from our first encounter to the present your servant maam lewrie managed to respond at last with a gulp and bob of his head as he doffed his hat to her and gave her a jerky bow feeling so deliriously putoff that he nearly blushed to be so gawkish and clumsy like a farm labourer introduced to a princess all but shuffling muddy shoes and tugging his forelock clever daring plucky lewrie felt like goggling to hear an introduction such as that from twigg of all people god above me a comrade of old of course mrs staples replied bowing her head gracefully and beaming in seeming understanding your servant captain lewrie and delighted to make your acquaintance and you have old times to take stock of im bound father the children and i should be going then may i get them off their new ponies she stated with a merry twinkle though you and johnathon my husband captain lewrie a man as fond of springing surprises on people as father spent far too much on them youll not dine here my pet twigg cooed looking devilishdisappointed that they would not damn his blood but he was almost wheedling or doing a damn good sham of it i told cook wed be back by one and theres just time for us to get home before everything goes cold his daughter chuckled holding up a lacegloved hand to her children as they completed their lap of the grounds rein in children and alight youve shewn grandfather your presents and we must go i mean it no you maynt ride them back theyre too fractious yet it will rest them to be led at the coachs boot unsaddled brush and curry then stable them proper once youre home as well my dears zachariah twigg fondly cautioned see to your beasts first you look after them and theyll look after you remember you are english not cruel dons or frenchmen yes grandfather the children chorused though unhappy about leaving or dismounting quick as a wink the team of roans was back in harness and the handsome closed coach led out into the drive ready for departure see you all on sunday my dears twigg promised as he hoisted the children in then handed in his daughter giving her a peck on the cheek like the dotingest granther in all creation church dinner then well all go for a long ride together after twigg in church hmm lewrie silently pondered wondering if even the most enthusiastic missionaries desperate for congregants in the worst stews of wapping or seven dials would dare have him delighted to meet you maam lewrie offered again and you sir she replied though distracted by keeping both her rambunctious chatterbox offspring in check then off the coach clattered at a sedate pace with the ponies trotting intrail well that was sprisin lewrie said with a droll leer once the coach was out of earshot think i spent all my life lurking in the worlds dark corners thout a private life outside of service to king and country twigg snapped frankly yes lewrie baldly stated lifting one eyebrow but not a patch on yours lewrie twigg shot back purring in his old supercilious fashion looking down his long nose you have spread your presence so widely and indiscriminately about the earth tis a wonder you had time for a public life haw haw all lewrie could do was remind himself that hed come to beg at his superiors table and beggars had to suffer abuse in silence that and grind his teeth well now you are come at last twigg said seeming to relent let us go into the house where we may discover what may save you from a welldeserved hanging chapter five the interior of zachariah twiggs humble abode was just about as disconcertingly outofcharacter to the man hed known as the stucco outer facade once they were past the requisite tiling of the entry hall done in redveined italian marble the floors of the central passageway were shiny contrasting parquetry laid out in a complex geometric pattern teak and holly twigg tersely allowed the teak brought from india indeed lewrie said as a servant came for his cloak hat and sword the servant was a hindoo a short wizened little fellow with a bristling greywhite mustachio that stuck out almost to his ears as stiff as a ships anchorbearing catheads above a thick round white beard he wore a tan silk turban above a europeans white shirt and neckstock a glossy yellow silk waistcoat and a voluminous pair of native pyjammy breeches his suiting completed by thick white cotton stockings in deference to the weather perhaps but with stout leather elephant or bullock hide sandals on his feet namaste ellooy sahib he said with a faint attempt at a smile aha lewrie barked back in further surprise ajit roy is it you namaste tyou too he said placing his hands together before his chin and sketching out a brief bow havent heard myself called that in fifteen years yayss twigg drawled in his superior amused manner of old theres a thousand other things youve been called since hmm now damme lewrie began to bristle before recalling what peril he was in and why hed come grovel fawn he warned himself the kutch bohjan kamraa ajit twigg ordered no need to use the formal dining room mongst old companions he could not help adding with a faintly amused sneer laanaa hamen sherry first ajit je haan sahib twiggs old servant replied bowing and smiling this way lewrie twigg commanded stalking off on his long legs hands tucked under the tails of his coat and leaving lewrie no choice but to follow the wellplastered walls were tawny yellow set off nicely with heavy crown mouldings wainscottings and baseboards falsecolumned at intervals with lighter mouldings to frame giltframed portraits and exotic foreign scenes clive of india still led his small army versus native rajahs hordes and grimlysmug relatives peered down with familial asperity all the floors were teak planking though strewn with wool or goathair carpets all light subtle chinee or colourful hindi with not an axminster or turkey carpet in sight far east shawls saris or vivid princes surcoats did service as wall hangings next to tapestries painted by native artists of parades tiger hunts leopard hunts or court scenes with gaylydecorated elephants bearing lords and ladies in howdahs some walls bore gaudy silk mandarins coats stiffarmed with a dowel through the armholes next to the little pillbox hats lewrie had seen at canton with the pheasant tailfeathers and coral buttons on the top that denoted rank and importance it would seem that at one time twigg had been a mighty hunter himself for there were boars heads leopards heads even a bear its lips still curved back in his final fury on a junglegreen wood platform there was a huge stuffed bengali tigerlooking a little worse for wear though where someones grandchildren had used it as a hobbyhorse and there were weapons galore cirles of wavybladed krees daggers and knives about a crossed pair of parangs assorted hindoo edged weapons about a brace of bejewelled tulwars lanceheads javelins and pikeheads billhooks and other polearm nasties that were favoured east of cape good hope behind locked glass cabinets were racks of firearms from clumsy matchlock muskets and handcannon to long slim and elegantlychased and intricatelyengraved indian or malay jazzails some so bejewelled that theyd fetch thousands even humble flintlock tower muskets st etienne or charleville french muskets given or sold to native princes troops had been turned into priceless works of art by hindoo artisans there were even wheellock pieces musketoons and pairs of pistols as long as lewries forearms that the czar of all the russias might covet armour take your pick fanciful cuirasses backandbreasts and helmets gilt or silver chainmail suits brass fishscale armour over thick oxhide tatar chinese mongol bengali moghul nippon there twigg commented pointing to a stand that held a wideskirted glossilylacquered set seemingly made of bamboo tied together with bright orange and red wool cords there was a horned helmet with neck pieces and side flanges so wide and deep that the wearer could shelter from a hard rain under it with a fierce wildeyed and mustachioed facemask bound to it them too twigg further stated indicating a horizontal stand that held a long dagger a short sword and a very long sword all of a piece brightcorded and their scabbards so ornately carved they resembled the jade or ivory boats with incredibly tiny figures of oarsmen and passengers all whittled from a single tusk or block of soft stone nippon lewrie gawped you mean japan no white man has gone there and returned to tell the tale in three hundred years lewrie twigg proudly said though some of the hereditary warriors the samurai now and then lose their feudal lord or blot their copybooks twigg added with a taunting leer at his guest and become outcasts ronin i recall is the term some of whom leave their forbidden isles entire and take service overseas portuguese macao is a port where bands of them may be hired on quite fierce quite honourable if you pay em regular this fellow here well let us say he proved a disappointment and committed ritual suicide to atone willed me his armour and swords did you ever manage to land in nippon lewrie just had to ask of course not sir twigg hooted i was bold in my younger days but never that rash unlike some i know hmmm swallow it swallow it lewrie chid himself another great room to pace through this one filled with porcelain niello brass gilt and silver pieces the most delicate ceramics ginger jars wine jars tea sets and eggshellthin vases from every ancient dynasty from bombay to fabled peking didnt know youd always wanted topen a museum lewrie said as they attained a smaller plainer dining room that overlooked a back garden barns coops and pens and a block of servants quarters it was where the houses owners would break their fast en famille in casual surroundings and casual clothes before they had to don their public duds and public faces to deal with the rest of their day as the french say souvenirs twigg scoffed though his eyes did glow with pleasure over his vast collection worthy of a man whod come back from india a full nabob with an emperors riches stowed on the orlop smugness of owning such grand things perhaps with happy remembrance of how hed acquired them or the blood and mayhem required to do so i can see why your grandchildren were loath to leave lewrie wryly commented my own childrend screech in bloody wonder to play amongst such a pirates trove mementos of an arduous life twigg scoffed again perhaps with longengrained english gentlemanly modesty spent mostly in places so dreadful the baubles were the only attractive things worth a toss i assume you like goat do you not it doesnt signify for thats what were having keep a flock to dine on sheep as well but no pork nor beefsteaks either id spose lewrie said with another wry scowl taboo to muslims in the first instance taboo to hindoos in the second aye twigg replied his thin lips clasped together in the sort of aspersion that lewrie had dreaded in their early days old habits die hard well dont just stand there like a coatrack sit ye down twigg snapped pointing imperiously at a chair at the foot of the sixplace table whilst he strode with his usual impatience to the chair at the other end and lewrie almost grinned to see himself seated below the salt no matter there were only the two of them the elderly servant ajit roy bearing a brass tray on which sat two glasses of sherry shuffled in obviously waiting til they were seated before intruding twigg took a tentative taste looking puckery as if assaying his own urine for a moment before nodding assent and acceptance at which point ajit roy came downtable to give lewrie his small glass laanaa shorbaa ajit twigg ordered and not a tick later an attractive hindoo woman in english servants clothing but with a long diaphanous shawl draped over her hair and shoulders entered with bowls of the requested soup on another tray dhanyavaad lakshmi twigg told her thankee lewrie echoed in english hed never learned hindoo as glibly as his father sir hugo and had ever sounded pidgin barbarian when he did speak it but it was coming back to him in dribs and drabs she was fetching did she and twigg ajit roys second wife twigg said with a knowing leer after one look at lewries phyz the firstun cooks and no i dont my tastes these days well i also own a place in the city quite near your fathers new gentlemens lodging club in point of fact his is at the corner of wigmore and duke streets as you surely recall while my set of rooms is nearby in baker street we run into each other oh how unfortunate for you lewrie sourly commented we speak rather often actlly twigg said with a mystifying smile sometimes dine drop in for a drink or play ecarte with him at his club with no need for its lodging facilities and does he give you a discounted membership sir or does he make up for it by fleecing you at cards lewrie cynically asked my dear lewrie no one has ever fleeced me at ecarte and lived zachariah twigg drawled with a superior simper your father and i rub along quite well together actlly were much of an age and experienced much the same sort of adventures in exotic climes so absent the disputes resulting from ah boundary friction in the expedition against choundas and the lanun rovers his concerns for his sepoy regiment and taking orders from a foreign office civilian weve discovered that we have a great deal in common having you and your ah follies in common as well how is your soup simply grand lewrie sarcastically muttered though the soup was as close to a chinese hot and sour as a hindoo cook could attain and as tasty as any ever hed had when moored off canton in the s amazing what a small world in which we live lewrie twigg went on carefully spooning up his own soup and slurping it into his thinlipped mouth then daintily dabbing with his napkin sir hugo is partnered with sir malcolm shockley in his gentlemens club enterprise sir malcolm thinks the world of him and of you more to the point though ive yet to see a valid reason why other than gratitude for getting his wealthy arse out of venice and the adriatic before the french took it in and wonder of wonders sir malcolm is wed to lady lucy hungerford nee lucy beauman of the jamaica beaumans who wish you hung for stealing their slaves well well well quite the coincidence what and hugh beaumans already written lucy and told her all about it lewrie said with a groan feeling an urge to slide bonelessly or lifelessly under the table and stay there unfindable for oh say a century or so christ im good as dead he moaned his brow popping out a sweat that was not entirely the fault of the spicy soup and here comes the roast twigg enthused as lakshmi entered bearing a tray of sliced kid goat and a heaping bowl of savouried rice mango chautney and such done to a perfect turn i am bound he added not without a purr and glare that lewrie took for sheer maliciousnessmaking him feel even more inclined to slink beneath the table unfed i take it an lewrie managed to croak that sir malcolms mentioned it to father blieve so lewrie yayss twigg responded in a further purr of hellish delight at his predicament all the time hoisting slices of goat onto his heaping plate of rice and mild baked red peppers lewrie felt his face flush not from the spicy soup picturing sir hugos reaction to his folly not so much anger or disappointment really for theyd never really been proper father and son leaving it quite latein india in or to tentatively reconcile thence to keep a wary distance ever since so whatever rage sir hugo might display was water off a ducks back no what upset lewrie more was a firm suspicion that hed chortled his head halfoff that alan had gone and done something so goosebrained and been caught at it redhanded damme lucy knows tis a safe wager that all london knows by now lewrie muttered dabbing his brow with his napery the henheaded blabbery baggage he nighstuttered in new dread tis a wonder ive not been taken up already with oned be surprised lewrie twigg loftily told him do try the kid theres a dahee to go with it one of those yogurt gravies i recall you liking when in calcutta tandooriroast chicken to follow christ you and lucy beauman were at one time in your misspent youth quite fond of each other lewrie twigg breezed on come over all amiable as he spooned spiced dahee on his goat and rice she went on to wed a richun she met at bath her first season in england dare we speculate on what is called the rebound following her family showing you the door for the utter cad you proved to be hmm lord hungerford knight and baronet surely was a great disappointment to her since he proved to be just about as huge a rakehell and rantipoling splitter of beards as you though lady lucy seems to have been spared revelations anent your poorer qualities for some reason the illogic and the blindness that the fairer sex possess towards their undeserving men no matter proof incontrovertible served up on a gilt platter hah she still has as they say lewrie a soft spot in her heart for you therefore and so far as i am able to ascertain has yet to utter the first word to anyone other than her husband sir malcolm of the matter you must be joking lewrie exclaimed almost leaping from his chair in amazement at such a ridiculous statement lucy is my prime suspect of writing scurrilous anonymous letters to my wife about my overseas doings he trailed off blurting out more than hed meant to ah those letters twigg said brightening with cruel amusement why must you suspect her you know of em lewrie quailed though he had to admit that zachariah twigg had spent his entire life as a foreign office agenthe just had to know a bit about everything your father has since the mutiny at the nore he said so knowing my old profession he approached me to delve into things and discover what i could smoak out the culprit so far without joy why do you suspect her when we met in venice in years later lucy i felt was still after me lewrie told him as he at last accepted a heap of rice a slice or two of roast kid and a dribble of the spiced dahee even if she was married not six months still on honeymoon with sir malcolm shockley she was what a burden it is twigg amusedly drawled to be the romantic masculine paragon of ones age and in such demand all but throwing herself at me aye lewrie retorted in some heat and grovelling bedamned her foot damn near in my lap even with her husband attable with us and when i wouldnt play she took up with commander william fillebrowne another officer from our squadron theres another i suspect the smarmy bastard our last words lucy caught onto my involvement with a lady id rescued from serbian pirates and said mistress theoni kavares connor the mother of your bastard twigg offhandedly interjected twixt a bite of food and a sip she of the zante curranttrade fortune from the ionian islands er yes lewrie barely squeaked having been reinsawed from a full gallop to a palefaced hoofsliding halt for a moment well lucy said something very like i should write your wife and tell her what a rogue she wed playfully but not without a bite to it i told her what sir malcolm should know bout her doins with commander fillebrowne and thats where we left it but and was she in fact involved with fillebrowne twigg asked well o course she was lewrie snapped hitting his stride i saw em for myself spoonin and kissin on the balcony of a rented set o rooms just before we sailed the last time whoever could notice em bedamned only dago foreigners i spose they thought an old friend of mine from harrow clotworthy chute was with me too chute was doing the grand tour of the continent with lord peter rushton at the time and she gambles gambles deep lewrie added recalling what that flaglieutenant at portsmouth said of lady emma hamilton as if that would be proof enough to sign seal and deliver the truth of his account twigg cocked an eye at him as if he thought that lewrie had lost his mind and was about halfway towards laughing out loud at such rank priggishness especially coming from one so lowminded as lewrie do assay the wine sir twigg instructed after a long ponder a dago wine how further coincidental a tuscan chianti in point of fact of a very dry nature that complements the richness of the goat quite nicely i can understand on the face of it why you might susect lady lucy lewrie but you say you also suspect that commander fillebrowne well lewrie elaborated after a tentative bite of kid and rice and a sip of the chianti which brought back memories of naples when we first met he was anchored at elba tupping a local vintners wife as i recall thought id take to him at first but in the space of a single hour i came away a bit disgusted comes from a very rich family treats the navy like a place to kill time til his inheritance is come all yachting cruising and claret and his orlop the storehouse for art treasures he was buying up from refugee royalist french boasted of it fillebrownes familyd all done their grand tours the war was his and all he cared about was collecting lewrie sneered he chaffered me that very morning with hints hed taken up with my former mistress lewrie paused waiting for twigg to say phoebe aretino better known as la contessa corsicanborn former whore shrewd businesswoman and collector trader and treasuresdealer in her own right but twigg kept his mouth shut or busy with his victuals and for the sort of man whose very gaze could turn cockchafers toesup dead his expression was a very bland do tell and say on threw it in my face rather lewrie growled shoving rice on his plate with an angry scraping noise of steel on priceless china nosehigh toplofty sort the greedy callous bastard well chute saw through him clotworthys a captain sharp makes his livin by gullin naive newcomes to london ones whove just inherited some tin and such when i told him that fillebrowne thought himself an astute collector of fine art chute cobbled up a brace o bronze roman statues o some sort never saw em amazin what a weeks soaking in salt waterll do tmake em look authentic and fillebrowne bought em straightaway pantin for em i suspect fillebrowne figured out hed been finessed sooner or later learned that chute and i were old friends acquaintances really perhaps he and my former mistress he said avoiding phoebes name as if to deprive twigg of unnecessary information just in case had an angry parting sharp an eye as she had when it came ttreasures if she tipped him that they were frauds hedve gone off like a bomb on her on me and hed have seen or heard just enough needful tpen scurrilous letters to caroline in revenge one could see his reason for pique yayss twigg mused those long fingers of his steepled thoughtfully under his chin not exactly mocking at that instant though you do have that effect on people but was commander fillebrowne still possessed of active commission i do not see how he could stay current anent your ah pastime theres been nothing current lewrie querulously replied not since i sailed for the caribbean well the last bits about mistress connor lodging with me at sheerness for a week before we departed he admitted with a squirm and afore that about the twodozen doxies my solicitor was tpay for services rendered twodozen prostitutes twigg barked as if in breathless awe going so far as to lay one hand on his heart what stamina damme lewrie but i am impressed for helpin me kill belowdecks mutineers so i had enough true men ttake back my ship and escape the nore mutiny lewrie retorted wos innit fme wos innit fme he snipped impersonating lowerclass dialect mainwell after twenty years of exposure to it they wouldntve tried it on else christ my report to admiralty got em letters of appreciation evry last one of em and i didnt lay one single finger on any of em but someone twisted it into a scandal idly and illogically the face and form of the thentempting young sally blue did cross his mind black hair blue eyes promising poonts and a waist bout as slim as a sapling pine and was commander fillebrownes ship at the nore at this time twigg pressed looking grimly intent and do you believe lady lucy was aware of your doings as well no dont think so lewrie had to confess going as slack as a sail in the atlantic doldrums so damme if i know who no other suspects then twigg asked one dubious brow raised well in my madder moments i sometimes fancy it was you both of twiggs brows leaped upwards at that statement he sat back so quickly in his chair that lewrie could hear the joinings squeak in protest then to make lewrie feel even worse was such a thing possible at that instant twigg quite uncharacteristically threw back his head opened his mouth and began to guffaw right out loud in an evil way it went without saying chapter six lewrie had to bite the lining of his mouth to keep a tranquil face on as mr twigg exhausted his highlyamused outburst he eased off from redfaced brays to napkincovered titters thence at last to a toplofty and nosehigh sardonicallysuperior air of very faint humourlordly chuckles of the arrogant kind which more suited mr twiggs usual nature oh lewrie twigg finally drawled after a restorative sip of wine believe me sir did i wish you destroyed professionally or personally such a nefarious ploy would never be required all id have to do is sit back and watch you do in yourself besides what reason would i have to attempt such hmm merely because your ways of prosecuting the kings enemies now and then row me beyond all temperance well which they do now and then twigg intoned with a vicious twinkle in his eyes as if he enjoyed turning this particular victim on his roasting spit despite the mute insubordination youve shewn me whenever weve been thrown together your truculent reluctance to sully your hands with underhanded duties that force you to get out of bed earlier than is your wont or out of some doxys bed more to the point i have always been more than amplygratified with the results you achieved and have expressed my satisfaction with you and your methods of fulfilling my aims to your and my superiors following our evry assignment secret reports of course twigg added with a casual wave of his free hand the sort of gesture that put lewrie in mind of someone tossing tidbits overboard to the sharks bless my soul must i have gushed does your longheld enmity arise from a lack of vocal praise was i remiss in not patting you on the back or the top of the head would a box of sweets make up for it twigg posed facetiously damn my eyes lewrie began to say no matter what youve thought over the years lewrie i admire your good qualities twigg stated as he reached for his knife and his fork once more on the other hand your good qualities have at times been rather damned hard to find but a mouthful of food a cock of the head as he savouried it then a palatecleansing nibble of bread and a sip of wine followed twiggs admission i will confess that my sense of duty and urgency in the fulfillment of that duty might have given you the impression that youre little more than an occasionally borrowed gundog of doubtful lineage twigg said on dabbing at his mouth with his napkin i have gathered that i sometimes do act more brusquely with others than they mightve preferred but to use a military simile it little matters to me do the officers mess dine me in as a jolly good fellow just so long as they perform as required to attain success gainst our foes no j really lewrie thought tongueincheek such an outgoing and amiable fellow like yourself perish the thought believe me when i tell you lewrie mr twigg continued now sternfaced and cold that people whove displeased me in the past i have ruined for the good of the country and when naval or military force was involved for the good of their respective services in the long view had i really felt call to ruin you whyever had i not had you cashiered years ago hey well lewrie was forced to realise your personal life such as it is twigg scoffed on with a leery roll of his eyes has no bearing on your public life or your service to the navy unless you were a drunkard a rapist or a brute so heedless and flagrant as to become a public spectacle and a newspaper sensation thankfully youre rather a mild sort of sinner you know how to keep your itches scratched with little notice sub rosa as it were as an english gentleman should or he ceases being a gentleman and then youd deserve evry bit of your comeuppance lewrie could have little to say to that he squirmed a little more on his chair and blushed like a cully chastened by a very stern old vicar ready to swear hed never do whatever it was again put me in mind of the scot poet robert burns you do lewrie twigg said with a thinlipped smile and a simper know of him hey aye lewrie allowed himself to admit burns said of himself that he was ah a professional fornicator with a genius for paternity twigg quoted with a chuckle ahhmm lewrie said clearing his throat with a fist against his mouth despite that burns wrote simply marvellous songs and poems twigg allowed thawing a little despite your shortcomings you are an invaluable asset to the navy and the crown lewrie and ill not let you be scragged over this smarmy jape of yours gainst the beauman family not til this war is done and weve wrung the last drop of usefulness from you youre as much a weapon as any broadside of guns ever you or anyone else fired thank you sir lewrie felt called to reply with a shiver of relief that someone no matter how horrid was on his side under the circumstances perhaps horrid devious and brutal aid was just what was needed besides twigg simpered again watching you twist about in the wind is devilishamusing now and then eat up man your foods going cold and tis too tasty to go to waste more wine see to him ajit roy jee bharnaa opar fill him up suddenly in a much better mood lewrie accepted more pipinghot rice more yogurt gravy more slices of meat and began to eat about to rave over the exotic longmissed flavours til how to achieve that aim though aye theres the rub mr twigg mused over newsteepled fingers with his fierce hatchet face in a daunting scowl stealing those slaves and making sailors out of em rather exceeded your usual harumscarum antics left em in the shade as it were you mentioned that sir malcolm shockley might be of some help sir lewrie dared to suggest with curry sauce tingling his lips aye shockley he likes you and he isnt your runofthemill backbencher in the commons either no vicar of bray is he nor is he the great mute either allied with sir samuel whitbread and those younger progressives who associate with him shockleys not a typical countryput like most of our rural squirearchy john bull members are damn em for the unsophisticate twits they are theres wit behind his eyes fox perhaps sir lewrie chimed in hopefully the great commoner twigg sneered following the spithead and the nore naval mutinies the prime minister pitt the younger and the tories crushed the man i fear that the formerlyesteemed charles james fox is as powerless as a parish pensioner and has about as many friends that will be a real problem for you for most of those who revile the institution of slavery are the same ones who spoke out so openly in praise of the french revolution in the late s men like jeremy bentham doctor joseph priestley wedgwood the pottery fellow boulton and watt the steamengine men and the lightheaded scribblers such as blake and coleridge even robert burns come to think of it all the socalled progressives what they run with the same pack still that was ten years ago and memories fade no one got round to hanging them for uttering such rot even if the french made them honorary citizens for their vocal public support but that was before the frogs lopped off king louiss head lewrie sourly observed well that changed everything but for the true henheaded of course twigg smirked most evilly no knowing those worthies as i do the vehemence with which they revile slavery will naturally make them raise up a too public hue and cry a veritable crusade with you the heart of their righteous blather make a martyr of you and dont most martyrs end up dyin mister twigg well of course they do lewrie cant have martyrs without a good bonfire and shrieks of agony twigg chortled what we need is the subtile backgate approach else the proslavery colonial and shipping interests in parliament demand your cashiering and hanging to spite the dogooders if for no better reason no we must go to cleverer men who can see the longer view wilberforce perhaps aye wilberforce would be your man god save me lewrie thought shrinking at the mention of that name william wilberforce and his coven of familiars had been a bane on english society for years marching on ageold morals or the lack of them like a vengeful army of pitchforkarmed puritans through the progressive wing of the church of england evinced by the socalled clapham sect on another front via the house of commons since so many members were of like minds and through philanthropy in the public arena a third front led by rich and influential women like mrs hannah more and elizabeth fry by jeremy bentham himself with his vice society and his damnable concept of utilitarianism if things didnt meet his strict and narrow keyholes of the most benefit for the most people then damn it to hell and do away with it whatever it was lt langlie had gotten a copy of benthams panopticon his view of an ideal england and had been aghast as had lewrie that it called for total surveillance of everyones waking actions by a morality police as an infernal machine to grind rogues honest over the years maypoles and dancing about them had been banned village football and sunday cricket had all but disappeared good old church ales were completely gone fairs bearbaiting dog and cockfighting throwing at cocks greasedgoose pulls beating the bounds and springtime beating of boys to keep them honest pigracing and all sorts of lighthearted amusements had been done away with which had reputedly led mrs hannah more to declare that sooner or later all that would be left would be the newfangled sunday schools and that the people of england would have nothing else to look at but ourselves why by now the reformers mightve even done away with foxhunting and steeplechasing damn em newlyrich arrivistes nonconforming anglicans dissenters and methodists barred from public office service or honours jumpedup tradesmen become wealthy grand landowners even that exslaver john newton whod written mr winwoods poem and hymn and had been saved oh but it was a devious conspiracy of dogooding that opposed almost all that lewrie thought he fought to preserve why give them a few more years and topping goosegirls milkmaids and serving wenches would be right out too such flam lewrie muttered bentham fry those sort that writer macauley and wilberforce and the evangelical society theyre all of a piece mister twigg are you sure we need their sarah trimmer dont forget twigg added she who thinks our old fairy tales too indecent for todays children dick whittingtons cat leads the poor to aspire above their proper stations for instance cinderella which my granddaughter adores by the way is too harsh on stepmothers and stepsisters to trimmers lights we need tales more uplifting instructional and useful gad though just try reading some of her alternatives horrid simpering blathering pap its the war i suppose twigg continued after a moment of gloom you were in england during the naval mutinies which for a time looked to become a nationwide levellers rebellion that mightve overthrown crown parliament and the established church to boot in dread of the french revolutionary terror being replicated here perhaps the mob needs taming and our upstarts quashed thankfully however twigg said with a sardonically amused leer our earnest reformers wish to do their chiefest work among our semisavage poor not the welltodo so far that is more wine uhm aye but lewrie replied impatient with the niceties let that lot get their hooks in me and im done for mister twigg you are surely done for do they not lewrie twigg sombrely pointed out where else could you find aid well lewrie said after a deep breath shrugging without a single clue damn my eyes exactly twigg said with a sage simper how was the ride up from london just bloody lovely lewrie snapped bucolic and i meant the state of the roads and the weather lewrie mr twigg snapped back in exasperation less theres a thunderstorm and washedout roads theres daylight enough to get us down to london and lodgings where i may write to those i believe mostable to give you aid no time like the present what if pouring rain well take my coach if not my chariot much faster your hired prad ill stable here and have my groom send down later leading an indifferent horse at the carts tail will only slow us down eat up and were off do you really think well be able to lewrie asked in awe of twiggs alacrity and in great relief that dubious as he was there was one ally willing to save him from a hemp neckstock hope springs eternal all that twigg responded roughly shovelling in a last bite or two taking a last sip or two of wine damme but this is going to irk but lewrie thought under the circumstances there was nothing else for it then i thank you most humbly and gratefully sir lewrie was forced to say however things fall out i will be forever in your debt yayss you will be twigg drawled with a superior expression on his phyz and his eyes alight in contemplation of future schemes a chariot jesus oh it had seemed perky enough at first just a rapid jaunt what the sporting blades of the aristocracy and the squirearchy were simply daft for speed and bandied about the names of famous coachmen who made their diligence or balloon coaches fly on the highways of the realm some of them would offer substantial sums to take the reins from an indifferent and bribable coachee for a single leg of a coach trip they knew the names of the famous whiphands and bragged about a mere handshake from a hero coachee as one would boast about a meeting with a champion jockey or boxer forever comparing records of how quick old soandso shaved five whole minutes from a run twixt the olde blue rabbit tavern and the red spotted pig postinghouse or some such rapid run of umpteenish miles and the odd casualty bedamned if an urchin or two one of the cheap fares who rode on the top or clung to the footmens seats atop the boot were bounced off and got turned into imitation cowpies in the road then so be it if the slow and unwary hiker got trampled well it only made for a better tale at journeys end chariots were even better for welltodo young bloods could be had to be the drivers and but for a hallooing chum or two in the wee open compartment with them any accident wouldnt claim any innocents who just might know a lawyer and sue for damages chariots were all the go and all the crack meant to be whipped into breathtaking speed and there was nothing grander lewrie had rather inconveniently forgotten all that and dour old zachariah twigg so precise and oxonian a fellow of the older generation surely his chariot and matched team of horses was merely a retired fellows affectation wasnt it unfortunately no once aboard twigg had revealed a new facet to his character there was a mischievious glint to his eyes an evil little chuckle under his breath and a sly smile on his lips as he took the reins in one hand a long whip in the other and turned into a biblical jehu they were off in a flash headed downhill for his estates gate quicker than a startled lark making a fair rate of knots even before they passed the gate in the inner wall surrounding spyglass bungalow moist dirt and gravel flying in twin roostertails from the madlyspinning wheels at the highway twigg didnt slow that much either they shot out into the road other traffic bedamned heeled over on one wheel and slewing about like a wagging cats tail brisk ah ha twigg exulted as they thundered along really beginning to gain speed duhduhduhduhduh lewrie replied unable to form words if he cared a whit for his teeth and tongue as the chariot drummed banged and juddered his portmanteau bag and valise at his feet between his legs were bouncing so high that he had to press his knees together if he cared a whit for his nutmegs as well down the long slow rise they tore the chariots axle starting to keen about as loud as lewrie wished he could he would have been wideeyed and gapemouthed in utter terror if doing so would not end with a mouthful of muddy road or the loss of an eye from gravel flung up from the teams rear hooves on boys on twigg cried cracking his whip over the horse teams heads marvellous ah ha followed by a madmans cackle youre a bloody shitebrained lewrie tried accusing but the chariot took a jounce or two wheels above the ground and it only came out as another series of duhduhduhduhs twigg was swaddled up in an old shabby overcoat an ancient windcutting tricorne hat jammed low on his brows with a muffler about his neck and halfway up to his nose he was getting spattered but it might not matter alan though his heavy grogram boat cloak was no use at all for it flew behind him like a loosefooted lugsail the gilt chain riding high on his adams apple and damnednear strangling him what was happening to his pristine white waistcoat shirt neckstock and his very best uniform coat he didnt want to even contemplate lewrie looked ahead of them with one slitted eye it here must be told just in time to screech watch out for that oh christ as twigg swerved their chariot over almost to the verge of the highway to miss an offending haywaggon drawn by a yoke of plodding oxen that flashed past in a twinkling so quickly that all lewrie could sense of their nearcollision was an oxbellow a startled cowfart and a waggoners thin cry of yew bloody damn and by the time theyd slewed back into their proper lane the light pony trap coming the other way had had time to move right over and they missed thatun by yards aah ha ha ha twigg exulted his long whip cracking and lewrie shut his eyes and tried to summon up a prayer twigg damn him drove as if the devil was at his heels which in twiggs case lewrie thought was an apt description chortling and whooping delight like billyo like an ancient celt warrior meaddrunk and painted in blue woad out to smash through a roman legion just one more good charge for good sweet ancient queen boadicea like pharaoh raced in pursuit of that damned moses upon discovering that the wily bastard had decamped for the promised land without finishing his mudbrick quota and had absconded with a dozen of his favourite concubines to boot all pharaoh could expect from dissenter religionists all lewrie could do was hang on for dear life to the front and the side frame and light screening wood and try hard not to get thrown clean out of the infernal machine have his wedding tackle knackered by his luggage or lose his only change of clothing entire a time or two on the flat stretches without competing traffic though lewrie wasnt going to peek to determine that it was even hard to breathe at their mad pace facing forward it felt like he was aboard the quickest frigate ever built going full and by into the apparent wind in a halfgale of course the muck flung up from the team made breathing difficult enough finally after what seemed an interminable term in hell the drumming of horses hooves slowed from a marine drummers long roll to summon a crew to quarters to rather sedate and distinctive clops he at last dared take a peek twixt the ringers of one hand the one he used to rake mudslime from his eyes and was amazed to see that they were on the tottenham court road just about to the crossing where it became charing cross were here twigg commented with a grunt of satisfaction and a peek at his pocket watch as if hed just beaten his old record for a jaunt to town indeed they were lewries addled senses reawoke to the sights sounds and smells of bustling london twigg had removed his ancient tricorne now much the worse for wear and had replaced it with a natty newstyled hat his grimy muffler now lay at his feet as did his old overcoat revealing the country squire suitings hed had on during dinner he looked clean as a new pennywhistle damn him with a twitch of his reins twigg swung them onto oxford street headed west i will drop you at your fathers gentlemens hotel and club lewrie he told him you are sure to get lodging there and at a significant discount id wager hah right round the corner to mine own house in baker street convenient that for our purposes should i dine with you tonight then sir lewrie asked flexing his hands now that there was no need to cling to the chariot with a deathgrip not a bit of it twigg barked back to his old imperious self theres too much for me to do tonight to put your salvation on good quick footing eminent people with whom to dine and consult over victuals hmm speeds the thing before any news from jamaica makes you a pariah subject to arrest hah what a pity lewrie said tongueincheek now that he could trust using it without the end of it getting snipped off on a deep rut and a bounce which statement made twigg glare down his nose at him it would be best for you if you kept close to your lodgings lewrie twigg instructed no gadding about no drunken sailors antics for a time and ill thank you to keep your breeches buttoned up snug as long as were here sir let us not give your anonymous tormentor any more grist for his or her mill and the influential men and women whom we wish to espouse your cause are a prim lot even the slightest whiff of new scandal or dalliance and youll lose what hope they could offer you nestce pas lor wot a caution ye are yer honour damme if ye aint har har lewrie returned in a mock lowerdeck accent fed up with twiggs toplofty scorn nary een one saucy wench nor drap o gin neither yer honour sir why wots th world comin t i axs ye tsk tsk and yet you must make a fool of yourself twigg said sighing in exasperation his eyes and lips slit one might have also heard him almost growl in frustration sorry sir my nature i spose lewrie said sobering well keep a taut rein on your nature twigg snapped back id keep you caged in a basement or garret if i could but i suppose at some point your potential patrons will have to see you and speak to you mores the pity whilst in your lodgings i suggest that you polish the tale you told me of how your crime occurred and make it damned short ill send round a list of queries your sponsors are to my mind most likely to make to you and include suggestions as to how best to explain yourself and when they see you lewrie should they that is to say twigg added his acidic aspersion dripping i adjure you to display a proper gravitas suitable to your station and circumstances one might even practice righteousness in a mirror though i doubt youre that familiar with it playact a tarpaulin sailor perhaps all blunt and tarryhanded rehearse responses of wideeyed honesty to the most probable questions they might put to you a list of which ill send round damned short responses it goes without saying do you give your saucy nature free play even for a moment such as your last witless fillip and i assure you that youre truly lost a short turn north in james street a tack westerly to wigmore street and they were at last arrived at the corner of duke street and twigg drew them to the kerbings before a splendid converted mansion that now boasted a discreet blass plate by the entry that announced the place as the madeira club lewries fathers gentlemens hotel hellishfond of their ports twigg said with a sniff sup in do not stray to your usual low haunts he brusquely ordered as lewrie mastthankfully alit on solid unmoving ground the doors opened and a liveried porter came down the steps to help carry his traps i will be in touch with you anon and for gods sake lewrie have yourself a good long bathe sponge your uniform or purchase a newun you are as filthy as a thamesside mudlark with that to cackle over twigg whipped up and away leaving capt alan lewrie muttering under his breath and slowly dribbling roadslime on the sidewalk chapter seven righteousness came rather easy to hand at the madeira club for most of its lodgers and guests were of the very same sort of made men whom twigg had disparaged over dinner at his hampstead bungalow newly rich or at least moderately welltodo off steam engines the mills and manufacturies that had sprung up due to the wars demands expanding overseas trade despite said war and clerks and functionaries returned from india or other colonies as chicken nabobs worth at the very least even some nabobs and goranabobs with nouveau riche fortunes of or more even some few who could nearly be called by the newfangled term millionaire even with his spanish silver lewrie was a piker compared to most of them after he let drop that he was a friend of sir malcolm shockley baronet one of the clubs founders and major investors though once he declared that his father was sir hugo st george willoughby the other founder he was welcome enough there serving officers in the main holders of kings commission were not expected to be anything but middlingpoor so he was forgiven and if he wasnt exactly a paidup official member he surely would be soon god but they were an earnest lot though early to bed early to rise no loud noises after ten in the evening their wagers on card games in the socalled long room never ventured much above a shilling or two and every meal was preceded with a prayer alan lewrie had to give his father credit though when it came to the victuals and most especially to the contents of the wine cellar if one had no valet or manservant to assist a gentleman could trust the staff to fill a role temporarily and with all the quiet unobtrusive competence of the best private mansions staff the maidservants of course were homely old trullibubs the chariot ride did require lewrie to purchase a complete new uniform at his old fleet street tailors whilst there he also got a rather drab and sober civilian suit imagining that if the citys bailiffs were on the lookout for a capt lewrie rn they might not look twice at a natty fellow in mufti as the east india company officers put it and if he appeared to be sober grave and righteous before his potential patrons in unremarkable but wellcut clothes it might go a long way towards furthering his cause lewrie didnt imagine that prim clapham sect and evangelical society sorts would care very much for flash on their own backs or on their penitents either with his fellow lodgers attires to go by lewrie thought hed made a wise move thats the question dye see captain lewrie one member told him as they sat sidebyside in matching leather chairs before a cheery fire one night in the common rooms after a hearty supper and two bottles of smuggled french cabernet sloshed down mr giles whod made his fortune in the leathergoods trade had turned nighgloomily voluble in his maunderings to which lewrie in his new sober guise was forced to listen nod and make the appropriate ah hums and i sees what tdo with sudden wealth sir mr giles said with a sigh as if was an intolerably sinful burden to spend and get and waste it on mere pleasures and fripperies as most do when presented with a windfall an unlookedfor inheritance why did god intend for me to prosper and not others thankee for the port sir aahh if one ponders it a bit one sees that wealth hidden under the proverbial bushel basket greedily squirreled away benefits no one the lord may mean for us to make ourselves comfortable but not showy then use his rewards for our hard work and diligence to the benefit of others dye see to be useful of avail to improve others lots mr giles was a methodist and a utilitarian treat the sick lewrie surmised feed the poor all that new hospitals yes sir mr giles replied workhouses and parish poorhouses to relieve the unfortunate the orphans the widows good works among em too not outright charity though schools for the lower classes so that they learn honest trades thrift sobriety and obedience to the laws of the realm chastity lewrie stuck in feigning an agreeable air oh my yes captain lewrie giles heartily agreed as well as cleanliness in their persons and habitations and the way they live their lives now mister putney yonder giles said indicating a sallow stick of a fellow who looked as if an entire host of tropical diseases had had fun playing with him was the collector of uhm some indian city or province sweatypore or some such like that came home with an hundred thousand pounds and whats the very first thing he did with it found a better physician was lewries best guess donated two thousand to tract societies to spread word of new morality throughout london and portsmouth ha giles boasted clapping a palm on the wide arm of his leather chairwhich act resulted in a waiter fetching them both a fresh bottle of the houses trademark madeira which wasnt exactly what mr giles had in mind but was welcome nonetheless and the poor academies and sunday schools i trust teach them to actually read those tracts lewrie asked smiling congenially but bored about to tears and wide yawns all improving and useful exactly sir exactly giles chummily agreed now our major baird is also a graduate of our indian possessions he said indicating another welltanned man in his thirties in a ditto suit of such starkly unrelieved black that lewrie had taken him for a dominee i heard he only came off of late with thirty thousand mostly in looted pagan baubles tsk tsk lewrie wasnt sure whether mr giles was sad that maj baird hadnt piled up loot by the keg or had had a bad run of luck at plundering the poorer rajahs invalided out of east india companys army sad tsay for him poor fellow but before he departed im told he donated enough to hire a c of e chaplain to minister to the needs of the native soldiers in his regiment he and his colonel held sunday church parade rain or shine and succeeded in converting a fair number of heathens to the lord before coming home in the market for a wife is major baird at present and im certain that the good lord will reward his efforts a thousandfold by steering his steps to a most suitable and companionable match of a like mind giles leaned closer to whisper bairds deadset against novels dont ye know any wastrel reading matter that does not uplift or serve the greatest good thinking of forming a society of his own i believe to which i do believe i may donate an hundred guineas ha a creditable endeavour sir lewrie said fighting a stricken expression from showing in his rooms he had four new novels hed found in the strand all of a lubricious or lascivious nature lewrie thought of hiding them away before one of the ugly chambermaids found them and denounced him to maj baird fearing that the evangelical society might just drag him about the city in chains for an example of how rogues were ground honest at the madeira club reading about sex was about as close to the genuine article as one could get in strict privacy one may try to be a good christian englishman giles stated all but wringing his hands one may attend divine services hold deep and abiding faith and strive to shun the lures of the world captain lewrie but without good works one is not a complete christian and is but a drone in society one must strive to be and do not just to seem hey what now where have i heard that before lewrie asked his tongue firmly in his cheek by then did doctor priestley say it or bless me but i cant recall the winefuddled mr giles said with a vague shake of his goodly head so what is it that you do to make your mark on a sinful world captain lewrie where do your interests lie when it comes to improving and uplifting i exterminate godless frogs and heathen dons thus making our world safe for moral englishmen sir lewrie declared pretending as if it was his true calling though ready to snicker aloud ha ha capital capital ha ha giles exclaimed bellowing his delight and slapping the chair arm again a glass with ye sir a brimming bumper well if you insist mister giles lewrie replied fraudulently trying to demur though wines a mocker and ive not much of a head for deep drinking not my nature dye see and i really did intend to read at least another chapter of the good book tonight before retiring clearheaded but hang it a glass it is soon after that convivial slosh he made his excuses further pretending to yawn in a prodigious jawlocking manner and made his goodnights to one and all once out of the common rooms though he headed for the bar for a pint flask of decanted also smuggled french brandy which he hid in his breast pocket he almost made it to the stairs but for the noble maj baird who managed to impede his progress long enough to hold a whispered conversation enquiring just where an inquisitive fellow could covertly witness and gather damning evidence upon the immoral doings of the city the cock hen clubs the dissolute dens of iniquity where wagers were laid and where women of the town plied their trade to document in eyeopening tracts of course ask the barman for a copy of the new atlantis lewrie winked back that guides your boy to all the dissolute slip him sixpence failing that just wander down charing cross this very night he left the upright maj baird to sort sin out for himself well you look presentable mr twigg said as lewrie entered his hired coach thank god a closed one and not another damn chariot this time youre wellpracticed in your responses as well as may be lewrie told him in a fretful tone as he sat across from him on the cold and dampfeeling leather bench facing twigg twigg had decreed that lewries new uniform would be best complete with his sword and both the cape st vincent and camperdown medals hung low on lewries midchest from their coloured ribbons sir malcolm shockley and some others have put in good words for you twigg informed him sounding almost breezily unconcerned your old school chum peter rushton in lords sent a letter as well with his reputation for vice god knows what use itll be though i must declare it was wellwritten clerk gave it a polishing i expect lewrie gave that a short jerking nod of agreement at harrow in the short time in attendance before his expulsion trying to read a sniggery surreptitious note from peter rushton had been all but indecypherable like getting a scouting report on the defences of biblical canaan from one of mosess spies and hastily scribbled in aramaic at that meet us behind the coachhouse and share a bottle of brandy in peters idea of a copperplate hand could have very well meant weve hid five dead mouse and theyre randy which of course had earned them both a caning even if the instructor or proctor couldnt make heads or tails of it either were to speak to william wilberforce himself lewrie twigg informed him you followed my directives had a last bathe a good nights sleep alone and youre not headed by spirits sober as a hangman lewrie answered how apt twigg said with a sniff heres the line youre to take twas your old compatriot colonel cashman late of the kings service in a west indies regiment and local planter and unfindable for corroboration in the united states lewrie stuck in whose utter revulsion over the institution of slavery even was he a participant and slaveowner for a time twigg drilled onwards that led you to despise slavery yourself very john newtonish you see it will strike a chord with wilberforce and what possible entourage of the likeminded who might be present for it slightly coincides with newtons own experience of being a slaver then shipwrecked and enslaved by the very people he sought to capture and sell that poem of his describing his enlightenment and salvation amazing grace aye lewrie said with a grunt and a new nod you actually know of it twigg nighgasped with surprise that lewrie of all people had been exposed to it well damme wonders never cease no matter when asked you will clew to this point as if your life depended on it which it does by the by twigg said with another sniff of faint amusement that it was cashman who thought it all up damme sir lewrie said recoiling even if its halftrue hes a good friend and its not quite honourable to shift the he did think it up you said so yourself twigg archly objected as a cruel jape on the beaumans in my version however the former colonel cashman disgusted with slavery and his own part in it manumitted all his own chattel then grieved by the unremitting and inhuman beastly cruelty with which the beaumans kept their slaves he schemed to free as many of them as he could encouraging them to go into the mountains and join the free maroons the young men and boys to steal themselves and join your crew as free men but lewrie tried to say loath to put the onus on kit cashman no matter that he was far out of reach of british justice they stole themselves lewrie twigg insisted you did not steal them dye understand the significance of that its a lawyerly niggle but under current statutes you only aided and abetted but did not instigate or commit hah and you did it in a fine cause think of yourself as the noble hero from a free land england where slavery has already been banished suddenly exposed in the caribbean sugar isles to the utter barbarity of slaverys realities and it soregrieved you consider also your experiences on saintdomingue where you witnessed the ah desperate courage of selffreed blacks trading their lives by the thousands so their children could be free i still have friends at admiralty ive read your reports of intercepting those sailboats full of exslave soldiers who almost blew you out of the water with suicidal gallantry the survivor who slit the throat of one of your sailors as his last act of defiance and you were touched to your very soul twigg spun out and lewrie could see it was all a cynical sham that twigg was creating merely an interpretation of what really happened ordinary seaman inmans throat had been slit out of savage hatred of any white man not gallantry but it was much of a piece with what a barrister would argue at his trial and if such an interpretation of evidence and happenstance took place at an informal hearing not a formal trial which would preclude a trial for a hanging offence should it succeed in gaining him sponsors protectors well so be it and he hoped christopher cashman would forgive him should he ever even hear of it ill do most of the exposition lewrie twigg ordered leaning back against his facing coach bench you just sit there and be stoic stern and honourable refuse wine but accept tea or coffee the sun isnt below the yardarm all that try not to fidget or squirm on your chair sound resolute boast only when describing what fine tars your dozen black hands are you might allude to any religious instruction theyve gotten since signing articles itd go down well hmm like a boxer getting lastmoment cautions on his opponent there was not time enough for mr twigg to impart all of his last suggestions before lewrie knew it their coach pulled to a stop before an imposing row houses stoop where exactly a preoccupied and benumbed lewrie in later years couldnt say and couldnt find with both hands and a whole battalion of flaming linkboys and their coachmans son serving as a footman was folding down the metal steps and opening the door lewrie stepped out onto a freshswept sidewalk looked up at the gloomy coalsooted sky and drew what felt like his last free breath his left hand fretting on the hilt of his hanger and his right hanging limp by his side loath to take a single more step forward or climb up the steps to the row houses door for london with all its stinks the air he drew in was rather fresh it wasnt raining for a bloody wonder and as he looked up as he would to read the set of the sails and the winds direction lewrie could actually make out shape and form in the clouds even espy several patches of open wispy blue here and there then as if the wicks of theatrical lanthorns had been turned up the sun peeked out briefly to stab bright shafts down on the city through those wispy cloudgaps and brightened the street they stood in marvellous mr twigg smirked as he shot his cuffs and tugged down his fashionable waistcoat why lewrie i do declare the sacrificial birds entrails are found flawless the auguries are auspicious and the old gods smile upon us haw bugger the old gods was lewries muttered reply to that if we must we must lets get it done chapter eight the row house fairly shouted respectability though in a muted subtle way shouting would have been thought too common or enthusiastic by its owners perhaps the terrace of row houses was a relatively new development outside once one was in the entry hall however it was obvious that materials from older razed houses had been reused for the entrys panelling looked to be authentic jacobean fold woodworking the immense and intricately carved marble staircases had the sheen from many hands and feet over a very long time too wellcrafted to be sent to the scrapyard the tables and such were of a heavier pastcentury style too and the framed paintings and mirrors were giltframed in a baroque style bright new red blue and buff axminster or winton carpets covered the usual blackandwhite chequered tile floors and ran up the staircase to cover slick worn spots on the treads the house of a serious collector lewrie wondered taking in the statues in the recesses the noble grecoroman busts on plinths the house of a rich merchant or banker or someone titled a balding old majordomo in sombre black livery took their hats cloaks and lewries sword then ushered them abovestairs without more than a begrudging word or two once up he opened a glossy wooden set of double doors and bowed them into a parlourcumlibrary done in much the same youwillbeimpressed decor but for the massive walls of bookcases from floor to ceiling on two sides more newish bright turkey carpets on glossy wood floors a world globe on a stand in one corner about a yard across a heavy and ornate old desk before the windows and surprisingly bright and cheery though heavy draperies a desk stout enough for cromwell and an entire squad of fullyarmoured roundheads to have fought upon if theyd felt like it there were several wing chairs and settees done in brighter chintzes on which sat some very respectable and seriously earnest men and women who stared at the newcomers like a flock of vultures waiting for supper to go toesup and die sir mr twigg intoned with suitable gravity and a head bow ah ha a slim older man seated behind the desk replied as he rose to his feet his coat was a sombre black too though enlivened with satin facings and lapels a fawn or buffcoloured waistcoat and newfangled anklelength trousers instead of formal breeches slimcut and light grey ladies and gentlemen may i name to you mister zachariah twigg late of the foreign office and his protege captain alan lewrie hell if im his protege lewrie irritatedly thought man of the hour and sponsor of human freedom he heard the fellow conclude hurrah oh hurrah a young lady cried leaping to her feet and clapping her hands all enthusiastic methodistlike which sentiment was seconded an instant later by all the others present who stood and began to applaud him making lewrie gawp redden in confusion and almost start out of his boots then to his further amazement damned if they didnt begin to sing for hes a jolly good fellow not at all well or coordinatedly mind but they sounded genuine in their approval lewrie decided that lowering his head and coming over all modest was called for and considered scuffing his boot toes might not go amiss either what the bloody hell he thought though though there are troubling aspects indeed to your feat sir the fellow behind the desk said as the song mercifully ended and he came to where lewrie stood it is an exploit which i and many others wish to become commonplace in future allow me to shake you by your hand captain lewrie which he did so energetically that his long wavy hair nighbobbed as he took lewries paw in his and gave it a twohanded pumping william wilberforce sir and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance erm well thankee sir lewrie managed to say wilberforce wasnt half the glum ogre hed imagined and for a reverend he dressed in the latest fashion with the help of an excellent tailor too some of your admirers captain lewrie and the leading lights in the movement to eliminate the scurrilous institution of slavery in every british possession not merely in the british isles which weve already accomplished thank the good lord reverend mister clarkson mistress hannah more the faces and names went by in a mindmuddling rush too many at once for lewrie though mistress hannah more was another surprise to him she might look him up and down like taking measure of a rogue with her lips as pursed as twiggs but she was in the main a rather handsome woman not half the infamous and forbidding killjoy hed imagined either though granite and ice did come to mind as he made a graceful leg to her getting a coollyimperious curtsy back host mister robert trencher wilberforce said passing lewrie on to a stout but handsome man in his late fourties another of those who espoused the latest london fashions in brighter suiting than one might expect from a runofthemill new puritan your servant sir lewrie said taking the offered hand nay captain lewrie tis i who hold that i am your servant mr trencher heartily replied twas a risky business but commendable most commendable and i shall be pleased to do everything in my power to see that you should not suffer for it ah allow me to name to you sir my wife and daughter captain lewrie mistress portia trencher my dear captain alan lewrie time to make another leg as mrs trencher a fetching older woman in shimmery grey satin curtsied her greetings in proper fashion and state that he was her servant as well captain alan lewrie my daughter theodora my dear the young lady no more than nineteen or twenty lewrie guessed had no patience for staid languid airs she bobbed him a very brief curtsy but also reached out to take both his hands in hers fingertips gripping fingertips and her grip trembling but strong your servant miss trencher lewrie dutifully tried to say noting that this theodora was the very same lady who had leaped to her feet cheered and clapped him i echo my father captain lewrie she nighbreathlessly gushed for in gratitude for the bold step you took to free so many who cried out for rescue from abominable cruelty it is i who are yours your servant i meant to say delighted to be she exclaimed a higher blush rising to her face over her hapless innuendo in what was obviously a rehearsed speech of welcome careful old son lewrie chid himself feeling lusty stirrings in his groin let go of her now hands t yourself he took a halfstep back and lowered his hands to break free of her fervent grip taking note of her parents stern cringes over her enthusiasm her parents taking note of his own chaste reticence and surprise at her departure from the normal graces he also hoped one more bow of his head which let lewrie take a better peek at her god almighty he thought for young mistress theodora trencher was the very personification of elfin beauty she stood not a whisker above five feet two inches in her softsoled athome slippers very slim and wee her hair was a dark brown that was almost raven curled with irons and banged over a wellshaped thoughtfullooking brow a firm jawline and sweetly tapering chin but with very full mouth and lips he was sure would be eminently soft and kissable she did not wear the artifice of cosmetics and had no need of them for her complexion was the epitome of english cream and her eyes huge at that moment in enthusiasm were the most intriguing and rare violet i really did very little mistress trencher though i am grateful for your good opinion he responded with a dash of gruff seadog modesty as twigg had rehearsed him he managed to tear his eyes away from gawping at her impressive bosom the newest womens fashions evidently allowed even the respectable to sport low necklines and her poonts or catheads could not be faulted turning to her parents he added part of it i must confess was need dye see the fever isles are hard on european sailors and wed had a bad bout of yellow jack aboard even with his back to him lewrie could feel twigg cringe and slit his mouth for him to blurt out that his actions were anything less than humanitarian and selfless indeed sir i was informed rev wilberforce said with a wary sniff had we not though sir lewrie quickly extemporised to save himself thered have been no vacancies for the escaped slaves the admiralty frowns on captains who recruit or accept volunteers above the establishment deemed proper for a frigate of proteuss rate even to the number of cabinservants and ships boys allowed unless they are paid from a captains purse theyre jealous of every pence spent on rations kits clothing shoes and what not tis said sir lewrie concluded striving to recall what a pious expression looked like that the lord moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform the slaves prayers and mine coincided nigh miraculously amen theodora seconded just as admiralty has broken captains who cheat the exchequer by overstating the number of their crews despite losses to desertion and death mr twigg informed all present with a knowing and casually worldwise air even if he was glaring daggers at lewrie who pocket the lost hands pay and connive with the purser who will sell off the unissued rations and slop goods reverend ladies and gentlemen just as often as they would one who overrecruits well shall we be seated and have tea mr trencher suggested waving his guests to the settees and chairs about the parlour twigg practically snagged lewrie by the elbow and led him to a settee too short for more than two looking as if hed love to hiss cautions but couldnt as they sorted themselves out waiting for the ladies to sit first lewrie took happy note that hed have a grand angle on the fetching young miss theodora who dipped her head most gracefully exposing what a fine and swanlike neck she had above her lace shawl or might captain lewrie and mister twigg prefer refreshments more stimulating than tea mrs hannah more enquired with a wary cock of her head playin fast an loose with the trenchers hospitality aint we sly witch lewrie spitefully thought though answering her with another of his special modest grins a shrug and shake of his head as we say in the navy maam the sun is still high over the yardarm for me he replied tea would be delightful the next hour passed much as twigg had warned him they asked careful questions as to his motives how his theft had occurred and what sort of fellow was his fellowconspirator excol christopher cashman was he a spiritual man and just when had his revulsion of slavery arisen in his new enterprises in the united states was he a slaveowner there or and more to the point when and where had the so far noble capt lewrie developed his own detestation so he told them of his first experiences in the caribbean back during the american revolution of the fugitive yankee slaves who had run to britishheld towns and garrisons seeking the freedom promised should they aid the tory cause i was at yorktown during the siege lewrie related addressing mrs hannah more his mostinsistent and mostdubious inquisitor in charge of a weak twogun battery of landed guns only a midshipman then for labourers and help loading the guns we had several runaway slaves we were all on shortcommons we ate the same rations slept in the redan together kept watch and drilled together with the same chance of being killed in battle did the french and the rebels attack well they stood a worse chance cause they faced lashings a return to their chains being lynched or shot if we lost which we did and i fear some of them did suffer such fates for very few of them escaped before the lord cornwalliss surrender and it shamed me maam the way they looked at me the veriest boy midshipman as their saviour and i could do nothing in the end he told them damned if they didnt and damned if i didnt lewrie took pause to recall and every bloody word of it the gospel truth and you were made prisoner captain lewrie mr trencher asked no sir two boatloads of light infantry north carolina loyalist troops i and my few hands were blown downriver while trying to ferry the army across york river got stranded on the mud shoals down guinea neck the morning of the surrender we sheltered at a tobacco plantation a slave plantation til we could rework our barges so we could sneak out to sea and escape the orders were to abandon all but british or white troops dye see the horrid conditions that the plantation slaves had to stand their near nakedness pardon fought their way out gainst a company of virginia militia and a company of french troops from lauzuns legion mr twigg added with a sage nod of his head to boot lewrie snapped his gaze to twigg he didnt know that anyone but the participants knew the details of that longago horror nigh a week on the atlantic before being picked up by one of our warships might have sailed all the way to new york if he had had to a most resourceful and determined man is our captain lewrie even as a mere boy of a midshipman twigg ended bestowing on lewrie a mostadmiring grin one which lewrie was sure was costing his soul a pinch or two but it was a welcome diversion one that went down well with all present then in was in the bahamas lewrie continued in command of a ketchrigged gunvessel alacrity a lieutenant finally there was a james finney there known as calico jack like that pirate jack rackham a war hero a successful privateer and a merchant of great fortune made by continuing privateering against every trading ship under any flag even british he was very big in slaves practically owned the vendue house at nassau and always had what they call black ivory cause he was pirating slave ships on their way to the americas murdering the crews and selling the africans off as well as the repainted renamed repapered ships with official connivance sad tsay we raided his secret cache of goods his lair on walker s cay finally and found the bones of nigh an hundred pirated slaves too old or sick to auction off some still bound in coffles by their chains after they were murdered some not he grimly said evidently calico jack and his cutthroats thought it a waste to let perfectly good chains and manacles be buried broke up the pirate cartel twigg stuck in again with even more faint praise and pursued finney right into charleston harbour in south carolina recovered what the brute had looted from the mostprominent island bank and captured the last of his minions for trial and righteous hangings at new providence put a very permanent end to calico jack as well didnt ye lewrie what doesnt he know about my doings lewrie gawped to himself halfturning on the settee to see twiggs eyes all steelglinted well twas personal by then mister twigg lewrie admitted after finneyd tried to seduce or assault my wife while i was at sea and twigg drawled looking back at the others with a smile on his phyz that was almost beatific made the man pay for his brute importunity by his own hand that made em gasp and shiver by personal experience with captain lewrie i may also relate to you that his own coxswain any captains most trusted aide is also a runaway jamaican house slave by name of matthew andrews mr twigg further informed them once they got over their vicarious thrill he has been with him for years and mostlike had a great influence upon captain lewries views on the despicable institution of slavery my word sir that mr clarkson exclaimed i am certain we were unaware of the depth of your feelings upon this head a house slave ladies and gentlemen lewrie said for himself better fed clothed and sheltered than field hands one might even say pampered to some extent yet andrews risked three hundred or more lashes or the noose to flee it and be a whole free man hang on a bit lewrie suddenly thought he might as well have for his brow and face were already furrowed with some sort of intensity do i really despise slavery as muchs im protesting well mine arse on a bandbox but i really think i do dont rightly know what his name was before lewrie admitted suddenly of a much cleaner soul relieved that he was not completely playing a role to save his neck lest his old owners spot him and try to haul him back i spose wont even tell me just in case but and your man andrews your newly rescued negroes wilberforce enquired has any attempt been made to see to their souls captain uhm the night they came aboard sir lewrie said with a feeling that his soulwashing had been very temporary for he was now back to tiptoeing cross a fakirs bed of nails i hope that no one thinks this a presumption but tis customary for new hands to doff their civilian clothes go under the washdeck pump and get bathed be rid of fleas and such before being issued slopclothing well our sailing master mister winwood a most devout christian thought it much like baptism dye see at his suggestion each chose a new name for ships books as if they had been baptised or christened they ate that fact up like plum duff with many a pleased prim simper or shared smile and softly whispered amens proteus doesnt carry a chaplain sorry tsay lewrie added only lineofbattle ships admirals flagships generally do with the charge to minister to a squadrons or a fleets spiritual needs and are paid either by admiralty for their services or are supported by a devout senior officer and as im sure youre aware the pay isnt all that grand the same rate as an ordinary seaman with so many groats per hand in the crew atop that hardly ever see a chaplain on a ship below the third rate mister winwood therefor is my chiefest aid at sunday divisions we hold a form of divine services morning rites with a collect or two as specified a suitable epistle perhaps even a brief homily and of course rather a lot of hymns no sacraments of course though lewrie just had to add feeling free enough for a bit of waggishness right after the final hymn we do issue the rumration at seven bells of the forenoon but totally secular and navy you understand but are your negroes cabinservants waiters and such or do you employ them as sailors captain lewrie mr trencher asked him sailors mister trencher lewrie firmly stated most rated landsman like volunteers or pressed men unused to the sailors trade in gun crews waisters at pulleyhauley aye the older ones one is a dev an outstanding cook i must admit but that was his plantation trade our five youngest though do go aloft are rated ordinary seamen spry topmen sure tbe rated able seamen in a few years oh and one young fellows a crack shot with a musket or pennsylvania rifle and theyre all drilled in musketry cutlasses pikes they have fought under arms mrs hannah more intruded with a slitlipped squeamish look at the image of armed negroes not merely freed negroes was that too much equality for her too soon but of course maam lewrie replied surprised by her fret they must if theyre to serve in the royal navy they have indeed and hellishwell too he boasted though wishing he could unsay the hellish part like any english tar must to serve his king and to uphold the honour and liberty of his ship to aid their shipmates in time of peril whether storm or battle maam shipmates lewrie prosed on only thinking himself half of a fraud paid the same garbed the same fed and doctored the same as each other swing elbowtoelbow in their hammocks belowdecks you may see such for yourself aboard any ship in the navy for free black volunteers are everywhere in the pool of london this very morning in any merchantman youd care to board oh weve seen them mistress theodora exclaimed one hand on her mothers arm those poor souls dismissed their ships between one voyage and the next those horrid captains who turn them ashore to save money til theyre needed again they live as handtomouth as the poorest unemployed irish what did that brute call them father that disparaging ah erm saint giles blackbirds dear mr trencher managed to say waving a hand to excuse getting even close to commonness or billingsgate slang where they gather mostly saint giles indeed they evince such heartwarming gratitude whenever some of us circulate among them with clothing mrs more piously said in a righteous taking or provide a hotsoup kitchen for sustenance once their few pence are lost to vice to drink to the sort of debased women who well she said with a grim roll of her eyes theyre dare i say avid to receive our improving tracts and penny testaments it is quite encouraging to witness the thirst they have for the good news of the gospels why i could even conjure that in every glad eye one may actually see the spark of uplifting enlightenment blossom in point of fact when we lead them at hymns their simple joyous expressions put the lie to the contention that negroes are forever bound into darkness and savagery i fancy them budding saints in their patience their eagerness to please and improve themselves with gods help of course and ours mrs more primly and firmly concluded and do you sense the same patience gratitude and dare we say budding saintliness in your own negro sailors captain lewrie mrs trencher asked they do sing better than most of my crew maam lewrie said though i fear that that french scribbler rousseau had it wrong when it came to the nobility of the simple savage whether still back in africa or dragged unwilling to civilisation by civilisation men women and children are prettymuch the same at bottom the wide world over why you damned heretical cynic lewrie could imagine he could hear them all say they certainly pruned up and sat back at that some will drink too much and try to smuggle rum aboard during a shore liberty or when anchored in harbour he explained some are clever some are dull the same as us the younger ones will cock a snook and be playful imps if they can get away with it the same as my midshipmen or powder monkeys some serve chearly some will always be bitter theyve traded one form of slavery for another just like any navy or merchant sailor aboard any ship in peace or war even if they are paid regular and get some prizemoney to hand all get homesick and lonely now and again miss loved ones wish to have loved ones someday somewhere im sorry but ive never met anyone even close to saintly in the navy and very few might earn such an appellation ashore either ladies and gentlemen lewrie told them in measured tones negroes or swedes or british it doesnt signify they arent saintly nor are they childlike they fit no playwrights cast of sympathetic characters for each ones different an individual aboard my frigate theyre proteuses all of a piece but each one a unique piece of the whole when this war ends and theyre turned loose on their own devices who knows what theyll make of themselves but for the meantime theyre my crew and quite right too miss theodora piped up ready to clap her hands again full equality even if enforced the rev wilberforce commented musing on all that lewrie had said well i think and i believe i am safe in saying for all of us captain lewrie that what you have related to us this morning has been enlightening as to your motives and what sort of man you are he arose leading the others to their feet it sounded very much like the interview was over and he had not won enough of them over well there was the girl but there is the grave matter that what you did officially might be termed theft of chattel property wilberforce went on and property is the heart of common law but could it be intimated that you intend to offer the jamaica beaumans perhaps a modest recompence to assuage their rancour the jamaica beaumans hold too hot a grudge against lewrie for even a princely sum to soothe them sir mr twigg countered that would be for a court to determine and as i said when i first placed the matter to you a court is the absolute last resort for lewries cause the very first for the beaumans because you duelled mrs more sniffed with disgust because i seconded colonel cashman maam and they cheated lewrie corrected her it was that or allow my best friend get shot in the back id not have that stain on my honour he could see another vicarious thrill cross their features at the image of lewrie as a duelling man a killing gentleman even if they did profess to abhor the deadly practice at least it was done among the better sorts not the scurrilous poor and the riffraff and if one intended to be respectable in this new england these reformers wished to make honour went with respectability whether you intend to aid captain lewrie mr twigg told them as they began to drift towards the double doors or not his presence in great britain will be a hindrance to both his cause and yours sirs madames i have spoken to people i know at admiralty whichever way things fall out dye see hms proteus will soon be departing for foreign waters thank bloody christ and its about time too lewrie thought support in the commons assisting sir malcolm shockley and his allies twigg suggested depicting the beaumans as the epitome of cruelty greed and crude rusticity sordid countryputs of a brutal and spiteful nature hmm speaking of saints heres lewrie and his magnificent list of achievements as a naval hero details of which i and my associates may supply you as we also drop a few hints here and there in the public press if absolutely necessary mr twigg said with an obvious dislike for newspapers here now just a tick you said wed not become a public spectacle lewrie cringed wishing he could openly disagree to the idea of being celebrated and right vehemently too else sirs else ladies twigg ominously told their assembly with a stern forefinger raised tis the beaumans who will prosper in this affair and the cause of emancipation in the empire will suffer a grievous backwards step hang property i say for this touches more on morality and ultimate justice not mans niggling laws well then we thank you for receiving us so kindly and attentively and no matter your final decision are both most grateful that you allowed us our say dye think we did my cause a damned bit o good twigg lewrie fretfully asked once theyd been hatted sworded caned and cloaked ready to reboard their hired carriage outside damme we didnt even touch on my involvement with the saintdomingue uprisings respect for toussaint louvertures slave rebellion like we planned to and oh i think we did lewrie twigg rather distractedly replied as he clambered into the coach and took seat upon the rear bench hands crooked over the top of his cane fingers flexing as his acute mind also churned odds and probabilities going over what had been presented as well as what had not been said for lack of time or the right opening lewrie settled in across from him and felt like gnawing on one of his thumbnails as the coach lurched into motion for twigg was quite ignoring his presence finally twiggs fingers did a last little dance on the handle of his cane and a sly smile spread across his harsh ruthless face what lewrie simply had to ask that smile was just too odd bless me lewrie but til now i never knew just how convincing you can be damme but i am impressed by your seeming sincerity mr twigg said with a simper wasnt a total sham mister twigg lewrie groused mine arse on a bandbox but i do despise slavery no person with the slightest bit of feeling could do else the idea of courtmartial and cashiering a criminal trial and hanging mightve made me urgent and glibber i dont think thats actually a word sir twigg snickered damn dictionaries lewrie griped with my name and neck on the line maybe i did do a stellar stage performance to convince those people to aid me but twas not a conversion by indictment like your common criminal slavery makes me queasy aye but tis not a thing i thought to do anything active about til it just is and what is the saying twigg amusedly said that the threat of hanging concentrates the mind most wondrously hmm well of course most people in england despise slavery lewrie whether they have ever been exposed to its evils or not they think most patriotically in arnes song rule britannia britons never never nehver shall be slaves now how that squares with suspicion xenophobia and the mobocracys general hostility towards samboes cuffies hindoos and lascars if they turn up in this country well thats rather hard to say englishmen like the idea of emancipation just so long as they dont have to rub elbows with the results ha ha free as many as you like just keep them out of england what so lewrie warily said wondering just where mr twigg was going with his prosing youre saying then that once this matter becomes public almost everyone in the british isles minus those actively engaged in the slave trade and colonial trade it goes without saying will adore you for what you did lewrie do the beaumans dare sail here to press their charges in court as they simply must if you are allowed to be faced by your accusers as the law requires i fully expect them to be greeted at the docks by hordes of the outraged righteous with the further addition of the idle drunken and easily excited mob of course therell be a trial youre saying lewrie responded with a groan and a sigh id hoped i fear there must be sooner or later mr twigg said with a shrug his eyes alight making lewrie feel as if he felt that it was no skin off his back if lewrie got pilloried and dunged or carted off to tyburn but only after such a public spectacle as to poison any jury empanelled from lands end to john o groats public sentiment will uphold you and spit upon the beaumans and slavery i do imagine that twixt wilberforce and his strident associates and what covert efforts i and my associates may contribute public sentiments may be played like a flute but for one potentially harmful distraction which is lewrie asked one eyebrow up in wariness you twigg replied tilting back his head to gaze down that long nose of his looking as if he was having difficulty stifling his chortle of glee youre a much easier man to extol at longdistance lewrie with none of your warts and peccadiloes on public display it is foreign waters for you me lad at sea where i believe you once told me or peel either of us it dont signify that you did not get in a tenth the trouble you did ashore out of sight out of mind whilst your allies at home strive mightily to put a gloss upon your valiant repute hmm very far away for an extended period of time where one may hope you garner even moreglorious laurels with some laudable achievement gainst england s foes thatd go down nice did you you said youd already spoken to people at admiralty lewrie said so i spose thats inhand too i fear youve no time to dillydally lewrie twigg assured him still simpering in a most haughty manner no recontre with the little wife no visiting your children not even time to drop in on sir hugo for a brief meal no loss there lewrie sarcastically said it wasnt so much the active dislike of his sly sire that had dominated his early yearspeople who pressganged one into the navy in the middle of a war and stole ones inheritance had a way of fostering distrustbut more a leeriness that no matter sir hugo st george willoughbys new repute fortune and rehabilitation in society one should keep one hand on ones coinpurse at all times and reject any proposed investments twigg youre smiling like you already know where im going lewrie sullenly accused perhaps twigg slowly and cagily drawled back i will allow that it will not be back to the caribbean and weeks from summons to court he mystifyingly added good god sir you should now be doing handsprings or saint catherines wheels are you not grateful i am but its the way you were i you id gather my traps from the madeira club at once and book a seat on the dilly to portsmouth instanter twigg went on quite blithely make haste to return aboard your frigate before your new orders beat you there and the port admiral takes notice that youve been absent rather a bit too long for one still holding active commission and command well perhaps i might run you down myself in my chariot much faster than a diligencecoach ah no thank you or does sir hugo wish to have a brief bit of time with you twigg drolly continued he could drive you to portsmouth in his he purchased a chariot and team recently dye know we race when we have the time to weekend at my country house theyre all the crack haw haw id rather walk lewrie bleakly replied with a shudder book ii i bone quo virtus tua tt vocat i pede fausto grandia laturus meritorum praeiia quid stas go sir whither your valour calls you go good luck to youto win big rewards for your merits why do you stand there still horace epistles ii chapter nine anyone looking for me mister langlie lewrie asked once all the honours had been rendered to welcome him back aboard he tried to make it sound like a casual enquiry not a furtive fret weve heard nothing from shore of any note sir lt langlie crisply reported as lewries shoregoing traps were borne below by his steward aspinall beg pardon sir but in your absence i felt that a few days out of discipline mightnt go amiss and allowed the hands boardship liberty once the water butts had been scrubbed and scoured and the hoys fetched us fresh good thinking lewrie commented his mind elsewhere kneeling on the quarterdeck to stroke his affectionstarved cats which had come scampering to the starboard gangway at the very first tweetles of the bosuns calls no one knifed poxed or run poxed i could not say sir langlie replied with a chuckle a few fistfights and drunken rows over the doxies of course but no runners erm i also sent ashore to the yards for spare spars and bosuns stores replenished our saltmeat and biscuit and indented for live animals so proteus is stocked with the full six months worth of supplies captain he reported with a touch of pride very good mister langlie lewrie congratulated looking up at him then rising to his feet now that toulon and chalky had had their immediate fill of wubbies i apologise that london required me to be away longer than i expected in my absence youve done well as you always do of course i expected no less after our years of being thrown together he tossed off with a grin thats enough praise lewrie thought dont trowel it on else itll go to his head once ive gone below and changed into working rig bring me the indentures and all to sign lewrie said any more mail come aboard some sir yours is on your desk langlie told him as they began to stroll towards the ladder to the gundeck when in the city sir did you discover where our future orders might take us sir nothing definite no lewrie cryptically informed him damn lads give me space in which to walk will you he said to his cats which thought it their duty to closely escort him down the ladderway weaving back and forth from one riser to the next pray god they do not come immediately no time for shopping and my personal stores are in need of restocking too quite unlike the wardrooms hmm were all quite happy sir langlie rejoined laughing i vow the pursers actually done us proud for a change lewrie quickly changed into dark blue sloptrousers a worn old waistcoat and his plainest and heaviest uniform coat for the greatcabins were chilly and the two castiron stoves did little to heat the space evidently aspinall hadnt slept in his quarters temporarily or lavished lewries limited supply of coal on himself whilst he was awaygood honest lad bills which lewrie read over then addressed to his solicitor in london mr matthew mountjoy official documents opened first of course but they were nothing demandingmost were fleetwide announcements of changes in admirals captains and lieutenants lists some new soundings taken of farflung coasts or harbours of more interest to mr winwood the sailing master than to lewrie right off hardly any personal correspondence though lewrie broodingly noted as he sat slumped at his desk in the daycabin a mocking note from his father sir hugo was the most recent japing him on staying at his madeira club something brief from lord peter rushton wishing him joy of his return to englandnigh indecypherable of course in his own hand peter mightve included cheerful words of how he would do what he could in his cause in the house of lords since lewrie did manage to make out a reference to having spoken with mr twigg but it was hard going without a magnifying glass and a sanskrit or arabic dictionary slam went the marine sentrys musket butt on the deck without the greatcabins maindeck doors first offcah sah he bellowed all full of piss vinegar and temporary officialdom enter lewrie called out lt langlie ducked under the deck beams and door frame to come in bearing a thickish bundle of paperwork just as aspinall bustled in a second or so behind him with his coffeepot two cups and half an hour later and there was another twitter of calls from the gangway the thud of a boat coming alongside below the entryport in the midst of their reading and scribbling not one minute later and mr darcy gamble their smartest and eldest midshipman was announced by the sentry and entered the cabins captain sir gamble reported with his hat under his arm a messenger from shore is come aboard with orders he said eyes bright with excitement for new adventures and new horizons have him in then mister gamble lewrie instructed aye aye sir a smartlydressed and languidlyelegant older midshipman entered next all but yawning in boredom with his workaday duty all but sniffing in disdain at such casually comfortably garbed officers so unlike himself captain lewrie sir he asked as if he had to be convinced before he would turn over his precious documents to just any hobbledehoy last time i looked that would be me lewrie said from behind his desk still seated taking an instant dislike for the fellow even if he did see a bit of himself back when hed been stuck ashore in the service of the port captain of english harbour antigua in younger days when hed appalled himself by actually wishing for another shipboard assignment despite his early loathing for a naval career he had been just that supercilious himself to disguise his delight to be on a warship even temporarily orders have you i do sir the young man replied reaching into a tarred and waterproofed canvas haversack slung from one shoulder and producing a ribbonandwaxsealed letter just come from admiralty sir mr midshipman toplofty formally intoned as if uttering the magic word admiralty made him a grander fellow didnt beat em aboard by much did i lewrie mused to himself as he stretched out a hand to accept them twigg must be working like a trojan tget me out of harms reach we done mister langlie lewrie asked his first officer who sat across from him legs crossed in one of lewries leathercovered collapsing chairs looking eager as a hound when the guncabinet was opened done to a turn sir langlie replied gathering up the last of his bumf into a neat pile one copy for the ship one copy for the yards then perhaps mister whatever your name is catlett sir midshipman cat would be so good as to bear all these back ashore for us hey mister langlie kill two birds with one stone seeing as how he is on his way hmm lewrie dismissively suggested quite enjoying his brief bit of spite anything else mister catlett uhm nossir the crestfallen midshipman replied well there you are then lewrie said with a bright grin as he indicated that langlie should hand catlett the paperwork do stay dry as you can on the row ashore wouldnt want em smudged very good sir catlett intoned sketched a brief bow then departed escorted by an equally disappointed mr gamble who had been hoping for at least a hint as to their new duties and destination a nosailor tailors dummy lt langlie softly commented in dismissal of their visitor hell never see the outer channel marks ill go sir and allow youhe offered starting to rise stay mister langlie lewrie objected waving him back down this concerns you as much as it does me he said breaking the seal and unfolding the large sheet of paper he laid it on the desktop smoothed the crisp folds flat and hunched over it under the slightly swaying lanthorn for the best light uhmum lewrie thought required and directed and all that making the best of your way uhmum with all despatch he read to himself frowning over the urgency implied by those stock admiralty phrases what in blazes has twigg talked em into he wondered oh buggery lewrie uttered at last mine arse on a bandbox hes not gone barking mad yet holy shit on a he griped sir lt langlie hesitantly asked his brow furrowed convoy duty mister langlie lewrie told him looking up and sitting back into his chair were to make all haste upchannel for the goodwin sands meet up with a trade of east indiamen and escort em at least as far as the cape of good hope saint helena recife in portuguese brazil to cape town africa sir lt langlie enthused ive never been there havent missed much then lewrie told him africa bloody africa lewrie furiously thought is this some sort of gallingjape on my predicament want me tturn my black tars loose there recruit even more do they damn their eyes and damn twigg too it mustve been him who suggested it the sly uhm far be it from me to presume further sir but who is not yet daft did you say langlie curiously asked captain sir tobias treghues lewrie bleakly said knight and baronet one of my old captains in the american war when i was still a midshipman aboard hms desperate prim as a dowager til a frenchie swotted him in the head with the hard end of a rammer and turned mad as a march hare on his off days so god knows what hes like now depending on the temperature the latitude or longitude what hes eat for breakfast grim dye expect then captain sir langlie asked far be it from me to slur senior officers mister langlie lewrie gravelled though recalling that yes yes he always had but are his wits flown him for a week or two he can turn into a spherical bastard a bastard no matter which way ye look at him next week youre in his good books and couldnt do wrong if you rammed him on purpose the navy must be hellish needful if he still holds active commission id have thought captain treghues had been dismissed or yellow squadroned years ago when he inherited his title and all lewrie took note of lt langlies bland expression was that worthy trying to keep a straight face or was he wondering whether his own captain was consistently up to snuff why next you know mister langlie admiralty might even be so desperate theyd offer me command lewrie japed the damned fools his first officer responded as junior officers should grinning and issuing a silent chuckle over a seniors selfdeprecating wit where stands the wind then lewrie snapped an hour ago twas a dead muzzier from the south sir but i did feel a pinch of veer to it langlie answered by dawn it could be more soueasterly damme by dawn there might be enough easting for treghues and his trade to set sail lewrie gloomily speculated conjuring up a seachart in the minds eye we could make an offing but itd take days to beat upchannel tmeet em off western kent at the very best if they can manage the narrow channel from out behind the goodwin sands lots of shorttacking close ashore for us bags of searoom for them and i just know he wont keep his anchors waiting for us to show up damn just damn my eyes best pass the word to take in kedge anchors mister langlie lewrie ordered well swing to our bowers til it looks as if we may fall down to saint helens patch safely then aye aye sir directly langlie replied getting to his feet and tucking his discarded hat under his left arm pass word for mister winwood as well sir lewrie said as he strode to the chartspace up forward against the maindeck bulkheads he stopped short though looking into aspinalls tiny daypantry and wondering just how much he had in the way of personal stores and estimating how shortcommons hed be by the time they reached st helena island much less cape town and id admire did you pass the word for mister coote to boot i run out of wine mister langlie and i might turn as mean as treghues can hah he added feigning surliness tea and water and ill not be responsible for my actions aarr lewrie concluded in one of his patented piratical snarls at once sir langlie answered and departing the greatcabins right speedily as if that snarled aarr was not meant in jest no time to go ashore for leisurely shopping for himself lewrie decided jams and jellies mustards vinegars cases and barricoes of spirits personal livestock fresh eggs food for the cats it would all be catchascatchcan all done by the purser in a slapdash lastminute rush with no allowance for suiting his tastes even whisky might be hard to come by in english shops much less good wines books to fill the many boresome hours and days to come lewrie bemoaned well there were the few hed managed to obtain in london the innocent adultress venus in the cloister cuckholdom triumphant and a compendium of testimonies from infamous adultery trials lewrie pawed over the volumes in the fiddleracks above the chart table hmm he did have the newest whoremongers guide to london his sturdy moll flanders a translated les liaisons dangereuses that hed acquired in the bahamas in the s his fanny hill his shamela and a selection of other amusing fielding or smollett novels by god what are these he asked himself as he dug his newest novels from his stillpacked valise and came across his own copy of the latest new atlantis the very same guide hed recommended to that seemingly upright maj baird at the madeira club and which wouldnt do him a bit of good at sea would it and out spilled a loose pile of tracts penny onesheets foldedover foursheets even pamphlets and chapbooks all by their bold titles declaring them to be of the most cautionary uplifting and improving sort of evangelical society flimflam who the blazes put these in here he muttered aloud immediately suspecting twigg or one of his unofficial minions who had slipped them in at twiggs behest just one more jibing mocking jape on top of everything else and secreted so their presence wouldnt ram it all home up his fundament til he was far out to sea lewrie considered what to do with em there was always a need for shredded paper in the cats litter box there was also need for a supply of scrap paper for his own quartergallery toilet and he just might be able to save a crown or two from what the purser was to buy ashore for him or leave em out in plain sight does treghues come aboard lewrie thought push em off on him if he hasnt seen the latest issues hah chapter ten by dawn of the next morning the winds had indeed come more out of the soueast allowing hms proteus to upanchor and shorttack down to st helens patch nearer the main channel round the isle of wight by midday just about four bells of the watch the winds actually were coming off the distant north sea and the danishgerman coast and proteus upanchored once again this time for good and thrashed out an offing into the channel as the last headland of the isle of wight slipped astern lewrie could admit to himself that it felt good to be back at sea even if the weather conditions were prettymuch a pluperfect bastard thricereefed courses topsls and tgallants with the royal spars and masts struck down and hms proteus was still laid over twenty or twentyfive degrees practically sailing on her lee shoulder and green seas were shipping over the forecastle jibboom and bowsprit with every plunge sluicing down the main deck wavebreaking round the companionway hatches and gurgling out the lee scuppers like the town drains the socalled chops of the channel behaved more like a series of granite terraces that the frigate clambered over then skidded down with many thumps and thuds among the highpitched whining of the easterly wind tearing through the miles of rigging aloft and standing upright on her quarterdeck took the skill of an acrobatic rider with legs spread and each foot placed on the bare back of one of a pair of fractious galloping horses and headed for a series of log jumps to make matters even dicier every bloody merchantman or naval vessel that had been stranded in every harbour east of portsmouth had used the wind shift to make their offings too and scud downwind for the atlantic trades convoys squadrons whole fleets or individual ships ordered somewhere round the world could be muzzled in port for weeks before the winds shifted allowing them out and it seemed as if half the royal navy and all the merchant service from coasting smacks to indiamen had set sail that morning all bearing westward in gaggles and streams a positive flood of hard unyielding impatient shipping their captains and masters in such a hurry theyd not give opposing traffic a single inch more than absolutely necessary to avoid collision as proteus shorttacked against the flood seemingly the only ship headed east that vile morning to make matters a tad worse proteus had to tack rather a lot if treghues and his trade had already sailed they would not venture too far sutherly else theyd end up wrecked on the rocks and shoals of the channel islands or the french coast or run the risk of privateers operating out of normandy or breton harbours so lewrie could not let himself stray too much to the south no he must remain in the northern half of the channel slicing cross the hawses of hundreds of those running both sheets aft merchantmen on the larboard tack and the starboard gunports almost in the water for a time then come about in a flurry and thrash noreast til the kentish coast was almost in sight from the deck making civilian captains and watchstanding officers and mates curse him on starboard tack too to make things just a wee bit worse on top of all that squalls and patches of nighblinding rain came swooping downchannel now and again driven by the fortuitous wind shift so beneficial to commercesqualls which perfectly blotted out both proteus and whatever high speed couldntgetoutoftheirownway traffic bearing down on them and as the final fillip of fate there were the damned tides in the channel which perversely seemed yoked to the winds like a pair of surly oxen the tides had turned an hour or so before right after hms proteus had cleared selsey bill and going like a racehorse but for the next few hours until the tides turned all of their efforts to go east no matter how close their frigate lay to the eye of the wind as she bashed full and by no matter how manfully proteus struggled up to windward damned if there wasnt selsey bill off their bows at the end of every starboard tack inshore in search of treghuess convoy sane people go west in weather like this lewrie muttered to himself and the wise stay in port til it moderates gained a bit though sir mr winwood the sailing master assured him after a long gloomy peek at that magnetic headland with a heavy brass telescope to his eye mightve made three miles to the good this last tack speaking of though sir aye thankee lewrie grumbled turning to lt catterall the officer standing the forenoon watch time to tack i believe sir aye aye sir catterall bellowed back with great glee turning to his helmsmen and lifting his brass speaking trumpet to roar stations for stays tail on and prepare to come about to larboard tack as he waited for sailors to ready themselves catterall clapped his raw hands together before him like a performing seal all swaddled up in tarred canvas foulweather clothing then turned to address both lewrie and mr winwood going like a thoroughbred at derby she is sir damme what fun god save us lewrie whispered to mr winwood but hes ready for bedlam certifiable he plastered a broad agreeable grin on his phyz though and shouted carry on to his manic second officer all hands and all officers too up from naps in the gunroom just to be on the safe side judging his moment very carefully lt catterall rose up on the balls of his feet taking a deep suck of wind into his lungs and turning just a tad blue as he held it for a long second or two judging the scend of the sea the pressure on the sails from the gusting winds the wavesets smashing against the starboard bows and what they might be like halfway through the evolution and what gaps in that shoal of merchant traffic he thought he could thread proteus through once she got a way back on sailing nearly degrees off her present course and lay slow and loggish before the winds snatched her like a paper boat on a duck pond and sent her tearing off once more ready ready ease down the helm catterall screeched at last loud enough for his trumpetaided voice to carry all the way to the forecastle then helm alee after a last peek a last breath proteus swung up closer to the wind foreandaft headsails now flowing and in such a brisk wind the fore bowline kept fast and the fore sheet checked or braced to in pilot boat fashion as they would when shorttacking in a narrow channel rise tacks and sheets tacking in such weather really wasnt recommended steady winds and fairly smooth seas were best but wearing the frigate about off the wind could end with them scudded a mile or more west of where they had started by the time they had described a full circle and pointed her bows sousoueast and selsey bill even further out of reach on their larboard bows there was a heartstopping moment when a series of combers met proteuss bows with wet and hearty smacks threatening to slam her to a full stop and put her inirons unable to fall off to either beam but the knacky mr midshipman gamble on the forecastle feeling what shift of wind that the men on the quarterdeck could not ordered that the inner jib and foretopmast staysl be flatted to larboard for a bit which put just enough windpressure on her to force her over enough to cross over then rightsmoothly the starboard sheets the new lee sheets he ordered belayed snug and hauled in in concert with loosening the new larboard windward sheets and hernias and tumbles among the focsle hands bedamned whew lewrie winwood and lts langlie and catterall all uttered once proteus recovered from her dramatic heel over to the starboard side and she began to make way once more whew again a moment later as a heavilyladen cargo ship actually altered course to miss them and passed down their larboard beam with at least a quartercable between them with her captain and first mate shaking their fists and cursing a blue streak of course selsey bill again lewrie muttered late that afternoon as the headland loomed into sight once more this time after the turn of the tide it was astern of them for a wonder could almost be said to be on their larboard quarter as proteus angled in towards the coast on starboard tack and readied herself to come about and hare off to midchannel the winds which had acted much like a gustfront preceding a storm had moderated nicely and the seas had flattened a bit though they still broke green and white around her when lt adair the third officer directed the latest tack the manoeuvre went off as smoothly as anyone could ask for and the nearest other vessel that could cause a collision was at least three cables off the wind seems to be backing sir the sailing master opined with a wary lift of his nose and a deep sniff at the apparent winds more out of the noreast by east now well perhaps a point shy of noreast by east but trending that direction it very well may be making our best course up on the wind east by soueast aye lewrie decided consulting that mental compass rose that he had been forced to memorise in his midshipman days so he could box it whenever a senior asked usually with a rope starter in his hand if he got it wrong and a bosuns mate waiting to wield it and breathing hard in expectation of the joy that came with serving mr midshipman lewrie sauce for his ignorance about that aye sir a point more easterly does the wind continue backing mr winwood ponderously cautiously agreed a long board this time i think lewrie further decided with a chart replacing the compass in his head with wind and tide since the turn early this morning captain treghuess trade would mostlike have headed souwest at first once clear of dover hug our coasts for safety from the frog chassemaries through the straits then take a slant south of west with the wind right up their skirts avoiding dungeness beachy head i dont expect wed see them too close inshore unless they havent sailed at all captain mr winwood said with a heavy frown did the east india company wish to add one more ship or two to the trade still lading in london and now unable to get under way gainst a dead muzzier up the thames or medway sir the only joy we can take o that mister winwood is in knowing therell be fewer damnfool merchant captains out tram us amidships lewrie scoffed with a dry chuckle that and the chance to flesh out our cabin stores from the bumboats in the downs even if those buggers would steal the coins from their dead mothers eyes there is that sir winwood agreed with a faint simper that on him was a sign of high amusement two hours more on larboard tack i should think lewrie opined tides with us the seas flatter we should fly over the ground like a cambridge coach thirty miles or more next tack the middle of the first dog mostlikely then a short board at due north with any luck at all well fetch some coastal mark other than selseybloodybill bognor regis perhaps ill be below til then sir very good captain sir once in his quarters lewrie paused to warm his hands over the single coal stove he trusted to be lit under way and that one lashed down tautly and secured in a deep fiddlebox filled with damp sand even with the skylights in the coachtop overhead closed all the gunports lashed shut and the sashwindows above the transom settee right aft closed it was still grindingly damply cool in his greatcabins toulon and chalky were curled up together in a snoring bundle on the starboardside collapsible settee in the daycabin faces buried in each others fur and had even managed to burrow a bit under the light quilt that aspinall usually spread over the settees removable pad to save the upholstery from a quarterpound of hair left daily after two and a half years and a bit in commission hms proteus was getting a little ripe despite the continual efforts expended to dispel the odours of a working vessel they smoked her with smouldering bunches of tobacco scoured with vinegar monthly swept down the lower decks daily and both swabbed and holystoned weekly but one could not put upwards of men and boys aboard in such a confined space as the gundeck and officers quarters keep six months of perishables on the orlop and in the holds without the reek of overripe cheeses the faint carrioninbrine smell of saltbeef and saltpork kegs the saltfish right aft on the orlop or the stinks of the livestock up forward in the manger below the forecastle from filtering into every nook and cranny from seeming to soak into the very fibre of the ship and her bulwarks beams and frame add to that her ships people who went without bathing for a week at a time unless caught in a heavy rain on deck who must fart and belch and sneak a pee in the holds or cable tiers when caught short when the beakheads were too far to walk not to mention the muddy fishreek of the cables themselves at sea lewrie got to the point where he hardly noticed it but a few days ashore even in such a rancid place as london with all her garbage middens and hordes of people and the change was noticeable in the extreme he wrinkled his nose in disgust there was no steaming pot of coffee or tea so lewrie remained wrapped snug in his boat cloak and sat down at his desk under a swaying coinsilver oil lamp that was putting out its own contribution to the ambient effluvia and looked over the last bits of mail that had come aboard just before they departed from st helens patch his ward sophie de maubeuge once french royalty but now penniless and orphaned had written him a chatty letter describing how his father sir hugo had furthered her introductions in london society with the promise of sending him a new oval pocket portrait that granpere had commissioned once she had moved away from anglesgreenshe and his wife caroline had had a major fallingout with caroline even suspecting sophie and her faithless adulterous pig of a husband with being lovers if not fellow conspirators to conceal his overseas amours for a timesir hugo had taken her in and to everyones surprise had developed quite an avuncular affection for sophie and her welfare and her future as an emigre now he positively doted on the girl as she blossomed into a ravishinglyattractive young lady expressing that he felt beyond grandfatherly perhaps had even attained paternal sentiments lewrie still suspected the old rantipolers intentions there was a letter from his wife too in answer to his brief note hastily scribbled at the guildford postinghouse caroline was appreciative of what the sofar small share of his caribbean silver paid out to him had bought to improve their house and middling tenant farm lord it was dry and standoffish though all sums of profits from the farm and lists of outlays made with a pointed direction for him to write his children at their new public school at the least if such a chore wasnt beyond his ability before he sailed and what was this she had asked about rumours of some criminal deed hed done on jamaica what new shame had he brought on his family name not that it was all that good to begin with damn him had he no consideration for his childrens futures for his longsuffering wifes repute there was an encouraging letter from the trencher family wife father and daughter which expressed their wishes for his safety and continued success they didnt have that much new to say about defending his good name but assured him that their continual prayers were with him their daughter theodora had offered to send him a package of goods for the betterment of his crew pocketbibles new testaments and chapbooks of the newest most inspiring hymns along with reams of tracts fresh from the printers of course lewrie looked up from rereading that letter speculating most idly of course on what sort of figure theodora trencher might boast feeling even a tad risable at the fantasytil he saw the framed portrait of his wife caroline that hung on the bulkhead facing him in the diningcoach odd hed never noticed the leeriness the artist had captured in her expression before coughing into his fist he lowered his gaze to the desk again lifting the letter that the rev wilberforce had sent him wherein he offered much the same sort of spiritual comfort for hms proteuss tars both black and white wilberforce had even proposed placing an eager young chaplain aboard her his pay and his keep to be supplied by the evangelical society could the young man he had in mind be able to go aboard before proteus sailed could lewrie vet him once he arrived at portsmouth and was he not suitable to captain lewries complete satisfaction perhaps there might be time enough for wilberforce and his associates to select another well hed done as caroline had bid him hed written to both of his sons hugh and sewallis had even penned a loving letter to his little daughter charlotte all done into the wee hours of the final night in the inner harbour at portsmouth long past the master at arms official lights out at nine of the evening though what good that letter would do lewrie rather doubted since charlotte was still with her mother hometutored not schooled and exposed to all the grumbles of his wife and inlaws whod never thought him quite up to chalk thered been that letter from his father who had mentioned one sunday after services in the churchyard when the vicar of ivied old st georges had preached a homily on sinners and little charlotte had so taken it and other things shed heard to heart that she had loudly told one and all present in the churchyard that my father is a sinner and a filthy beast his fatherd found it delightfully droll at the time even if lewrie hadnt and god knows what poisons had been poured into her ears since children well there had only been a few years on halfpay ashore to get to know them then the war with france had erupted back in and he was back in navy harness and there hadnt been a whole month with them since then sewallis hugh and charlotte had become more the concept of children just as he had felt himself merely the shadow of a father and every reunion had presented him with sprouted strangers and little charlotte the most unknowable of all to whom he wrote platitudes wellmeaning platitudes but no matter how he reminded himself that he indeed loved them he still felt so oddly disassociated there came the heavy thud of the marine sentrys musket on the deck outside and the cry of mister midshipman grace sah enter lewrie called out sitting up straighter and shoving his letters into the desk drawer captain sir mister langlies duty and he wishes to shake out to second reefs in courses and topsls he said to tell you that the winds are moderating sir the lad said grace the son of nore fishermen who had come aboard a ships boy in company with his father and grandfather who had risen to gentleman volunteer midshipman once proteus had been won back from the mutineers he was upwards of sixteen now and shaping well to become an extremely reliable and tarry lad his grandfather whom theyd dubbed elder grace was gone lost to the yellow jack and his father middle grace was now rated an able seaman and bore the shipboard rate of captain of the afterguard the petty officer in charge of the mizenmast very well mister grace lewrie said in agreement give to mister langlie my respects and permission ill come up directly aye aye sir lewrie had himself a paternal sigh then got to his feet gathered up his hat and mittens and went on deck pausing to give toulon and chalky a chin and ear rub or two at least on deck the nippy wind was much fresher than what he breathed in his greatcabins and the channel was calming too where agitated green rollers and whitespumed crests had been there were now darker green or steelgrey waves though the chops still made proteus ride like a brick masons dray on a cobbled street her heel had altered to a mere fifteen degrees from vertical according to the clinometer by the compass binnacle and chart cabinet as well were making a better way sir lt langlie reported with a sketchy salute tossed up to the brim of his cocked hat the coast is completely under the horizon and mister winwood thinks we are nearly twenty miles to the good eastrd and about the same to seaward came up early did you lewrie asked a bit fuggy below sir langlie allowed with a wry grin i was in need of fresh air and eight bells chimed slowly in pairs from the focsle belfry as a ships boy turned the watch glass four in the afternoon and an end to the day watch and the beginning of the first dog carry on mister langlie lewrie bade and his first officer went through the ritual of relieving lt adair and his watchstanders the men of the larboard division shuffled up to take the place of the hands in the starboard division the men going off watch lingering to savour fresh air themselves very well sir i have the watch langlie intoned saluting adair with a doff of his hat all hands he bellowed not a moment later mister pendarves mister towpenny mast captains trice up and lay aloft to make sail to the second reefs lewrie paced up to the larboard windward quarterdeck bulwarks to watch things done as spry topmen and older yard captains climbed the ratlines in the weather shrouds out to the masttops edges and for a time upside down on the futtock shrouds before some scampered up higher to the topsl yards whilst others scooted out the course yards carefully balanced on the footropes with their chests pressed to the canvasbound main and foremast course yards lewrie thought to remind langlie to overhaul the spiral set of the yards once more sail had been made but forebore that would just be gilding the lily an unwanted intrusion on a competent officers performance good and trustworthy lieutenants could almost make his job irrelevant at times which suited lewries wellhidden lazy nature right down to his toes sails ho the mainmast lookout cried pointing up to larboard deck there ships in compny nine ten or more three points off th larboard bows an hullup he sang out as the clutch of ships appeared from the misty rains glass please lewrie called over his shoulder and thought of going aloft as high as the futtock shrouds but decided not to it was already too crowded aloft and hed just be in the topmens way midshipman larkin fetched him a dayglass and he had himself a good and long look at them deck there the lookout far aloft wailed eight indiamen a frigate two sloops o war and a third rate in the van our john company trade sir lt langlie took time from his duties to enquire with excitement in his voice unless theyre running more than one a month aye sir lewrie told him and on the leading seventyfour i do blieve i can make out a flag with yellowredyellow stripes east india convoy in the code book they gave us mister larkin east india flag to the foremast the union flag to the mainmast halliards where they can see it and know were not a frenchman and hoist our number to the peak of the mizen signal halliards he counted off the massive east indiamen admiring their glossy and rich hulls and fresh canvas so big and impressive that they could be mistaken for gunned ships of the third rate though the gunner leading that elephants parade was the genuine article and could be discerned as such after close inspection for her own sails were worn mildewed and parchment tan by comparison and her hull did not glisten as the others did too much wear salt water and not enough linseed oil or tar and paint and that not refurbished lately by comparison his frigate relatively fresh from the halifax yard gleamed like a bright newminted penny a flurry of flag signals from the lead created an answering blizzard of bunting from the frigate on the forward southern quarter of the convoy was repeated by the trailing sloop of war to seaward of the trades stern quarter and answered by the other third rate that brought up the rear which after a long moment made a new hoist that the lead frigate repeated as she wore a bit off her soldiers wind and started to come down nearer proteus cant read em sor sir sorry midshipman larkin said as he stood atop the bulwarks by the mizen shrouds a telescope to his own eye theyre streamin right at us but i think shes askin just who we are i do tis in the private signals for this month i think must believe were a french fraud lewrie agreed mine arse on a bandbox weve our number aloft already can you read his er aye sor sir larkin the bogirish byblow replied drifting back into brogue as he always did when flustered shes ah hms stag fifth rate thirtyeightgunner captain john philpott larkin stammered fumbling through his bundle of lists and almost losing both his telescope overside and his grip on the shrouds last stag would know were still in the caribbean sir lt langlie commented by lewries side a good ruse for a french raider aye mister langlie lewrie said mister larkin hoist that we are ordered to join the escort perhaps the latest signals bookll convince them tis only three weeks old after all aye aye sir a long minute or two passed as larkin and his bunting tossers made their hoist which was acknowledged by stag then they had more minutes to wait til stag made a reply for she had to pass the message back to the repeating sloop of war which passed it to the trailing gunner which was obviously the flagship more time was taken for the flagship to hoist a new order which had to come down the chain to the sloop to the frigate to proteus and all during that time the convoy was plodding along under reduced plain sail bound roughly west souwest while proteus still was on larboard tack heading about soueast by east and drawing apart slowly wear her about to west souwest mister langlie lewrie told his first officer nothing more convincing than showing leery people your arse like a dog rollin over on his back aye sir all hands stations to wear ready what did they ask that time mister larkin lewrie asked order sir come under my lee the flag said tdo larkin puzzled out at last hms grafton seventyfour captain sir tobias trey gwees triggers truhgewz lewrie corrected him an old captain of mine me lad damme they didnt do him too proud did they grafton was commissioned in why she hasnt been hulked or rotted apart ready to wear sir langlie reported very well mister langlie once about reduce sail so we may fall astern of grafton yonder then come up under her lee with winds full astern i spose he means come alongside her inshore beam might be eitherd do lewrie said with a shrug mister larkin alert yon suspicious frigate that were wearing about try not to make it look like an order to captain wilkinson hmm aye aye sor larkin sheepishly replied wear about then mister langlie aye aye sir perhaps half an hour later hms proteus had fallen far enough towards the tailend of the trade to make a bit more sail so she could angle in towards hms grafton when she was close enough it was an easy matter to duck under her high oldfashioned stern and make a brief dash before the sails were reduced once more so that she ended up off the gun ships starboard quarter about half a cable inshore of her lewrie left the details to langlie busy with his telescope by the larboard bulwarks to study the people gathered on graftons quarterdeck officers sailors of the afterguard some gloomylooking corn stalk of a fellow in drab dark clothing and a woman an officer perhaps graftons first lieutenant lifted a brass speakingtrumpet to his mouth to shout across the swash of the sea between the two ships the wind and the normal creaks and groans of proteuss hull made what he shouted quite unintelligible croror isll pot lewrie mimicked cupping a hand behind an ear and shrugging at that worthy what the devil does he mean by that i ask you must be a welsh insult he japed to his own officers come up to pistol shod graftons senior officer cried again all but screeching this time and waving an arm to direct them to sidle up alongside grafton almost hulltohull ease a spoke or two o lee helm mister langlie lewrie said tossing back his boat cloak so the single gold epaulet of his rank on his right shoulder could be seen as proteus tentatively angled a bit to larboard closing the distance between the ships to about twenty or so yards ah theres the bugger he muttered under his breath capt sir tobias treghues baronet had thrown back the wings of his own cloak to display his pair of epaulets with his chin high as if hed smelled something rank treghues had always been lean and tall and so he still was though his aristocratic face was thinner in the cheeks than lewrie recalled and there was a hint of the beginning of a gotchgut tween groin and chest that strained his pristine white waistcoat the sign of good living lewrie surmised once treghues had inherited his fathers estates and title though lewrie also could recall that treghues was the first son from a poor holding forced to sea to earn the better part of his living lewrie lifted his cocked hat to doff it in salute and after a moment treghues lifted his in response revealing that his formerly dark brown locks had receded above his temples and were now streaked like a badgers pelt with grey captain alan lewrie is it treghues shouted across after he had replaced his hat on his head will wonders never cease to the life sir lewrie shouted back wondering what sort of answer one could really make to that opening sally he would have said that it was good to see treghues again but didnt have a clue whether the man was in the proper half of his wits to accept it you are late sir treghues primly said only got our orders yesterday sir and had to wait on the wind in saint helens patch lewrie replied his own hands cupped to make a trumpet i thought id catch you up at sea once the wind arose from the east im tryin tbe jolly he told himself you should deal with your signals midshipmen captain lewrie treghues instructed they are slack in their duties dead downwind of you sir all signals were edgeon to us he explained the leading seventyfour did not repeat them just like the old days treghues seemed to scoff at that as i recall you always had glib and ready answers and bugger you too ye prim turd lewrie silently fumed take station out yonder sir treghues cried pointing off to the southwest corner of the convoy tell captain hazelhurst of the chloe sloop that he is to reposition himself ahead and to larboard of horatius just asking sir but my orders did not list all the ships in the escort lewrie yelled over to him may i assume horatius is the van sevetyfour aye she is treghues shouted sounding both impatient and petulant together you will learn them soon enough make all haste to your proper station captain lewrie it is growing dark sir aye aye sir lewrie replied doffing his hat once more in sign of departure and hopefully that his joyful rencontre with a shipmate of old was mercifully at an end clew up mister langlie spanish reefs to slow us helmsmen helm hard up and slew a knot or two off us lewrie snapped proteus swung wide away acting as if shed been stung by the flagship course sails were briefly gathered up in their centres to spill wind until shed fallen farenough astern of grafton to avoid a collision when she swung sousoueasterly putting the wind on her larboard quarter to fall down towards the distant sloop of war clews freed and her course sails now drawing taut and full me pardons sor midshipman larkin meekly muttered wringing his hands over his supposed faults but i really couldnt read em no one could lewrie gently told him not your fault uhm not a horrid beginning was it captain langlie queried in a soft voice at his captains elbow after what you said of but not a goodun either mister langlie lewrie resignedly replied turning to look astern at the flagship in the gathering dusk i fear thisll be a hellishlong voyage and feel twice as long chapter eleven signal from the flag sir our number midshipman gamble sang out with a heavy brass dayglass to one eye damn it capt alan lewrie spat and thumped a fist on the caprail of the larboard quarterdeck bulwark for good measure bleakly muttering under his breath what the bloody flamin hell does he want this time before turning to face midshipman gamble he took a moment to recollect the proper nautical stoicism heaving a deep sigh aye mister gamble lewrie enquired with what a disinterested observer might mistake for bland and idle curiosity his playacting was wasted on midshipman gamble for that young worthy had clapped the telescope back to one eye and had screwed the other shut intent upon the distant hms graftons hoists lewrie was therefore allowed to scowl taking note that the first lieutenant mr langlie and bosun pendarves with whom he was discussing the renewal of chafing gear to save the currentlystrung running rigging both lifted their eyes in sympathy and pointedly looked away take station alee no ahead mr gamble interpreted after a quick peek at the sheaf of unique signals that capt treghues had composed whilst they were hammering their way sutherly across the dangerous bay of biscay just in case the french raiders had managed to snag a copy of that months code book to simply obtain their copy of the convoys code had required them to go closeaboard grafton and put a boat down to fetch them into proteuss captains hand only in the middle of a roaring westerly winter gale once soaked to the skin and nighdrowned lewrie had clambered up graftons side to the entryport whilst the lineofbattle ship had ponderously rolled pitched heaved and even seemed to wiggle only to be greeted by the first lieutenant who had given him the signals wrapped in oilskin then sent right back into his swooping boat with nary a sign of treghues to be seen lewrie didnt imagine that capt treghues had meant for him to perish but the sight of his demise might have fetched their senior officer up from below to do a little what a pity hornpipe five miles leeward of convoy sir mr gamble concluded crack on sail mister langlie all to the royals lewrie said very good sir langlie replied more chafing gear mister pendarves once were settled down for now id admire did you pipe all hands and here we go again lewrie muttered turning to stomp aft and peer cross the quarterdeck at grafton now up on their starboard bows and about five miles distant could he really shoot fire from his eyes like an ancient greek god the flagship would explode before he blinked all his problems immolated in a towering ball of flames it had been like this for weeks going on for the better part of two months since the rendezvous in midchannel did the shallows or rocky shoals of the breton coast need scouting for fear of lurking frog warships or privateers one could count on proteus to do it were any of the towering east indiamen dawdling astern or straying too far away the safest wager would be that grafton would hoist their number as the ship to dash off and play whipperin did one of their merchantmen lose spars or sails in the generally horrid weather in the bay of biscay or off the equallybelligerent spanish coasts it was usually hms proteus and lewrie given the task of giving her both close escort and succour to the point that lewries carefully hoarded supply of bosuns stores sail canvas light upper mast and yardarm replacements had been sorely depleted and would any of the other warships among the escort force whip round a shareout hell no of course in point of fact the only signal that grafton had not hoisted was captain repair on board and an invitation to supper as was made to every other warship captain and even to some of the betterbehaved indiamen the third time i blink she blows to smithereens lewrie fantasised and feeling a bit of disappointment when grafton did not after a last shutting and snappingopen of his eyes their trade was now well south of the tropic of cancer steering mostly sousouwest with the weakening noreast trades fine on their larboard quarters to churn out enough southing in midatlantic so the westwardflowing equatorial current did not slosh them too far over to the new world and onto the shoulder of south america where they could end embayed against the coasts and hit bowson by the soueast trades it was theoretically possible to shave the cape verde islands without being forced too far west then do a long and labourious tacking course direct to st helena if the weather allowed though that would require fighting the equatorial current and the trades all the way anything tmake this hellish voyage shorter pray jesus lewrie fervently prayed and quite often at that the easier way so their sailing master mr winwood insisted would be to let the current and winds waft them westrd as far south as the bleak and lonely st paul s bocks then haul their wind to fall down upon cape st boque for a landfall and coast south to becife in neutral portuguese brazil but somehow lewrie just knew by then that capt sir tobias treghues bart would demand that they do things his way the hard way he was charged with convoying the indiamen to st helena and by god thats where hed escort them besides heading over to recife would require that their trade would have to run down the coast of brazil then down the hostile shore of the spanish possessions til they could strike the strong easterly winds round the th latitude the roaring fourties using them to be gusted over to the southern tip of africa and exposed along their way to the odd spanish or farroaming french warships or privateers at least the weathers warmer lewrie could console himself though it was middecember and the atlantic was still a lively place and the skies were rarely completely clear enough for reliable sun or star sights the seas were a cheerier blue and the rising and setting of the sun each day was dramatically and colourfully tropical equally dramatic were the height of the waves and the spacing between their sets that they encountered which made both deepladen indiamen and sleek men o war wallow soar and snuffle atop them one blessing to that moderation in the weather was that lewrie no longer had need of his coal stove for heat during the days but for the rare night when the wind had a nip to it after sundown and most times one of carolines quilts and the cats made his swaying bedcot snug and cozy god but the thought of even an extra week an extra day more in treghuess company was enough to curdle his piss and even the sudden turn of speed that proteus was now displaying could not cheer him even were they ordered to take station a blessed five seamiles ahead and apart and lewrie dourly speculated once at st helena theyd take aboard wood and water then turn the bulk of the escort force on a course for england leaving but one ship of the line and perhaps no more than two lighter ships to see them all the way to cape town and there was the strong possibility a hellishgloomy one that treghues would choose his frigate to be his goat had not twigg as much as said that he was on his wayall the wayto africa and had that perversely mischievious man sent a letter to treghues of lewries need to be far away from england perhaps had intimated the why of it and had chortled over the thought of a primlyoutraged treghues deciding to make lewries life under his authority a living hell he wouldnt put such dastardy beyond mr zachariah twigg damn him and belay evry inch of that lt langlie bellowed satisfied with the set and angle of the sails at last bringing lewrie back to a somewhat pleasing reality hms proteus now had a bone in her teeth her cutwater forefoot and bows smashing a mustachio of white foam below her bowsprit and jibboom the seas creaming either side of her hull and spreading a wide white highway in her wake in comparison to the plodding merchantmen and other escorts bound closely to them proteus seemed the only vessel under way with the slow ships looking as if they merely tossed and wallowed in place the convoys best speedthe speed of the slowest to which all the others conformedwas no better than five or six knots while proteus was in her element with the trades on her best point of sail from nighastern a quick cast of the log showed her already making nine knots easily able to better that at the next cast and attain ten or better east india company captains were even more conservative than most civilian merchant masters they had priceless cargoes to safeguard and paying passengers some of them rich titled and wellconnected and members of the board to boot who demanded coddling so dash simply wasnt in their sailing directions they plodded mostly under plain sail in daylight and dramatically reduced canvas after sundown and drove him to testily impatient legjiggling fits savour it savour it lewrie chid himself determined to take as much fleeting joy of their temporary freedom as possible will ye take a cup o tea sir aspinall enquired making his rounds aft from the galley with his everpresent steaming pot tead be capital aspinall just capital lewrie replied with relish allowing his body to loose the treghuesinspired tension of his back neck and jaws once hed gotten a battered tin cup of tea in his hands he turned aft to look astern going so far as to slouch like the veriest lubber against the bulwarks the freshness of the stern winds kissed his cheeks and there was the gladsome sight of hms grafton as she slowly dropped astern going hulldown in proteus wake mister langlie lewrie announced in a quizzical tone and with his head cocked to one side love a cup sir the first lieutenant replied mistaking that quizzical tone as an invitation and grinning cheerfully wolfish oh that too but lewrie added once were the requisite five seamiles alee of horatius yonder instead of reducing sail again i think we should weave a zigzag course under full sail we could cover a wider swath of ocean that way of course sir langlie said holding a cup for aspinall as he poured it brimful ah thankee kindly and before bosun pendarves overhauls the chafing gear let us also see to the deadeyes on this tack we may retension the shrouds on the lee side first then wear and tighten the starboard shrouds as they become the lee stays very good sir langlie said with his hot cup just below his lips and blowing to cool his first sip weve not had a chance to exercise at the artillery of late either lewrie further decided once were all atauntto id like the rest of the forenoon be spent at livefiring the windward guns of both broadside batteries depending on which tack we stand a little more work to run them out up a sloping deck but good practice for our people dont you think sir i do indeed captain langlie dutifully responded as if hed ever demur with a hearty hell no what a daft idea sir no matter what a captain might dream up good physical exercise too sir he added who knows mister langlie the crew might even enjoy the extra exertion lewrie said with a chuckle full sail hearty breezes and no more bloody plodding might perk them right up by god it does me all of a sudden i feel as gingery as a feagued horse bow to stern by numbers fire mr carling the master gunner bellowed over the roar of wind and water and the starboard guncaptains jerked their lanyards tripping the flintlock igniters of the starboard batterys pounders one at a time as soon as a gun fired the first and second loaders dashed cross the deck to the guns waiting down the larboard side the guncaptains and hands on the tackles stayed at their stations at the starboard guns long enough to overhaul any potential tangles in the recoil and runout lines the smoking vents were checked by leatherguarded thumbs as the rammer men swabbed out with sopping wet sheeps wool sponges once the tubes were safe to handle tacklemen who normally didnt handle loading got a bit of crosstraining inserting cloth powder bags and ramming them home to the rears of the tubes at choosing the best roundshot from the racks about each main deck hatchway or the thick rope shot garlands between each piece they then ran their guns up to the port sills once fresh shot had been inserted down the muzzles and tamped down atop the powder bags stoppering the blocks so they would not roll back free then abandoned the starboard pieces to join the men who had been readying the larboard battery wear mister langlie lewrie ordered while the gun crews panted and gasped the brace sheet and sail tenders went to their stations once more and proteus was worked cross the stern winds again the fourth time in a halfhour and as those trade winds swung round onto the larboard quarter and the deck began to heel in the opposite direction mr carling was there to cry for the readyloaded larboard battery to prime and cock and stand ready signal sir midshipman gamble called from the taffrails a repeat from horatius our number suspend action and conserve powder and shot sir damn that man lewrie griped under his breath hands gripped whiteknuckled on the forward quarterdeck railings overlooking the gundeck and waist aw dad he said louder for all to hear you just never let me have a bit o fun loud enough for his gunners and sail tenders to hear which drew a hearty laugh at his good imitation of an adolescents peevish whine very well mister langlie secure guns seal the ports and insert tompions drills done have mister coote fetch a fresh scuttlebutt up from below so the hands can slake their thirsts well stay on this point of sail for a while too once youve gotten everything flaked or flemished down mister gamble sir signal to grafton lewrie began then paused buss my blind cheeks ye spiteful bastard lewrie considered go shit in yer cocked hat an call it a brown tiewig signal acknowledged mister gamble lewrie directed with a weary and muchputupon sigh no way tput that in code he thought six bells chimed at the forecastle belfry and ships boys turned the hour and halfhour watch glasses eleven in the morning almost the end of the forenoon and a halfhour from when any forenoon drills would end anyway and the rumissue ceremony would be held mister carling lewrie shouted down to the master gunner i will join you once the guns are secured to your satisfaction and see what needs doing in your estimation aye aye captain carling shouted back and lewrie was sure that the master warrant gunner would have his people filling that halfhour til up spirits was piped with greasing sponging and prissy fussing about tackles and blocks with lewrie by his side during the inspection carling would most likely find a way to wheedle more goods from bosun pendarvess stores as well and the muchputupon bosun still had that wornout chafing gear to rig this morning perhaps that task would fill the better part of the afternoon if nothing else came up or capt treghues spotted it and chaffered lewrie for its lack of a sudden lewrie was determined that it would be done before grafton ordered them back within closetelescoping distance the bosuns calls twittered in unison as clear decks and up spirits was piped the redrum keg with the kings seal painted on it in gilt came up from below and the hands queued up for their sailors anodyne loafing and nattering each other in matey camaraderie about sips or gulpers owed debts already paid or had they been forgotten a pair of lt devereuxs fullyuniformed marines complete with muskets escorted the keg forrud behind the young boy drummer beating a jaunty roll to announce its coming now that duties were done for a time and all the hands expected for the following halfhour was their call below to their midday meal it was a welcome bit of idle leisure lewrie paced along the windward quarterdeck bulwarks from the larboard ladderway to the main deck to the taffrails and signal flag lockers right aft his undress coat and hat discarded in his own sort of casual leisure readying himself for participation in the measure of the sun at noon sights when all his commission officers and the sailing master and his students the midshipmen would ply sextants together and at the first chime of eight bells ending the forenoon record their sums on slates or foolscap paper then perform the mysteries of navigation proteus was still under all sail cracking along quite nicely most pleasingly this far south the day even began to feel a touch more tropically warm moderated by the winds and lewrie untied his neckstock and opened his shirt collars he leaned on his hands atop the taffrails for a bit of lonely peace from the demands of his ship and his senior officers pique right by the larboard stern lanthorn slowly shaking his head at the faroff convoy the lead hms horatius still plodded along at the convoys head with only her sails at times a sliver of her upperworks visible when pent atop a rising swell astern of her lay the four short columns of indiamen twobytwo in lineahead with only their beige courses topsls and tgallants in sight the entire gaggle was now about five miles off as ordered but an equal five miles off proteuss larboard quarter and slowly falling to full astern lewrie didnt relish the idea of interrupting the rum issue but in the few minutes between the issues end and the pipe for dinner they would have to come about one more time he decided before they sailed too far astray of the convoys mean course once settled on a long starboard tack once more they could then eat in peace deck there the mainmast lookout shrilled of a sudden sail ho one sail one point off th larboard bows he singsonged damn the rum and victuals too lewrie turned about looking outward as if he could spot their mysterious interloper from the deck how bound he cried back hands cupped round his mouth how far away topsls an tgallants sir tis all i see hulldown she is an bound west the lookout decided after discerning which were the leaches of the strangers upper sails and how they were cupped to gather wind thatd make her about eight or nine miles off lewrie decided to himself nodding in agreement with the lookout as he pictured a plot in his head they were sailing sousoueast with the trades fine on the quarter which put the stranger due south of them bound west did the lookout say they were close enough to the cape verde islands for it to be a ship bound for brazil from there scudded along by wind and current it could be an innocent merchantman even a britishflagged ship or it could be a french or spanish warship or privateer outbound from taking on wood and water and seeking prey mister gamble lewrie shouted stomping his way forward a signal to grafton for horatius to repeat strange sail due south will investigate mister langlie soon as dammit put the ship about three points alee to south by west theres just enough time for our people to eat but whoever it is down yonder we will beat to quarters when weve fetched her hullup chapter twelve just what in the name of god is that lt langlie asked once they had gotten within hullup distance of the strange vessel that they had spent most of the afternoon pursuing westward the closer they got to her the odder shed looked first had come the sight of her royals and tgallants above the seas sharpedged horizon some were pale jade green others were such a pale red they seemed pink faded perhaps sir lt catterall had speculated with a leery expression as if hed just been presented a bowl of dogspew at a twopenny ordinary mightve been dark green and red once well we know about fading lt adair had commented with a snorty chuckle obviously referring to his captains unfortunate choice of light cotton uniform coats hed had made by a kingston jamaica tailor which had bled for months before fading to a very pale and washedout blue even where white fabric or gilt lace had been intended arr mister adair had been lewries comment to that sally next had come full sight of her topsls and courses one of themher main coursewas vertically striped like pillow ticking in a red white and blue all now reduced to pink parchment and offwhite whilst her fore course was a more conventional mildewed and sunburned light tan but bore some large design painted on it spanish warship the sailing master had wondered they hoist crucifixes to their crosstrees before battle sir and paint crosses on their fighting sails must martyr more than a few sailors too lewrie had replied when someone shoots the big wood crosses free tdrop on their decks last had come the sight of her hull and the very size of her as long as a first rate fleet flagship as towering from waterline to midships caprails as the loftiest indiaman but from the normally blacktarred gunnls upwards painted a vivid blue all picked out with bright yellow paint on rails round her entryport beakhead rails and twin stern galleries and quartergalleries and decorated along her upperworks with what looked to be yellowpainted rosettes gunports sir lt langlie had suggested old elizabethan style gunports with fancy woodwork framing them might even mount a side battery of dragonmouthed cannon like the chinese what in the world garish catterall dismissed tawdry mr winwood sneered whore transport lewrie whispered his face creasing broadly into a grin which had required him to explain the jape played on the younger officers of the gunroom when he was aboard hms cockerel in the med in though for a moment the very strange ship had put him in mind of those floating emporiums moored on the south bank of the mississippi opposite the wharves of new orleans the aging hulks that served as nearly dutyfree stores for spanish british and american merchants all of them had been just as gaudily painted and so plastered with an assortment of signboards or sales broadsheets that it had been hard to make out what colour they actually were underneath sir midshipman grace called from the mizen shrouds where he had climbed with a telescope theyve boarding nets strung from every yardarm nets strung to catch falling blocks and such from aloft too close enough lewrie snapped as that outre seagoing joke was within a single mile his amusement fading mister langlie id admire did you beat the ship to quarters aye aye sir mister larkin youre signals midshipman of the watch aye sor sir their little bogirish imp soberly replied hoist colours lewrie ordered and stand by with our number and private signal does that gaudy fraud try to bluff us shell not have this months proper reply as the crew went about stripping the ship for action lumbering furniture seachests and flimsy objects deep below hanging their own antiboarding nets and protectors aloft across the gangways and the gun positions against falling wreckage proteus changed her course to reduce the angle at which she closed the odd duck of a ship baring her larboard broadside to her and starting to steal a little of the noreast trade from her sails by placing her in the frigates wind shadow the course change also gave proteuss gunners time to ready their pieces light the lastditch slowmatch igniters and open their gunports as the strange ship loomed up within a half a mile of them guncaptains raised their free arms to indicate that they were prepared in all respects to fire into her the moment the command was given colours and private signal mister larkin lewrie snapped as he fiddled with his sword and brace of doublebarreled pistols freshly fetched from his greatcabins by his coxn andrews the royal navy ensign broke high aft of her spanker sail with a match on her foremast halliards a string of five code flags soared up the mizen halliards as bundles which opened like blossoms at a single twitch on the light binding line now well see just who ye are ye sonofabitch alan lewrie thought in amazement for at the very last moment a british merchantmans red ensign shot up her after running stay and a blue house flag soared to the top of the strange ships mainmast trimmed in bright yellow at every border and bearing yellow masks of tragedy and comedy think i can make out her name sir lt catterall commented busy with his telescope there on her quarter board festival mine arse on a lewrie gravelled as dozens of people suddenly appeared along the festivals bulwarks and rails waving shouting and cheering some of them most skimpily dressed in the tightest garments scrambled up those boarding nets and scampered high aloft to begin swinging back and forth above their protector nets lewrie lifted his own telescope to behold a whitepainted and looselygarbed fool who plucked his large red pompom buttons down the front of his smock and hit himself in the head with what appeared to be a pig bladder god amighty tis a circus ordinary seaman liam desmond on the larboard gangways cried look pat he called to his thickerwitted compatriot ordinary seaman furfy a seagoin circus arrah sonofa a whole afternoon chasin bleedin tomnoddy twits lewrie fumed slamming the tubes of his glass shut play a jape on me will ye ye clowns wonder if anybody dfuss much if i just sank em anyway i lewrie wondered theres bound tbe mimes yonder mimes clowns fools and captain sharps might be doin the world a favour gawd theys wimmen thar a sailor in the afterguard gawped deck there the mainmast lookout shouted nekkid wimmen still lewrie howled to shut down the bedlam it wasnt his way to run a totally silent warship as some captains might where no talking or unnecessary sound beyond the bosuns pipes calls passed an order but might this be a sly ruse to get him within gun range all unsuspecting and almost completely disarmed then silence on deck silence all lt langlie sternly shouted lewrie jerked the tubes of his telescope open to full extension again so angrily he could hear the brass grinding against the stops and lifted it to his eye there were even more clowns all prancing about in a dance that looked inspired by st vitus giving each other the odd bash with their pig bladders turning st catherines wheels the nearlynude people aloft no they wore costumes sewn so snugly that they at first had appeared nude but he could now see that they wore tights and similar upper garments with equallysnug wraps about their groins as skimpy as a hindoos underdrawers and they were swooping to and fro on swings hung from the masts leaping from one to the other as agilely as so many squirrels two or three twirled horizontally from taut ropes being swung by people on deck and even a few were playing at sliding down the braces of the sails riding perilously from the royal yard and the stiff windward edge of the sail to the tgallant to the topsl then down the edge of the course wonder if theyll charge admission heh heh lt catterall quipped to the helmsmen i said still lewrie snapped mister larkin do they have this months private merchant code uh nossir larkin sobered from being lost in amusement then make a hoist lewrie ordered fetchto at once do not use the trades private signals use the common book aye sor and damned if a brace of clowns didnt leap atop the quarterdeck bulwarks make exaggerated gestures of cupping their ears then waving large handkerchiefs and shouting yoohoo even blowing kisses trumpet lewrie barked taking the one that lt langlie meekly offered he turned back to the rails lifted the speakingtrumpet to his lips took a deep breath and bawled across the narrowing range between both ships fetchto or i will blow you out of the water he heard a faint yoohoo returned as one of the clowns got his hands on a speaking trumpet too though at least some of the men on the festivals quarterdeck realised that lewrie was serious and tried to claw the fellow back down and retrieve the brass instrument mister langlie lewrie snarled larboard chasegun put a roundshot under that bastards bows close under bang the pounder chasegun on the larboard forecastle went off terriersharp and in the blink of an eye a feather of disturbed spray leaped into being right beneath festivals jibboom collapsing in a salty mist over her own beakhead rails at least the clowns stopped crying yoohoo gods sake a man lewrie took to be the ships master cried in alarm from her quarterdeck were british hold yer fire for the love o god sir he lowered his recovered speakingtrumpet and took off his oldstyle tricorne hat mopping his forehead on his free sleeve merchantman festival three days outta the cape verdes and bound for recife he continued with a fresher breath fetchto festival lewrie yelled back i will inspect your papers to his officers he ordered in a softer voice lower away a cutter and muster a boarding party lewrie completed his climb up the battens and manropes to the festivals starboard entryport once both ships had fetchedto cocked up into the trades at a relative halt sailors acrobats and women in scanty casual clothing stood about her decks awaiting him as did her master and mates a man in a battered old tricorne doffed his hat and lewrie began to doff his in return but three whitegarbed clowns ran up to toe the line along a plank seam one widely salaamed in arabic fashion a second banged his head on the deck in a chinee kowtow whilst the third parodied bosuns calls on a nose flute dont make me shoot you lewrie harshly warned the flutist as he gathered a fistful of pompommed smock in one hand and tapped the butt of one of his sashed pistols with the other gerroutofit the ships master angrily shouted jesus he added half under his breath as he came from his quarterdeck to shoo them away im that sorry for that sir that sorry too to be such a bother but we had no idea you were royal navy and ran from you i am amos weed master of the festival and youd be bein captain alan lewrie sir of the proteus frigate lewrie said his humours still unsettled by the jeering amusement the circus people expressed as they congratulated the clowns on their jape smells like the cats sand box lewrie told himself as he got a good first whiff of the air aboard the merchantman our owner captain lewrie capt weed said waving at a portly fellow tromping up the starboard ladderway from the waist mister dan wigmore of wigmores travelling extravangaza ow do sir w do mr wigmore cried as if lewrie was a long lost brother as he joined them he was garbed in a bilious green wool tweed coat and loudlyembroidered tan waistcoat a pair of taupegrey corduroy breeches and topboots he bobbed from the waist jerkily as he doffed a very fashionable narrowbrimmed thimble hat an werry glad we are tsee ye capm daniel wigmore but i spects ye know o our extravaganza aready th finest most hamazin portable show hever ye did see wigmore declared in a

french an spanish persuasion like now yere ere we kin sail trecife in compny wif a stout british frigate so youve seen enemy warships captain weed lewrie demanded of the soberer merchant master trying to ignore wigmores patter trying too to ignore the semiexposed charms of the women the festival carried flaminghennaed redheads lithe little blondes and an assortment of brunette or auburn wenches who were slowly drifting over to starboard to listen to the conversation or flirt with the file of marines and the sailors from his boat crew one of em seen several odd sail sir capt weed told him and we ran from a few that gave me the odd itch festivals not a swift sailer laden as we are but a sure ol girl cant rightly say they were warships but none pursued us too long and weve nought but eight old pieces and them but puny converted army sixpounders as like as not tburst and none o my hands what yed call proper gunners mmhmm lewrie said with a sage nod more than halfdistracted frets me critters somethin orrid sir wigmore bemoaned at his elbow oh tis ard shippin orses an such an them a pitch away from broken legs an h after years o trainin thatd be wasted cept on wot capm weed calls a reach th hupset damme there they go again an hafter we just got em settled too evidently lying fetchedto didnt suit his menagerie either for lewrie heard a sudden cacophony of grunts roars bleating goats burbling somethings fierce moos or heehaws yelps bugles and enough dog barks for a whole hunting pack one set off the others then some parrot squawks and shrill peacock cries arose too might ye be good henough t hexcuse me capm lewrie ive beasts tsettle damn em wigmore griped then scampered down to the main deck and down a midships hatchway bawling for his keepers tell me yere bound for recife sir capt weed nighimplored were ah lewrie temporised loath to tell weed too much perhaps sir bound south at any rate but let me ask you sir what took you to the cape verdes and from where did you sail before you fetched em as to yer second question first sir weed explained wed just done a whole year o shows all up and down the coast of the united states of america evry seaport city from maine to savannah down in georgia right successful too and huge crowds evrywhere we lit the yankee doodles are starved for entertainment i expect we did a show or two in the bahamas then planned to head south ourselves for cape town and the far east couldve fetched recife but wigmore was leery of how the dramasd go over in brazil with so few folk speakin english there for none of our folk speak portuguese een the fortune tellers and bein a catholic country they might notve taken kindly to our costumes neither a bit scant for some tastes ah lewrie could see the sense in that worry as he let himself be distracted by the women clad in muslin or sheer cambric underskirts and chemises exchanging recited lines from slim booklets he took for the scripts of a new dramatic work one of em that particularly caught his eye was an exotic foreignlooking girl with ravendark and long curling hair highcheeked features and a complexion that put him in mind of spain or the new world bright amberbrown eyes or were they hazel but very attractive and firm young breasts straining against her loose chemise damned impressive and full poonts as to yer first question capt weed continued dragging him back to reality we hit the equatorial current and the passage turned longish so much so we were runnin low on water for the critters capm lewrie theres been drought in the cape verdes the last fourty years captain weed lewrie scoffed his unformed suspicions of such an odd ship revived and took a moment to glance over his shoulder to see if his marines or sailors had found anything piratical in their searches aye and so there is sir capt weed sadly agreed i told mister wigmore itd be iffy but the few folk still livin on those isles were damn tight with what they had too sold us barely enough tfetch recife after all then shooed us outta port nigh at cannonpoint wouldnt even let us land the beasts for exercise nor any of our people either got a low opinion o circus and theatre people in the cape verdes i hope we can make it all the way to recife and we just may do we not meet slack winds or have to run from any more of those strange sail wed much appreciate escort capm lewrie do ye be bound that way he almost pleadingly stated we ah lewrie hedged once more then finally had to spill it that would be up to my senior officer sir and the east india companys civilian commodore were part of a rather large escort to a john company trade should the winds suit those gentlemen may even plan for us to beat our way direct to saint helena a john compny convoy up to windward of us capt weed gladly exclaimed rubbing his hands together in such an avaricious way that he put lewrie in mind of a newday blackbeard who had just heard news of topsls in the offing though i never heard a good word said o saint helena water either nor decent anchorage thatd be better than swanning about these seas alone aye john compny mastersd not discomfit their paying passengers with too long a passage thout putting in for fresh stores high on fresh capm lewrie manger beasts and wines flour so they can bake fresh daily aha id lay ye any odds ye wish yell fetch recife long before ye see the hills of saint helena why by sundown wed know one way or tother he happily went on rubbing his hands together again you know the rules of convoying sir lewrie had to ask him the acts and admiralty regulations that youd have to post a bond with the commodore before and follow evry rule aye capm lewrie aye weed replied an daniel wig mores rolling in chink so the bondd be no bother a very profitable busness is entertainment tis another reason to wish to join yer convoy sir theres lashings o profits hidden in dans cabins most of it in silver coin so lewries interest drifted off again as a pack of nighnaked people swarmed down from aloft where theyd been swinging or leaping about and there was that ravenhaired girl again too and this time she was done with reciting her lines and was leaning against the larboard bulwarks on the opposite gangway her arms crossed under her breasts her legsparted stance through the sheerness of her underskirtings hinting at slim hips a taut belly and long fine limbs a narrow slit of bare flesh was bared twixt the waistband of skirt and chemise bottom freed of rehearsing she was frankly and openly staring at him with the slightest hint of a promising smile upon her lips she began to grin as he stared back at her just as boldly and her eyes widened she drew in an expectant impressive breath before clapping a hand to her mouth as if she found him as attractive as he found her felt as risible as lewrie did then her grin widened to gapemouthed and she pointed at him saying something aside to those other wenches near her rather gauche that but who knew what foreign girls thought proper lewrie wondered and he halfraised a hand to wave at her til something butted the back of his booted calves something hairy encompassed his lower legs something as reeky as his cats sand box after a months neglect and he looked back and down jesus fuckin lewrie screeched of half a mind to break into a panicky gallop to the taffrails or leap for festivals lower yardarms whuff the thankfully leathermuzzled bear said as he tried thankfully unsuccessfully to lick and chew on lewries ankles christ lewrie yelped oh pay fredo no mind capm lewrie capt weed told him as he let out a guffaw but dont do nothing suddenlike either old fredos just curious bout a newcome his teeth are dulled and his clawsve been clipped short gentle as a baalamb mostly one of our dancing bears he is and aint he a beauty does a whole series o tricks when we feed him regular hell give up and lose interest in a bit thatd be nice lewrie shudderingly said as the bears great bulk gentle or no made him stagger as the beast began to scratch his hairy hide on the back of his thighs jose come do something with fredo will ye por favor hes an andalusian bear him and his brother quite rare where they come from they are raised em from cubs wigmore did weed told him uh huh lewrie whinged fearful of taking a deep breath fredo amigo his keeper jose cajoled coming to take hold of the bears thick collar chu beeg seelly leggo de chennleman instead the bear rose up on his hind feet laid a heavy paw on lewries right shoulder and epaulet hard enough to make him sag and started to sniff his coat and head all over fredo gave him another chummy whuff and a soft but rasping bawl then slapped his cocked hat off at least that got him off and down the bear gave it a lick or two then skittered it along the gangway like an amusing new toy a football perhaps jose swept it up from him eliciting another disappointed bawl and handed it back to lewrie towing better than five hundred pounds of furry appetite by the collar like he would a wolfhound he mean no harm senor jose said in a friendly manner even going so far as to tap the bear on his long snout fredo and paulo dey are poosycats say jello to de chennlemun fredo say jello he urged and the bear stood up again raised a foreleg and waved his paw at lewrie uttering another friendly squalling bawl that might be taken for a pacific greeting did one ignore the paw the size of a soup bowl geef heem a scratch on de head senor jose coaxed he like de head pat an den he be chur vriend say jello to my widdle vriend senor capitano uh lewrie began to demur rather shakily it here must be noted but so many of festivals people were watching by then that spectacular and highlyamused ravenhaired wench included that lewrie couldnt refuse so he tentatively reached out one hand to stroke the bears broad head to dare skritch his fingers in fredos coarse thick fur knowing that his hand would reek afterward as if he petted a wild goat or badger and wouldnt chalky and toulon be pleased when he went back aboard to snuffle savour and go gapemouthed in wonder over such exotic new stinks fredo seemed pleased giving out a raspy whuff or two so mightnt ye put in the good word with yer admiral an them capm lewrie weed asked as jose mercifully led fredo away finally bout us joinin your convoy for a spell uh lewrie dazedly reiterated seeing another keeper come up on the main deck just done leading a burbling spitting baby camel into the sunshine and damned if hed pet that perhaps its be best did we retire to your cabins captain weed so i may study your manifests registries and such chapter thirteen absolutely not capt sir tobias treghues snapped a band of seagoing gypsies might even be pirates in a gaudier garb well festivals papers are all in order sir lewrie pointed out with as much deferential patience as he could and while there very well may be some gypsies among the circus folk fortune tellers and such i dont blieve weve any pots need mending nor are there any babies aboard our ships to steal so oh well put young sir capt george clowes hooted lifting a handkerchief to his mouth as he had himself a good guffaw clowes was the senior civilian master of the east india company trade and therefore the temporary commodore who would see them all the way to calcutta or bombay perhaps onwards to canton in china too we indeed are bound for recife captain lewrie and i see no valid reason why the circus ship should not be given our protection seeing as how were all going the same way really sir tobias he tsktsked they could have been lurking off the cape verdes just waiting for a fat convoy to come along sir capt treghues continued to demur if not pirates themselves perhaps they serve as the eyes and ears for enemy privateers perhaps a small french raiding squadron their claim of water shortage might allow them alongside one of captain clowess vessels to be succoured and they look sliteyed dangerous to you captain lewrie clowes asked giving treghues a long upanddown look as if his patience was long but not limitless id not turn my back on their dancing bears sir lewrie told him but my boarding party and i searched the entire ship looking for anything odd well piratical odd not outrageous odd and we found nothing amiss theyve but eight light sixpounders and those are british army castoffs there are only thirtyodd in her crew and perhaps an hundred circus and theatrical folk all told the festivals master captain weed possesses but a dozen muskets and fowling pieces and a dozen rather dubious sea pattern pistols all under lock and key in his greatcabins of course there are boarding pikes and cutlasses in their one arms locker also locked up securely oh i fancy those sailors of theirs have personal knives theres a knifethrower with a small chest full and a swordswallower with a small arsenal and among the artists oned find pocket pistols and daggers and such hatpins among the women but and shes a slow sailer this captain weed admitted the east india company captain enquired he was a trim and spare fellow in his late fourties rather distinguished looking and with the salary of a john company master dressed extremely well with a vague attempt at a uniform look that emulated royal navy fashion less all the gold lace folderol and with silver buttons instead of gilt or brass aye and theres another reason she should be shunned treghues snapped fidgeting in his leathercovered chair behind his desk in hms graftons greatcabins under her oldfashioned poop shell slow our progress well take weeks more to and my indiamen wont sir tobias capt clowes tittered as he shared an amused look with lewrie youve already made sufficient remonstrances for more sail and quicker progress sir and complained of our customary reduction of sail after sundown bare steerageway you called it i seem to recall its the companys way sir for the comfort of our paying passengers clowes stated more soberly laying down the law in a manner of speaking a way of speaking that a royal navy captain a putative commodore in his own right with a triangular red pendant to prove it even if it did bear the white ball of an officer not officially listed in that rank yet found both egregious and insufferable it would appear from lewries observation this evening and from his previous service under treghues god knows he was always smug and insufferablelewrie thought treghues was the son of a poor but titled family and had been raised with all the deference given to members of the peerage he had entered the navy despite being the eldest for there was little to inherit but the empty title with the honourable following his younger rank and preceding his christian name even so people would tug at their forelocks and doff and scrape to nobility and unless he had proved himself monumentally unsuited would continue to be courted in a midshipmens mess the officers gunroom or as a captain second but to god he never had been the sort who took disagreement with his notions easily had ever been sublimely cocksure of himself and was primly strong in the lord lewrie was certain that capt clowes and his casual nature and his quick amusing wit was a constant trial to treghues treghues was the sort who expected potholes to be filled before he crossed them stairs to flatten themselves and clowes and lewrie himself were deep sloppy road ruts and tripsnares if it makes you any easier in your mind sir tobias perhaps since festival will be as slow as my indiamen clowes suggested you could keep her under your guns at the rear of the trade where it most certainly appears she will end up were a longsuffering christian permitted to snarl slam fists on the desk perhaps even aspire to rising and kicking cabin furniture capt treghues looked more than ready to turn from a job to a samson in the pagan temple crashbang and down come the pillars to bury smarmy john company captains under the rubble lewrie could not help himself he felt a fit of smarmy coming on and let it take wing besides sir tobias he said with a sober straight face to allow festival to make the best of her way alone would undermine orders in council or was it an act of parliament cant quite recall its origin but thirtythree george the third ceesixtysix of seventeen ninetyeight all british merchant vessels and the festival demonstrably is must attach themselves to convoys under royal navy escort which either go to their destination or as close to it as may be sir for a merchant master to do otherwise he would be subject to a fine of one thousand pounds sir tobias treghues did two things simultaneously he scowled at lewrie as if hed turned into a steaming goredripping beelzebub liable to ruin an armchair and seemed to perk up at the mention of a substantial fine to levy of course festival on her initial voyage to america was in a halifax convoy lewrie explained hiding his delight at what he had read up on once back aboard proteus sailing alone from one yankee doodle port to the next down to savannah georgia this last year entire she was not strictly on the high seas and therefore not liable to the compulsory convoy act and departed nassau alone for the very good reason that no southbound convoy originates from the bahamas captain weed assures me that it was his intent all along to join any convoy he met which could see him to recife saint helena or cape town lewrie laid out ticking items off on his fingers and so he has he concluded then folded his hands back in his lap behind his cocked hat pecuniary interest quite flew treghuess head and utter disgust for the beslimed imp of satan seated before him rose to the fore his mouth flapped open then snapped shut with an audible click of teeth i never expected you to become a sealawyer lewrie treghues sarcastically drawled fidgeting a deal more in his chair and uttering a faint subdued sound that seemed very much like one of lewries own patented arrs perhaps with a slight improvement of treghuess own devising resembling a parrots rwark that he stifled rather well by raising a fist to his lips as if caught in midcough captain weed and mister wigmore have put up the bond for their passage sir lewrie further explained reaching into an inner pocket of his coat and withdrawing a letter i laid out to them the penalty of failing to obey escort instructions lagging behind or departing a convoy without proper leave sir and the fines liable for disobeying as well as the one hundred pounds penalty for not making all efforts to avoid boarding by a foe or failing to alert the rest of the convoy to such incident by night or day now as of this hour festival doesnt possess our private signals book which you devised nor have they posted the pertinent articles of thirtythree george the third ceesixtysix on a board on their quarterdeck but perhaps did you send an officer aboard her in the morning with those one who could ascertain how much they have done to be in compliance with thirtythree george and the compulsory convoy act perhaps go yourself sir tobias to satisfy your worries for yourself and theyre circus and theatre folk sir so youre bound to be amused grrumph treghues thundered into his fist louder and more acidic than before fidgeting forward in his chair as if he wished that he could leap across it take lewrie by the lapels and shake him back to subordinate sobriety that or slap him senseless would that suit you sir tobias capt clowes innocently asked though he had a slight trouble with his own throat it seemed for he had need for a fist at his lips too if capt treghues barked if ah he repeated in calmer takings after a moment the law requires us requires them rather and given commodore cowless assent to this des this particular ah vessels joining the convoy then well hmm he flummoxed trailing off whilst trying to put the best face on abject surrender or humiliating defeat i spose we must allow it though and will they keep strictly to themselves sirs came a harsh voice from aft from treghuess sleeping space which was screened off by some rather nice glossy deal partitions and homey chintz drapes or will such low and amoral people be allowed to contaminate us all it was a female voice which made lewrie start and swivel about in his chair made easier by the slugtrail of satanic slime hed left in it perhaps to seek the identity of the speaker thought i saw a woman on the quarterdeck the first day lewrie told himself damme did treghues marry at last and does he carry her aboard long long ago when the old hms desperate had helped evacuate the last british garrison and american loyalists from wilmington north carolina treghues had been rather taken by caroline chiswick had even very clumsily and embarassingly sniffed about her even more embarassingly trolled about lewrie to see if the girl might prove willing for him to sling a tentative woo at her damned near grovelling he had been blushing as if it nighkilled his prim soul to discover what he could of the girl from such a low source and did he ever hear that she married me in i wonder the heavy draperies were pulled back and the lady in question appeared with her knitting still in her hands and both bone needles clutched in a whiteknuckled grip like allconquering brittania ready to heave spears or cross swords with the foe yoicks what a bloody horror lewrie silently gawped keeping a level expression on his phyz as he rose from his chair at her entrance lady treghues was the severe sort wouldnt care trun into her in a dark alley was his thought as he clasped his hat to his breast and made a leg to her as did capt cowles which nicety she ignored in her pique hair which might have once been lustrous and fetching was now a drab mouseybrown and drawn back from her face her face of a particularlypale complexion bore not a trace of fashionable cosmetic artifice a firm square jaw lips so thinly pursed that she could be mistaken for one of zachariah twiggs kinfolk harshly high knotty cheekbones and the only feature that might draw favourable comment was her light jadegreen eyes which were now spitting glittering arctic icicles like a shower of crossbow bolts despite the lingering warmth of an evening near the th latitude in a stuffy closed greatcabin lady treghues was simply swaddled in a puritandark heavy gown covered from scrawny throat to her wrists and draped in a wool shawl of her own making to boot oh she was a long and lanky gawk milady capt cowles soothingly intoned bent over in a bow worthy of st jamess palace good captain cowles lady treghues cooed back to him could a vulture actually coo of course and you must be captain alan lewrie sir milady lewrie rejoined dipping her an additional bow my husband has told me all about you captain lewrie came a much cooler address had she a fan instead of knitting needles shed have been whacking it back and forth to fight her virtuous vapours like a loose and flagging jib all that was missing was a scandalised hmmph and a stamped foot it was my pleasure to serve aboard his ship milady lewrie replied rising upright instead of grovelling like a russian serf hmmph there it is lewrie told himself now sure that an exasperated stamp would soon come i rather doubt therell be much visiting tween ships dear treghues grumpily said put out that his wife had intruded upon mens business but seemingly at a loss as to how to prevent it perhaps the grey hair in his thinning auburn thatch had come from his wife and her for his own good interventions once the weather calmed there has been treghues she objected supper invitations and i dont know what all surely do circus people actresses and base lowborn itinerants get a whiff of money to be made off the better sorts we convoy with their sleights of hand mountebank antics and pickpocketing theyll swarm every ship in a twinkling like a biblical plague of locusts she fumed shifting her knitting needles from low guard to presentarms lewrie never could make sense of how loving couples addressed each other commoners wives might refer to the mister or cry out their husbands surname to get his attention perhaps even in the melting moments before orgasm oh smith oh mister yes yes calls him treghues not tobias does she lewrie took quiet note and its our convoy our crewmen too my husband or the captain says god spare us he thought with a shiver capt treghues looked as if hed like to tell her to mind her own business put a sock in it or simply bugger off but years in harness with her years of bleakness might have already daunted what meek remonstrances hed made and the wiles shed used on the poor bastard to make sure he knew just which of them wore the breeches a quick perusal of the greatcabins bulkheads and partitions revealed an assortment of art but nothing personal no children no portrait of lady treghues in her younger days talk of bleak lewrie thought of course i will issue a directive that there will be none of that dearest treghues announced stiffening his back and lifting his chin as if to make his surrender to her will seem all noble and it goes without saying that any chicanery or pilferage on the part of the mountebanks will be severely punished as such crimes would in fact be were they committed on any street in england good luck with that lewrie amusedly thought bored as the passengers and officers aboard the indiamen already are t will be them to swarm festival for a peek at the menagerie o course so educational as improving as sunday school ha hmmph in a somewhat satisfied sniff was lady treghuess conditional comment on that well perhaps i should return to proteus sir now that thats out of the way lewrie offered speaking of offering no one had yet offered him a glass of anything and he rather doubted theyd trot out the good china and sit him down to supper in their current snit yayss capt treghues drawled turning his forbidding gaze in lewries direction once more perhaps you should lewrie very well sir tomorrow night though sir capt cowles said as he gathered up his own things preparatory to departing himself let us say about the end of the first dog i would admire did you dine aboard my ship canterbury i should be absolutely delighted captain cowles thankee very kindly lewrie answered most pleasantly surprised that someone would dine him in at last should i fetch a brace o bottles along no bother captain lewrie cowles most agreeably replied we bear a perfectly ample and varied wine cellar aboard surplus to the passengers personal stores i dare say a freshbutchered roast would go down nicely with fresh butter and pipinghot rolls baked not a quarterhour before hey cant beat the victuals of an indiaman before i begin to slaver sir let me say that you do me too proud lewrie happily told him well it appears were both off good evening sir tobias lady treghues last sunday captain lewrie lady treghues said instead and capt treghues stiffened in wariness for which bee had got in her bonnet this time we ordered divine services and your frigate was fairly close under our lee though i do not recall proteus holding a proper service you lack a chaplain sir now dearest treghues began with much ahemming we do not lady treghues lewrie told her few ships under the third rate ever do we hold what lay portions of the liturgy as are allowed without the presumption of a real chaplains offices it would be a touch sacrilegious to do otherwise milady treghues this coming sunday we simply must see that reverend proctor is rowed over to them must we not lady treghues triumphantly announced of course dearest he just had to agree reverend william wilberforce offered milady lewrie couldnt help say in parting sadly we had to depart portsmouth before a man of his selection could come down from london and come aboard the reverend wilberforce lady treghues goggled and it wasnt pretty proteus had just come from the caribbean milady lewrie said with his tongue firmly in one cheek he and i and mistress hannah more and some others had a long discussion about chattel slavery that i witnessed overseas the abolitionist society dye see it was very kind of him to offer a chaplain but admiralty would brook no delay even for the lord he concluded giving pious a good shot i see lady treghues intoned much subdued and sharing a fretful look with the captain of hers your offer for your reverend proctor did ye say to conduct a proper service aboard is may i say equally kind milady lewrie told her with a reverent bow in conge and a thankful smile that only treghues a longtime navy officer might recognise as one of lewries shiteating grins i quite look forward to it til then i spose adieu all and what they make of that the lord only knows lewrie told himself as he stood by the starboard entryport waiting for a cutter the abolitionist society capt cowles snickered at his side in the companionable darkness looking out on the riding lights of the convoy that glittered on a slowheaving dark ocean my god lewrie but youre a proper caution hee hee book iii fornix tibi et unctu popina incutiunt urbis desiderum video et quod angulus iste feret piper et tus ocius uva nec vicina subest vinum praebere tuberna quae possit tibi nec meretrix tibicina

lookout on the mainmast crosstrees high aloft shrilled and this time it wasnt false dark cloudheads that loomed over the horizon could appear solid and they had been mistaken several times for the tall mountains of st helena just as thunder heads earlier in the voyage had been mistaken for the lonely st paul s rocks for cape roque one particularlysolid and seeminglyunmoving storm ahead of the trades course onpassage for recife had resembled an island so much that grafton had despatched hms chloe to smoak it out sending her dashing ahead of the convoy as if capt sir tobias treghues might gain undying fame by discovering one of the long lost isles described in early spanish seacharts sometimes reported by seafarers ever since just as highbrazil and its archipelagos were once cartographers rumours yet never found where others had reported them shed returned hours later emptyhanded these hills and mountains were real though at long last they solidified as the convoy butted its slow way towards them against both trades and current other clouds scudded behind them as they got near and even at ten miles rough details of rocks and bluffs and greenery such as it was could be discerned on barren windswept st helena almost done lewrie whispered to himself with mounting yet wary enthusiasm as he studied the isle from a perch on the foremast fighting top almost there soon to be free of sir tobias and lady treghues pray jesus a break in their long very long passage and the bulk of the escorting warships would turn about for home and was god just proteus would be one of them one more circus performance then lewrie thought as he put his brass telescope to his eye it was land by god it had to be st helena and not another of those portable mysteries for this was even in the correct latitude and longitude for a wonder though he still despised clowns and mimes worse than he ever did cold boiled mutton capt alan lewrie had come to rather like circuses and such or rather certain circus folk recife had been a friendly port a wondrous place to break their passage go ashore and stretch their legs well for john company sailors and paying passengers for navy officers or workingparties under the ships pursers to fetch supplies but not for jack tars treghues had ordered his squadron anchored farther out so that even the strongest swimmers might be daunted from hopes of desertion with armed and fullykitted marines posted at entryports sterns and bows round the clock once revictualled and glutted with firewood and fresh water treghues had allowed the easy pendants hoisted the warships put out of discipline for two whole days and nights aboardship liberty not shore liberty so the local bumboats could swarm out with their waresshoddy slopclothing cheap shoes exotic parrots and monkeys for sale fruits and ades smuggled spirits and whores what had then ensued had not been a pretty sight and treghues and his wife and chaplain had taken shore lodgings to spare their finer sensibilities the sights and sounds of the wild ruts that had followed any sailor with the blunt could hire a doxy for a tumble for an hour or so those who could afford more could declare to the watch officers that his chosen wench was his wife with whom hed share his food and whatever extra he could buy from the bumboatmen and his rum issue with her plus a fee to her and her agent for her loaned charms the surgeon mr hodson and his mate the exiled former french physician mr maurice durant made what attempt they could to determine the women free of venereal or other communicable diseases the bosun and his mates the masteratarms and his ships corporals searched incoming goods and the whores underskirtings for contraband liquour but that was a losing proposition and small bottles of local rum or arrack always got past them watches would still be stood in harbour and the cry to rouse a division a watch usually was no longer wakey wakey lash up an stow but show a leg show a leg hairylegged men got chivvied out of a hammock smooth and mostly hairless female legs were allowed to sleep in everyone got as drunk as they could afford danced as exuberantly and sang as loud as they could holler and coupled in hammocks or on the deck between the guns whenever they felt the itch with a blanket hung from the deckhead for only the slightest modicum of privacy it sometimes required the masteratarms the bosun and those marines who werent whoring or talkingintonguesdrunk to break up fights over a woman a parrot puppy or kitten a dram of rum or a suspect run of the cards dice or backgammon lewrie slept aboard but wisely took his gig ashore right after breakfast and didnt return til after lights out round nine oclock what he hadnt seen he wouldnt have to punish and would usually hold a rather lenient captains mast unless relatively innocent sins turned into crimes against the articles of war the portuguese were neutral in the war against france and the people of recife were friendly towards most visiting seamen without wartime taxes and with the higher value of the pound sterling he had gone on a frenetic shopping spree fresh lowtide sand by the barrel for the cats necessary jerked meats and sausages for their feeding hardskinned citrus fruits by the bushel cocoanuts for their novelty both local and imported wines to restore his winecabinet and his lazarette stores fresh ink and paper new batches of candles and oils to fill his lanthorns a new shirt or two christmas presents to ship to caroline and his children sewallis hugh and charlotte for hed not had enough time to do so in london or portsmouth and here it was not only past christmas but almost two months into both the new year of and a new century as well lewrie had bought a personal store of jesuits bark cinchona just in case of malaria breaking out after a shore call along with a box of citronella candles in tiny wooden tubs that mr durant found useful to defeat the sickening tropical miasmas that had engendered an outbreak of yellow jack aboard proteus when first in the caribbean in and when they were anchored near shore the candles seemed to shoo away the pesky mosquitoes too allowing one to sleep at night without diving completely under the bedcovers new linen or cotton bedding too a spankingnew and more comfortable cottonstuffed mattress for his hanging bedcot since the old one had begun to reek from both his own sweat and the odd claim laid upon it by chalky or toulon most especially when capt nicely had supplanted him for a time last year and laundry and hot baths at sea laundry was done in a wood bucket with seawater or partfresh part saline in which the lye soap the purser mr coote sold could barely raise a lather the freshwater ration was a gallon a day per man officer or ships boy and most of that was used to boil the saltmeat rations or rare duffs or puddings in net bags in steeptubs in the galley to rinse other net bags were used to tow the washing astern in the ships wake so clothing smutted and stiff with tar and slush stains from the skimmed fat from the galley used on all of the rope rigging to keep it supple reeking of human sweat and fleshy oils and grease came back aboard but a tad cleaner and simply stiff with salt crystals once theyd been dried after a while everyone from the aristocrat to the powder monkeys erupted in painful suppurating saltwater boils lewrie included laundry done in boilinghot fresh water though oceans of it then rinsed and rerinsed in colder fresh water churned and paddled wrung and beaten then sundried on a line of clean rope could hold the boils at bay for weeks months if one carefully rationed changes of underclothes and sheets and didnt go too potty on fastidiousness the officers and midshipmen had decided to go shares on fresh livestock too and had asked if their captain might wish to join in theyd hunted up a nannygoat with two kids which could be milked for addition to coffee or tea so sweet that even hot cocoa didnt require too much sugar stirred in and a good kid goat was tender eating as well they bought chickens and new coops so they could have eggs at least three days a week along with a lusty rooster to quicken chicks so the flock would prosper if the noisy little bastard did his duty a fat duck or two some pigs including a pregnant sow sure to birth some roast sucklings sooner or later and a bullock for consumption in harbour and one for later fresh beef even a permanent guard had to be put on the manger under the break of the forecastle to help the ships boy who tended livestockgenially known as the duck fuckerkeep the marines pet the champion ratkilling mongoose from stealing chicken eggs by now she was very wellfed on dead rats which upset the midshipmens mess no end for taking that source of meat sleek and wellgroomed and wore a red leather collar and the semiofficial rank of corporal listed in their muster book as marine m cocky then after a sublime first night ashores supper of local seafoods fresh salad soup and mango pudding washed down with a moderate lashing of wine lewrie had decided to toddle over to the plaza to take in the show at the wigmores circus capt weed of the festival was right the language problem was insurmountable so the planned dramas and comedies and the songs they usually sang in english had been dropped but there was still a lot to see and the performers of wigmores travelling extravaganza were jacks and jills of all trades able to play any role called for on stage or flesh out acts in the arena both aloft and alow lewrie paid his admission and got a seat several rows back on a shaky set of locally runup tiers of benches set about an open area at one end of recifes typically large colonial plaza before him there were two foothigh rings formed by garishly painted wooden boxes the outer ring about ten feet closer to the audience the inner ring about sixty feet across temporary masts and spars and shearlegs inside the inner ring stood with the aid of rope rigging colourful flags flapped in the slight evening breeze and long strings of castoff signal flags or small cheap burgees were hung everywhere a rope could be stretched torches or large lanthorns illuminated the inner ring and the air was heavy with expectation of something out of the ordinary and the local crowd half of them children stirred squirmed and chattered lewrie made sure that his watch and fob and his washleather coinpurse were safe in the front pockets of his breeches for though he wasnt exactly in the cheap seats some of the betterdressed brazilians nearest to him still bore a shifty pickpockets look at least he was back far enough to be spared the attentions of the damned clowns and mimes all in all it was rather enjoyable there were fireeaters or swordswallowers bareback riders who performed acrobatics while their mounts cantered or loped about the inner ring strongmen billed as hindoo jettis who drove nails with their fists into wood or broke stacks of bricks human pyramids of acrobats jugglers who threw knives back and forth people who went aloft above the boarding net to twirl on taut vertical ropes or leap from one swing to another there was a ropewalking act followed by dancing and trickperforming bears fredo and paulo of his recent acquaintance in the slim outer ring there were parades of animals though lewrie did think that the zebras moreresembled the four burros he had seen aboard festival dockedtailed and maneshorn and tarted up with soot and chalk stripes there were performing dogs a rooster who did a dance even if his iron dance floor had been heated beyond endurance capt weed had told him there was a horse who could add subtract or multiply a camel race with the baby camel chasing them ridden by a monkey in a red vest and turban followed by an eyepatched scrawny man with a whip who worked a pair of mangy old lions and went so far as to put his head in ones mouth which set the locals into paroxyms of fear followed by trained parrots which could play fetch from children in the crowd if shown a matching item first and the clowns and mimes of course as entre actes whacking each other with pig bladders or whatever fell to hand who also worked a troop of monkeys for all they were worth and that rightlewdly too though that seemed to go down better with the mostly catholic audience than lewrie might have expected earlier on jose had made a second appearance as a knifethrower with both the brassy wee redhead actress and the little blonde as his assistants or targets on a huge revolving wheel he could even do it blindfoldedor so it appeared at least and there was eudoxia the ravenhaired wench who had caught lewries eye the first day aboard festival shed assisted with a dog act been one of the bareback riders all in garish revealing costume but her final showing put all those in the shade out she came in a scanty outfit to do a solo turn she wore a spiky glittering tiara of what looked to be old sword tips and toobigtobereal paste gems all that atop both her own hair and a black wig of tightcurled tresses so long they reached her arse and looked like old ropes eudoxia had on a sheer upper garment a hiplength oneshouldered greek chlamys sheer enough to show off her silver lame corset

warriors wot shot their arrers from th walls o troy hitself fightin fer ol king priam in th hiliad i gives ye that harcher par excellence that most beautiful an deadly oo revenged erself on them oo slew er own true love wif er silent steel h eudoxia it started slow but built right craftily lewrie thought she began with regular strawstuffed canvas targets but then progressed to playing cards candle flames to snuff large rings flung aloft which she snapped a beribboned arrow through locallygathered expendable pigeons released from wicker cages didnt stand a chance as they fled towards the far end of the plaza even right overhead of the audience the wee blond actress turned up with a canteloupe on her head and that got skewered too then a grapefruit then an orange finally an apple a la william tell for the piece de resistance a gaudily caparisoned white horse trotted out into the inner ring and eudoxia gave a great shriek and ran after him springing and rolling astride and proceeded to perform her art on targets from horseback too seated upright kneeling atop her mount standing even scissorlegged along her horses side and shooting from below his belly from under his neck eudoxia finally drew rein after squarely hitting the ace of spades on a playing card at the full gallop then reined back her horse so hard that he skidded to a halt on the plazas stones to rear and prance pawing the air with his fore hooves to a tumultuous applause as the small band did a triumphant fanfare and over the roar of the crowd uttered a howl of victory that the portuguese might mistake for an amazon or cossack phrase but which to lewrie sounded suspiciously like sic semper tyrannis before she wheeled away behind the gaudy sailcloth draperies that screened the performers and beasts from view as her horse dropped to allfours though she swept the upper tip of her bow across the audience stiffarmed and ended aiming at lewrie a salaamish bow from the waist from the back of her horse then a very wide grin and she blew kisses to everyone with a final one again directed at him and a vixenish impish smile to boot well then he thought well well well hmm winks as good as the node though as hed suspected there had been visiting back and forth from one plodding ship to another on days when the winds and seas werent up and festival had indeed drawn more than her fair share of callers proteus had spent half her time close under graftons lee close under the slow festival too though unable to partake of an hour of two of diverting amusement probably so treghues could keep a damn wary eye on the both of them by telescope lewrie had noticed that civilians off the indiamen had gone aboard much tenser than they departed all callers had been warmly greeted and the female members of the troupe had always been the first to welcome them and the last to see them off perhaps she really was a whoretransport lewrie had sniggered pays for new costumes atones for poor salaries and damme if those camels and zebras o theirs dont need a lot o fodder now as he paid only half his attention to the magic act which followed the girls performance the rational half of his mind warned him that eudoxia or whatever her name was in real life mabel or peg mostlike from liverpool might be a wellused strumpet but that other moiety of his higher faculties kept nudging him with an elbow to remind him that he was the owner of a round twodozen sheepgut cundums of mother greens very best construction purveyed in old half moon street and english by god the finest in the world and in the end if she was for temporary hire then her socketfee no matter how steep would be more than worth it with a body so slim her legs so long lean and shapely catheads so bountiful and so athletic and strong a ride that he very likely might only halfsurvive it no commitments no embarrassing entanglements no his sane moiety pointed out that surely eudoxia might have a lover or protector among the circus or theatrical troupe already someone jealous hulking someone like jose perhaps whod proved his skill with knives who had wild beasts to sic on him someone who might pester him to death with clowns if nothing deadly fell to hand no matter he felt invited and damme lam curious he told himself what harm in that so now without a certain amount of trepidation lest hed misunderstood the wenchs broad gestures he alit from the stands once it appeared that the nights entertainment was winding down and casually ambled as innocently as he might over towards the circuss screenedoff area even going so far as to stick his hands into the pockets of his breeches most unofficerlike and attempt to whistle a gay air to disarm the squinty looks he was getting from the thicklymuscular hindoo strongmen and some equally strong and daunting sailors off festival who did double duty as roustabouts and guards over wigmores property he could reassure himself that he still owned a watch and a full purse if nothing else before he got quite to his destination though the curtainedoff backstage area erupted performers and beasts out to take a final parade and their last bows from an adoring audience and he ended up standing there looking foolish a minute later he felt even more of a cully as smarmy slicklooking local young gentlemen and pretenders came stroking their mustachios and leering with flowers in hand on much the same mission as his oh bugger this lewrie scowlingly thought feeling hot under the collar and even more embarrassed to be lumped in with such sprogs he turned away and shaped his stroll out towards the empty end of the vast plaza towards the fountains statuary and such when capm lewrie daniel wigmore gaily called out as the torches and lanthorns were doused and the tinny little band strangled their last notes and fell silent why bless me soul capm sir but owd ye henjoy me show wigmore came bustling up through the departing crowd beaming and bobbing at one and all to take bows of his own from them for a successful performance why i thought it was simply capital mister wigmore sir and i dearly wish my sailors could come ashore to witness it lewrie cried back stopped in his tracks and removing his hands from his pockets to doff his cocked hat enjoyed it immensely especially owever not then sir wigmore wondered aloud as he came up and not only doffed his own huge austrianstyle foreandaft bicorne adrip with gilt lace and egret plumes sufficient to stuff a large and fluffy pillowcase but stuck out his hand for a hearty shake fetch em ashore t next nights performance why dont ye ah thatd be up to our captain treghues mister wigmore and hell not allow shore liberty not in recife at least lewrie said perhaps at saint helena which is more a garrison than a civilian and desertible liberty port my ladsd relish that aye sir aye thatd bulk th gate sides th few poor sodgers stuck hout there wif nary a diwersion wigmore happily agreed the sound of silver coins dropping into his receipts sack in his minds fantasy why there must be undreds o th buggers ah ah he purred with his hands rubbing greedily together promise me capm lewrie yell do all ye may tgit yer sailors allyer sailors an them off tother warships ashore soz we can hamaze em an ill give yer officers an ye free hadmittance hoftenz yed like thatd be grand too mister wigmore lewrie told him and at saint helena youd be staging your plays as well so did captain treghues allow we might even be able to attend several nights one night the circus the next a comedy the next a drama or opera or in this case what they call an operetta i was quite taken with how your performers filled so many roles surely what they may do on a stage would be even more interesting revealing such a well of talent so to speak does erm eudoxia for instance or whatever her real name is play dramatic roles as well i sound like a countryput sniffin round a pimplewrie chid himself feeling a burn rise up from his collar once more like a young buck tryin tsneak backstage at drury lane why heudoxia his er real name sir wigmore declared with a wry squint of understanding at him th princess parts a bit of a stretch but she did come from somewheres round th greek or turkish ellespont struth er kings henglish haint all that good t play h important talkin parts but she goes down well when it come to supportin roles hat comedies an such chorus singin and wot we calls in th trade the hingenue like er show particlar capm lewrie he asked with a knowing nod and smile most impressive indeed lewrie confessed reddening more why ye should tell er ow much ye were himpressed wigmore exclaimed all but taking lewrie by the elbow to steer him towards the tentage come backstage wif me an well do that this werry minute id be ah delighted lewrie agreed much took quickly to make it sound casual so he amended if that would be no imposition on your performers privacy o course ah wigmore looked at him most disbelievingly damn near goggled in point of fact as he led him past the hopeful leering local senhores and into the backstage area and knowing the goal of lewries wish to congratulate his performers took his own sweet time getting round to the object of lewries quest lewrie was perforce made acquaintance with the horses the parrots who made use of his shoulders and arms for roosting branches the terriers of the dog act who found the permanent scent of cats on him equally delightful a joyful rencontre with fredo and his brother paulo once the dog pack had been forcibly removed both of whom seemed devilishglad to see him again and both mother and baby camel which involved rather a great deal of slobbers hello to jose hello to almost everyone a handshake with that eyepatched skeleton who made the lions perform though without having to ruffle any lion fur for those beasts were already back in a stout iron cage gnawing on what little was left of their earlier supper finally an surely ye remembers our darin harcher capm lewrie wigmore said with a sly simper heudoxia darlin ye recollect capm lewrie o th proteus frigate wot stopped us da i do yes eudoxia purred cocking a brow at him as if to ask what took him so long the scanty outfit and wig were now gone and she sported a thin silk dressing robe belted at the waist looking as if shed had a quick spongeoff right after the final parade her own hair had been brushed back into a single long mane and the garish makeup shed worn in the ring had been removed as well no cosmetics of a more conventional nature had replaced it either even so eudoxia appeared nighflawless freshscrubbed with her natural colour still high from her satisfaction with her performance and her excitement at being in the public eye for a bit there was no curtsy or bow she stuck out her hand manfashion to shake with him catching him in midleg forcing lewrie to shift his hat from his right hand to his left to respond in kind and finding her grip surprisingly strong her slim fingers tautly lean your servant mistress eudoxia lewrie said by rote you are havink parrot shit on your shoulder kapitan lewrie she said instead reaching for a damp towel to sponge his coat with an impish grin on her face which kindness and care for his appearance required her to step overly close to his left side with her in flat slippers eudoxias chin was just below the point of his shoulder shod in shoes with fashionably and sensibly low heels she might stand within two or three inches of his own height of five feet nine looking larboard at her work her face seemed solemn but her eyes glittered and crinkled with wellhidden glee very kind of you mistress eudoxia lewrie told her normally sponging off my coat would involve cat fur you havink pet cats two of em chalky and toulon lewrie said grand company for sailors cats for a captain a lonely think eudoxia agreed stepping back at last i am seeink kapitan veed liffing alone in greatcabins da weed i am to say not veed new to the engliski but learnink quickly do you think kapitan lewrie doin mainwell mistress eudoxia extremely well lewrie amended since mainwell was an idiom she hadnt yet met it seemed mister wigmore says you came from beyond the hellespont turkish or greek or her face hardened of an instant her almondshaped almost oriental eyes slitted in fury and her nostrils flared eudoxia all but stamped a foot turkman nyet greek nyet she fumed ve beink ukraine people cossack not mongol not tartar what fool wigmore know hah not muslim but russian orthodox yob tvoyemat fuck your mother come from volga east of volga the ah river aye lewrie said shrivelling up and shying from her sudden fury mans who say cossack be bastard tartars or turkman is damn lie they tell eudoxia snapped this time she did stamp her foot dainty though it was we christian see she opened the throat of her robe to display a silver cross with an odd diagonal extra bar showing him the proud topswell of her breasts an expanse of flawless skin and a promising depth of cleavage too though lewrie didnt think that was her intent at the moment why ill wager shes that yummy right down to her toes lewrie told himself creamy damn creamy i apologise for any misunderstanding mistress eudoxia maybe i did not hear him right and i was not aware of your heritage he said redfaced forgive my ignorance of your part of the world but ive never been near the volga in the black sea um i beink sorry too kapitan lewrie eudoxia meekly replied looking down and all but biting her lower lip for a moment for saying the bad think yob tvoyemat pajalsta please forgive it mean to do something bad vit your own mother she halfwhispered that blushing and lowering her gaze again though finding it a tad funny would that be with or without bells on lewrie asked with a grin an english expression to go do something to yourself ye see with bells on of course youre forgiven and thankee for a new phrase to add to my vocabulary should i ever sail to the russias dye think i might find it useful get you killed eudoxia all but giggled looking up at him directly and with all her impishness back is very bad my poppa hear me say he beat me then dont tell him you did lewrie leaned closer to suggest snickering and laying a finger alongside his nose for a sage tap his experience with foreigners was fairly broad though he could not claim a working knowledge of any tongue but his own and he was thankful that flirting with the girl wouldnt require a hired interpreter or a glossary of useful phrases her accent thick as it was was nowhere near as incomprehensible as that hungarian officer in the austrian navy lt kolodzcy hed been saddled with in the adriatic back in sailing along the balgan goast in search of zerbian pirades and bud ov gourse ve must fint ourselfs some wirgins all delivered with his double heelclick of precise punctilio so are all cossacks from the volga as skilled in archery as you mistress eudoxia lewrie enquired i came to congratulate you on your skill and accuracy ive heard that cossacks are superb horsemen o course but my word i must say that you are possessed of a fine seat as well they hit another language snag for eudoxia furrowed her brows at that compliment and all but groped her slim bottom peeking over her shoulder to survey her arse on your horse lewrie chuckled in explanation before she took off on another angry outburst excellent riders in england are said to have a fine seat in the saddle or in your case bareback how did you learn all that her hands flew to her mouth for a second as she saw the comedy in misunderstanding his idiom as her hands came down she didnt just giggle girlishly she laughed right out loud oh that seat da all cossack learn ridin from babies poppa is tea chink me from a little girl have brother but he go serve vit czar in cavalry we beink circus people all my life i only child left so he teach me like he teach brother poppa do act vit bow do shootin vit guns too but act vit gun is expensive ponyemayu unnerstand powder shot and be uhm need rifle guns she frowned searching for a word and looking to him to supply it rightfetchingly coquettish to be accurate aye lewrie supplied da the accerrut eudoxia smilingly agreed waving him to a pair of rickety cane chairs so they could sit facing each other with a respectable yard between them gun act be very slow to reload or must have many rifle guns cost too much make not so much money so you can shoot as keen with a gun as with your bow oh da eudoxia exclaimed feckless not boasting but merely stating a manifest fact of life she gloomed up though mercurially quickly and laid her hands on her knees poppa one night pan or flint go piff by his good eye cannot do no shootink act anymore i beink twelve i think when it happen and you had to take over to earn the family income lewrie surmised feeling genuine concern though he did trowel it on thicker for her benefit how terrible for you mistress eudoxia nyet not take over i too little she corrected him work dog and monkey act ride bareback horse poppa is tendink horses and beasts but is very little we make for long time and momma eudoxia squirmed fretfully on her chair dropping her gaze and looking both pensive and a tad angry too she very good singer and actress but must help poppa too he lose place act is over so i am fourteen she run away vit damned french clown is also singer actor oh opera grand he thinkink very handsome da think circus and clownink is too low boast he be bolshoi opera czar in vienna or paris she sneered and momma run way to be opera czarina too damn the french lewrie commented with longaccustomed heat never can trust a one of em i say the arrogant bastards clowns he derided to himself french clowns worst of all finally join wigmore show in lisbon eudoxia related heaving a heavy sigh begin bow and horse act when i am beink sixteen after poppa teach me all he know old lion tamer sick and old poppa is good vit beasts so he learn new act but very hard on him poppa is proud but she said with a fresh smile and hopeful expression now we makink the good money evrything is karasho engliski bloody fine good for you lewrie said patting the back of her hand that rested atop her nearest knee so youve been doing your act how many years now no wonder that youre so skilled having honed your craft your art so long art pooh eudoxia spat figuratively and literally with a brief scowl is reason momma run way in letter she leave us she say must follow her destiny her art hah as for my act i doink it six years now now twentytwo you seem to have coped rather well for all your heartbreaks mistress lewrie responded and im sorry if my mention of art is a reminder of past sorrows but hurt no more kapitan lewrie she assured him smiling back and twining lean strong fingers in his with her impishness returning so you are kapitan of bolshoi big engliski frigate an engliski gentleman must sail the whole world over so many new places like we do in circus is excitink meet many excitink new peoples sometimes it seems just like a circus lewrie laughed but lets speak of you instead i heard youd done an entire year along the american coast how did you like that wild indians and such oh is grand america eudoxia enthused big as all russia vit peoples so rich and clean not serfs not like russia where i get my boots wild indian moccasins at savannah ahem came a voice near lewries left ear making him freeze in dread would he have to pet another new mostly harmless creature here is poppa eudoxia exclaimed leaping to her feet letting go of lewries hand is our lion tamer errp lewrie gawped as he shot to his own feet the man with the eye patch stood near them one hand on a dagger in his waist sash the right holding his whip uncoiled to the ground the look on his harsh face could curdle sperm piss or strong brandy blieve we were introduced a few minutes ago sir but i didnt exactly catch your name lewrie smoothly offered sticking out a hand in hopes the fellow would take it thus partially disarming him kapitan lewrie of the engliski royal navy here is my poppa arslan artimovich durschenko eudoxia contributed with all the guilelessness of the righteously innocent going all giddygiggly poppa kapitan alan kapitan alan lewrie spasiba thank you i meanink to say eudoxia repeated all but bouncing on her chaste toes is proper manners to say christian name and patronymic kapitan to speak to my poppa mister arslan artimovich yer servant sir lewrie said ummm durschenko responded not even looking down at lewries offered hand and making that ummm rise from deep in his chest like a bear awakened grumpy and deadly from his winter nap the fellows jaws flexed and worked from side to side as he ground his teeth very much lewrie thought like a slavering mastiff eager for his dinner you must be very proud of your daughter sir lewrie quickly extemporised striving for another of his shiteatin grins and his nighperfected smarm in her skill her poise and talent that is i came to offer my congratulations to her and evryone else dye see for a most enjoyable show which i hope my sailors will be able to see once we reach saint helena ah ha this aint workin lewrie nervously considered hah durschenko senior barked not buying that for a minute his live eye glared bullets but he did shift his whip to his other hand and unhanded that dagger to at last take lewries hand as if all was forgiven giving it a viselike squeeze so hard that lewrie felt his eyes were almost ready to water heh heh heh durschenko muttered with a feral toothy grin lewrie gave back as good as he got though clamping down with all the strength he had never try that on with a sailor arselick artimovich he thought nor a swordsman either ye old fart they stood there arms beginning to quiver fingers going numb and white shuffling closer to each other like two wrestlers looking for an opening to a sudden throw oh stoy eudoxia snapped in exasperation at last seizing them by the wrists to pull them apart stop that both of you the kapitan is nice man he mean no harm dont lay wagers on it lewrie thought wishing he could shake feeling back into his hand without anyone seeing him do it low bastard fine gentleman no difference eudoxia cried no matters i never meetink nobody that poppa do not oh tell me what is word she flustered looking to him for aid murder lewrie wryly supposed distrust he said instead da distrust spasiba kapitan lewrie eudoxia hotly agreed her eyes glinting as cold as the snowy steppes that had birthed her she turned to face her father and launched into a rapid gutturallygarbling bit of foreign argeybargey durschenko senior glowered scowled gawped and stamped a booted foot by turns leaning back and almost tittering at one point during her harsh tirade growling and barking like the aforesaid mastiff in the same lingo whenever he could get a word in which wasnt often other circus people including those smarmy clowns and mimes were drawn to their little domestic tiff and lewrie wondered if he could crawl away unnoticed for every now and then arslan artimovich would snap his head about to glower and snarl at lewrie and everyone in wigmores travelling extravanganza surely had seen him and eudoxia at loggerheads before perhaps lewrie dourly fantasised they had also seen durschenko lash an interloper away from his precious girl and were waiting with rising expectations of a good show perhaps even laying wagers on the outcome their business now not mine lewrie told himself giving up all hopes of sporting with the girl no matter how entrancing had a good hot freshwater bathe a fine meal and the circus was nice really just toddle off stand here and look foolish for a second lewrie wished he had thought to fetch his pennywhistle ashore with him or knew how to juggle the best he could do was manage a semidignified departure if that he sadly supposed there was no point in risking being fed to durschenkos lions at the worst or being whipped bloody at the best flirtatious and coquettish as eudoxia was as welcoming of his attenions there didnt seem to be a rosy future in it their palaver ended finally with a sideways cutting gesture on her fathers part which got his hand off the dagger and a nyet well ill take my leave lewrie said doffing his hat eudoxia goot girl ponyemayu durschenko rumbled deep in his chest keep goot me dosvidanya bolshoi kapitan goot bye understand completely sir lewrie replied sketching a bow to him evnin arslan artimovich good evnin mistress eudoxia hellishgood show he added making a finer leg to her we see you again at saint helena kapitan alan lewrie she responded in kind making a more graceful curtsy than he had suspected she knew how to perform dressing robes werent made for such though nyet from her father da she hotly retorted time t scamper lewrie thought feeling the need to employ his hat for a fan at the charms that curtsy had briefly revealed he left them still yammering away at each other slinking redfaced and feeling like the veriest perfect fool as he threaded his way through the circus folk he could not help looking back though when he attained the draperies to see the father leading eudoxia away by her elbow and she turned her head to watch him leave for one last sight of him she gave lewrie a largeish shrug as if to say well what can we do yet a second later began to grin her mercurial minxlike impishness returning she pursed her lips for a distant kiss well lewrie thought lustily stunned past dread or close to it anyway well well well well hmmm chapter fifteen to where might they run sir tobias capt graves of horatius asked with a weary note to his gravelly voice after listening to capt treghues expound on why he had decided not to allow shore liberty for their hands now that they were snugly anchored in jamess valley harbour at the east india company entrepot of st helena why aboard an east indiaman for the better pay sir treghues rejoined in his best tutors voice as if speaking to a student with all the tired patience required to get through a dull scholars skull most especially aboard a homebound indiaman so they may jump ship in england and desert their bounden duty to the navy all of which sir anchor here in jamess valley harbour for the very good reason that the only other possible anchorage where any ship of worth or deep draught may cometo is ruperts valley which is totally uninhabited for the very good reason that there is not a drop of fresh water to be had there sir capt graves belaboured in this anchorage sir tobias any seaman who takes leg bail could easily be restored to duty by the very simple task of enquiring of and going aboard to search any indiaman before it sails capt graves no kin to the influential royal navy graveses exhibited reasonably great patience himself and for a tarryhanded and direct sort of old salt phrased his rebuttal slowly borrowing a formal choice of words usually alien to his nature lewrie was pretty sure but a volcanic simmering was just below the surface then we could flog them blind as an example to the others capt philpott of hms stag added almost tongueincheek the island is thinly settled captain graves treghues said with a thinlipped aspersion all theyd have to do is scamper into the hills live off the land for a few weeks to wait us out then come down and sign aboard an indiaman the islands thinly settled sir capt graves quickly said for another very good reason compared to saint helena the scottish highlands are as lush as tahiti cant farm hills this steep except for this valley so theres nought to steal and eat every resident of this bleak rocks a member of the militia and bored to tears mostlike raise the hue and cry and theyd run em down in a dog watch and enjoy the adventure to boot sir then john company or the garrison of the forts gives them their floggings and holds them in gaol til the next warship arrives sir capt philpott stuck in again pity treghues snapped his head about to glare his displeasure at such a waggish comment but found philpotts phyz composed in a wideeyed benign expression which expression made lewrie hide a grin with his fist to his mouth and stifle a snort of amusement treghues swivelled about to bestow upon him an even sterner glare you said something cogent captain lewrie treghues snapped is there a notion you wished to contribute sir erm only that i am quite in agreement with captain graves and captain philpott sir tobias lewrie declared though ive not called here before it seems evident that theres nothing upon which a deserter might victual outside this little onestreet village and no place where any such might even find shelter no trees to cut down to make a crude leanto to get out of the incessant winds there are no beaches from which to fish with only four hundred or so soldiers in the garrison not over a thousand residents alltold unemployed tars would stick out like sore thumbs and be taken up rightpromptly a sailor intent to run would take any risk captain lewrie treghues countered with an impatient wave of his hand the fools though may i point out sir tobias capt philpott eagerly added to lewries remarks finding a willing ally that sailors who were not allowed ashore in england before our departure kept aboard at recife kept aboard here at saint helena possibly denied liberty ashore at cape town too might be more eager to desert than sailors given a slight bit of free time of leisure ashore of trust sir oh rot sir treghues sneered all but rolling his eyes in scorn your average english tar is a drunken ignorant and irksome lout whod sink into sloth crime and alcoholic stupors given the opportunity captain philpott without continual watchfulness without unending discipline to rein in their baser desires theyd run riot in a twinkling oh ill grant you there are some honest volunteers who look to improve themselves some men pressed under dubious legalities who come aboard imbued with sobriety and industriousness as a result of their former civilian employments but treghues waved away as if the situation was hopeless and would always be so hms grafton so they had all learned on their long voyage was a taut ship lewrie didnt remember treghues being quite so strict during the american revolution perhaps because old hms desperate had been a much smaller ship with a smaller more familiar crew he had always stated that a taut ship was a happy ship though how capt treghues translated that to his present crew was reputed to be harsher then again treghues had been younger and full of promise and hadnt spent so many years idling ashore on halfpay either nor had he wed such a dour termagant of such a bleakly forbidding nature but two whole days out of discipline since departing england sir tobias capt graves cautiously pressed gainst currents and winds to here as long a voyage as it took to fetch recife with perhaps better than a month more til we break passage at cape town assuming we even do liberty here at saint helena is the least we may do for them do they face the prospect of an unbroken voyage all the way to bombay to canton in china well compared to those ports liberty granted here is safest of all sir thats why there were two ships of the line in the escort once past cape town and madagascar in the indian ocean some of their trade would head for bombay some would bend their course for the strait of malacca and china with a twodecker for escort treghues would choose which duty hms horatius might perform which half hed escort onwards in grafton jack ass point and the foreign factors compound at canton sir lewrie said i have been there no risk of desertion there since the chinese lop the heads off redhaired foreign devils when they get into their part of the city i was not aware you took merchant service lewrie treghues interrupted sounding as if involvement with trade or its nautical assistance in a civilian capacity was rather sordid wasnt merchant service sir lewrie responded with a smile some secret work for the foreign office aboard a false trader armed and crewed by the navy bombay too sir well my experience was in calcutta up the hooghly but theres nowhere for english tars to run among the hindoos either not for long if they dont speak a word of the language sir ports in india might not be walled off from the local population like canton is but they might as well be for all the good theyd do potential deserters and as i recall it every ship that put in was allowed shore liberty liberal liberty sir if our handsll be allowed liberty at bombay and canton whats the harm in allowing liberty here where they have no hope of jumping ship sir for the very good reason sir that they will run amok as the barbarians of the malay peninsula say treghues snapped now rapidly losing his patient allknowingfather air on what may i ask sir tobias capt graves gravelled near the end of his seeming serenity too the very few public houses of jamess valley upon the veritable regiment of bawds now atiptoe on the strand awaiting their arrival with open arms sir capt treghues barked slamming a palm on his desk for punctuation you exceed proper bounds captain graves aye theres very few public houses or taverns hereabouts and should we allow our people ashore theyd be swamped by so many sailors all at once exactly what the publicans and tavern keepers look forward to id expect sir capt philpott blandly suggested howd they make their livings else the garrison and the locals cant be much of a livelihood sir and theres wigmores travelling extravaganza too lewrie quickly seconded theyve a decent band and do musicals comedies and dramas in addition to their circus performances sir all quite innocent no more harmful than letting discharged sailors free in covent garden or drury lane sir itd go hard for our people to know that theyre performing for the garrison but theyre not allowed to go ashore and attend sir might make em surly youre entirely right sir tobias capt graves was quick to exclaim scooting forward to the edge of his chair in his eagerness to make his point a taut hand and consistent disciplines the very thing to make an efficient ship but it can become too much of a good thing dye see do you not give them a bit of slack now and then if my hands must sit aboard close enough to see soldiers civilians and jonn company sailors going ashore to take in the shows it will make them surly as our good captain lewrie suggests sir even more eager tbe aboard an indiaman perhaps sir capt philpott tacked on sounding breezy and trying hard not to smirk at his impious suggestion never can tell lewrie wasnt sure which comment made treghues bristle up go pucefaced and bluster more gravess hint that strictness might prompt rebelliousness philpotts heretical idea or graves calling lewrie good aye that circus treghues seethed whacking good time you had ashore did you captain lewrie at that circus hmm damme what does he know and how did he learn it lewrie had to take pause to ask himself crossing his legs the other way round to guard his wedding tackle an amusing and innocent distraction sir tobias he replied half the audiences at recife were children and their parents and the local authorities seemed satisfied that nothing prurient or bawdy had insulted their rather austere sense of morality sir i enjoyed it too sir capt graves chimed in as did capt philpott a second later aye it was innocent and amusing and i suspect sir tobias that were our sailors seated in their audiences thatd be hours theyd not be spending in taverns or brothels half a days liberty watch and watch say noon to midnight a fresh dinner time enough for at least a mild drunk then a bought supper and a ticket to a show and by the time the final curtain comes down tis time to return aboard their ships hmm depends on local sunset full dark lewrie speculated when they light their illuminations i spose perhaps from seven bells o the forenoon til seven bells of the evening watchd work better the usual arrangement of two hostages still aboard for each libertyman their own run ashore dependent on tothers behaviour and return wouldnt have to expend rations do they debark before the rum issue or call to messes capt philpott slyly said he and graves had turned their attention upon each other to thrash out arrangements as if the decision had been made in their favour and captain treghues was no longer present and wouldnt our pussers love that hey mastersatarms ships corporals and provost guards from the garrison to keep a wary eye on em perhaps lewrie further suggested aye thatd work out well captain lewrie graves exclaimed turning to include treghues at last garrison troops toldoff as the provosts might attend the shows in an official capacity but could watch em in essence for free lewrie hooted an easy arrangement to make with the garrison commander id think sir tobias philpott chortled turning to face treghues with a puppyeyed eager childs expression waiting upon treghuess sayso as they all did with a please father may we please expectancy treghues stared them down as stonily as the egyptian sphinx lips downcurled as pruned up as if hed bitten into a sour citron his fingers drummed on the desktop nails chittering as if he wished to hone them for a clawing in the near future he heaved a great sigh and leaned back in his chair to stare at the overhead and the painted and lacquered deck beams perhaps he was consulting the almighty as to the best course of action praying a silent apology to him for being a weakling imploring the lord to keep his sinful sailors from too much exuberance ashore or calling down all the pharaohs plagues upon his contemporary moseses who pleaded to set their people free a third of each ships complement sailors and marines each day sirs he glumly sullenly announced at last twothirds will bide aboard dependent upon the libertymens behaviour and if those miscreants depart one jot or tittle from decorous comportment then i will cancel all further liberties hear me sirs very good sir they almost managed to say in chorus i will consult the tables to determine full dark hereabouts he further decreed does the circus require full dark for their performances as good captain lewrie is so certain that they require treghues could not help loftily sneering makes for a better experience sir like a darkened hall in drury lane draws the audience into the lit stage lewrie explained to him offhandedly or so i am told he added withering under that steely gaze do not interrupt sir treghues gravelled as i was saying perhaps an adjustment from six bells of the forenoon to six bells of the evening watch eleven to eleven would suit depending on what the tables say i will send you word by dusk in the meantime you will see to wood and water for your ships liberty is allowed from behind the deal partitions and privacy curtains leading to his sleeping space and quartergalleries came a faint outraged hmmph from lady treghues and for a moment lewrie wasnt sure if he didnt feel sorry for the poor fellow it was one thing to be talked out of a firm decision no matter how rigidly daft by officers junior to him but it was quite a rather grim other to have to beard that harridan in her den probably after making assurances to her that he would not allow sailors of his squadron access to sin they rose and made their parting salutes and treghues rather languidly perhaps even a tad weakly waved them on their way they had not quite attained the starboard gangway and entryport not even attained their own gigs or cutters before graftons crew began muttering and buzzing all atwitter with the glad news that theyd be going ashore even before it could be announced officially such was usual aboard ships though what was whispered aft in gunroom or greatcabins had a way of spreading before the masts by a nautical grapevine older than mythical jasons good ship argo by the time lewrie as the leastsenior officer had settled himself on a stern thwart in his gig with coxn andrews ready to order out oars and didnt he have a huge grin on his face too graftons people were beginning to cheer we re going to the circus lewrie could not help thinking like a beamish tyke we re going to the circus again hurrah chapter sixteen the circus yes lewrie saw every performanceperhaps hoping for an aerialist to fall and kill a clown or for arslan durschenkos lion to mistake his head for a chew toy at that climactic high point of his actdefinitely to savour eudoxias archery and horsewomanship pigeons to skewer were a bit thin on the ground on st helena but the seagulls used in their stead were equally delightful lewrie doubted there were more than a corporals guard standing watch on the ramparts of the cliffside forts guarding ruperts or jamess valley or manning the massive pounder guns in the mundens fort that dominated the main harbour for the audiences at every show were filled by redcoated soldiers even here on a bleak and remote outpost isle mr wigmore looked to be in the way of making a grand killing what with the garrison and the locals so eager for anything novel in their isolation with the addition of the thousands of east india company or royal navy sailors in portnot just the sailors from their convoy but an additional eight indiamen which had broken their passage after departing cape town and had been waiting for the arrival of warships to escort them to england along with the hundreds of passengers and john company officials there gathered wigmore made the most of it with the circus scheduled for the late mornings and taking just long enough to whet appetites and very dry throats by the time performances ended which pleased the taverns and inns to no end and the comedies or dramas staged just after the sun went down there wasnt all that much timber available on st helena so this time there were no tiers of shaky seats everyone had to sit on the ground or rocks catchascatchcan up the beginnings of a slope of a hill that framed the little onestreet company village much like the sketches that amateur artists brought back from their grand tours of the continent and the edifying sights of tumbledown ruins of ancient roman amphitheatres in the capitals of southern europe it wasnt grand theatre either not when the lead performers were still smarting from their circus acts of a few hours before and were mostly as amateurish as a cast of public school boys putting on a springtime lark just after their final examinations when at meaningful dramas they tended to overemote most portentously turning shakespearean classics into shouted declamations and lewrie could not recall any performances hed seen of othello the merchant of venice or the tempest done quite so energetically as if the entire cast was made up of very frenetic fleas or inmates of bedlam they were much better at comedies and musicals they did the beggars opera of course since everyone english highborn or low knew the tunes by heart knew the japes wordforword and could sway and sing along in nostalgia or shout heckle cheer or laugh a bit too early throwing the performers off their paces so thoroughly that that show had turned into a mugging contest two gentlemen of verona got completely plagiarised becoming a farce titled a day at the forum with many foot chases and slamming doors slave girls in skimpy gauze costumes and lusty but foolish roman lads who didnt know they were related then there was the sultans hareem loosely borrowed from the many horrid novels some running to eight volumes written about some plucky english girl kidnapped by corsairs and sold off to an ottoman turk fending off the old lechers advances quite cleverly if quite implausibly til rescued by the royal navy thatun featured skimpy costumes too perhaps the same ones worn earlier by the roman slave girls both farces were heavy on popular songs incorporated wherever they even slightly fitted into the plots the sultans hareem ending with rule brittania and didnt eudoxia look grand in barelyconcealing gauze since no clowns could throw buckets of confetti or water on him at the temporary theatre nor any mimes drag him out for their victim or laughingstock lewrie sat down front at the dramas and comedies with the other captains officers and east india company officialdom and their wives mistresses or doxies where he could get a good view of her charms eudoxia indeed didnt get many lines in the dramas but more than held her own in the comedies she was a slinkysultry egyptian slave girl in one a star bellydancer in the other doing much the same routine in both actually and would never be said to possess a fine singing voice but who cared lewrie certainly didnt for her natural nighexotic beauty her graceful longlimbed carriage as she made her paces across the extemporised stage and her innate impishness when delivering comic dialogue combined with the sombrely serious way she went at her nearlysalacious solo dances transfixed him into gapejawed and highly appreciative awe and just as she singled him out with her bow at the end of any circus act when the dramatis personae took their final bows lined up just before the footlights her eyes always found his her triumphant smile grew brightest and her last blown kisses and lowerings of her head were to him despite her father who always seemed to be just at the edge of the stage curtains or in the shadows of the circuss screening drapes also looking fixedly at lewrie and that furiously too with his teeth grinding themselves to peagravel and dust that was as close as he actually got to her in point of fact as close as any hopeful gentleman or lusty tar got to her either for just as soon as eudoxia exited the ring or the stage poppa durschenko was there by her side now sporting two daggers in his waist sash and bestowing upon one and all cautionary glares so black and menacing that they might have killed birds on the wing before taking her by the arm or elbow and hustling her behind the safety of the tents or drapes until their last night in port wigmore had staged a day at the forum again the bawdiest and funniest of his offerings that seemed to go down so best with sailors and soldiers most captains and officers had already seen it as had the local lights squirearchish passengers and officials but the audience was still fairly large most of it garbed in army red or in navy blue and lewrie had gotten himself a place in the very front on a low stool hed fetched off the ship no matter that the crowd that night were repeat attendees the farce went down even better than before knowing that this was their last performance before packing themselves and their scrims costumes and props aboard festival for a long boring voyage the actors played up even broader and bawdier altering dialogue and the ends of jokes to suit their less sophisticated but more loudlyappreciative crowd the music was louder and livelier even the songs leered or eyerolled more comically the pace of the foot chases and door slams even more frenzied and drawn out til people in the audience were nearly retching or choking they had laughed so hard could not even titter a jot more yet found something new over which to howl lewries own eyes were squinted tearfilled his sides ached the corners of his mouth nearly hurt and he had guffawed so forcibly that when he could draw a full breath his lungs felt as abused as if hed smoked the foulest spanish cigaro in all creation at last both noble families were reconciled the villains were confounded the longlost brothers reunited and the little blonde who played the first ingenue slave girl and eudoxia who played the sultry egyptian dancing girl slave were freed and espoused the entire cast gathered to sing the last song linked arminarm then took the final bows arslan artimovich durschenko slunk out to the edge of the thin curtain on one side of the stage ready to help haul it shut glaring at everyone and eudoxia did her last deep curtsy head inclined as grandly as a countess clad only in a peachy lame chemise a very sheer goldish sheet of gauze gathered to resemble a roman stola ankle bangles and whiteleather sandals as before after she had made acknowledging bows to leftrightandcentre of the audience blown kisses to the four winds and waved to those who shouted loudest from far in back higher up the slope her almond eyes and widest smile was for lewrie making him sit up straighter and squirm in lust no matter the danger lurking in the wings then eudoxia stepped to the edge of the stage as the rest dropped their linked hands to depart bounded lithely over the footlights from the low wood stage onto the stretch of ground separating the stage from the audience and with her most playful laugh landed in lewries lap arms about his neck and one lean slim leg extended towards the starry sky merciful god lewrie gawped beaming fit to bust with an arm about her waist well hallo there zdrasvutyeh english sailor boy eudoxia said with a laugh you comink here offeten one hand came up to stroke lewries cheek to steer his head then planted a broadlydrawn loud and wet kiss on his lips to his and the crowds amazement and delight woohoo sailors cheered jeered and whistled while her kiss turned from playful to fierce thats our ramcat for ye a sailor off proteus loudly hooted one who knew the sobriquet by which his captain was known in the royal navy and the reason for it which had nought to do with lewries choice of pets your papa is going to kill me lewrie carped stunned pleased but very worried as she gracefully rose to her feet and drew him erect with her draping her slim body against his her arms about his neck and fingers toying with the short tied queue atop his coat collar might even take his whip to you girl wed best then it be good you run away da she teased back whispering her lips half an inch from his and lewrie could not stop himself from running his hands up and down her back giving her a firmer squeeze so he could lift eudoxias toes off the ground marvelling at how sinewy how firm her body was compared to most womens yet how silkysmooth running away now he told her yet didnt now eyetoeye with him she grinned and bestowed on him another more serious enflaming kiss before leaning her head back and crying hah now is good time we both runnink he let her go thinking it a most sensible suggestion and she fled with a playful hop and a skip for the righthand side of the stage platform farthest from her papa though she did stop spin about and cry was much fun dosvidanya kapitan alan lewrie he stood staring after her like a greek hero whod caught too good a direct look at the hydra and been turned to stone he felt a need to gulp and did so a time or two he also felt a need to grope at his crutch to ease the sudden tightness of his breeches for surely no human could have a cockstand the size and hardness of a belayingpin but forebore given the audience about him and the fear that her father was still watching he shook himself back to reality bent down to pick up his hat and stool and saw the nowdrawn stage drapes nighchurning with a struggle behind them tot tarakan that cockroach he heard recognising arslan artimovichs raspy shrieks let go yob tvoyematl chort shit or damn doh god tot sikkim siyn that son of a bitch or whatever that meant in punctuation a long arm emerged through the curtains partings a hand at the end clutching a dagger with several other hands struggling to disarm him and lewrie determined that aye it would be a good time to bolt in a dignified manner o course though with some purposeful haste tot gryazni sabakathat dirty dog as he headed for the piers and his waiting gig taking longish strides he tried to recall what it was the london papers always said of a new play in drury lane or covent garden right that was it a most enjoyable time was had by all chapter seventeen first offcer sah the marine sentry without the door into the greatcabins cried thudding the brassbound butt of his musket on the deck enter lewrie bade interrupting his breakfast in the diningcoach and rising to his feet almost wincing with dread anticipation of what report lt langlie might make he had already gotten a letter from hms grafton even before his sailors had finished washing and stoning proteuss decks lt anthony langlie stepped through the door into lewries forward cabins twixt the diningcoach to larboard and the chartspace to starboard cocked hat under one arm and a rolledup set of papers in his free hand toulon and chalky who had been breakfasting on the fresh bacon bought ashore raised their tails and trickytrotted over from their dishes to greet him as was their usual wont for langlie was always good for a kind word and a skritch they were disappointed though for langlie paced right past them for a rare once to attend to the grim matter at hand coffee mister langlie lewrie offered dabbing at his mouth with a fresh napkin buttered toast and jam too perhaps ehm the coffeed be welcome sir thankee langlie said a frown upon his usuallyplacid and some said handsome features sit ye down then sir aspinall coffee for the first officer and a refill for me lewrie directed aspinall fetched a fresh cup and saucer his battered black pot and did the honours before at his captains firm nod retreating back into his tiny pantry abaft the chartspace well then mister langlie just how large a pack of sinners are we lewrie finally asked ehm langlie commented with a sigh unrolling his reports a total of twentytwo hands on report sir i comfort myself with the fact that proteus isnt the greatest offender but to paraphrase those americans with whom we cooperated in the caribbean mister langlie lewrie stuck in with a scowl when the captain aint comforted aint nobody comforted hmm ive already had a note from captain treghues on the matter tell it me aye sir ahh langlie sadly replied after one sip from his sugared and goatmilked cup of coffee he referred to his papers first off i suppose there was the zebra race though that mister wigmores made no formal complaint about the ah borrowing of his beasts or the condition in which they were returned it did draw an undue amount of attention though sir so couldve been worse mister langlie lewrie opined might have been camels not the camels put them right off sir langlie told him all that biting bawling and spitting green goo in point of fact one could hold wigmore partially at fault for allowing our black hands to mount them at all some of their liberated jamaican blacks landsmen or ordinary seamen had been allowed to view the circuss menagerie in their pens down by the piers where theyd been kept after the last circus performance prior to reloading aboard festival god knows why but they had also been allowed to mount the socalled zebras and on a drunk lark had decided to race them bareback all the way uphill through the town to the last tavern at the head of the valley the loser to pay for all they had been highly displeased to find that the zebras were only tartedup donkeys whose cosmetics stained their cleanest shoregoing uniforms equally displeasing was their discovery that having been born black african they had no more innate zebramanship skills than your runofthemill drunken tar the race had been a shambling shorttacking disaster and once at the distant tavern they had taken a peevish load of ale aboard themselves and gotten the donkeys drunk into the bargain the garrisons provost guard had fetched them hood howe bass whitbread and groome and the donkeys home giving the men hell for cocking a snook at them and giving the provosts false and highly improbable names and whats this about stolen azaleas roses and a tree lewrie asked referring to treghuess note by his plate well that was mostly our irish hands doing sir langlie informed him with a grunt of obvious distress furfy desmond some of the other lads once i got them back from the provosts and a bit sobered up their explanation was that theyd heard sailors off those homebound indiamen talking about how profitable is the importation of exotic foreign shrubs and they thought that it might be a twoway trade make a bit on the side sir there was also some talk about emulating breadfruit bligh the saplings not the mutinous part and they wished to do a bit of gardening sir spruce proteus up were they of a mind tplant em in the water tubs between the damned guns mister langlie lewrie gawped or would just anyold where suit ehm i gather theyd have gone either side of both entryports the quarterdeck and focsle ladderways and your door sir decorative doorstoop flowers langlie lamely confessed but the island governors wife s roses and azaleas mister langlie lewrie exclaimed referring again to treghuess damned note the bloody tree from right outside the governors courtyard ahern was especially covetous of the roses sir lt langlie morosely commented hed been up all night from the first alert hed gotten from the garrisons officer of the guard and was by now much the worse for wear his old grannie was a herbalist healer or so he says and highly recommended rose hips for those feeling poorly the ah argument over which ship got the roses and such never really did get to an outright brawl though hundreds of sailors were involved not just our proteuses sir men off grafton horatius and navy tars off the homebound escort ships were actually the greatest offenders or so i heard from the other first lieutenants once we were all summoned to the mundens fort at dawn sir once there we compared notes held a little guild meeting as it were the tree mister langlie lewrie pressed the tree aye sir langlie said with a putupon sigh furfy clapped eyes on it and swore it was the very sort of tree that stood just outside his childhood croft back in ireland sir and and was it lewrie asked most dubiously i rather doubt it sir langlie replied with a brief grin on his phyz it was a twentyfoot chinese magnolia furfy said though that itd look grand forrud of the roundhouse give shelter and shade for hands at the beakhead rails and the seats of ease it required hundreds of sailors to uproot it and bear it back to the piers sir where they discovered that it wouldnt go in even the largest cutter without swamping it so they did return it and tried to replant it sort of sir thats when the garrison mustered a company of infantry mine arse on a bandbox lewrie attempted to growl picturing it in his minds eye the only scene he could conjure up was a horde of tars dancing and weaving ribbons round a mobile may pole he used his napkin to conceal his snicker well was it returned and mostly replanted it wasnt rightly stealing was it mister langlie he hopefully asked under english common law the theft of anything worth more than a guinea would earn the perpetratorin this case perpetratorsa hanging there were urchins in london whod met captain swing or been transported for life for the theft of a loaf of bread or silk pocket handkerchief the governorgeneral and his wife might be that wroth he told himself sir tobiasbloody treghues for certain if they re not i gathered saint helena s governor has seen a deal worse sir langlie told him though he may be a long time forgetting this one i was informed hed only press for monetary damages though that may be subject to change the shrubs suffered no permanent harm though that magnolia tree may be ruined tis a shallowrooted thing and there wasnt a single blossom or leaf left on it when it was returned the spoils of war victory laurels i suppose the mob thought sir there is also mention of a chinese lap dog missing a pug something or other very dear to the governors wife all ships are to be searched for it not aboard proteus thank god lewrie sighed for a search had already been made now what about this low brawl he asked as both his cats eager for attention from two such affable people chose a lap or the table top chalky to langlies lap where he rolled over onto his back and wriggled for pets or play all four feet pawing air and trilling shutmouthed for amusement toulon sniffed about the edge of lewries breakfast plate first then flopped on his side just out of easy reach with his thick tail thumping the table and his own paws rabbited against his chest issuing louder more insistent mmrrs now that wasnt our lads doing sir langlie objected in an insulted manner hands off adamant objected to sailors off any ship drinking in their private tavern one of the homebound twodeckers she is sir the greatest offenders as i earlier said the tavern in question is the one nearest the piers and too convenient to be the sole property of one ship so the last hours of liberty our lads popped in for a last pint or two the adamants took exception to not only our lads but any navy sailors they didnt recognise and especially to our black hands and fell on our people well sir the rest of our tars werent having any of that neither were our marines sir lt langlie further explained just before it got completely out of hand mister neale the masteratarms and his party turned up mustered petty officers off every ship and broke it up the publicans damage claims are rather piddling nineteen pounds ten shillings five pence lewrie muttered grossly inflated or not tis not exactly piddling as you see it mister langlie not being in a position to negotiate itll be up to me to make quick restitution before we sail on tomorrows tide does the wind suit thatll be above and beyond the sum for damages asked for the damned tree and shrubbery and a deep bite out of my purse and ready funds in recompense for which ill expect the gunroom and the cockpit and every man jack cited in your reports to whip out chink just imagine what your share o thatll be mister langlie before you call it piddling aye sir sorry langlie muttered hangdog and meek for all those reasons mister langlie captain treghues is now utterly convinced of our entire squadrons irredeemable depravity in general and proteus filled with satans spawn in the specific we have to quote that worthy directly lewrie sarcastically said referring to the note smutted the good name of the royal navy cast a stain upon the repute of every ship involved and by your libidinous and drunken conduct besmirched mine own escutcheon with admiralty to wit mister langlie weve shat on his copybook and will now have to pay the piper how so sir langlie was forced to enquire frowning more the usual practice is to escort john company trades beyond saint helena or cape town with a pair of seventyfours perhaps with a seventyfour and a single frigate depending on how strong the french squadrons out of reunion and mauritius are reputed to be lewrie said with what might uncharitably be deemed a groan now though captain treghues is of a mind that only a long depriving sea voyage a total ban on even shipboard liberty and lashings of discipline will restore the ships of this squadron to the paths of the righteous and there was no pun intended of course he left out the juicy part wherein treghues had taken him personally to task for associating with a nighnaked circus person and actress a lilith a jezebel a corrupting delilah what was he a captain of less than three years seniority even so a commission sea officer of their king and supposedly a married man and the father of three innocent babes doing in company with such a jade and cavorting so publicly before common seamen to boot to the detriment of sailors morals the dignity of officers and respect for english gentlemen and et cetera and et cetera so captain treghues may deem it seemly for us to sail further than we expected sir langlie asked twigging to the meat of the affair at once damme sir we knew we stood a good chance of going as far as the cape of good hope but now it appears were down for bombay or all the way to canton in china aye lewrie sourly mused idly fluffing his fingers through toulon s belly fur but sir such a long voyage with no additional break in our passage and without even shipboard liberty much less shore liberty is the very thing that dispirited the crews of the homebound warships lt langlie protested theyd not have run riot here had they been given a chance to carouse at cape town ill grant you the point mister langlie lewrie said with a sigh as he shifted in his chair now assuming captain treghues allows us even a whiff of land at the cape and its all wooding and watering and no liberty at all at least mister coote the purser and officers will be let ashore do we indeed sail cross the indian ocean wed best hunt the settlements over for some handy phrase books in chinese and hindoo that or kidnap likely lascar or asian translators ehm dont you own some hindoo sir langlie asked and i believe i heard that you had been to canton tween the wars my hindoo is barely good enough to order drinks and supper lewrie sourly admitted and as far as chinee goes i doubt i knew a halfdozen people who had a handle on it was dingdongdell a real chinese phrase itd mean twelve diffrent things depending on which syllable or syllables got sung higher than the rest we may be in need of a translator a social guide and damned if the navys going to repay us for his hire well were still a few hands short sir langlie suggested almost tongueincheek perhaps we could hire them on as landsmen to perform two tasks in that case the navy would pay us for them much like our ehmm the first officer bit off the rest blushing like our black sailors hah lewrie thought silently completing langlies slip of the tongue for him and wouldnt that make this ship an allnations as varied as a dram shop kidnap a few and the rest come easier well well see once we attain the cape lewrie said which will depend on captain treghuess mood at that moment before we sail tomorrow though mister langlie youd best alert the purser bosun and your fellow officers warrants and midshipmen that we may be in for a lean spell any needs or comforts they presently lack they had best make good here aye aye sir i will hold captains mast tomorrows forenoon once were at sea lewrie further announced my respects to mister pendarves the bosun and hes to make up a round dozen catoninetails and the red baize bags for em aye sir langlie numbly agreed though with one brow cocked in surprise at such an order for lewrie had never in his association with him been much of a flogging tartar nor proteus been known as a whippin ship captain treghues our putative commodore has ordered me to administer punishment for our malefactors lewrie said condign punishment for all involved he wrote can he do that sir langlie uneasily asked just order not strictly under the articles of war no mister langlie lewrie replied with a chuckle and a wink the drunkness happened on shore as did the brawling and such on liberty and not aboard ship where they would fall under the strictures of lineofduty discipline what individual captains may make of civil infractions not admiralty infractions is up to them and any interference from outside the hull even from a senior officer commanding would be looked upon as a violation of captains traditional and jealously protected prerogatives make up the cats anyway lewrie further said looking all slyboots at his perpetually putupon first officer the sight of em will put the fear o god in our people let em stew on what they might receive what i might do a day or two and they just may have a fresh think on what grand larks they think they had this time which might make em think twice the next time i let em off the leash oh i see sir you oww you little langlie exclaimed first in mirth then in pain looking down in his lap at chalky the cat had delighted in having his belly and chest rubbed and gently tickled but evidently had desired more energetic amusements and had nipped unwary fingers to initiate a wee romp chalky stuck up his head over the edge of the table ears halfflat and a mischievious cast to his eyes as he scrambled to his feet tail whicking impishly chalky lewrie chid him in a gentlyscolding tone gaining his attention we do not bite commission officers no we dont not even midshipmen no matter how distracted and vulnerable they be hmm bleeding overly much mister langlie skin not even broken sir langlie chuckled give me your list of incorrigibles then mister langlie was there anything else you wished to discuss anything pleasant to tell me to lighten my gloom well were still afloat sir langlie said with a wider grin that about covers it on your way then mister langlie lewrie bade him watching as he finished his coffee and rose from the table depositing chalky on it who immediately bounded to hurl himself on toulon who might be more up for play louder with a meaningful glance upwards at the open skylight windows in his coachtop where sailors of the afterguard and the quarterdeck harbour watch could always be trusted to eavesdrop for a clue to future developments lewrie concluded his remarks to langlie with and dont forget to tell the bosun to make up those damn whips chapter eighteen long though the voyage had been so far it was roughly two thousand miles as the squarerigger tacks from st helena to the cape of good hope and the first day onpassage had only logged the trade steered somewhere between souwest by south did the trade winds allow and souwest if they did not threemasted squarerigged ships could only get within six points up to the wind even when sailing full and by closehauled the middle of the second day however brought dark cloudheads that swathed the horizon from the eastnoreast all the way down to the soueast and with them a backing rising and much brisker breeze a soldiers wind that gave the convoy and its escorts a welcome lift to sail souwest in search of the perpetual easterlies for their ride to the cape would have added more nautical miles to their passage and would force them down into the vast swirling heart of the southern atlantic where the great currents that circled counterclockwiseabout between south america and africa became weak confused or nonexistent where the counterclockwise winds that could sweep a vessel south along portuguese brazil and the southernmost spanish colonies or batter them on the nose in their guise of the soueast trades faded away becoming an area larger than north america where ships could chase zephyrs weeks on end the doldrums the usual course from st helena to the cape was one large zeeshaped detour as the winds came most unexpectedly easterly though with rains and high seas for accompaniment notwithstanding those soldiers winds were looked upon as a blessing a raree that perhaps would never be encountered again in an entire life at sea and one to take advantage of the trade turned their bows due south cutting off the souwest zee almost before it began they reefed down or completely took in their royals and tgallants but left their topsls courses staysls spankers and jibs fullbellied with wind to sprint southward even the most hidebound passengercoddling indiamen masters and reeled off an average of seven or eight knots for nearly two whole days and a fair portion of a third before the skies cleared the seas moderated and the wind shifted back into the soueast so rare was it that even after full dark they pressed on rocking scending and heaving over a whitespumed ocean under full sail for not a capfull of that precious wind could be let go to waste even festival that cranky old jade got a way on and looked almost lively as she bowled along at the rear of the convoy with as much of her gaudybutfaded particoloured and patched canvas bellied out taut and straining it pleased everyone even capt sir tobias treghues bart for brisk winds and high seas precluded any more of that scandalous traffick tween ships most especially to festival which he had referred to as that demned hoorship it ended the baresteerageway crawl of the nights which was always pleasing to one who deemed himself a seasoned salt and tarpaulin man and lewrie happily considered the weather had reduced the necessity for treghues to speak facetoface with those fractious nighrebellious captains of the other ships in his squadron to virtually nil which lewrie also deemed a blessing of another kind from his point of view and he was mortalcertain that capts graves and philpott felt much the same for condign punishment for those who had misbehaved had been interpreted more leniently than treghues might have wished or exacted aboard hms graftons malefactors for the most part lewrie had awarded more subtly grievous punishments five days biscuit and water for rations denied their hearty morning burgoo sugar and butter their duffs cheeses pease puddings or portable soups with the eightman messes temporarily shifted so that all twentytwo offenders ate together and could not beg or borrow even a morsel from their usual messmates who might not have run amok what had drawn the most groans though had been his decree that for an equal five days none of the those twentytwo sailors would have leave to smoke or chew tobacco or purchase or borrow from the purser or their shipmates and horror of horrors for five days those men would get no rum issue either no sippers or gulpers presently due for past favours and none to be snuck off innocent mates for a present or future duty or favour pledged during their time in hell those cats hed had mr pendarves make up had mostly been put away in the bosuns locker and only three had actually been let out of the bag to use on landsman humphries and ordinary seamen grainger and sugden who had been witnessed striking petty officers mastersatarms or ships corporals from other ships at the tavern brawl as the roving shore parties broke the melee up or for being so drunk they had tried to fight their own petty officers as they were brought aboard a dozen lashes apiece bound to the upright hatchgratings the minimum since those were their first offences enough lewrie hoped to drive the message home so they would not be disputatious with their seniors the next time but not enough to make it seem vindictive and ruin the mens morale or loyalty to what had been til then a fairly happy ship who they fought ashore on their next rare dryland liberty he could really care less under graftons lee to shout across a verbal report lewrie had taken sly advantage of treghuess lust for strictness by declaring his intent to work the devil out of his hands as well with which at that moment capt treghues could form no dissenting opinion that resulted in holding the gundrills that treghues had earlier peevishly curtailed the light pounder chaseguns fore and aft the carronades and the long pounder greatguns were manned runin and loaded runout to the port sills levered about to aim elevated by use of the quoins below the breeches then fired in dry drills first then actually lit off for real later once the rust had been scaled off his hands for with so much fairly peaceful passagemaking of late and more time spent in various harbours thered been little reason or opportunity to keep his gunners from turning slack he and his officers began at the very basics as if introducing newcomes to their duties stressing safety caution with their dangerous charges and attention to duties lewrie who had fallen in lifelong lust for artillery as a most angrytobethere midshipman in his early days the winter of on his first ship finding in the power of the guns the one perhaps the only joy a displaced dandy as good as pressganged by his own father for his own damned lust for soontobeinherited funds relished in an ordeal that had seemed at the time as miserable a drudgery as a long prison sentence he had therefore high standards higher even than those of the experienced officers who had taught him navy gunnery lewrie was disturbingly surprised by just how rusty his men had gotten but promised himself that by the time they reached the cape he would have them back up to scratch even reacquainting them with the rarely used light swivelguns and pounder brass boatguns to be mounted in the bows of the gig cutter and launch oh theyll come up to par soon enough lt adair their scot third officer cheerfully opined swiping a hand through goatcurly and dark brown hair as he raised his hat to air out his scalp in the rain and the warmlymoist greensmelling winds that blew from the faroff shores of africa par dye say lt catterall the second officer scoffed whatever the devils that some gaelic word parbroiled makes some sense participate parfy but half a real word mister adair it is a golf term mister catterall adair impishly replied and what the devils golf catterall hooted in his bearishly burly way once more yeve lost me sir tis a game we play at home mister catterall and great fun actually lt adair explained a game which requires great patience and skill well perhaps it might be lost on englishmen sir he said with a twinkle then adair proceeded to describe golf to himtediously and minutely mean tsay lt catterall querulously asked minutes later you take yer mashie with a whuppy shaft and whack a sma leatherbound rock that never did harm to anybody cross yer braes rain fog cold or snow no matter til it lands in a rabbit hole then do it all over again why i never heard the like is there a prize in it does the rabbit keep the rock or do ye haul the rabbit out of its hole take it home and jug it for yer reward sounds daft tme but i spose tis amusing to scots who have so few amusements par means average for getting there mister catterall lt adair said biting off an exasperated sigh as he usually had to do in dealing with sassenach heathen englismen in general or the sardonic lt catterall in particular the number of whacks necessary then less than yer par is doing worse catterall chuckled better mister catterall adair insisted with a slight edge to his voice he knew catteralls cynical humours knew he was being twitted but never could help himself the fewest strokes win a well thats arseyvarsey then catterall snickered over average is worse under average is best and someone actually keeps a score of it then par will never do gentlemen lewrie commented after listening with amusement to their typical bantering from his post by the windward bulwarks ill not be satisfied with average gunnery not after our experiences in the caribbean ill settle for two shots per gun every three minutes but id rather we get off three in that time in the early minutes of engagement at any rate when the hands are not fatigued and wellaimed twixt wind and water remember what that american captain from georgia said the captain aint happy aint nobody happy sir lt adair piped up with a laugh to which in lieu of a hearty amen or here here for a second catterall added one of lewries patented piratical arrs which hed become quite good at imitating i fear i must stand more aloof to you gentlemen lewrie said as he tucked his hands into the small of his back and peered back up to weather no more dining some of you in he pointedly commented over his shoulder some seem to have come to know me and my ways simply too well alas and mister catterall and the surgeon were to dine with me this very night on fresh beef too what a pity he swivelled about to face them quite enjoying the smirk upon adairs phyz and catteralls strangled expression with a droll grin and an energetic clap of his hands he announced once gundrill the rum issue and noon mess is done sirs he said i think we should strike topmasts then rerig them should the winds abate just to see how quickly the evolution can be performed rusty as we seem tbe hmm then with the wind abeam and sailing mostly on an even keel i will also have the hands work off excess energy by going aloft waisters idlers and all along with the topmen larboard division gainst starboard division aye sir up and over from the windward foremast shrouds to the fighting top then down to the lee gangway up the lee main shrouds and down to the larboard gangway then up and over the mizenmast encouraged and led by their officers o course mister langlie and i shall observe and time it lewrie continued with a smirk of his own much like the irish whore instructed up down up down up down repeat if necessary winning division gets extra grog on completion of their dog watch the fortuitous winds abated at last shifting back to soueast forcing the trade to steer wider to the souwest but they had logged nearly six hundred nautical miles mostly at due south more than a quarter of the total passage placing the convoy and its escorts more easterly to africa and even sailing six points off the wind they would only skirt the edge of the doldrums not get becalmed in it for a much shorter time the trades and the equatorial current that flowed the same direction in concert with each other would impede them then though the soueast trade might still rule an eastwardrowing current that girded the southern rim of the doldrums parent to the one they now fought would kiss them on their starboard lee bows to counter the leeway lost to the winds a few slogging degrees more of latitude and the winds would shift to out of the west in concert with that current and theyd all be be there and so it was one midafternoon in march that hms stag far ahead of the convoy hoisted a string of signal flags in the private code that capt treghues had invented that read landfour pointslarboard bow table mountain thatd be mostlike sir the sailing master mr winwood carefully opined visible from seaward on a clear day as far as fifteen leagues or so my book of pilotage tells us almost over lewrie quietly exulted this part at least well not enter harbour tonight sir beg pardon winwood said id expect well stand offandon til morning so we may be able to spot the rocks and such a poor set of anchorages even so sir this table bay or simons bay bad holding ground the both of them both subject to sudden and contrary afternoon clearweather gales it says cape town or simons town lewrie said with a shrug of resignation with any luck well not be in either very long sir in point of fact twill require a great deal of luck should we come to anchor at all the ah results of our sailors deeds at saint helena i should think captain winwood ever the sombre christian whispered exactly so mister winwood lewrie agreed theres odds we might just sail right on by do captain treghues and captain cowles as commodore of the indiamen concur might be just as well sir winwood commented though with a slightly disappointed sigh ive never really been ashore here the tavern of the seas mister winwood lewrie told him with a chuckle an infamous sink of sin no matter the stiffness of the protestant dutch even so though sir winwood said most wistfully i wonder if they have cornwhisky lewrie wondered aloud chapter nineteen it was a rather abstemious little gathering for supper in the greatcabins the sailing master mr winwood who never drank much at all seated to his right lt devereux in charge of proteuss marine detachment to his left and for a seasoldier never known as one who overindulged in tipple and his three midshipmen mr gamble the older mr grace and wee mr larkin at the tables foot as the vice all of whom were so daunted by mr winwood who was the midshipmens tutor in matters navigational and mathematical and by dread of making a fool of themselves by taking too much aboard mr winwoods grave mournful scowl when his sense of primness was offended could make the middies scurry like cockroaches lt blase devereux was a languidly elegant sort whose gentlemanly mannerisms they wished to emulate anyway and the captain was well the captain not a man to disappoint if they wished to stay in his good books once capt treghues had signalled that the trade would indeed stand offandon the coast til dawn they had sailed legs north and south abeam the wind with the indiamen back to their usual custom of reducing sail to bare steerageway which had let the avid fishermen in the crew dip a line ending in the catch of a middlingsized tunny which had been shared between the gunroom and the captains table they had had reconstituted portable soup a seapie made from shredded saltbeef and saltpork diced potatoes fried with bacon and the tunny for the last course great slabs of it dredged in flour and crumbled biscuit spices and lemon then fried in oil there had been a decent claret with the seapie and an experimental white wine bought off a homebound indiaman one of the first things the dutch settlers at the cape had planted was vineyards though with mixed results so far the white had gone well with the fish though not as smooth or sweet as a german hock but miles better than the navyissued miss taylor the thin vinegary and acidy wine that could double for paint thinner and lewrie was intrigued enough to think of buying more once at anchor there had also been the promise of an apple stackcake to come a dessert that his wife caroline had brought from her native cape fear in north carolina shrivelled and wrinkly older kentish apples that had not gone over or been wormed pulped and boiled with dollops of molasses and sugar then spread thick between several layers of pancakes once the tablecloth would be removed there would have been a tray of bought sweet biscuits nuts and port midshipman larkin to propose the kings toast mr winwood to make one to the navy and as it was a saturday evening it would have fallen to lewrie to propose a traditional navy toast to our wives and sweethearts may they never meet which lewrie found excrutiatingly apt but just as aspinall was lifting the cloth cover from the cake the marine sentry slammed his musket butt on the deck outside with a strident rather urgent cry of second off cah sah enter mister catterall lewrie bade cocking a brow over lt catteralls exquisite timing imagining that the second lieutenant who had the appetite of all three midshipmen together had thought to wangle himself a hefty slice of cake or at least a free cup of coffee signal rockets from the convoy sir lt catterall announced though his usually saturnine demeanour much agitated fusees and an alert gun from horatius as well pipe all hands mister catterall and beat to quarters at once lewrie snapped rising and tossing his napkin into his plate sorry bout the cake gentlemen but it appears there may be frogs in the offing your posts shoo scat younkers as they quickly rose and tumbled out without ceremony lewrie went aft for his baldric and hangersword looking about for aspinall and his coxn andrews andrews do you fetch up my pair of pistols soon as you can aspinall save the cake if thats possible then see yourself and the cats to the orlop with the carpenters crew in a twinkling sailors would rush to man the pounders mounted rightaft in lewries cabins knock down the deal partitions and bundle fragile furniture sure to be turned into deadly flying splinters in battle below one last snatch off a rack in the chartspace for his cocked hat and he was off himself out onto the main deck and up the windward ladderway to the quarterdeck amid the mad but welldrilled bustle of sailors clearing their ship for action offwatch men rushed up with the long sausages of their hammocks and bedding perhaps not rolled as tightly as they would each morning to pass through the ringmeasure to stow them in the iron stanchions and nettings to turn them into a feeble defence against grapeshot splinters and musket fire where away lewrie demanded grabbing a spare nightglass by the binnacle cabinet the marine drummer was beating the long roll bosuns calls were peeping hundreds of feet shod or bare thundered on oak decks and proteus nighshuddered to the sounds of loose items seachests and stools being rushed to the orlop or holds messtables being hoisted to the overheads on the gundeck of guntools removed from their overhead racks starboard side of the convoy sir lt langlie breathlessly reported in the dark he and the other officers and warrants had come in a rush from their own suppers lieutenant catterall reported that hed seen a rocket and fusee from stag then heard the night signal gun board horatius before he summoned you ah theres another one indiaman then a second astern of her at the forward end of the starboardmost of two columns both were now burning blue warning fusees high aloft and launching amber rockets from their swivelguns lewrie lifted the nightglass to his right eye straining ahead and to starboard the convoy was at present bound south about twenty miles off the shore a dark coast lit only by a single feeble bonfire atop either the lions rump or green point near the entrance to table bay high enough above the sea to still be somewhat visible they had nearly sailed that seamark below the horizon and within the hour had need to come about and plod north but for this lewrie picked out ships by their large taffrail lanthorns hms horatius far ahead and now sporting a blue fusee at her maintop and four indiamen astern of her the threatened pair that sailed on the starboard flank also lit up with the bright blue pinpoint lights on their mastheads they were turning away to larboard pairs of stern lanthorns pinching together and the vaguest hints of canvas growing like spectral spooks in the faint starlight and what was thrown by a mere sliver of moon farther out lay captain philpotts hms stag a black smear of hull a pair of taffrail lights and her upper sails visible by the burning fusee at her mainmast tip damn this bloody thing lewrie furiously thought cursing the night telescope for its series of lenses was one short to allow more light into the tube making everything appear backwards and upside down with the glass stag was headed north without she was headed south foreshortening as she turned up into the west wind to face something hms horatius was also turning sousouwest as close as she could lie to those winds unless she tacked and came about cant make out a bloody thing lewrie griped aloud lowering the telescope and rubbing his offending eye theres something up to the west of them but damned if i can spot it any word from grafton none sir langlie was forced to say same flares as us well of course lewrie said with a frustrated sigh captain treghues possessed the customary navy signals book as well as the one of his own devising but both of them were based on the precondition of daylight nighttime signals could alert the merchantmen and warships to threat but could not convey any tactical orders as to which action they might take together it was up to each captains judgement as to how he might respond from his own scattered position at one of the convoys four corners here on the larboard and landward flank of the dark ships it was up to lewrie alone how best to act now the nearhand columns hauling their wind sir langlie pointed out with his naked eyes lewrie took note of the two nearest indiamens lights their hulls were beginning to occlude the starboard lanthorns the blue masthead fusees swinging almost atop their glowing larboard taffrail lights were going tget trampled are we not careful lewrie griped shake out the reefs in courses and topsls mister langlie and get a way on so we pass ahead of those tubs aye aye sir topmen topmen aloft trice up and lay out greatguns manned loaded and ready sir lt catterall said from the foot of the quarterdeck ladder the ship is in all respects prepared for action the gundeck forward and below lewries post amidships by those freshly hammockstiffened quarterdeck nettings was dimly lit for night action a wellspaced row of battle lanthorns marched down each beam thicklyglassed and made of heavy metal so gun crews could have just enough illumination to see to their duties robust enough to resist a spill of the candle flames inside them and create a fatal fire or an explosion of a serge powder cartridge after it had been removed from its wood or leather carrying sleeve beside them tiny red fireflies glowed between the glossy blackpainted artillery smouldering ends of slowmatch coils wrapped round the tops of the swabwater tubs by each piece the lastresort means of igniting the priming quills full of the finest mealed gunpowder should the flint in more modern flintlock strikers break or fail far up forward there were another pair of small lights by the forecastle belfry normally used by the sleepy ships boys whose duty it was to keep track of the halfhour and hour glasses turn them and ring the bells of the watch charge both batteries mister catterall lewrie ordered we dont wish to be taken by surprise open the ports and run the guns into battery both sides just in case aye aye sir a quick look astern satisfied him that the convoy was turning alee all of them earlier than scheduled a quarterhour longer and they would have been alerted by grafton to ready about and at the proper night signala fusee at the end of each foremast royal yardwould have hauled their wind and worn off the wind as much as one might be expected from civilian shipmasters now they were wearing individually the most threatened bearing down on the larboard ships startling them to haul off and fall alee like stampeding sheep order lost and if this turned out to be nothing theyd be half the following day rounding them back up both the nearhand merchantmen seem to be bearing astern of us sir lt langlie announced with the faintest bit of relief apparent in his voice should we be going about as well captain ive a mind to let em fall far enough astern then tack and see what aid we may give stag and horatius lewrie decided looking forward and to starboard again noting where capt gravess lumbering twodecker had gotten to in the meantime a moment mister langlie the threat seemed to be from seaward but on such an ebony night nothing could be taken for granted the french squadrons that haunted the cape passage and the indian ocean were rumoured to be at least two large gun or gun frigates operating separately but paired with one possibly two corvettes apiece threemasted fullrigged equivalent to sloops of war in the royal navy armed with a battery ranging from to guns and sometimes sailing in concert with wellarmed overmanned privateers as well such a pack could prowl like wolvessea wolves and like wolves lewrie realised with his wary bone wakening could attack from all quarters not just the one dashing in to nip or intimidate til their quarry was encircled and doomed mister winwood lewrie called over his shoulder aye sir here the sailing master reported coming to join him from his usual post before the binnacle cabinet and double helm weve a goodly way on sufficient for a quick clean wear so i would adjudge it sir aye winwood ponderously answered and no reefs rocks or shoals to loord not for at least sixteen or seventeen miles no sir winwood was forced to avow after a wince and a toothsucking noise obviously much more comfortable with such a statement after a long perusal over his charts a set of fresh star sights taking the height of the moon by backstaff and auguring the entrails of the odd passing gull very well sir well come about lewrie announced mister catterall check tackle and be ready for a wear mister langlie i wish hands to stations ready to come about to larboard then steer a course noreasterly aye aye sir bosun pipe stations for wearing ship lewrie paced to the leeward bulwarks to study the ocean where they meant to go as the fresh bustle broke out round his ears with the heavy nightglass to his eye once more he saw greyblack sea and a few whiteflecked rollers that now and again caught the faint glim of the waning moon a complete pall of utter blackness that showed the veriest upper tier of faroff african cliffs thin on the horizon a complete sweep from due south to due north showed nothing else up mainsl and spanker clear away the after bowlines brace in the afteryards up helm langlie was bawling through his speakingtrumpet and proteus began to swing to heel over as she slowed bowsprit and jibboom sweeping alee across the black face of the night the winds dead aft now clear away head bowlines lay the headyards square shift over the head sheets lewrie walked over to the starboard side with his telescope looking into the stern quarter and abeam as proteus continued to swing the wind now striking her on her larboard quarters man the main tack and sheet clear away rigging spanker outhaul clear away the brails there seemed to be nothing dangerous to landward lewrie eased his straining eye by lowering the nightglass for a second as sudden gunfire rolled down on them from windward he spun about to catch the ruddy afterflash from gun muzzles the brieflylit spurts of whitishgrey smoke from some ships pieces and the pyrotechnic spiralling yellowish embers from cartridge cloth distant as that gunfire was his ears could discern the deep boomings of pounders of horatiuss lowerdeck artillery the crisper barks of what he took to be hms stags pounders and some light terrierlike yaps from even lighter guns missing all the fun he heard midshipman grace whisper in the relative silence once those distant guns fell silent brace up headyards overhaul weather lifts haul aboard lt langlie bellowed as the ship came rapidly back to early abeam of the winds mister catterall lewrie called down in the tumult man the starboard battery excess hands to chock trucks and snug the runout tackles then rejoin their mates aye aye sir steady out bowlines haul taut the weather trusses braces and lifts lt langlie concluded at last clear away on deck there they were about bearing off the night wind to the noreast and by the sound of the hull making a goodly way again well clear of the ships of their convoy now fleeing north in no particular order with as lewrie could espy the sluggard festival and hms grafton now ahead of them all thankee mister langlie well done lewrie took time to say as he took one last long sweep of the sea to the east and soueast but was drawn back to larboard by a new storm of gunfire sounding as if horatius had spotted something and had loosed an entire twodeck broadside at it deck there a lookout atop the mizen shouted down black ship astern the starboard quarter close in up helm mister langlie stand by the starboard battery and be ready to engage short range lewrie cried whirling about again get her bows down and but it was too late somehow a ship had sneaked up on them all her lights extinguished perhaps with her sails sooted or so old that dark tan weathered canvas would not reflect enought light to see her by even as the wheel was put hardover more gunfire split the night until the very moment that her guns lit off no one on deck could have spotted her not the night lookouts normally posted at the bulwarks not the watch officers not even lewrie for all his urgent peering he froze caught like his frigate with his breeches down and there was nothing else to do but stand and take it bambambam eight guns hammered out a slow metronomic broadside as the hostile ship crossed proteuss stern serving her a vicious rake by the size of the muzzle blasts at a range of about two cables roundshot screamed or moaned the howling rising in tone as they lashed towards them then came the crashing noises the sound of timbers being smashed with the parrot rawrk of rivened wood the shattering of glass sashwindows a few feet below the taffrails as the roundshot pierced through lewries greatcabins to bowl richochet and carom past where the temporary partitions that normally shielded his privacy had stood down the gundeck among sailors standing by their pieces shattering truckcarriages glancing off pristine whitesanded decks thudding into the mizenmast trunk sparking off gun tubes with deep belllike bongs and raising a cloud of splintered wood flying like terrified pigeons into flesh eight guns corvette lewries panicky brain told him as he stood stifflegged almost unable to move to think of much more she shot her bolt minute and a half treload good as our navy there was a great pall of spent powder smoke astern the hint of masts and sails above it and the fore end of a warship emerging from behind it sailing what looked to be norwesterly belay the last helm order lewrie shouted forcing himself to motion seething with sudden rage for being caught so flatfooted so stupidly and with shame for letting it happen to him to his ship put yer helm down steer due north might open us to another rake but do we get a bit off from her he thought open the range duck into the gloom and hope the french corvette for what else could it belost sight of them for a moment the wind was from the west and the corvette was closehauled steering no better than nornorwest six points off of the wind and obviously trying to get after the convoy and take at least one prize with a relatively clean bottom and all plain sail aloft she might attain nine or ten knots slightly better than what proteus was making lewries senses told him they could not hope to surge up abeam of her to swat the corvette with their heavier broadside but what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander mister langlie you still with us lewrie called out aye sir still here came a reassuringly firm reply good i want that saucy bastard free the last of the night reefs from the tgallants let fall and sheet home the royals and let the main course stay full fire hazard bedamned lewrie schemed aloud that frenchmans after an indiaman hard on the wind mostlike and should be about there he said pointing out into the darkness off the larboard quarters perhaps three or four cables off with luck we may be able to outreach her and tack cross her bows then serve her a bowrake taunt me will ye lewrie thought in fury to be fired upon by a lighter warship one that usually would shy away from action with a frigate if the frenchman had not mistaken proteus for a sloop of war or gunbrig then his feat of tweaking the bloodies noses with such daring could get him dinedout for years with a knot or two more inhand lewrie began to say but a fresh series of explosions split the night another eight bursts of hot white powder smoke bright amber juts from muzzles and showers of embers there she is the corvette was as hed speculated about three cables astern and farther up to windward than before at that range in the gloom the frenchmans new broadside was more of a threat than a killing blow reverting to the usual french navy practice these balls were fired at full elevation on the uproll meant to dismast and cripple proteus not hull her forcing her to fall away eastward and astern to let the corvette get on with her depredations without further interference lewrie involuntarily flinched into his coat as the round iron shot bowled overhead ahead and astern in a hopeful spread but all of them clean misses this time and by firing that broadside msieur frog had given away his best weapon his location and the direction of his course he was still closehauled bound nornorwest signal rockets mister langlie lewrie snapped let grafton and the others know theres a wolf mongst the sheep and carry on aye aye sir swivelguns on the midships larboard gangway bulwarks were made ready by the few bracetenders and waisters not part of the gun crews below on the main deck four yellowwhite rockets flung themselves to the skies with sulfurous whooshes slanting out over the dark sea that lay to the west creating brief golden sparkles and fireglades on the waters faintly illuminating their foe as well mosthearteningly revealing a frigate off to the west as well one which flew the red ensign of the royal navy which looked to be sailing due north or one point alee a little ahead of proteus and in a prime position to haul her wind and fall down to counter the french corvette too mister catterall lewrie shouted down to the deck below him chock and check starboard and be ready to engage the frog corvette off our larboard quarters when we wheel up to windward in the last lingering glimmer of the signal rockets lewrie had time for a look into the waist and was appalled the pounder gun nearest to the larboard ladderway sat on a shattered truckcarriage at a crippled angle and there were two bodies beside it in the awkward sprawls of the dead that could be mistaken for piles of old clothes four more corpses had been laid out round the trunk of the main mast the broad pools of spilt blood glittering evilly in the light of the battle lanthorns even as he watched mr hodsons loblolly boys were bearing a gasping wounded man to the main hatchway ladders on a messtable for a stretcher a sailor so quilled with fingerthick splinters he moreresembled a hedgehog a bit farther forward another gun had not only been dismounted but had been struck so hard with a cannon ball that a large divot had been taken from its thick breech thirteen guns left no lewrie fumed to himself ten morelike for god knows what happened to the ones in my cabins aft all sail set sir ready to go about lt langlie reported begin mister langlie lewrie ordered tightlipped mister catterall were bearing up fire as you bear stations for stays quartermasters put your helm down proteus was now sailing at nearly ten knots her bottom was as clean and swift as could be expected so recently after a recoppering and her turn up towards the wind was quick leaving that to langlie lewrie went to the larboard soontobe engaged side gripping at the caprails and peering wideeyed into the night and yes there she was four cables off but making a goodly way her location revealed by the creaming white swash of her wake and bowwave lt catteralls gunners groaned grunted and cursed as they levered their loaded guns about to point so far aft in the gunports lifting bodily shifting the rears of both gun and carriage to the right heaving on the runout tackle and breeching tackle so when fired those monsters didnt slew about and crush their tenders or snap free at this angle the guns righthand second reenforcing rings were out the ports the trunnions upon recoil might barely clear the bulwarks the guncaptains urged them on with shouts and fists blows unnoticed by the sweating tars for all of them just as much as lewrie craved at least one broadside for revenge for payback and to prove to the world and to themselves that they could give as good as they got ready lt catterall was bellowing stepping well clear of his charges the crews gathering well away from the possible result of recoil too each guncaptain standing with one fist in the air with the triggering lanyards to the cocked flintlock strikers taut in the other well damme catterall barked frustrated as proteus came up on the wind as waisters and tenders braced her sails and yards up sharper she began to wallow as if sailing with the wind nearly rightaft on a longscending following sea lewrie looked to the helm of a mind to curse the four helmsmen on the double wheel for the worst sort of lubbers to see them heaving away making the spokes blur first to helm down then to helm up steady her dammit lewrie bawled thus he snapped using his right hand to indicate the best course by the light of the blue fusee at the mainmast top he could see the commissioning pendant so why couldnt they for gods sake steady on she did steady up though with a manic effort on her helm she came to a constant course at last as you bear fire came the eager and relieved shriek from lt catterall and the pounders began to bellow lewrie turned back to watch the corvette picking her up by her frothing wake along her waterline again as the first roundshot was fired there a tall feather of water leaping up under her bows a second about amidships of her length a short but close enough to graze up and hit her twixt wind and water her forecourse twitched as a ball punched right through it there came a faint rrawk from a direct hit into her scantlings or timbers he saw her foremast shiver from top to trunk vibrating like a harpsichordists tuningfork as a ball struck it another feather of spray from a ball that just barely cleared her starboard quarter another closeaboard her after thirds and caromed off her at a shallow angle ripping side planking to bits proteus began to wallow again bowsprit and jibboom swinging and hunting left and right in wide and lazy yawings with the convoys stern lanthorns now faint and faroff glows to track by dammit to holy hell what lewrie roared about ready to strangle someone no helm sir quartermaster austen shouted back no helm christ shit on a biscuit lewrie muttered see to it mister langlie he shouted back though fearing the worst that sternrake surely had blown away steering tackle smashed into the tillerflat or the rudder itself could relieving tackle be rigged and reroved else proteus would go from warship to drifting hulk in a twinkling a helpless hulk at the mercy of a pitiless frenchmans guns the last gun in the larboard battery erupted even though a hit was out of the question as proteus fell off the wind only nine had fired by lewries count even worse than hed feared on this wind and without steering proteus could do nothing but slump shoreward her stern and weakened gun battery open to the foe lewrie turned back to peer after the french corvette her wake still gave her position away but she seemed farther away not quite as long as shed been before perhaps that creaming froth too short for a ship within four cables he speculated there came a bellowing up to windward a series of gun flashes that revealed hms stag which was on a course of about noreast now sailing to interpose herself between the convoy and the intruder moments later fardistant hms horatius lit up the seas to the west with another full broadside of her own at something beyond her silhouetting herself for several long seconds deck there a mainmast lookout shouted down th enemys goin about tackin two point off th larbrd quarter thank god for small mercies lewrie whispered no matter how ignominious it was to be rescued by a sister ship it felt much like playing the role of a breeding bull being saved from the terror of a vicious marauding terrier by the arrival of a cow from his own herd sure ill never hear the end of it lewrie bemoaned pardon sir lt langlie said coming to his side and tapping the brim of his hat in salute the bosuns mate has been below with the carpenter mister garroway mister towpenny reports that all the steering tackle is taut and sound with no shot holes near the tiller head he fears tis the rudder itself sir masthead lewrie barked aloft where away that corvette now one point off th larbrd quarter six cabler more sir an anonymous cry came back might jis be past stays an bound to th souwest breakin away looks like sir made a big frothy patch very well lewrie shouted then turned to his first officer in that case get the way off her fore we rip what littles left clean off mister langlie bosun and carpenter to the quarterdeck at once and ill have a battle lanthorn fetched with em order mister catterall to secure his guns and stand ready to assist where he can aye sir when a ship tacked she slowed wheeled degrees or more created a large patch of disturbed water and fell off the wind for a spell before firming up on a new course that was what the lookout had seen that pale phosphorescent halfacre of foam of a ship gone about daunted from her desires by the presence of two frigates and unready to trust her luck against the second one this brief fight was over as the guns were levered back to right angles to the hull and swabbed clean tompioned and bowsed to the bulwarks as freed sailors went aloft to take in the royals and tgallants and once more reduce the topsls lewrie mr towpenny and mr garroway went aft with the lanthorn and a coil of light rope to inspect the rudder sonofabitch sorry sir towpenny gasped as the lanthorn bobbed dangled and swung lowered halfway to the waterline under the frigates counter no wonder shes yawin like shes drunk as davys sow th lower part o th main pieces swingin like a barn door upper stock of the main piece is nigh shot clean through sir the carpenter also marvelled tween the second and third pintles and gudgeons and i suspect the lowermosts been torn completely away else shed not sway like that aye mr towpenny spat fir baulks tth trailin edge has been shot off too hangin on by less than a fingernail she is sir he shifted the lanthorn lower and then slowly raised it bumping up along the sternpost ah tis bad horrid bad that towpenny sorrowfully commented with a wince and a sucking hiss nigh shot through twixt the second an third pintles an both fourth an fifth torn free too sir an wots left o th sternpost below th waterlines anybodys guess bronze gudgeons an pintle arms seasoned oak for a replacement carpenter garroway mourned firs no problem perhaps but theres no oak in africa is there good dense english elm fr sole an back an wot them balls did tth fayed triangle strips o th sternpost an rudder both mr towpenny added could it be fished like a broken yardarm mister towpenny lewrie hopefully enquired ready to all but cross his fingers behind his back some vertical iron strips bolted through stead of foreandaft strapping like the tiller head might could try capm but id not trust it in anythin more than calm seas towpenny said with a sad sigh do it get boistrous th rollin gits too heavy she might snap like a fresh carrot an then whered we be sir nossir we need a whole new main piece any other wood besides english oak that might serve lewrie asked him towpenny hoisted the lanthorn up to the taffrails with a distant look on his grizzled face waiting til the lamp was inboard before he spoke mahogany or teak sir towpenny speculated tis dense an stiff enough but th findino such long an broad enough an seasoned enough not green wellsir thatd be a real poser capm damn lewrie spat clapping his hands behind his back pacing forward and away there were cubanbuilt spanish ships fashioned from truck to keel of mahogany and the envy of anyone who captured them for they were incredibly strong and longlasting hed seen merchant vessels in the far east country ships in the local trade made from teak and they bore reputations for strength too but india was a long way off and without a rudder theyd never get there to find the material necessary to fashion a new rudder and lewrie rather doubted there were any spaniards still in the far east trade who might put in at cape town and just happen to have a spare rudder gathering cobwebs in their bosuns lockers he spun back around i take it weve not enough seasoned oak of the proper size to fashion a newun either mister towpenny nossir weve not the bosuns mate replied after sharing a quick silent conference with the carpenter nothin thick or long enough tmake new cap m well damn my eyes lewrie growled one good point he thought taking what wee scrap of fortune he could from rawfortune thout a rudder surely to god well not have tgo on to bombay or canton in sir tobiasbloody treghues s company assuming they survived til dawn for lewrie was reminded that proteus with the way now almost completely off her to save what was left of her shattered rudder was still prey to the west wind and the eastwardsetting current mr winwood had thought them about twenty seamiles offshore when the action had begun and they had worn away to leeward and steered noreast for a time before coming back to due north to follow the convoy which might have resulted in their losing a mile or better shoreward a highcliffed rocky shore where the bottom rose up steeply and quickly and the waves crashed with a fury even on the best days there would be no chance to come to anchor as they drifted ashore with the seabottom so far below neither could they come up to the wind close enough to attempt a tack or even fetchto for gods sake such a swing might rip the tatters right off the sternpost besides it took a sound rudder for fetchingto to maintain her head when the foreandaft sails and the backbraced sails on the yards countered each other in a constantlyshifting balancing act are we fucked or what lewrie miserably thought mister langlie lewrie called out aye sir i think its time we fired some more of those signal rockets lewrie said admitting to himself that he could think of nothing else to do for once what is the number to convey need assistance five at once sir lt langlie quickly replied make up a seaanchor get it over the side and well hope for the best mister langlie lewrie said glad that no one could see him blushing with embarrassment in the dark at once sir about a halfhour later hms stag came looming up in the gloom surging alongside under reduced sail but still going a lot faster than proteus within a long musket shot of her larboard seaward beam hoy proteus capt philpott cried through a brass speaking trumpet you there captain lewrie something amiss is there hoy captain philpott lewrie shouted back im still here but weve a wee problem with our rudder shot halfway off thats what happens when you let a badun sneak up and spank you on the arse aye philpott cried sounding like he was chortling god i didnt know how much i despise him til now lewrie took a moment to think do you request a tow lewrie philpott offered aye we need a tow into harbour philpott lewrie shouted figuring that if philpott would drop the honourifics he would too no matter did he outrank him on the captains list be ready when we come round again sir philpott ordered ill fetchto off your bows do you reduce to bare poles and lower a boat to transfer the towing cable your cable or mine ha ha i will supply lewrie replied goodho mind lewrie towing you in ill not demand that you fly my flag over yours as my prize choke on it an damn yer sense of humour ye bastard lewrie furiously thought wondering if it could get any more humiliating after a moment lewrie took evil glee in the comforting thought that whilst proteus swung to her anchors at cape town making repairs it would be philpott who would have the utter delight in accompanying grafton and horatius cross the indian ocean with not a jot of shore liberty and lewrie would have free access to the cape the tavern of the seas do i thank that frenchman for that lewrie wondered mine arse on a bandbox if i will book iv contemnere miser vitanda est improba siren desidia aut quidquid vita meliore parasti ponendum aequo animo you will earn contempt poor wretch you must shun the wicked siren sloth or be content to drop whatever honour you have gained in nobler hours horace satires ii in chapter twenty oh twas a splendid little victory the saving of the convoy on paper at least nine helpless merchantmen eight of them worthy assaulted by a french squadron which might have been consisted of two frigates and a brace of corvettes the foes fell purposes countered by english pluck and daring superb seamanship and arguseyed gunnery all most shrewdly directed and concentrated in a trice by rapid application of a unique nightsignalling system invented by the escorts commander a system the fleet would surely find superior to any other and had the frogs been possessed of real bottom it couldve been a spectacularly conclusive fight resulting in the capture or the utter destruction of a significant number of the french raiders who preyed on british trade in this part of the worlds oceans adding even brighter laurels to the royal navys fame and their sovereigns honour but the shivering cowards had done as much as they dared then scampered away in the face of overwhelming strength wellpeppered and much cut up by good british iron whilst their own seagunnery fared as poorly as it usually did except for sneaking most unfairly and knavishly but what could one expect of frogs up on hms proteus and whose fault was that certainly not the victorious squadrons alert commander who was at that instant busy directing the activities of his own flagship and his squadrons ships miles away so there lewrie looked up from a copy of that report after gathering the gist of it and bestowed upon the flagcaptain to viceadm sir roger curtis commanding officer of the cape station a most dubious expression all but rolling his eyes indeed sir the flagcaptain derisively simpered after lewrie handed it back to him captain sir tobias treghues may make of your encounter with the french what he will but tis doubtful if admiralty will find his account much of a success we shall of course despatch it to london of course sir lewrie replied with a knowing nod with an account of our own of course anent this odd affair the flagcaptain further said with a mocking brow raised lewrie had already seen a thumbnail sketch of this report in a scathing personal letter that treghues had sent aboard a letter replete with lewrie how could you spoil such potential glory by your inattentiveness by allowing himself to be taken so unawares salted with i have always felt uneasy in my mind over your lamentable lack of assiduousness and with several tsktsks over his utterly casual and tongueincheek and lackaday and dilettantish approach to such a serious and demanding profession as the navy required and et cetera and et cetera in much the same vein concluding with the supposition that one could suspect that to avoid a long and depriving voyage to the far east you finagled a way out by letting your ship be damaged by a mere corvette along with a closing warning that should any part of the convoy suffer loss due to further french action with the escort so reduced then he capt sir tobias treghues would personally hold capt alan lewrie responsible for it and make sure that admiralty did too lewrie had not expected to see the official version though junior officers were never allowed such a luxury but this was sir roger curtis he was dealing with he had to recall they had met briefly in the aftermath of the battle that had famously become known as the glorious first of june in on the decks of hms queen charlotte when capt sir roger curtis was flagcaptain to adm sir richard black dick howe lewrie had spent a whole day being pursued by two scouting french frigates ending penned up against the unengaged side of the entire french line of battle and had gotten round the end of their line and into the shelter of howes battle line by the skin of his teeth that exploit had not been mentioned in despatches by sir roger gaining lewrie no fame of it and playing favourites most shamefully thencapt sir roger curtis had also omitted the names of captains and ships that had not been able to come to close grips with the french on the light winds that prevailed that day denying them admiralty recognitionand the gold medalsgiven to those in the van of the snakebent line of battle or as some spitefully suspected omitting the names of people with whom hed served in the past and still disliked adm duncan at camperdown adm jervis at the battle of cape st vincent certainly adm nelson at the nile made sure that all captains were cited for their efforts for all the world to see in the gazette and the marine chronicle but evidently sir roger curtis baronet still had no truck with the newfangled idea of we few we happy few we band of brothers treghues is fucked lewrie told himself poor desperate bastard ye say your ship was damaged aft captain lewrie our rudder was nigh shot off sir aye lewrie replied four guns dismounted two with divots the size of dinner plates shot out of them and im leery of firing full charges from them in future i have six dead and thirteen wounded as well with three of those not long for this world or so my surgeon informs me sir lewrie unconsciously fingered the st vincent and camperdown medals that hung round his neck for this fulldress interview as if to reassure himself and the flagcaptain that he had done much better in the past and that the french ambush had been a rare fluke you may enquire of our stores ship for replacement timber with which to mend or replace your rudder captain lewrie the man offhandedly allowed as to guns there may be some captured dutch twelvepounders with the local prizecourt the courts warehouses may also hold bosuns stores from prizes taken by the ships of this station in past he concluded with a preening smile what bloody prices lewrie sourly thought dont tell me that elphinstones are still here five years later in sir george keith elphinstone had led a squadron to the cape three s two older s and a pair of gunned sloops of war along with transports carrying the th regiment of foot to take over the dutch colony which he had done right handily now the squadron assigned here was little larger minus the transportswith older and lighter frigates replacing the sloops of war a force not much bigger than treghuess escort force table bay treacherous as it could be was huge but fairly empty at present and once the east india trade sailed onwards it would be even emptier for the moment there were only a pair of s a lone and one old gun sixth rate at anchor besides the stores ship and crippled hms proteus and neither cape town nor simons town on the other side of the peninsula owned a graving dock or dry dock where serious repairs could be made what had the dutch done before we got here lewrie had to wonder i must own surprise sir that such an important station bestride one of our most vital trade routes does not have an official dockyard establishment lewrie stated that seemed safer than asking what prizes the cape squadron had managed to reel in oned think so wouldnt one the flagcaptain breezily answered but there is a war on and the cape is rather far removed from major french naval ports such as rochefort brest or toulon with the dutch french and spanish roundthecape trade nighcompletely ended and the much smaller neutral countries trade so lightlyarmed there is no real threat to crown interests gad can you imagine the americans or the roosians coming in on the french side then mounting expeditions to come here ha ha though the french do hold mauritius and the seychelles with a strong force of lighter ships sir lewrie carefully pointed out he would get no help if he irritated the local squadron and wasnt it a rather firm rumour that they have also fortified the old pirate hole on the northern tip of madagascar fort de france on mauritius is so i was told as large and nighimpregnable as any of their home ports but rather far from here sir the flagcaptain replied with a bit less casualness as if awaiting criticism but aint that what warships are for lewrie cynically thought go play silly buggers thousands of miles away tkeep you awake nights i also must own that neither i nor captain treghues had warning of the french operating on this side of the cape of good hope sir lewrie added keeping his face serious perhaps playacting perplexity so the flagcaptain wouldnt take affront and kick him in the nutmegs is this something new since we left england sir i thought their best hunting grounds would be twixt ceylon and here not in the atlantic well despite the tight blockade of the french home ports some reenforcements do slip through the net the flagcaptain dismissivelyand rather grumpilyanswered and though fort de france on mauritius has its own dockyard facilities there are times when ships have need of serious repair such as is your case hmm he added with a prissy sarcasm and they must sail for france or replacing warships and privateers must sail out to mauritius in the face of a strong royal navy presence it would only make sense for them to sail together rather than risk a singleton sir roger and i are of an opinion that what your captain treghues encountered the other night was such a mutuallyprotective group on its way to france that ran across you all by accident and could not resist the opportunity to sail home with some additional prizes dye see sir well lewrie began to say deeming that wishful thinking weve three frigates at sea this instant sir hunting just that sort of movement the flagcaptain insisted in your case it was a fluke treghues still retains a strong escort force so i doubt hell have another encounter like that in the indian ocean mores the pity for his aspirations to glory what and by the time he is back you might be repaired and ready to rejoin his command but thatd be months sir lewrie protested with no yard and no replacement timber no more than six to eight weeks mostlike the flagcaptain said with a shrug doing nothing to reassure him our esteemed john company convoy service is now a monthly business put in a request to the yards at bombay and you could have a spankingnew rudder shipped here for installation request goes with the indiahalf of treghuess trade the rudder arrives sooner or later to make things worse the senior officer added with what felt like a malicious little grin assuming that there would be a homebound indiaman whod break their passage at the cape they usually dont even the trades outbound from china evidently lewrie had rankled the man even with a pose of innocent perplexity plastered on dear lord he breathed his shoulders slumping for the nonce allow me to advert to you the services of the local dutch chandlers sir the flagcaptain cheerfully blathered on making it sound as if hed gladly foist all responsibility for repairs and stores wellwide of the cape stations limited funds and place it all squarely on lewrie and his purse have you been ashore yet only briefly sir lewrie said funeral arrangements theyre most capable and passably wellstocked from the very first days of dutch settlement theyve brought in farmers servants and slaves from their far east colonies tis an allnations like a dram shop ha ha the flagcaptain chuckled javanese sumatrans malays hindoos lascars even chinamen some of whom are fishermen boatmen and pearl and oyster divers dye see sir the local dutch myhneers could put you in the way of some who could survey the damage to your ship do the preparatory work for you without need to careen your ship on some beach what well thats a grand idea sir lewrie said perking up considerably ill ah take no more of your busy time then sir anything needful send word once you conduct your initial survey and well see what we might possibly do for you captain lewrie shore liberty for my people sir lewrie offhandedly asked hoping that the cape squadron had not yet gotten word of what had happened on st helena within reason was the flagcaptains reply cape province is the land of the lotus eaters so be wary of allowing your tars any freedom beyond the immediate town environs tis all too possible for a man to live well off the backcountry more than half the dutch are what they call trekboers who live seminomadic herds waggons and kinfolk native slaves and all stopping just long enough to plant the staple crops then moving on when the land plays out or they get bored i expect the flagcaptain said rising to indicate that their interview was over theres more than a few sailors wellpaid hands off indiamen and passing traders who run no risk of battle such as we do have run and taken up the life damned fools thankee for the warning sir lewrie told him gathering up his hat and such i will caution my officers and warrants tbe wary tis such a pity though that so much of the beguiling wildlife can kill you kill sir lewrie asked trying not to gawp the two times he had broken his passage at kaapstad as the dutch called it in and between the wars he hadnt gotten into the backcountry taverns restaurants and richgentlemens brothels had been more beguiling to his tastes a spirited horseback ride on a hired prad from kaapstad and table bay to simons town on simons and false bay represented his best effort at exploration and thered been clean postinghouses and taverns all along the way too oh god yes the flagcaptain exclaimed with a moue snakes and scorpions spiders biting ants biting flies and such they are as vicious and deadly as a pack of hungry lions wild beasts running in herds so vast they blanket the land miles across not to mention a large assortment of fierce native tribes simply keen on poisoning their spears and arrows god only knows what the dutch hoped to make of a toehold in africa other than a way station on the way to the riches of the far east and now we have possession of it god only knows of what avail twill prove to be to us hah well at one time one mightve said much the same of north america sir lewrie drolly pointed out oh quite right the flagcaptain hooted in much mirth over lewries quip quite right indeed ah empire what a grand and glorious thing for britons to owntil one must actually go take a squint at it close up and be confronted with its sweaty itchy and uncomfortably fatal nature look at india for gods sake best of luck with your repairs captain lewrie any difficulties dont hesitate to ask he vowed though how much aid hed actually be was a moot question beyond the stores ship it would be up to them alone at least armed with some morethancredible things for his crew to dread when they went ashore preventing mass desertion lewrie went back aboard his frigate once the ritual salute was done he went aft to the taffrails to stare long and hard at the inviting shore leaning on the caprails on his elbows most lubberly two guns short even if there was enough seasoned timber ashore or in stores to remount them on new truckcarriages unless the prize court really had captured pounders he would have to accept sailing with a weaker gun battery assuming bombay had a slab of seasoned oak big enough for a new rudder the stores ship had it and would really give it up the dutch chandlers had it well sailing might be a moot point too six possibly nine hands short if mr hodsons sad diagnoses proved correct with nigh a dozen more prime sailors recuperating from wounds and on light duties for weeks more to boot there wasnt even an official naval hospital ashore not yet and admiralty seemed loath to spend hapence more on the cape town station than absolutely necessary so lewrie supposed that he would have to rent a place in the town something airy clean and shady where his wounded sailors could recover for the small sickbay near the forecastle aboard ship was the worst sort of makeshift sickberth one comfort the longsettled dutch no matter how much rancour existed twixt them and the english were also protestant christians with none of the intolerance for other faiths that obtained in spanish or catholic lands there had already been an established but small church of england parish to serve the needs of transient british sailors in cape town and the churchs rector had mostkindly offered his services and his graveyard where lewries dead were now buried with a real churchman to officiate a handpumped organ and organist to accompany the heartfelt hymns and altar boys to both assist the rector in his duties and form the core of a tiny choir which had turned out to honour fellow englishmen as they went under the earth the service had been much more satisfying to one and all than anything that lewrie could have done with his battered book of common prayer in one hand and equally tattered hymn book in the other awkwardly reciting ritual by the starboard entryport as the dead were tipped over the side one by one sewn into a canvas shroud with roundshot at their feet a last stitch through their noses sliding from the carrying board from under the ensign to plunge into the unfathomable abyssal depths it was best though that his dead had come ashore already sewn into their sailcanvas shrouds for two of the six had come from among his black jamaican volunteerslandsman george anson and ordinary seaman jemmy hawkeand lewrie was mortalcertain that the vigourous youngish rector kindly as hed seemed would have raised a torrent of objections had he seen blacks going into the ground beside whites they were related to those august gentlemen were they he had comfortingly enquired in a private moment how horrible twill be for such famous naval families to learn of such early demises for kin who had their promising careers ended so tragically early should i write letters of condolence perhaps no kin to former admirals nossir lewrie had had to say with a straight and mournful face suddenly amused nigh to titters with the astonishment everyone would evince were the shrouds opened or letters sent to the anson and hawke families back in england in fact they were but common sailors good men but without any ties to gentlemanly families i fear men volunteer or declare themselves when pressed under false names take false names to avoid being taken up by civil authorities were they wrongdoers before dye see ah i understand captain lewrie the rector had said and i feel certain that no matter their sins were scarlet dying in service to king and country they were washed as white as snow by their dedication to duty and by the true valour they evinced in their last instants heaven will be their reward no matter how humbly born truly said sir lewrie had replied as for notifying their kin i have already composed letters tis my sad duty half the morning gone kicking his cooling heels waiting to be seen by that flagcaptain whilst mr pendarves mr towpenny and mr garroway had been over the side on a catamaran a floating work stage surveying what they could above the waterline the damaged guntrucks being repaired with what stocks of seasoned timber they had in stores aboard proteus and the divotted artillery pieces dismounted ready to be slung into the cutter and rowed ashore for exchange should there actually be dutch pounders to exchange them for lewrie would not be picky they could be tigermouthed hindoo or chinese guns for all it would signify to him at that point so much to do to put proteus to rights to care for his maimed sailors one of whom sam whitbread was also black and what dutch renters thought of that when he sought shore lodgings for them well six eight weeks he said lewrie thought with a dismayed moan longer land of the lotus eaters bedamned and the french could they have gottenstrong or bold enough to haunt table bay despite what the local navy officers think i cant sit idle swingin round the anchors if the frogs think they can raid this close to home for a bleak moment he pictured that french squadron sailing right into the bay for a night raid on shipping and with proteus so lamed he thrust himself erect determined to get a way on to achieve something productive before sundown though what that was he hadnt a clue at present he paced back forward but caught sight of festival anchored about a mile off and now swarmed with barges and boats to unload her menagerie scenery and such for a long run of performances her main yardarm was dipping to sway out a sling which held a horse a white horse eudoxias welltrained gelding hmm he speculated eight weeks or more in a paradise even if its a deadly sort with her ashore lord give me strength chapter twentyone two days later and the prospects for his frigate didnt look so bleak requests for material assistance from the indiamen that theyd convoyed this far had resulted in enough oak from their own civilian bosuns stores for new truckcarriages to replace the ones too smashed up to be repaired and for repairs on those that could be salvaged out of gratitude that one or all of them hadnt been taken by the french perhaps there had also come enough dried and seasoned fir or pine with which to fay the face of the sternpost and the lead edge of the rudder enough elm for faying and soling as well with timber had come a few iron pigs that could become reinforcing strapping bands enough bronze inpig for a shoreside blacksmith to forge new gudgeons or pintles and bolts a personal meeting with salty old capt cowles the convoy commodore and hed sponsored a whipround from the other indiamen that had resulted in a flood of offerings worthy of a cornucopia a veritable horn of plenty had seven of his brave sailors now passed over were ten still lying wounded for each man mates and passengers had made up a small purse to cover their sickberth fees which ships surgeons and mates would deduct from their pay even if the spithead mutiny had ended the practice of wounded mens pay being stopped til they were healed so they would not suffer financially dead mens grave fees were paid to the parish and a tolerable amount had been contributed to send on to their families to augment the miserly pensions admiralty granted more was to go to providing fresh victuals for those who lingered in the rented cottage high up on the windy bluffs of the lions rump artillery well neither the stores ship nor the prize court storehouses had pounders for exchange they had some few pounders and a pair of pounders taken off dutch merchantmen captured in port when elphinstone had landed and a pair of dutch pounders that had never been installed in the sea forts built to protect cape town but lewrie was slavering but wary of how much recoil and weight that his decks his bulwarks and his breeching cables could withstand should he dare install those monsters and touch them off fully charged in the face of such freelyoffered bounty lewrie had no choice but to reciprocate by diningin capt cowles the masters and mates off the other indiamen and those passengers who had contributed he had dreaded the expense but a local inn had done him proud off the local viands and at a fairly decent price too it had turned out to be a game supper the soup had been egg and guinea fowl mainly with some rice and fresh peas crisply fresh salad greens came next then the vast assortment of meats brought in as removes more guinea fowl or pheasant even ostrich for venison there had been springbok or gemsbok antelope and impala even giraffe for gods sake then had come wild boar with mushrooms followed by fish courses such as cape salmon thumbthick shrimp as long as ones whole hand done in olive oil lemon juice garlic chilies bay leaves and cloves there had even been a kickshaw made of crocodile local madedishes such as bredies and boboties had made their appearance the bredie a mutton stew stiff with pot vegetables and the bobotie nearly the best mild curry of shredded lamb fruit and rice lewrie had eaten in his life fresh breads local wines mounded rice pilafs or satays showing javanese influences and to top all of that off should anyone have had a cubic inch of stomach left for them the desserts besides fresh whole fruits had consisted of rich cinnamonlaced milk tarts a steamed brandy pudding as good as any to be found in england or koeksisters which were wee braided doughy confections sopping with honey spices and heavy fruit syrups port sweet biscuit and nuts had seemed superfluous and lewrie was still belching two days later now though lewrie paused midships of the larboard gangway as the sound of cannon fire caught his attention the convoy of indiamen was setting sail to complete their long journeys to india or china and hms grafton horatius and the unfortunate hms stag with the equally disappointed capt philpott were getting under way with them the flagship firing a proper salute to viceadm curtiss flag as it went imade the effort lewrie told himself for he had sent an invitation to his shore supper to his fellow captains and treghues too but only philpott and graves had attended treghues had sent a stiff note of regret that stern duty would not allow for such idle socialising at such a moment poor stiffnecked bastard lewrie bemoaned sir roger being sir roger that worthy had laughed that report capt treghues had submitted and sent on to london to scorn eagerly sharing his scorn among his coterie it actually made lewrie wince to see treghues grasping at such a slender straw to turn what had been a halfblind shambles into a signal victory or at least a thumpinggood repelling of a backstabbing french attempt on his convoy what a misery treghues might find his wartime career of plodding to india and back with his guns rusting for want of use and with never a foe strong enough to challenge him lewrie could not imagine didnt want to imagine for by comparison hed already had more than his share of a lively war with the medals rank and post to prove it did treghues hope that a report of any sort of action involving gunpowder any sort of success against the french might bring him to the admiraltys notice in a fresh new light which might earn him his promotion to real commodore rank command of a squadron in more active and important seas or might a release from boresome convoy duties be the excuse he craved to land his dour wife ashore whilst he sailed in harms way as that american pest john paul jones had termed it no one in lewries jaded experience could tolerate such a tart and termagant mort like her for very long not even if she came with access to the rents of an entire shire faarewell and adieu youou sour english sailor faarewell and adieu youou arseload of pain lewrie softly sang under his breath as he watched hms grafton curtsy and heel as she manned her yards to make more sail oh a host of foreign byebyes lewrie gleefully thought as he tried to dredge up halfforgotten phrases from his experiences adios came to mind quickly followed by vamanos which was more apropos auf wiedersehen au revoir both of which he thought too polite by half the catchall hindoo namaste good for welcome and departing what had he heard at naples genoa and leghorn in the med ah arrivederci that was it ave atque vale from his schooldays latin he would have tried the greek but there was a language he never could get his wits about for which failure his bottom had suffered at a whole host of schools there was eudoxias dosvidanya there was what he had read in captain blighs book following the bounty mutiny that the sandwich islanders said aloha oheh what the first explorers to the colony of new south wales had heard the aborigines shout at them on the beach of sydney cove warrawarra later settlersthe willing not the convictshad learned that it was not a cry of welcome but a wish for the strange new tribe to go away how very apt warrawarra lewrie softly called out lifting one hand as if bestowing a blessing on hms grafton though did one look closely one might have noticed that lewries index and middle finger of that hand were raised a bit higher than the rest that hand slowly rotated palm inwards towards the end rudder lewrie reminded himself turning away to deal with his greatest problem he went to the starboard entryport clad in an old shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbows his rattiest oldest pair of sloptrousers rolled to his knees above bare shins and shoes about to crack apart with age mildew and damp bareheaded he tossed off a sketchy salute to the sideparty and scampered down the battens and manropes to his gig where coxn andrews and only a pair of oarsmen awaited they would not bear him far just down the starboard quarter then round the squareish stern where other people were already occupied good morning mister goosen lewrie said to the dutch ship chandler who had contracted to do the survey he was a squarebuilt fellow in his early fifties heavily bearded contrary to current fashion elsewhere garbed much as lewrie was but for a wide straw hat on his pink and balding head reddish cheeks and nose the sign of the serious toper or one who spent his days in the harsher african sun and on the water to boot gut morning kaptein goosen jovially replied from his boat an eightoared thing nearly fourty feet long with both a false forecastle and imitation poop that had once been as grand as an admirals barge but had gone downhill rapidly in civilian hands goosen waved a wooden piggin at lewrie by way of greeting then emitted a belch at him which required a fist against his chest cold sweet lime water ver gut on hot days kaptein but making die bilious he explained what have your divers discovered so far sir lewrie asked as he shared a look with the bosun mr pendarves who was sitting on the edge of his catamaran with his feet and shins in the water alongside the damaged rudder rudder iss fucked kaptein goosen replied with an expression halfway twixt a scowl and a grin sacrificial fir baulks shattered die main piece uhm iss die greentwig broke not clean broke but hang by

sprogs came bursting to the surface in welters of foam bobbing like corks for a moment before starting to paddle with their legs and wave their arms sideways to stay afloat one swabbed water from his face and long hair then kicked a few feet over to goosens barge took hold of the gunwale and began a palaver in a tongue that was mostlikely halfdutch and halfjavanese neither of which lewrie could follow goosen listened nodded here and there over the choicer bits sucked his teeth and winced then translated kaffir say gudgeon at bottom of sternpost iss open iss bolted to sternpost but die holeforpintlepart iss not hole but like diss goosen said frowning and holding up one hand thumb and fingers forming a cylinder before snapping them apart to make a wide ushape and the lowermost pintle lewrie prompted iss half tore loose kaptein wit pintle pin bent goosen further translated bending his forefinger into a crook to describe it die bolts heff tore up rudder too nextest to sternpost be gone pintle fitting hang by last bolt nextest to aft end what in gods name hit us then lewrie wondered aloud if the lowermost of the five sets of pintles and gudgeons are the thickest and

almost out gon need whole new rudder oh ja new pintles gudgeons bolts nuts top to bottom ja tell me something we didnt know lewrie sourly thought musing on that sad news and looking away up the shattered sternpost and the rudder to the square overhang of the transom he had to smile nonetheless for the sashwindows of his greatcabins were open and both of his cats were posed in them paws resting on the sills intrigued by such a rare sight below weve received enough iron and bronze to have new pintles and gudgeons fashioned ashore lewrie stated looking back at the sweaty dutchman if our own armourer cannot do the work that is new oak of this size or is there some sturdy local tree that might serve just as well hereabouts mister goosen local timber pah goosen countered with a humourless laugh die verdammte african termite eat gut timber quick as goat eat paper kaptein unt oop in mountains die cederburg hex mountains die drakensberg iss only pine grow tall unt straight he

indiaman comes back with a hunk of teak or mahogany lewrie spat as he mused over that even more of goosens javanese divers bobbed to the surface from their mysterious work below the hull gasping for air and laughing together which did little for lewries sour mood either how long can they hold their breath he asked himself for he was sure that theyd been down long before hed been rowed round the stern we cant wait that long mister goosen he said trying not to sound like he was pleading surely there must be something lewrie rather doubted he and his officers could invent enough makework aboard an idled crippled ship for two whole months of dull thumbtwiddling to keep the crew from going dull or querulous and if their last shore liberty was anything to judge by his only other option was to keep them penned aboard ship else cape town would end in splintered ruins long before a replacement rudder turned up wahl goosen drawled with a cagey stroking of his beard table bay iss bad anchoring

reached out and shook hands with the cagey bastard if he played his hand well enough there was a good possibility that the navy might sport him the cost entire chapter twentytwo kapitan lewrie a tantalisingly familiar voice interrupted a foul musing as lewries little train of waggons reached the southern outskirts of tidy little cape town almost into the first of the farms and vineyards on the dusty road to simons town zdrasvutyeh oh shit and wheres her papallewrie thought with a twinge of alarm as he reined his hired mare and wheeled her slowly about to see the equally familiar spirited white gelding loping to catch up with his caravan eudoxia durschenko was beaming fit to bust as she easily and athletically posted in her stirrups heels well down and back just as straight and erect as a fencepost as she came near is good be seeink you again kapitan lewrie eudoxia gaily called out as she reined in her horse to a walk patting his neck as he tossed his proud head and snorted in frustration that his fun was over ve have not see you at circus or theatre since comink here pooh fine engliski kapitan where you are goink wit ox and waggon that had been the first surprise cousin andries de witt had refused to risk his precious dray horses as big as english punches to haul that much weight and had supplied six oxen to each long and narrow pinkended waggon that rose up so high at bow and stern that they resembled yankee dorys and a round dozen oxen as the team for the timber waggon which was little more than two sets of wheels as tall as a man and a stout frame linking them together mistress eudoxia enchante lewrie responded in an equal gayness and doffed his newlypurchased widebrimmed farmers hat to her you keep well you and your father he asked not taking it for granted that the surly bastard wasnt lurking somewhere over the next rise or skulking behind the last house but one to spy on her as to where im going were off to salvage a new rudder for my frigate to replace the one the french shot up da and it was so brave of you kapitan to save us from the fransooskie las week eudoxia quite prettily gushed as her gelding came up alongside his mare til they were riding kneetoknee and a rather slim and attractive knee it was for eudoxia paying no heed to prim dutch boer proprieties was wearing a pair of green moleskin breeches only slightly less snug than the skintight ones she wore in her performances blackandtan kneehigh riding boots and was gasp shamelessly astride her saddle and if eudoxia had made an attempt at propriety by wearing a loose linen shirt tucked into those breeches with a loose and unbuttoned tan suede waistcoat over it the shirts collar was unbuttoned nearly all the way down the placket to top off her outre ensemble she had chosen a light grey widebrimmed hat with perhaps her one and only gesture towards proper femininity for it was flounced with long trailing ribands one brim pinned up over her right eye with a long locallyobtained ostrich plume caught in the fold our peoples is karasho kapitan lewrie she beamed everythink good everyone good but for poppas best lion he is die eta tak groozni

sailors hats and gave her a cheer gonna ride tsimons bay wif us missis simons bay exdoxia asked down the cape tother side of it on another bay my dear lewrie informed her theres a wrecked ship there where we hope to obtain a new rudder and timbers to repair proteus and what of you youre rather wellarmed i must say doing a spot of hunting as well are you mistress eudoxia she looked down at the brace of singlebarrelled pistols jammed into dragoon holsters either side of her saddles front the long and slim firelock in a leather scabbard under her right leg and the bow case and tube that held at least twodozen of her arrows oh pooh is only to practice a quiet place in country where i am practicink not to disturb peoples in town for wild beast if one come for the wild man if one come too corn merchant in town who sellink us feed for beasts say many dangers in africa must always be ware rifled see kapitan she declared drawing her musket from its scabbard i buyink musket and pistols in ph philadelphia in tour in america mnoga much better even than poppas old ones lighter too see try kapitan she said thrusting the rifled musket into his hands he swung it up and sighted down the barrel hand well clear of the trigger or lock for he was sure that shed loaded it before leaving town that would be mere caution for a young woman out riding all by herself in the wilds of africa which like inland settlements in north america began about fifty yards past the last truck garden it was light and pointed well though the comb of the stock was tailored to a slighter form custommade by a talented yankee gunsmith glossy burled wood lots of brass with brass or silver inlay about as fine as the pennsylvania rifles that his ship had captured from an american smuggling brig in the danish virgins in the caribbean all of them topgrade presentation models sent as gifts or bribes to the rebel exslave leader toussaint louverture and his senior generals magnificent lewrie told her handing it back a match to a rifle i took in the caribbean and ive a breechloading ferguson as well ever seen one we should have a shoot so you may try them though im certain youd outshoot me without even trying i would like that kapitan lewrie you thinkink you are good shot she teased as she slid the rifle back into the scabbard uhm passing fair i spose lewrie said with a grin and some false modesty potted pirates in the china seas at two hundred yards with my ferguson wingshot give me a decent fowling piece and i can fetch home a decent bag lewrie chuckled though up the mississippi i did manage to knock down ducks and geese on the wing with an air rifle schto eudoxia gaped leaning away in her saddle wit air rifle i am seeink one in gunshop in portugal but never am shoot id let you lewrie teased back ooorah she whooped startling both horses uhm skolka vremene pardon how long it take you to be goink to this simons bay two days each way lewrie said unconsciously gritting teeth at the thought that horses would have been much faster perhaps two or three more to fetch what were after so call it almost a week together oh but youll be off hunting by then id expect nyet eudoxia said with a silvery laugh no kapitan men go hunt but sailors and girls stay in cape town we do circus but soldiers have seen gallandya dutch peoples have seen and plays in engliski make no sense to them so

horse im sure he is lewrie praised her one worthy of his name so when does the hunting party leave oh not for week at least kapitan lewrie eudoxia told him with a mischievious glint in her large amber eyes almost as playful as his own and prettily lowering her lashes at him vigmore is talk to boers what you call them trekboers who are knowink country evry stitch havink waggon trains like yours wit ox teams wit a band of black drivers like yours too mister van der merwe one is called he havink cutest little black fellows who drive his oxes i am thinkink they call them hottentots like doll peoples well we should be back by then lewrie offhandedly said perhaps we could once my ship is repaired o course ride out to the backcountry and have ourselves a shooting contest oh would be bolshoi would be grand kapitan lewrie and maybe eudoxia posed girlishly shyly all but biting her lower lip and drawing out that tentative suggestive word you showink me grand engliski frigate da then we have shootinks race horses or hunt little beasts not lions take picnic basket why what a delightful idea and thankee for suggestin that lewrie cried his baser humours wellstirred by then and with yer pesky poppa off gettin bit half tdeath by flies too he thought in glee and damn my eyes but for playacting so doeeyed innocent swear theres an eager vixen in her nature were to break our passage at an inn that our guide mister goosen knows up ahead mistress eudoxia lewrie further suggested care to ride with us and dine with us oh so sorry kapitan eudoxia said with sudden pout but i am promisink poppa i not ride far give hour i must return spasiba for invitation but i mus go i makink it up to you in a few days she hinted with an enticing chuckle in a throaty promising way then i will be looking forward to that most eagerly mistress pooh kapitan eudoxia pouted some more mistress eudoxia always mistress so stuffy da is eudoxia please you are alan not kapitan beink very good maybe i sayink tiy not viy how you say unformal unnerstan completely lewrie told her with glad leer stunned by that allowance and halfstrangled by the implication dosvidanya alan she cooed leaning over from her saddle to plant a chaste kiss on his cheek and put a hand in the small of his back before he could respond in kind though she gave out a whoop and put spurs to her horse she whipped away to go cantering down the length of lewries motley caravan to its very head spin round before the ox team of the first waggon and come galloping back along the far side of it towards town shchastleevavapooti paka have good trip alan see you god in heaven lewrie thought and just how longl it take for wigmore and her poppa thunt down their lions elephants and such chapter twentythree well hits a big bugger haint it one of the sailors commented with a scowl on his face as they contemplated the wreck of the indiaman big as a bloody threedecker bosun pendarves agreed looking up at her from a few yards away hands on his hips and goggling at her ruined hull which towered over them biggern a third rate anyways the east indiaman once named the lord clive lay rolled over on her starboard side with her bows driven into the kneedeep shallows and her forefoot cutwater and bluff bows now halfsunken into the soft sand of the beach while the rest of her extended out into the water of the bay her stern underwater up to the counter under the stern walks that her bestpaying passengers had enjoyed local scavengers had salvaged most of her forward hull planks already those they could reach without a boat so her ribs frames knees and carline posts showed in the gaps theyd torn clear from her larboard side to starboard where crushed frames could be seen after her grounding on the whittle rocks even as mr andries de witts caravan was unpacking and setting up camp on the low bluffs above the beach diehard local boers sawed and pried on her forward half even redoubling their efforts before the newcome interlopers could decide to run them off damned shame lewrie said to the bosun as he joined him beside the wreck looking up at her great bulk what dye make her mister pendarves one hundred eighty feet on the range of the deck perhaps fourtyeight feet abeam summat near that aye capm pendarves said with a sage nod big as an eightygunner or a sir william sladedesigned seventyfour o th large class biggern th common class for certain sir shell have one hell of a rudder and sternpost then lewrie surmised might take a deal of cutting and trimming down aye sir but well do er long as its in decent condition ah here come our boats i believe lewrie pointed out as a group of three rather large cutters came near them from the docks at simons town mr goosen stood in the bows of the lead boat waving talk about your bookends lewrie thought with a scowl of his own as he walked down to the hardpacked sand of the lower beach both of em bad bargains crooked as a dogs hind leg still reminding himself that beggars cant be choosers he waved and smiled in similar enthusiastic fashion to greet goosens arrival ach dere be goosen andries de witt cried from his left side bookends indeed both were squat solid and stout both florid of face and balding and both sported beards so thick they looked like a brace of owls in an ivy bush all lewrie could normally make out of their features were thick and meaty lipswhich they licked with sly relish whenever he enquired about costsand pale blue eyes gut morning kaptein lewrie goosen bellowed ashore flapping his widebrimmed hat in the air you see we heff boats and i am speaking vit de leading burghers of simons town to assure them all you vish is de rudder and they can keep the rest of the wreck oh ja very good mister goosen lewrie shouted back cupping hands to his mouth can we board your boat and take a look at the rudder right away sir ah ja climb aboard tis big aye bosun pendarves commented again minutes later after the cutter had been secured under the lord clives stern counter the locallyhired dutch crewowner and helmsman and two younger lads who seemed to bear an uncanny resemblance to goosen and de wittfound a quiet spot rightaft by the tiller and took themselves a wellearned nap the doings of rooinek british sailors no concern of theirs mr pendarves got out his long wooden ruler and mr garroway proteuss carpenter produced a long hank of knotmarked and inkruled twine for long minutes they hemmed and ahummed over the great rudder which hung as far over as its gudgeons and faying pieces would allow as if the last helm order had been to put it hardover thankfully it still seemed to be in one piece abovewater at least and all pintles and gudgeons in reach had held firm through the grounding and still supported the rudder without evident strain four foot even i make it bosun pendarves announced at last four foot even allow th hances foreandaft oak main piece fir sacrifice boards an all garroway did her builders follow ol navy fashion thatd mean shed widen tfive foot seven inch at th sole what dye make it buckley garroway asked one of his junior mates who had shinnied up the greenslimed main piece to the gallery above where the upper stock entered the overhanging counter two foot two inches wide mister garroway the carpenters mate called down two foot four inch foreandaft an th tiller mortices look sound too nothin sprung fum wot i kin see means the main piece would taper to four inches wide at the sole then garroway said with a satisfied grunt and nod we need a stock tbe one foot six inches the sole tbe three inches wide we can plane that down easy enough hey aye pendarves agreed lost in their own little arcane world we carry a stock o one foot eight inch front tback an planes an adzesll take care o that whether shes wormed though he said finding a new fret to frown over and digging into a canvas bucket full of odds and ends then produced a small drillauger with which to take a few sample bores from the exposed portion of the rudders main piece taller than we need the carpenter pointed out shorten the stock thats easy cut new mortices for th tiller bars aye pendarves agreed alow th olduns make me calmer in mind dwe do that stronger the bosun muttered happily drilling away ship this size fits seven sets o pintles an gudgeons proteus fits five so well haveta bore fresh boltholes too an that makes me even gladder strip the fir trailingedge timber off plane the main piece to a taper garroway speculated and might lop a bit off the sole as well so shes even with our sternpost uhum pendarves dreamily replied salvage the copper disks tween pintles and gudgeon holes goes without sayin our old sternpost though aye theres yer bugger take a morticed block from thisun and shiv it into ours or rip this bigger post clean off trim it down and replace ours do ye think garroway asked be a bitch that but might be stronger all in all aha pendarves cried sounding very pleased he withdrew his drillauger and carefully cupped a palmful of oak shavings as bright fresh and wormfree as the best seasoned inframe timber from an english dockyard capm sir i do allow we got ourselves a sound rudder marvellous lewrie crowed all but ready to swing his hat in the air and cry huzzah though after a long look up the rudder how heavy dye think it is though mister pendarves he asked in a soberer voice and how the devil do we get the damned thing off in one piece well hmmm from both pendarves and garroway i knew it couldnt be this easy lewrie told himself indeed it wasnt first off mr goosens javanese divers had to swim down to survey that part of the rudder that lay underwater and in what condition the unseen pintles and gudgeons were the locals had already taken the long straight tillers so temporary new ones had to be cut so they could turn the rudder while it hung at its precarious angle uncontrolled when they attempted to hoist it free of the gudgeons its great weight could crush or kill someone hoisting chains had to be rigged from above thick cables run from the chains to the after capstan and new bars fashioned to insert into it for the local boers had taken those as well the sacrificial trailingedge pieces of fir had to be stripped off to lighten it the hard and waterresistant elm dowel pins saved for later use and that took many dives by the javanese too so they could hammer them out while several feet down and holding their breath the triangular strips of bearding elm from the centreline of the sternpost and the forward edge of the rudder also had to be removed with care so they could employ them on proteus too involving even more diving and lewries money a hole had to be drilled through both the leading edge and trailing edge of the rudders sole and ropes threaded through them led up either side of the stern to the jeer bitts and belayed when that massive weight was hoisted free there had to be some way of controlling its swinging and half of lewries workingparty would be tailing onto those lines while another half would be breasting to the new capstan bars and as mr goosen explained trying to drill underwater was a long laborious process where one turn on a drillauger could rotate the worker off his feet unless anchored with a weight on the bottom and loops of line where he could snag his toes naturally all that took days longer than goosen had estimated with a resultant increase in the final cost as did the cost of keeping mr de witts waggons beasts and kaffir workers idly waiting for the rudder to be recovered and trekked back to cape town as frustrating as the delay was lewrie found that camping out on the bluffs could be enjoyable so long as precautions were made against snakes spiders scorpions and other nasty native buggers simons bay and false bay were wide and yawningly empty and the surf was calm on all but the worst days a firm stiff wind swirled in cooling even the hottest part of the day and allinall lewrie found the climate near the th latitude so mild and invigourating the sound of the surf raling on the beach so pacific and the dawns so cool and bracing that lewrie began to think of the cape as a prickly sort of paradise late each afternoon after the javanese divers were exhausted and the sunlight on the waters slanted at too great an angle for them to see what they were doing all work ceased but for camp chores and experiments by sailors off proteus at fishing halving off in watchversuswatch to stage a football match on the hardpacked lower beach or lounging about like the aforesaid lotus eaters after a refreshing dip in the surf themselves careful to keep an eye out for sharks which were reputed to teem in southern african waters and were of an especially vicious maneating nature or snoozing in the shade of a tent fly til mess chores summoned them lewrie had his horse and had fetched along his lighter fusil musket for a piddling fee andries de witt offered him the loan of a young boer by name of piet dutoit as a hunting guide and lewrie got into the habit of riding out into the countryside each afternoon with the lanky thatchhaired boer in search of game settled as the lower cape below the cederburgs and drakensburgs were as neatly dutchorderly as the farmland appeared game was still plentiful and with the larger predators driven out by years of pest or trophy hunting decentsized herds of ungulants had prospered with the lions absence and every day ended with something for the pot piet dutoit wasnt the most talkative fellow but he did enjoy pointing out a few cautions on their rides how to spot puff adders or black mambas how to scan trees very warily for the slim green treedwelling boomslang that was so poisonous both versions of cobras to avoid the cape cobra that bit and chewed its venom into a wound and the rinkhals that could spit death into ones eyes a goodly distance they ran across a bewildering array of beasts such as rhebok reedbok red hartebeest steenbok and klipspringer wee duikers and grysbok larger elands and impalas and god only knew whatall piet dutoit boasted that this was nothing for north beyond the cederburg range out in the great karoo savannahs and vlies there were bigger creatures kudu and wildebeest cape buffalo giraffes hippos and rhinoceros warthogs zebras and elephants and the kings of all the lions dutoit would go there he swore once he found a properly sweet wife and amassed enough money for waggons oxen horses guns and kaffir slaves hed find a wellwatered spot break ground with the plough and start raising his herds and flocks and if that land played out or he got bored thered always be something even grander to see a weeks trek farther along town life was so boresome and confining no place to raise a brood of a dozen children the bird life was equally fascinating to lewrie both the ones worth shooting and those too grand to eat for the countryside teemed with them too ostriches and tall dignified secretary birds kori bustards that looked too big to fly but did cattle egrets and red oxpeckers hornbills storks ibises a dozen varieties of eagles hawks and owls kites buzzards falcons kestrels and goshawks on the gentler side there were hoopoes and louries the lilacbreasted rollers bee eaters glossy and plumcoloured starlings the waxbills that came in either yellow blue or violet red bishops and jewellike sunbirds and the maricos that came in their own palette of vivid colours for shooting there were redeyed doves laughing doves ringnecked cape turtledoves and namaqua doves helmeted guinea fowl crested francolins and sandgrouse moorhens egyptian geese yellowbill or whitefaced ducks cape teals even flamingos which only the richest ancient romans had eaten that ended on lewries plate though young dutoit was the better shot with a doublebarreled fowling gun nailing three for each one that lewrie brought down there were anteaters and honey badgers or ratels as the boers called them mongooses and four kinds of smaller hunting cats civets and genets which were closer to mongooses than true cats servals and caracals and jackals and cape foxes and bateared foxes and if lewrie ever wished to take a real hunting trip he could bring back pelts and masks from leopards cheetahs and lions for a reasonable fee of course piet dutoit swore he could outfit him with anything he wished tentage bearers and cooks bodyservants waggons spirits and gunpowder even a string quartet if he wished some people i know have hired a guide and gone on an inland hunt lewrie remarked one afternoon as they watered their horses by a small stream those circus folk who staged those shows those stupid rooineks dutoit harshly laughed between bites off a strip of biltong a sundried meat of unknown source the gut god help them myhneer for they go vit jan van der merwe blieve that was the name they mentioned aye lewrie slowly allowed his curiosity up and stirring why whats wrong with this van der merwe machtig myhneer what is right dutoit scoffed back with sour mirth a sham is he a captain sharp lewrie asked further dont know this kaptein sharp kerel you speak of myhneer a sham oh ja jan van der merwe is what you call joke he could get lost in a field of mealies cannot trail smoke back to a campfire once he think he tame hyenas thinking they are just another kind of big puppydog haw haw those circus people mean to hunt out in the vlies they have no need of guide to find game just ride far enough they will see thousands of beasts an hour only need kaffirs to butcher and skin drove oxen to bring back pelt and ivory set up the camps and cook you see any fool can boss camp kaffirs know just enough bantu to tell them what to do ha van der merwe cannot speak proper dutch much less they were ah more of a mind to capture animals than hunt for trophies lewrie explained to add to their menagerie and such real zebras stead o tartedup donkeys elephants to ride and train to do tricks lion cubs to raise african elephant dutoit gasped in true shock raising his voice higher than his usual cautious fieldmutter african elephant is not like the indian myhneer try to train them they stomp you in ground then mash you to soup badtempered beasts good only for the shooting and ivory and anyone think to steal cubs from a pride of lions they end up eaten to the bone and their bones cracked bones end as playthings for those cubs thought it sounded a touch daft lewrie replied machtig god dutoit exclaimed those people tell that fool van der merwe that is what they plan they pay him good money for him as guide you never see them again kaptein lewrie rooinek idiots even so i feel sorry for them what is a rooinek mister dutoit lewrie felt pressed to ask though the picture of arslan durschenko being gnawed down to splinters was intriguing ah rooineck in cape dutch means red neck kaptein his guide matteroffactly decyphered well perhaps with a tiny touch of arch amusement in his eyes your british soldiers come here we see their tight red collars the colour they turn in the sun too you see what we say instead of british more biltong no thankee ive eat sufficient lewrie replied thinking it odd that he wasnt offended uhm what is biltong made of then it puts me in mind of venison or beef jerky as the american indians i met called it but ja it is any kind of game meat dutoit told him though he seemed suddenly distracted moved very slowly and carefully and felt behind him for his musket his eyes fixed on something beyond cape buffalo old cow anything smoked lewrie asked dried in the sun maybe with nets to keep the bugs off get your musket ready myhneer slowly dutoit instructed in a harsh whisper take the reins of your horse too gently and do not spook him before the crocodiles do if you wish to ride back to camp croc lewrie gawped fighting the urge to whirl about and shout something nigh to holy shit his horse had drunk its fill and had grazed over to some green grass so it never even noticed the crocodile as big as a louisianans cypresslog pirogue that had stealthily slunk off the far bank of the stream about a musketshot above them and had let itself be wafted by the faint current to close pistolshot only its hornyscaled head and eyes visible rub em with spices lewrie asked once they were saddled up and paced out of snapping distance crocodile dutoit gawped turning to look quizzically at him biltong lewrie said some do cheap is it very cheap myhneer dutoit replied might make a nice change from saltmeat junk aboard my ship lewrie speculated and ive my two cats to feed does it keen lone months kaptein better and better lewrie enthused but it by the bale id expect by the hundredweight soak it in water you can add it to bredies soups stews dutoit suggested but myhneer why buy when you can shoot your own and i can dry it for you for a very cheap price that is he added with an avariciously sly grin we start now kaptein small herd of steenbok there he whispered pointing at something only he could see at about half a mile or so for lewrie couldnt spot them at all get up close leave the horses and creep up there dutoit decided after licking a finger to determine the direction of the wind take one each we will have a nice small roast tonight and cousin andriess kaffirs can prepare you the rest as biltong in two days hundredweight as you say between the pair and steenbok doe is tender ja i knew he was another damn cousin lewrie told himself might need a third for the hands supper lewrie speculated i have second musket dutoit smugly told him patting a scabbard under his saddle three steenbok it could be we try aye lets lewrie agreed with a feral grin the brace of steenbok didnt cause the sensation in camp that evening surprisingly dutoit had missed with his second shot once the steenbok had been startled into great springing bounds and leaps and darting evasions at the crack of musket firerather it was the crocodile tailmeat that theyd fetched in once theyd decided to go back and bag it after all lewrie and his guide had both shot it in the head at the same time within two inches of each other so the skull was ruined for a trophy but the largest teeth were still impressive as was the stillmoist hide the black waggoners bearers and cooks had sprung on it to stake it out for drying in the sun along with the steenboks they had fielddressed and one of them swore he could string those teeth into a quite nice necklace if baas lewrie wished heathen savage but nice along with the slices of roast steenbok there were treats that the burghers and women of simons town had come to sell now that they were over their sulks at rooineks camping out too near their proper and tidy boer settlement and helping themselves to part of the wreck that was theirs by right they vended more bredies and mutton boboties more sumatran or javanese satays along with pipinghot fresh breads and syrupy sweet baked koeksisters or pies along with the viands though so lewrie learned there had come strong and hearty dutch beer some local rum some of the rawer sort of cape wines and that ginclear dutch peril that tangletongue akavit sound a tad too mehearty mister pendarves lewrie scoffed once he got the bosun off to one side for a hearttoheart the last thing he needed with the ships hands off ashore and given much ease from their unremitting daily schedule was too much drink riot and mutiny were the worst he could expect the least would be people kept on such strict spirit rations drinking themselves into insensibility and uselessness on the morrow given the slightest opportunity that mister goosen and mister de witt told the locals that theyd best not get em too hot sir pendarves cautiously laid out in his own defence small bottles an such an mister gamble an i been keepin a wary eye on th trade too sir god above mister pendarves lewrie spat to the dutch its a patriotic duty tfuddle their occupiers without the masteratarms and ships corporals the marines theyll go witless if they get even a touch drunk cant keep th men from all spirits sir pendarves pointed out beggin yer pardon an all half a pint o beer with supper a tot o wine stead o their reglar rum issue well maybe along with th rum but me an mister gamble warned em stern capm anybody gets rowdy tis my good right fist hell be eatin along with is teeth they dont have much coin sir an th dutch dont give credit so they couldnt buy all that much besides what little the dutchies brung theyre chargin an arm and a leg for so most o our lads cant afford a good drunk an the dutchies camped out near us aint of a mind tshare like capm youve had no trouble then lewrie wondered aloud dubious but slightly relieved by what hed heard so far well we did have a couple o fights sir pendarves admitted looking cuttyeyed but mister gamble jumped tween em before it got outta hand an said did they want tfight do it proper an form a ring for em referee an all and wagers laid so it turned more a sportin show sir how did the fights turn out then lewrie asked snickering and revising his alreadygood opinion of his oldest midshipman a little higher both ended in draws sir pendarves told him with a twinkle in his eyes not much damage done and i gave em all a good duckin in th surf after then swore to em theyd be doin th most work come mornin an the samed go for anyone who got so drunk that i took notice sir my compliments to mister gamble and to you mister pendarves lewrie said satisfied by their bareknuckled solution just be sure you prowl about before lights out and see them bedded down properly and mostly sober hear me aye aye sir carry on then mister pendarves lewrie said before heading off to his own tent for a scrubdown and a hot supper chapter twentyfour it took far longer than anyones rosy estimates but the work at last was done the massive rudder and sternpost of the lord clive was off the bronze fittings bolts elm dowels and bearding strips labelled with paint and itemised for later use and everything packed up in the waggons it was a wellfed sunbronzed and muchrefreshed workingparty of tars that slowly trundled back into the outskirts of kaapstad the unsprung waggons clattering axles squealing and ox teams farting and lowing goosens chandlery would receive the reclaimed materials into a beachfront works yard where both lewries specialist petty officers and their crews and yet another set of cousinspaul riebeck who was reputed to be a skilled carpenter and his metalworking brother hendrikwould set up their forges anvils and tools to assist the hands off proteus in cutting down shaping and planing the lord clive rudder down and manufacturing new bronze and iron fittings all that for a most reasonable fee it went without saying lewrie turned things over to midshipman gamble and mr pendarves sure that cousin andries de witt knew the way to that works yard with his eyes shut and for them to send word to the ship that they were now back turning his horse aside lewrie rode up the steep curving road of the lions rump to the tidy farm cottage where his wounded men were recuperating alls well he asked their emigre french surgeons mate mr maurice durant who came out to greet him on the windswept slopes three hands are still poorly captain durant said with a most gallic shrug as they stepped into the shade of the deep galleries that fronted each side of the rented farmhouse suppuration from the oiled oak splinters that caused their wounds i am sorry to say the rest are still too stiff for even light duties i am also sorry to relate sir but they are healing and whitbread lewrie enquired about one of his black sailors quel dommage he has gone away from us captain durant sadly related reverting to the old french expression for death lieutenant langlie was informed and saw to his burying wellwrapped in a canvas shroud n estce pas he said with a conspiratorial wink and nod that young english rector suspected nozzing and now samuel whitbread is interred beside his shipmates and fellow escapees poor fellow a great pity though now there are only seven of the black fellows left from your humanitarian gesture captain nine lewrie insisted as durant helped him dip an oak bucket of water from a butt on the gallery porch for his horse non captain seven durant corrected as if it was of no matter the lean young marksman who calls himself rodney and the one who calls himself groome who tried to ride the sham zebras they have run lieutenant langlie tells me run lewrie snapped deserted mine arse on a the cirque the circus people who go into the wilds durant calmly went on offering lewrie a copper dipper of water too groome and rodney were ashore on liberty when the circus party departed but they never return to the ship i gather from what lieutenant langlie learn that they had hung about the circus menagerie and talk often to msieur wigmore and their guide a local boer van der merwe lewrie spat ships cook he tell lieutenant langlie that several wished to be in circus captain durant said with another fatalistic shrug groome believeed he could be elephant tamer or rider handle horses and real zebras even be an actor if they do shakespeares othello rodney he say he is the crack shot good as any and wish to shoot the great beasts of africa his native land after all perhaps perform in circus with guns like mistress eudoxia lion tamer durschenko him aye lewrie growled drinking off half of the dipper and swirling the rest to rinse it before heaving the rest over the railing before he injure his eye he was the crack shot aussi he tell me durant went on as if desertion was an everyday occurrence nothing to get exercised about for it had nothing to do with his specialties he come to me when he learn i was once the physician trained in paris to see if his eye was hopeless quel dommage there is nozzing anyone may do to restore his sight but that flapeyed bastard whatd he tell you lewrie demanded instantly suspecting that luring some of his sailors to desert was the mans way of getting back at him if putting one of his daggers in his heart was not in the immediate offing he does say when i treat him that such a hunt will be one of lifes grand adventures captain though the danger is aussi the great so as many guns who go along will be welcome he suggest i think i might enjoy such with him hawn hawn durant said with the nasal sort of laugh of which only the french seemed capable he rode up here lewrie pressed hoping that durschenko had no idea being a foreigner that black sailors werent all that common in the royal navy not in such numbers aboard a single ship or that burying them alongside whites was heavily frowned upon else he d be crowing it from the rooftops t spite me lewrie fretfully thought or if groome rodney one of the others blabbed about how i got em i lured em away did he lewrie griped that is very possible captain durant agreed with the calm of a saint which to lewrie was becoming maddening mine arse on a bandbox lewrie exclaimed stomping about the gallery all but ready to flap his arms in anger didnt the idiots know that the dutch keep slaves here same as jamaica that theyre trading one set o chains for another once theyre far enough away in the wilds where the trekboers can do anything they like with em perhaps they assumed that they were under the protection of that msieur wigmore durant said and if he performed just one more of his damned shrugs lewrie would not be responsible for his actions or that msieur durschenko would prevent that if they were going as free black men employed by the circus captain damn damn hell and damn lewrie cried in a stew for there was no way short of organising a hunting trip of his own to get them back and he was already several hands short and what guarantee was there that galloping a pressgang to go after them might not result in even more freespirited hands even marines thinking that the merry life of the trekboers was infinitely better than that of an overworked underfed and underpaid jolly british jack there was no way to prevent it captain durant tried to console you were away and could not have known lieutenant langlie or the ozzer officers could not have known their intentions beforehand lizz either doesnt matter dammit lewrie gravelled it was his fault whatever occurred for good or ill was always the captains responsibility hereof nor you nor any of you may fail as you will answer the contrary at your peril it said near the bottom of his commission a phrase the navy was rather keen on bleakly lewrie thought that the best he could do for the next week or so would be to see to the ships repair no matter how tempting it would be to hare after his deserters and haul them back in irons do they survive captain durant continued in his maddeningly serene voice you may arrest them on their return nestce pas well there is that lewrie bitterly allowed slouching with his hands resting on the gallery railing and staring out at table bay not that their present absence does the rest of our people any good i might have to cancel shore liberty til we have em back before any more of our hands think to emulate em replacing the rudder and the sternpostll keep em busy enough for a while but much as i find it loathsome ill have to have those two at the gratings he thought give em both fourdozen lashes apiece just to drive the lesson home tone and all you will see the wounded captain durant asked aye i will what i rode up for lewrie began to say but took closer notice of table bay before he swung back to face durant there was a new ship anchored near green point inside the encircling peninsula and even more ships were entering the bay just starting to round green point even without a telescope he could make out a few identifying details in the clear air so far up above the haze of cape towns hearth and workshop fires the arriving ships appeared to be five east indiamen escorted by a lone twodecker and the anchored ship seemed to be flying the distinctive postboy flag of a mailpacket a red ensign sporting a union flag in the canton with the hornblowing rider on a horse that filled the rest of the fly a convoy coming in lewrie muttered ah oui durant replied cheering up as he came to lewries side by the gallery overlooking the wide bay too soon i am told for ships from england so this must be a convoy from china or india i hope msieur hodson or i may go aboard them while they are here to ask of ingredients for fresh medicines oil of cloves is and the mailpacket lewrie asked what of her oh she came in yesterday durant answered i trust there are letters from madelaine and our babes for a time both hodson and i had to be up here to tend our wounded but now their care is not so urgent msieur hodson returned aboard proteus leaving me with only three loblolly boys he gently complained his old plaint of being a bettereducated and trained physician serving under a sawbones surgeon i would ask should you discover any mail forme done and done lewrie assured him half his attention still on the incoming ships well let us go and visit our hurt men once thats done ill sort through our mail and send a midshipman up here with anything for you or our patients sir merci captain merci beaucoup i think i can trust a midshipman not trun off with the circus lewrie grimly told himself chapter twentyfive welcome back aboard sir lt langlie said once the salutes of the sideparty and officers were done might i enqire if the hunt went well it did indeed mister langlie lewrie gleefully told him as they began to walk aft together the rudder and sternpost are sound as the pound and now in the local contractors yard a week or three more and well be completely ready for sea again excellent news sir langlie enthused whats happened aboard now two of our black sailors have run lewrie asked him and how did that happen i stopped all shore liberty since sir langlie reported turning sombre my fault sir should have seen it coming what with that mountebank wigmore beguiling them perhaps as early as our stop at saint helena i now gather when they return if they return well have to make examples of em mister langlie lewrie grimly announced was wigmore after any of the others the more exotic the better i believe sir langlie replied playact as hindoo mahouts should they get themselves some elephants trick them out as eunuchs or turk swordsmen for one of his plays or the circus parades but i also have ascertained that the rest of our sailors thought it a daft idea and rightly reckoned the consequences of desertion especially in a land that keeps native blacks as slaves and makes war on the rest sir good lewrie declared relieved to hear it mister durant tells me a mailpacket has come in was there anything for us scads sir lt langlie said brightening and may i convey my congratulations captain ive quickened another babe somewhere in the world he thought in confusion ive inherited all of surrey you have me at a loss sir lewrie said to that the latest captains list sir langlie gushed your name now appears among those of more than three years seniority you may board your second epaulet well damn my eyes lewrie replied after a stunned moment then began to chuckle with all thats occurred lately the date that i was posted quite slipped my mind thankee for that news mister langlie a ream of officialese from admiralty too i spose all your letters are in your clerks possession sir awaiting you in your cabins langlie told him very well sir lewrie said eager to be at them for with a slew of official documents there might be personal letters from home as well word from twigg or that gaggle of earnest dogooders who had sworn to defend his good name ill be aft and below do you in the meantime see to victualling arrangements for our shore workingparty and send a lieutenant along to supervise the work when it begins on the morrow aye aye sir hello lads lewrie cooed as toulon and chalky swarmed him miss me did ye yes i smell exotic dont i african dirt blood and meat aint it tasty yes love you too toulon lewrie told the blackandwhite ramcat as he knelt down allowing both of them to sniff him raise up on their hind legs to rub chins on his clothes and make snoring noises over such blissful new scents welcome back sir aspinall happily said will ye be havin a sip o somethin a scrubup theres lashins o fresh water comes aboard every mornin enough for a hipbath do ye care for it and ive your workinrig uniform fresh as a daisy when ye call for it cool teall take no more than half an hour too sir should have taken you along aspinall lewrie said as chalky swarmed up his thigh to scrub the side of his little head on his chin and start to snuffle his hair i could have used a bit of civilised seeingto ah a spongedown first aye a gallon of water if that much is aboard two gallons and ill wash africa out of my scalp too ow chalky here lad biltong he beguiled as the newest cats affection turned nippish lewrie reached into a pocket of his slop trousers and pulled out two strips of dried springbok wrapped in a handkerchief wild game meat lads could have brought it down yourselves im certain but you can pretend smell good hmm taste it toulon ooh yes he tore a strip into wee bites feeding both cats a bit or two from his fingertips as they swished their tails rose up on their hind legs again and went frantic meowing loudly for more ive two hundredweight coming aboard aspinall lewrie said still on his knees well have to find a safe place to store it else they might founder on it the first dark night ill think o somethin sir hot waters on the way lewrie rose at last and went to his desk where he discovered a fairsized mound of correspondence sorted out by his clerk padgett into official mustreadfirst personal and newspapers bills and a slushpile of whocares and futuretoiletnecessities surprisingly the official pile was rather small the most of it those sort of directives sent out at quarterly or halfyear intervals to every warship in active commission and yes it was delightful to pore over the captains list to see his own name among those whod lived long enough and hadnt come a cropper with the beginnings of real seniority down at the bottom of that list even so but his name was finally there and lewrie could smugly note about a quarter of the names above his did not command ships or hold active commissions he had to stop and play some more with the cats reach into the larboard pocket of his trousers and dig out another strip of biltong with which to placate them before he could pore over the list for the names of friends or foes keith ashburn a fellow midshipman in was listed in the lower third in command of a frigate francis forrester that fubsy fart with all the interest and patronage was above keith now pestering the crew of his own fifth rate his old captain in the far east ayscough was near the top of the list with a twodecker dropping down to commanders he found that midshipman hogue of those far east adventures under ayscough had just taken command of one of those newfangled brigsloops and even more pleasingly his first officer into hms jester lt knolles had been promoted into a sloop of war with an epaulet on his shoulder too far down though there was kenyon damn his blood that windward passage bugger was now a commander too eres your hot water sir aspinall announced as he and seaman bannister staggered into the greatcabins each bearing two gallon buckets and lewries reveries ended for a time it was only after he was squeaky clean his hair trimmed and still slightly damp and clad in a freshsmelling uniform that lewrie started in on his personal correspondence there was a nice selection from which to choose a thick letter from theoni kavares connor the mother of his bastard son in london even one from his halfcherokee bastard son who was now a midshipman in the fledging united states navy his actual offspring sewallis hugh and charlotte had written him too there was one from the trencher family he had met in london one from his wife caroline wonder of wonders one from sir malcolm shockley one of his patrons in the house of commons but there was a very thick packet from zachariah twigg and despite his desire for news of his family his real family he felt himself drawn to it despite himself lewrie undid the bindings letting the travelstained covering fall open to reveal a stack of newspapers bound in twine with a folded letter atop it all he opened the letter very carefully using only the tips of his fingers as if handling a dud exploding shell sir twiggs letter began our cause advances most promisingly though i must in good conscience confess that the enthusiasm of your abolitionist allies quite took me by surprise and that i greatly underestimated just how much notice favourable notice mind that the publick has taken of your exploit i daresay as you may see from the enclosed papers that revd wilberforce and his associates have made of you quite the nineday wonder and your freeing of slaves in the caribbean the talk of the city as the odious french might say you and your cause are become a cause celebre oh my god lewrie groaned aloud damn their it is possible that general napoleon bonapartes recent escape from his failed egyptian expedition and his most recent accession to power once back in paris may be the greater news at present but you do run him a close second twigg went on you are lauded should that be the correct way to put it by the sobriquet which i supplied them of ramcat lewrie the publick and the newspaper scribblers making the obvious mistake of imagining that ramcat represents your belligerent nature when confronting our foes at sea instead of what we both know as more representative of your lascivious proclivities you will find from the abolitionists tracts which i included however that you are now equally spoken of as black alan lewrie or emancipation lewrie and the hero of the hour mine arse on a bandbox if i am lewrie shakily growled he had no idea it would come to this what happened to subtle defence all this was prompted twigg continued by a letter which i received from mister peel on jamaica peel continues to thrive by the by and expressed to me that i should convey to you his utmost respect and best wishes it would seem that the beauman family from whom you stole those dozen slaves for seamen had finally coerced or beaten enough evidence from the other slaves remaining on their plantation on portland bight to discover the hows and whens and most especially the identity of their thief peel warned that the beaumans intend to pursue the matter in a court of law and are not to be dissuaded from their purpose by any means at peels disposal he would stand ready to initiate extralegal means to thwart them though he fears any such action on his part might not redound to your discredit should word of it reach england they have engaged a prominent colonial barrister in kingston who is i learn soon to be despatched to london where he is to lay charges on his own or further engage lawyers who deal in kings bench cases to either assist him or take upon themselves the matter entire by the time you are in receipt of this letter he may already be there im ruined im done for lewrie felt like shrieking im hung publick opinion in your favour though has most likely prejudiced their suit before the case may be laid twigg further wrote to reassure him a legal friend of mine and old schoolmate who sits on kings bench cases explained to me that you have the right under english common law to be confronted by your accusers in the flesh and not by dry affidavit as well as by witnesses which will require the beaumans perhaps their whole odious clan to sail to england for the proceedings a requirement they should have been told by their legal representative on jamaica in the first place or shall soon learn to their further distress equally witnesses to testify to your perfidy must include slaves from that plantation and what a cunning defence council may make of their living conditions punishments victuals and the means the beaumans applied to force confessions from them will be the finest grist for the abolitionists mill were i a beauman bent upon revenge against you i should think twice before appearing such a despicable ogre for all the world to see lewrie raised one eyebrow as he fantasised hugh beauman in the dock squirming in anger and arrogance as a sharp barrister took him to task whilst the gallery perhaps the judges too openly wept over the slaves testimonies all england swayed to freeing every ive been had again lewrie suddenly thought with a gasp the abolitionists could have mounted a silent subtle defence but had they really looked upon him that morning he had walked into the trenchers parlour as a test case the very sort of cause celebre which would sway public opinion to demand emancipation for slaves in the british empire have i been their bread cast upon the waters he had to ask himself their sacrificial baalamb it works im a hero not hung if it fails theyll weep a bit then try again with someone else and im a martyr to their cause christ shit on a and why lewrie suddenly wondered feeling that such erudition on his part had come much too late did zachariah twigg write to me so quickly am i his damned catspaw again he knew just exactly whom to approach the conniving devious old secret abolitionist why he mightve been one of em for years in on it from the first now glowing with anger lewrie returned to twiggs letter conversely you may not be tried in absentia which will require your presence a circumstance subject to the whim of admiralty and an advantage greatly in your favour so long as the navy needs you at sea in command of a frigate delaying the confrontation for years during which your allies the reformers and abolitionists may continue to beat the drum and keep the matter of emancipation in publick notice i knew it lewrie growled i just knew well no dammit not til now i didnt but damme he spat sopping sweat off his forehead this has of course required us to engage legal representation for you and with the aid of your solicitor mister matthew mountjoy and his good advice succeeded in engaging one mister andrew macdougall esquire one of the finest upandcoming legal minds in england he is one of those canny edinborough scots usually thought to be just too clever by half but in your cause such sharp and clever wit may prove to be vital twigg continued do not dread the costs for i am assured by reverend wilberforce the trenchers and others that a campaign will be launched to gather donations towards your defence so this necessity might not touch your purse too dearly not too dear for gods sake lewrie bleakly croaked with a cringe imagining all his prizemoney being shovelled down a rathole of ending penniless homeless and on halfpay and that was if he prevailed the scandal would be too great as if it already wasnt and the hour after his vindication the navy would chuck him out the servants entrance like a drunk at closing time and did they feel a keen vindictiveness a courtmartial for conduct unbecoming would make even halfpay moot unless for a mad moment lewrie contemplated wigmores circus three of his black hands were now dead and gone already and two more now run he wondered what sort of deal he could strike with wigmore to hireon the rest so when he sailed back to england he could respond with what stolen slaves you see any maybe he could learn to ride horses standing up on their backs and jump through flaming hoops juggle or portray naval characters in dramas no comedies would be better more apt there was more to come in twiggs long letter and he returned to it though by now he dreaded what else the man might have arranged support for our cause in parliament is building quite nicely too i assure you no matter the seeming criminality of your actions your chiefest patron in the commons sir malcolm shockley has spoken most eloquently for you and has gathered round him not only some of the leading lights from his own growing faction but many of the upandcoming reformist sorts such as sir samuel whitbread and many of the crowns own faction given the best face official government has put upon our recent debacle on saintdomingue in which you played a part and the publick pronouncements of congratulations to the former slaves of that colony who rose up and rebelled against the cruel state in which their former french masters kept themcynical and false though such pronouncements werethe ruling faction cannot appear the twofaced janus and condemn one of their sea officers who freed a dozen slaves no matter how ilegally or be called down as hypocrites those voices in commons condemning you therefore are mostly from the shipping and sugar interests whose only god is mammon and rest assured that sir malcolm and others have made certain that everyone in great britain knows their venality for what it is a great many who might condemn your actions and call for your immediate return to face charges have muted themselves else they are tarred the same even in lords a body usually much more conservative and hidebound than the commons you have found remarkably supportive voices speaking to the justification of your deed rather than to the cutanddried facts of common thievery among them your old schoolmate lord peter rushton of all henheaded wonders your deed has been interpreted as a bold geste a blow struck for human freedom as you will note when you see the newspaper articles and the many letters written upholding your actions im told that homilies and sermons have been preached hed had enough of twigg for the moment so he turned to that pile of newspapers and tracts and if he thought things were horrid then he rapidly discovered what horrid really was the times the gazette even the marine chronicles latest numbers featured articles about him not one of which actually got the facts right or made things up out of whole cloth though they werent that condemnatory and most of the letters to the editors sounded like the bulk of the writers somehow approved england after all didnt much care for slavery if britons never never never shall be slaves then why should anyone else and only foreigners meaning spaniards and other assorted evil types did it didnt they slave labour was something that happened far overseas and even if englishmen did keep slaves in the sugar isles our sort of slavery couldnt be all that bad could it compared to dons dagoes and frogs the lesser papers though and the tracts good god every one of them splashed a copy of a large woodcut drawing on its front a fantastic picture of a bareheaded lewrie in full uniform storming a minor fort of utter evil with a huge sword much like fabled king arthurs excalibur in one hand and a knightcrusader shield on his other arm bearing a shining christian cross and the word freedom on its face the bloated and knobbyfaced villains atop the ramparts were as ogreish as anyone could wish cringing and tearing at their hair as they directed a legion of skeletons garbed most remarkably like french grenadiers to oppose him as he the artistic lewrie actually was depicted leading a band of winged angels for gods sake little ribbons of captions led from the villains mouths with tis only business ye meddlesome upstart and curses on him whod come tween us and our money and other statements sure to rile the average reader at lewries feet knelt several grateful blacksthose not impaled on the evil minions bayonetsexpressing the most pitiful expressions of thankfulness for even a few of them being liberated a selection of phrases that made lewrie cringe in embarrassment and squirm in his chair god above they got cruikshank tdo it lewrie gawped aloud when he took note of the wee signature beneath the artwork no wonder the villains resembled the worst aspects of that artists depictions of his stockcharacter john bull no one had loaned cruikshank a portrait to copy though thank god so saint alan the immaculate or so the scribbles on his coat stated bore an uncanny likeness to horatio nelson kicking bonapartes fundament though lewrie thought that cruikshank had made him both taller and more manly than that slim little minnikin must notve paid him all that much he muttered damn he pushed all that aside skimmed over the last few sentences of twiggs letter which didnt amount to much and sat back in utter misery a trip to his winecabinet was in order he decided badly rearmed with a glass of brandy he returned to his desk to see what else there was to plague him well there were letters from sewallis and hugh both of them almost made him feel much better for they were frankly proud of him all eager to leave their stultifying school and go fight the french and the evil blackbirders his father sir hugo was also complimentary noting that his and their ward sophies social invitations had increased since word of what hed done had first appeared in the newspapers though the old fart did complain that hed have to sell off his shares in a liverpool slave ship on the quiet side since the price had suddenly sunk so low and he might not have profitted from it anyway and how dare his son associate with such a wildeyed and rabid pack of hounds sure to be exposed in future in secret league with the most jacobite and levelling wing of the foxites and frenchlovers who had lost all credence after king louis and his queen had been beheaded in besides an english gentleman should not appear in the papers unless he did something glorious or noteworthy else only his birth his wedding and his demise should be grist for common reading by the lower sorts his daughter charlotte sent a onepage letter which stated that mama told me you did something heroic though extremely foolish and reckless over some black people but that is your nature as mama has ever said thank you for the dolls from heathen brazil they are very pretty though the package contained a large black and hairy spider as big as my hand before governess squished it it was most awfully good fun to chase about mama says the admiralty told her you are now in africa or india if you can find another spider i would love it if not a spider i would very much like a monkey and caroline herself well longsuffering godonlyknowswhatyouhavedonetoshameusthistime though she did note that the vicar of st georges in anglesgreen had delivered a rather impassioned for him homily about slavery and why it should be abolished throughout the realm as it was already in great britain she also noted that her brother governour chiswick a former slaveowner himself in the carolinas before the american revolution had nearly stormed out in anger had not his sweet wife millicent restrained him and that the two of them were now atloggerheads over the subject the vicar had praised their own local emancipator had almost but not quite called him a true christian gentleman which might have set off inappropriate laughter and driven caroline to storm out lewrie suspected so that almost everyone in anglesgreen now thought him a fine fellow even the local squire sir romney embleton what his otterfaced son harry thought was not recorded but then who cared a damn what harry embleton thought though our lands in the cape fear of such sweet memory were indeed worked by negro labour never in my mind can i recall an instant of such brutality as the papers describe in the sugar islands of the caribbean alan why else would old mammy and a few others of our household clew to us so fiercely and kindly and my old mammy to emigrate with us to england where til her passing she served mama and papa and me so faithfully and cheerfully even after manumission i can only pray that the accounts of the reformers and abolitionists are greatly exaggerated to foment their causes success or should they prove true that the reformers succeed for no one of our former acqaintance in north carolina a most genteel and refined society could ever have even conceived of such fiendishness evidently the planter class in the sugar isles are an utterly depraved lot bad as the tobaccochewing dregs who are now i am told populating lower portions of the old georgia colony am i too cynical or is she too naive he had to wonder at her welledited remembrances alan you have ever been a puzzlement worthy of cursing for an inveterate rogue and rakehell a jocular and slothful lackaday where an upright man would shew sobriety diligence and rectitude in his doings for a man grown you evince such a boyish indolent face to life surely such should preclude your advancement in such a demanding profession as seafaring and the navy yet you not only thrive you are become a great success and a hero i also pray that this recent beau geste of yours is a sign of you turning from folderol to rectitude that the navy has forced you to so discipline yourself in your professional and publick life that some wee bit of that discipline has at last trickled over into your private life as well had you the ability to apply but a tithe towards mastering your amatory nature our marriage would have remained a most happy one no matter now many years apart nor how many thousand miles separate us if only such were true i could own to complete approval and adoration of an heroic husband though until such is proven to me you will understand you have won but a portion of my praise you incomprehensible paradoxical everamazing man which was certainly a lot more warmth than hed gotten from her past letters lewrie decided did all england hail him as saint alan the emancipatorand they forgot that horrid black alan quickly pray god caroline might deign to accept him back in public at least were they cheered in the london theatres like horatio nelson she might stand beside him in their private box and even go so far as to wave and smile in appreciation with him though lewrie doubted if shed be gazing up at him in mute adoration exactly mostlike shed keep her eyes out for the flirty orangeseller wenches lewrie grimly thought and rip the lungs out of the first un who tried t hug me i not that i can actlly blame her still it was a start towards some sort of reconciliation but only the iciest sort and only if he came out his troubles smelling like hungary water there was a chance they might reside under the same roof again in the same bedchamber the same bed well he might have to hireon a foodtaster and sleep with one eye open for a time mother charlotte is failing alan and we despair that we may see her with us by autumn caroline related by longdistance in her homebody persona we do hear though that in response to our informations sent to burgess in india he is now of a clear mind to throw up his commission with the east india company army now that he has achieved a majority with the th native infantry your fathers old bengali regiment and with the last remnants of the tippoo sultan uprising quelled in which burgess informs us he has amassed quite the chicken nabob fortune it his greatest wish to be home with our dear mother whilst she is still well who knows perhaps his fortune will prove even greater than the one you reaped in the beyond that news there was only a formal close and an almost jocular plea that he closely inspect any packages of gifts he sent for the children in future and under no circumstances was he to send them anything living a formal setpiece of a final sentence worthy of a letter to a cornmerchant of long but armslength standing and she signed herself rather coolly simply as your wife caroline lewrie determined to write her back instanter to strike while the iron was at least lukewarm and hed write sir malcolm shockley too and ask him to delve around twiggs and the abolitionists true motives and whether he really had been set up as a sacrificable catspaw chapter twentysix it is sinkink eudoxia asked with a puzzled look as she used his telescope to study proteus as she sat at her anchors out in table bay everything we could shift is moved forrud lewrie explained to lift her stern as high out of the water as possible the divers have hammered new gudgeons in place underwater and weve spliced the sternpost above the waterline with the timber we fetched back from simons bay it just looks precarious precarious indeed for with all her artillery roundshot and victuals casks shifted up near the cable tiers the frigate sat like a badlyanchored duck decoy on the water her bows were immersed as far as her lower gunwale timbers the sea up almost as high as her hawseholes and the lowermost beakhead rails whilst proteuss stern was up as if she was a live duck ready to bob and feed off the bottom weeds of a pond it even made lewrie sweat to see it but without a dockyard and a graving dock this was the best they could do andries de witts multiple oxen team and his timber waggon had rumbled down to the piers with the new rudder where lt catterall and the bosun mr pendarves had erected a shearlegs to hoist it off the timber waggons supports then sway it out and down into a large barge another of mr goosens quite reasonable hirings it was as ungainly and squat as a fatbellied dutch coaster in the scheldte or the canals nearly fiftyfour feet long and over sixteen feet in beam the scruffy sort of thing that usually bore cargo or an entire six months supply of water in vast casks in her belly low freeboard fitted with a dozen sweeps a cockroach scuttling cross a harbour in full daylight and just about as handsome once under our counter well moor the barge snug against the stern lewrie went on with his explanation wishing he could cross a finger or two for the reality could not go as easily as his breezily glib exposition the long thinner part is the upper stock and that will slide up through a large hole under the transom the bottom end will swing even float but with the kedge capstan and the hoisting chains well lift her til shes almost hangin right then use brute force aloft and alow to get the bronze pins of the pintle fittings into the holes of the gudgeon fittings and shell ride all her weight on em once weve let out slack on the hoisting chains and cables you do speak engliski alan eudoxia asked with a crease in her forehead as she lowered the heavy glass half of what you say is shumashetshi how you are sayink daft mad babbling lewrie supplied with a snicker thats sailors for you our own language even our own dictionary da daft eudoxia said with a giggle testing the word a few more times and finding daft right pleasing lower away handsomely lt catterall bawled to the workparty as the massive and heavy new rudder finally was swayed off the side of the pier above the barge he was echoed by goosens spouting a flood of dutch the local variety some called afrikaans javanese or hottentot for all lewrie knew now and then came an english phrase having to do with damn your eyes dont sink my boat or some such so eudoxia further said with a playful teasing note to her voice as she stepped closer to hand him his telescope back you get the rudder on you sail for england right away alan thatd be up to viceadmiral sir roger curtis eudoxia once were seaworthy again he may tell us to escort that newcome convoy to saint helena or all the way to the pool of london i truly dont know it may take days to get us settorights proper and they may sail without us and well have to do a short patrol cruise round the cape instead til captain treghues comes in with another homebound trade he told her hmmm was her pleased purring comment to that news if you wait that long we go shootink together you give me tour on frigate be delighted to mdear lewrie vowed taking a second of his attention from watching the rudder being lowered into the barge and yes with his cackhand fingers crossed along the seam of his breeches a shore supper what the frogs call a piquenique a basket of food and wine one eats outdoors that is we shoot food roast on sticks eudoxia cheerfully enthused all but bouncing on the toes of her moccesins build fire take big blanket cut poles and put up palatka uhm dammit tend hunt springbok duck and grouse eat wit fingers get greasy damme but it does sound temptin lewrie thought one eye on the swaying rudder one ear cast for eudoxias patter the other ear cocked for pierside sounds like snapping or groaning ropes squeaky or jammed blocks in the hoisting tackle trying to sort them out of a constant intrusion from the comingsandgoings of rowing boats along the pier from the newlyarrived indiamen and the clatter of coaches and carriages either dropping off passengers or arriving to pick them up a tent hell yes night in the wilds he fervidly imagined one of those bomas du toit mentioned ring the camp with thornbush to keep lions out of the what was it kraal thats it kraal just me and her he almost had to shake himself to stay focussed well some natives t hew an tote but off in their own little kraal once the sun goes down and my word lewrie it is you a sharp voice intruded uhm hah lewrie gawped whipping his head about to find a source irked that his urgent attention on the doings with his rudder and his fantasies were so rudely interrupted at possibly the most inopportune instant he espied a quartet of people just attaining a firm footing on the pier from the wooden stairs that led from the floating landing stage on the south side of the pier there was an older reverend in the allblack ditto and white bands that were church uniform the world over a stout woman of equal age in dark and drab grey silk sporting a grim little bonnet atop her tautly drawnback hair under a parasol worthy of a rainy funeral a young lady gowned much the same who bore a fair sort of resemblance to the older people though quite pretty in a prim way and a sundarkened man in the red and scarlet of an officer of the east india company army right down to the bright silver chainmail epaulets on each shoulder aiding the girl burgess chiswick lewrie yelped in glad surprise damn my eyes burgess caroline just wrote me you were on yer way home give ye joy lad give ye joy he whooped forgetting everything else for a moment to step forward and offer his hand yell pardon me but i have a wee situation here burgess mnew rudder the frogs shot the oldun off a couple of weeks ago just out yonder he added waving a hand seaward mother hasnt burgess uneasily asked him as he not only shook hands with him but threw his arms about him too caroline wrote that mother charlottes poorly but as of four months ago was still with us though as for autumn lewrie told him pounding him on the back the diffident lad that lewrie had met during the siege of yorktown so long ago who had seemed so illsuited and sometimes naive for a soldiers life in the harshness of india had turned into a wellweathered man and a confident and seasoned veteran of nearly fourteen years of command in the field hellishgood tsee you burge lewrie loudly told him ah hum burgess cautioned with a subdued cough to remind lewrie that he wasnt on his quarterdeck that a churchman was nearby yer pardons lewrie said blushing oops ill see to the last of our lowering away then vast the goddamned larboard snublines ye idle duckfuckers lt catterall bellowed all unknowing fully into his task and in ripe catterall form belay evry inch of that shite eudoxia found that outburst hilarious even if such billingsgate language made her blush she laughed right out loud obliviously and repeated the duckfucker part to herself several times savouring it in wicked glee lewrie could practically hear scandalised heads snapping from him to the unseen catterall below the edge of the pier and to eudoxia could hear stiff faces crackling into scowls uhm hah lewrie mumbled going to the edge of the pier to stand by the shearlegs revrend on deck mister catterall he said in warning arr fook th preacher ordinary seaman slocombe growled back in a voice just loud enough to be heard ive aready done that usband landsman sugden cackled in a female falsetto providing the end of the old jape about the habits of some circuitriding ministers and their doings now e warnts ye t kill im a chicken can it get any worse lewrie sadly asked himself god almighty he yelled down to the barge without thinking in his quarterdeck voice belay that language or therell be people at the gratings come morning vaht is meanink to kill him a chicken pajalsta a giggly eudoxia just had to enquire stalking up to lewries side it didnt help matters that today she sported a new pair of buff breeches as snug as a second skin her kneelength moccasins with all the fringes a tan linen shirt unbuttoned halfway to her navel a bright yellow sash tied about her waist and that damned hat with the long egret feather plume to boot and mostlike looked about as outlandish and savage to the reverend and his family as a muskogee war chief ill explain later lewrie muttered from the side of his mouth and trying to shush her with a hidden gesture alan you knowink this fine soldier da she blithely asked he couldnt snub her could he well he considered giving her a shove off the pier into the water or the barge but by then every eye every brow lifted in prim expectation was on him and her just ready to pounce and lewrie had to follow through burgess allow me to name to you mistress eudoxia durschenko lewrie managed to get out just knowing it would all turn to shit no matter what he did mistress eudoxia this is major burgess chiswick of the east india company army an old comrade of mine from the american revolution and my brotherinlaw mistress eudoxia burgess smoothly replied as if such things happened every day perhaps hed seen odder in india he doffed his hat to her and made a presentable leg eudoxia stuck out a hand at first before remembering the finer customs and dipped him a shallow curtsy which in boots and breeches looked perfectly scandalous as she murmured your servant major cheese sir you are ah of local cape dutch extraction miss eudoxia burgess brightly enquired in hopes of explaining her outre clothing to his travelling companions perhaps to himself as well nyet major cheese week eudoxia proudly stated i am russki russian vith vigmores travellink extravagazaa i do bareback ridink expert archery turn and some acting in comedies and dramas is pity we finish our run of shows before you arrive now vigmore and papa who is beink lion tamer are away on hunt for new beasts but i learn african elephant is not good for performink but you come from india she gushed all agog and feckless land of tiger and ridink elephant you see them hunt them oh you must tell me all major ch sir your friends family eudoxia asked pointing to the churchman and his brood unaware of how gauche it was they see elephant and tiger too you introduce me da uhm ah burgess dithered caught in lewries trap after all from the instant eudoxia had opened her mouth there had come a series of prim gasps circus person bareback anything and horror of horrors actress if shed said she rode a broomstick boiled up potions to cast spells ate children and stuck hatpins through all her cheeks whilst bussing satans fundament she couldnt have given them a worse case of the fantods reverend brothers allow me to name to you mistress eudoxia uhm durschenko mistress eudoxia may i name to you the reverend brothers his wife mistress brothers and their daughter mistress alicia brothers my fellow passengers on the lord stormont i dont know which of us is worsefucked lewrie grimly thought as he watched the brotherses reaction to that him or me tis about equal shares i could trot out knowing wilberforce clarkson and old hannah more but i doubt itd cosset em no theyd never believe it your servant sir madam miss eudoxia said smiling in anticipation of tales of india her curtsies to each deeper and more graceful as if she was finally catching on then oh but you are so pretty mistress alicia she exclaimed all but clapping her hands you comink from india too did you ever ride elephant hunt tiger vith noble rajahs why thank you but the young lady stammered certainly not and never her parents huffed id also like to name to you my brotherinlaw sir maam miss alicia burgess interjected about ready to tug at his shirt collar and suddenly tootight neckstock captain alan lewrie of the royal navy reverend brothers mistress brothers miss brothers lewrie purred doffing his cocked hat and dipping a formal leg your servant sir from the husband hmmph from the stodgy wife brotherinlaw from eudoxia in a hellishsharp tone oh shit lewrie miserably thought im in the quag now alan you not tell me tiy jenati zamujem you are married aah was lewries spiffy reply schto eudoxia snapped her colour up and her breasts heaving chort hellanddamn tiy gryazni sikkim siyn lying peesa what damn you intimate case dirty sonofabitch lying prick and wherve i heard that before lewrie sadly asked himself as she glowered at him hands on her hips and probably wondering where shed left her horsewhip or her papas daggers a stamp of a boot on the pier a gesture that involved flicking her thumb off her upper teeth perfectly white and lovely he noted followed by a last one she must have picked up in her travels her forearm thrust at him bent skyward and a hand slapped into the crook of her elbow dosvidanya viy sabaka goodbye you formal case dog and she stomped off gathered the reins of her waiting white gelding and swung up into the saddle with a lithe spring and roll she sawed the reins to turn lightning and gave him her heels drumming him into an instant mad gallop into town well hmm burgess commented in the stricken silence that ensued perhaps well see each other about town before we sail alan old fellow for now though aye before we sail of a certainty lewrie gloomily replied reverend maam miss he intoned doffing his hat again the brothers family gave him the cut sublime in return suddenly intent on the clouds the bay and tidy little cape town well thats torn it lewrie bleakly thought as he watched them toddle off rather more rapidly than properly languid and here i didnt think it could get any worse fool me if caroline hears o this which suretogod she will less i can bribe burgess tkeep mum im back sleepin in the stables lord is that dominee dolittle in with wilberforce an his crowd im in the quag up t my eyebrows with them too he ambled an impartial observer might have said stumbled over to the pier edge once more to a stout combination piling and bollard against which he could lean or slump depending on your outlook just by the stern of the ungainly barge all done sir lt catterall proudly shouted up at him it is finished and aint it just lewrie wryly commented very well done mister catterall lads he congratulated secure all ready to get under way ready mister goosens no time like the present and with a spryness he did not feel he scuttled down a steep ladderway to the northside landing stage and into the barge at the least he could sail home to pay the piper aboard a sound ship chapter twentyseven and what about those eighteenpounders mister catterall he asked the morning after hms proteus had completed her repairs with a sound rudder and sternpost firmly attached and a short test sail about table bay done to assure them that it was a permanent repair guns and carriages fully found sir catterall gruffly replied though any eighteenpounder frigate or older ship of the line calling at cape town has already carried off most of the roundshot i doubt if there are a dozen rounds remaining in stores and none of the warships on the station at present mount eighteens sir and if they did theyd be extremely loath to share with us lewrie glumly decided he paced about his newlypristine quarterdeck now free of piled cable shearlegs heaps of hoisting chain and the carpentry or metalworking implements needed for lastminute tinkering to make the rudder and sternpost fit properly it appears that well be forced to sail a brace of guns short then dammit hms proteus was a gunned frigate of the fifth rate a classification that could be misleading to the uninitiated who might think that thirtytwo guns meant thirtytwo heavy guns sixteen mounted on each beam she had only mounted twentysix pounders and the grand total included six pounders four on the quarterdeck and two forward on the forecastle for chaseguns and carronades didnt count now lewrie had only twentyfour pounders he could trust the two dinged ones stored on the lowermost hold with the ballast with the two midships gunports yawning empty we could shift two carronades to fill in lewrie mused aloud but then wed also have to shift stores aft again to compensate so our new rudder has its proper bite well sir the burly lt catterall suggested the new rudder is actually broader than our oldun foreandaft and that with only one fir sacrificial strip on the trailing edge stead of two or three as the oldun did might not be completely necessary to push her stern down to the old seventeenandahalffeet draught we had before sir seventeend do it then mister catterall lewrie asked or slightly less hmm lewrie paced a bit more all the way aft to the taffrails for a peek over the stern with lt catterall following a few feet astern of him whilst he did some mental calculations four long twelves in my cabins now he thought shift two of em to the midships ports thatd lighten her astern by better than four tons right there ah but ships are meant t be sternheavy makes em quicker on the helm does the rudder have a deeper bite though with a broader rudder like a dutch coaster he turned and peered forward along the freshlywashed and holystoned length of the quarterdeck now restored to almost a paperwhite neatness there were two pounders on each beam and two carronades the short stubby smashers not very longranged pieces but capable of throwing a heavy pounder solid shot or be loaded like a fowling gun with grapeshot langridge sacks of musket balls scrap crockery or any sort of hard objects to maim and kill when up close alongside a foe they werent meant to take the powerful powder charges needed in a long artillery piece so they and their slidecarriages weighed less than conventional artillery any carronades in stores mister catterall lewrie asked the second officer and twentyfourpounder shot oh aye sir lt catterall said brightening the indiaman lord clive mounted twentyfourpounder long guns and carronades vice admiral curtiss people salvaged her guns but little else after she went aground i want two of em mister catterall lewrie declared well shift two twelvepounders from my cabins to amidships the aftermost pair and replace em with a pair of smashers theyll almost make up the weight and balance diffrence get em for us sir no matter what it takes beg borrow or steal aye aye sir catterall cheered er how sir if they wont give em up that is he asked more soberly a second later you know where they are lewrie pressed youve seen em aye sir board the stores ship but just go ask for em mister catterall lewrie exclaimed with a sly grin with my chit in hand o course take our largest boats and sufficient crews by now our people should know all about shiftin heavy loads as should you in the meantime ill go aboard the flagship and request em formally with the list of expenditures to date trepair our ship weve not made much demand pon naval stores yet and a penny saved is a penny earned as the old rebel benjamin franklin used tsay salvaged guns goin twaste free and clear of prizecourt folderol well muster your boat crews sir but spare me my gigs hands and coxn ill have you a note for the stores ship in two shakes of a sheeps tail get me those guns and as much roundshot as you can manage another fifty or sixty do they have em cartridge flannel gun tools hell take the master gunner with you and let him shop to his hearts content slidecarriages new breeching ropes hell know whats needful go get ready you steal or borrow old son lewrie told himself as he trotted below to his desk for pen and paper ill do the begging my word sir the flagcaptain said rolling his eyes over a neatlypenned list of outofpocket expenses to put proteus right as much as that what the local dutch as they say sir saw me coming and made the most of our predicament lewrie uneasily explained shifting one leg over the other as he sat before the senior officers desk thankful that the flagships transom windows didnt face the stores ship so that worthy couldnt see his boats scuttling cross table bay with the first of the requested goods not so much in materials mind but in labour and hires sir the waggons and ox teams and su and you contracted all this without consulting me as to which part of it sir roger might authorise sir i fully intend to present my sums to admiralty in london as soon as we return to england sir lewrie purred back with a blandly reassuring smile proteus sailed under orders from captain treghues sir and is not strictly the responsibility of the cape station so i did not wish to impose my monetary needs upon sir roger dye see ah well the flagcaptain mused hmm not under our flag as it were a transient in need of repair aha aye itd be proper to submit your expenditures to the navy board stead of us whichll be my problem sir since so much of the costs came from my own purse lewrie told him shifting uneasily once more the very idea of how much his personal funds had been depleted was enough to break a sweat a local bank now held a hefty noteofhand that they would draw from his account at coutts bank in london a hefty sum he prayed admiralty would reimburse someday this century well i must own to a sense of relief captain lewrie that we are not bound to offer recompense to you or foot the bill entire to the local chandlers and such ha ha never even crossed my mind sir lewrie assured him tossing in another disarming shiteating grin so proteus is now ready for sea in all respects well sir there is the problem of my two damaged guns lewrie casually allowed crossing his legs the other way round i have been informed the stores ship has no twelvepounders available so i could sail two pieces short but i am also told that she holds several twentyfourpounder carronades salvaged most swiftly from the wrecked lord clive and i had a thought to mount two of them in lieu of greatguns temporarily to be turned over to gun wharf soon as were back home other than that lack we are indeed ready for sea and for an engagement with any lurking french raider or privateer sir unless a greater need exists here on the cape station for em that is he crossed the fingers of his left hand down below the edge of the desk where the flagcaptain couldnt see them id be very much obliged eternally grateful really to have your permission to indent for two of them sir along with sufficient roundshot for a brief engagement should that occur hmmm the flagcaptain said thoughtfully rubbing his chin with the rest of captain treghuess ships now halfway to india or china proteus must either become part of the cape squadron or be assigned to bolster the escort of one of the other john company convoys id suppose so lewrie suggested perhaps the one waiting to depart in harbour now sir aye captain leatherwood would find you useful lewrie the flagcaptain informed him with a smile of his own some trouble with the previous escorting frigate reefing down too late in a squall just off ceylon a squall and a heavy roll that put her on her beam ends and rolled her masts right out of her she put back to calcutta or the nearest port with a yard under jury masts and captain wheeler had to request the assistance of a warship from the bombay marine which saw his convoy as far as the southern tip of madagascar not allowed to operate west of good hope the bombay marine and not much of a seaforce either a few british officers of doubtful abilities and the crews made up of god knows what sort of natives lowcaste hindoos at the best who can cross the great black water without breaking their caste aye sir lewrie happily supplied been in indian waters yourself sir the flagcaptain asked tween the wars sir aye under the circumstances then i do believe that leatherwood will find you more than welcome captain lewrie the flagcaptain said with a beamish smile as if that settled the matter bad run of luck all round has captain leatherwood three of his charges took bad water aboard when they victualled and theres been sickness among passengers and crew cholera sir lewrie asked with a shudder of dread cholera was to blame for most of the untimely deaths among britons who sailed east to make their fortunes no thank the lord the flagcaptain told him with a shudder of his own and a rap of his knuckles for luck on his desktop a bit of gippytummy mal de mer and the runs but no deaths itll be a day or two more before they scrap their water casks and load fresh ones then fill them with safe cape town water my brotherinlaws a passenger aboard the lord stormont sir lewrie said he said nothing of it when we met and looked healthy as a horse dont believe she was one of the affected ships uhm about those carronades sir lewrie reminded him one more time might i have your permission to indent for them if this captain wheeler is in immediate need of a frigate sir dont see why not captain lewrie the flagcaptain allowed with an easy chuckle its not as if shortranged carronades will be doing us much good here tis proper fortress guns we need thirtytwopounders and fourtytwos but will admiralty or even the armys artillery board at woolwich respond to our needs cant hold this harbour without should the french stir themselves but he dug into his desk for paper and pen a steelnib much like lewries and opened his brass inkwell to begin scribbling a formal indenture thank bloody christ was lewries thought that was easy there ye are lewrie the flagcaptain said handing over the note to the stores ship put them to good use if needs be hopefully sir well yawn our way to channel soundings but i am indeed grateful to you no matter lewrie declared as he got to his feet for a quick exit before the flagcaptain could change his mind ill be going then sir and thank you once again for all you have done for us a good voyage captain lewrie that worthy replied as he rose as well and offered his hand in parting fair winds calm seas all that what his gig came alongside the starboard entryport just about the same time that the first carronades slidecarriage was being hoisted aloft from the ships cutter in a sling hung off the main course yardarm all the gunports gaped open the port lids raised to show their red interior paint and lewrie was delighted to see that the two aftermost in his greatcabins already were yawning empty and the red tompions stuck in the muzzles of the pounders which had occupied those ports were now brooding in the amidships gunports got em sir lt catterall hooted from the cutter where he was overseeing the hoisting fifty rounds of shot apiece to boot next trip mister catterall ill have the formal permission for you to give to the stores ships captain lewrie shouted back rightho sir a scamper up the boarding battens and manropes to the gangway and the ceremony of welcoming a captain back aboard and lewrie could beam with pleasure to see that both slidecarriages for his new carronades squatted in the waist ready to be hauled aft the smashers will take two more trips sir lt langlie told him after he had paced to the centre of the hammock netting overlooking the waist a further trip for the shot with the launch to bear all that mister carling requested and its done captain very good mister langlie excellent lewrie declared this note came aboard for you in your absence sir langlie told him offering a foldedover sheet of paper ah hmm lewrie said breaking the seal which did not bear any stamp or signet mark ah my brotherinlaw burgess is ashore and asks me to dine with him he dug out his pocket watch and checked the time frowning as he realised that the hour appointed was fast approaching for dinner at a shore establishment the very place in point of fact where hed fed those generous indiaman passengers and captains there was no time to send a reply he would just have to show up my compliments mister langlie but im off ashore at once he told the first officer here give mister catterall this note from the flag so the stores ship captain wont think we bilked him out of anything call away my boat crew no coxn andrews but a fresh set of oarsmen and im away aye sir burgess surely has gotten sour letters about me from caroline lewrie fretfully thought no matter the casuallypleased face he put on it as he waited for his gig to be readied is he t give me a good cobbing bout my sinful ways i wonder chapter twentyeight so nice of you to invite me lewrie said as they were seated on a deep side veranda at the travellers inn where jewelbright birds in cages flitted and chirped and a cool breeze blew stirring hangingbaskets of local flowers well i saw that your ship was no longer in danger of sinking burgess chiswick snickered and supposed that youd be off as soon as the next tide or something and meant to see you before you departed wont sail til you do lewrie told him i gather that were to escort your ships to saint helena to help that lone sixtyfourgun that brought you in perhaps all the way to the thames why thatd be splendid alan burgess cried then with any luck at all you could even coach me all the way to anglesgreen havent been home myself in quite a while aye lewrie said hang it might as well broach the subject myself he thought not been exactly welcome round the homeplace actually alan added bit of a dither oh that burgess deprecated with a snort as their first wine arrived women simply wont understand the realities alan old son burgess scoffed with a worldlywise air that hed not had before hed headed for india carolines written me all about it several times as has governour hes quite wroth with you though before he wedded millicent governour was quite the buckofthefirsthead when we were back in the carolinas tell me has he really gotten as stout as they say mother was concerned for his health in her letters a proper john bull stoutness lewrie replied chuckling comes of good living and living under millicents thumb id expect burgess said with a frown quite good wine this in india we came to like cape wines their reds dont travel well but whites keep mainwell well governour as the eldest he always did see himself the arbiter of just about everything threatened to shoot or horsewhip me lewrie admitted what a fatuous arse burgess exclaimed just cause he cant caterwaul or take a mistress now hes a down on you mostlike will take me to task does he ever learn of my bibikhana as a major in the east india company army burgess would have lived in a private bungalow apart from the ensigns lieutenants and captains who would share quarters off the collegial mess building for his regiments officers nearly as grand as a colonel and a man with private quarters had to have his own cook manservant butler cleaning maids punkah boy to keep the fans or suspended mats swinging for cool air and no one would think a thing wrong of him did he furnish a womens quarters out back where he could keep a brace of fetching bibis to ease a mans essential needs without running the risk of a brothel or street prostitute in such a diseaseridden country impressive were they lewrie asked with a grin only the two but yes alan burgess beamed back with a wink most delightful now most english ladies who come out to india see that their husbands have needs and when in the field are presented with opportunities galore from what caroline wrote me i dont think you ever actually dallied with any wench when you were home no i didnt lewrie quickly said immensely pleased that his brotherinlaw was being so sane and reasonable about it well i did spend some time at sheerness with ah the greek widow yes burgess supplied with another wink and a snicker as the waiter approached their table other than her twas all far from home burge lewrie swore with bloody years and thousands of miles between homecomings and you were always careful burgess blithely assumed ah satays and boboties ye say like hindoo cooking splendid i will essay the country captain and be sure to set out a pot of chautney ill have the cape salmon lewrie decided looking over their chalked menu slate salad eggdrop soup and let us share a platter of eland strips in the plum sauce between us first off freshsliced is it or are they soaked biltong fresh is best thankee and a glass of your best burgundy each with it biltong what youd call jerky lewrie explained my cats adore it i have nigh three hundredweight in stores for em oh you and your cats burgess laughed ill see your eland and raise you the fresh lobster remoulade and make it a bottle of the burgundy my treat after all and we might as well make a feast of it whilst we may ship victuals are passingfair but god your cats two of em now i recall that hulking old ramcat of yours you left with caroline when we sailed for india william pitt wasnt it didnt take to me ill tell you though he adored caroline theyre good company at sea lewrie told him as their waiter topped up their glasses before heading off for the kitchens so you became a chicken nabob burge lashings of a rajah loot loot itself was a hindi word ive come away with better than sixty thousand alan burgess imparted in a careful but gleeful whisper cross the table noteofhand drawn on army agents some in rouleaus of guineas for easy access and some jewelry i scooped up when we broke into rebel rajahs palaces to boot havent even had them assayed yet and still have no idea of their value emeralds and rubies big as pigeons eggs nigh a pound of strung pearls and such good lord you fortunate young dog lewrie congratulated with a hoisted glass and youre looking to buy yourself a british army commission why not a whole regiment while youre at it oh ill end with a regiment of mine own burgess casually rejoined do i not make brigadier id be more than happy commanding a regiment of regulars this will be a long war alan longer than any of us expect and sooner or later we must beard the frogs on their own ground a naval blockade wont defeat them begging your salty pardon have to kick them in the teeth make them howl in anguish and parade down the streets of paris before they cry uncle i expect to find an opening as a major at the least burgess boasted even are john company officers sneered at by the loftier sorts round horse guards tis not so much my experience which has to be much greater than theirs but the money i can bid for my colours after all is there need for a lieutenantcolonel in a middling regiment well i could afford that too then with what ive learned of real soldiering not squarebashing and church parades i could turn that middling regiment into one of the finest in the army you watch and see if i dont just like you expect to turn any new ship youre given into the best as well lewrie could not remember burgess being so confident or so loquacious but he thought it a grand improvement on the boy hed known after a proper spell of leave o course lewrie chuckled a quick run through civilised society at least aye that too burgess agreed and perhaps marry well certainly lewrie said surprised dye know the old army saying burgess asked with a puckish expression might be kings regulations for all i know ensigns or cornets must not marry captains may marry majors should marry and colonels absolutely must wed a good woman with the proper taste and manners sets the right tone in the mess seen it when its good and seen the results when the colonels wife wasnt up to snuff the adorable miss brothers perhaps lewrie japingly hinted oh lord burgess exclaimed all but writhing in his chair no lewrie teased she seems a prim mannerly sort the good reverend and his wife have been all but shoving her at me alan soon as word got round the ship that id made a fair pile of tin chiswick scoffed after all my time in india im not sure what a good woman looks like but for all her time in india mistress alicia is still the shrinking violet sort so prim and sheltered she might as well be newcome from the moon besides burgess grumbled she and her family are as skint as churchmice i doubt the girl would fetch me fourty pounds per annum for a dowry and her paraphernalia might not extend beyond poor hindimade furniture and bedding like calls to like what definitely not landed either id spose lewrie asked spent their whole time traipsing from one poor glebe to a next doing good works and ministering to pagans and rice christians in the bengali slums burgess told him with a mocking shudder reverend brothers may be the only man ever took holy orders who believed in a vow of poverty either that or hes a disguised catholic monk with a weakness for dour bedpartners haw haw aha this is our eland he exulted as the waiter fetched their first course chiswick forked some onto his plate slathered a bite with the spicyhot plum sauce and sampled it marvellous he cried after a sip of the local wine this cape burgundys better than any they sent us too ill tell you that biltong of yours its as good as this might i be able to purchase some for the voyage home john company victuals are decent but id relish some game meat now and again purchase able aye lewrie told him though i shot most of mine a little hunting down the peninsula to simons town and back id adore an african shikar burgess declared between bites didnt get much chance our first voyage out east hunted all over india of course even bagged a tolerable tiger once but there might not be time enough even with the bad water problem comes from relying too much on local suppliers who filled their casks close to calcutta stead of inland hooghly river sewage no wonder they had sickness aboard tis a wonder no one died lewrie commented raking several strips of hot eland meat onto his plate before the ravenous burgess chiswick gobbled them all im told theyll be ready to sail in two days not enough time then burgess said with a disappointed sigh look here then alan do you recall anyone round anglesgreen who might be a suitable mate i intend to heed millicents and carolines advice in seeking a good match well caroline might be a touch prejudiced on wedded bliss lewrie admitted with a wee grimace not much local talent always did have her head in the clouds burgess scoffed all those horrid romance novels shes read as you allude millicent may be my best advisor you could call on my father in london lewrie teased again not him burgess hooted well perhaps london but not with his advice a wider market what in fact alan ive received letters from sir hugo bout once a year or so and frankly had i my druthers im much intrigued to be introduced to your ward comptesse sophie de maubeuge shes no dot no dowry worth mentioning burge lewrie had to caution him though she is become a fine and fetching mannerly young lady of the best accomplishments beyond the usual parlour and musical doings shes an excellent horsewoman fine as your russian cossack wench it was chiswicks turn to tease my word but your mistress eudoxia was impressive not my wench lewrie was quick to correct him just in case he got home and spoke to caroline before he could never laid a hand on her really he added at seeing chiswicks extremely leery expression might have given it a thought but and i didnt help matters ah well burgess said sighing again wroth as the mort is with you i doubt a stab at her on my part would go down well either seemed taken with you a while probably not lewrie replied busying himself with knife and fork and plum sauce secretly relieved that burgess had no chance with her even he didnt either jealous am i he thought whyever a harmless flirtation on her part lewrie dismissively said heres a thought though when you take leave and go up to london i am acquainted with a very rich tradesmans family with a daughter you might wish to meet the trenchers whose daughter theodora is about as angelic as ever i did see elfin and wee about nineteen or twenty perhaps too young but she seemed sensible and comported herself well enthusiastic and outgoing not your runofthemill languidlybored and tooelegantforwords missy slews of spirit hmmm burgess prompted sounding intrigued very dark curly brown hair almost black and the most amazing violet eyes lewrie further tempted soberly dressed when i met her since the familys on the newlyfashionable respectable side but with excellent taste the hints of a fine form though i wasnt exactly looking met her with the reverend wilberforce clarkson and mistress hannah more that crowd you burgess exclaimed rather loudly in point of fact in with wilberforce and the clapham sect that slavery abolition pack twas the reason for our meeting lewrie confessed turning a touch guarded as he recalled that the chiswicks had been slaveowners once and his brother governour chiswick was still fervidly in favour of the practice ive a dozen black hands in my crew some of them ah might be runaway slaves who volunteered aboard on jamaica well good for you burgess told him horrid thing that you think so id have thought tis one thing to hire hindoo labour and such and yes you get a slacker now and then who needs a touchup with your quirt to keep him on the hop but actual slavery is just despicable chiswick swore twas my parents in north carolina who thought slaves necessary for a plantation mother charlotte was born there and used to it father god rest his soul adopted it after he emigrated to the cape fear no matter what he really thought of it and yes i suppose i took it for granted as well but you rather surprise me burgess lewrie had to confess well times change people change chiswick shrugged off you remember at yorktown those runaway slaves who served with us to earn their freedom should we have defeated the rebels they served your artillery and stood with us ready to march and volley though i doubt they knew the first thing of soldiering and there wasnt enough time for them to learn god forgive me but that was the first time i saw slaves as men not useful animals theyd have gladly died under arms than be taken and returned to lashes manacles and slavery aye i do recall them lewrie agreed though at the end we abandoned em and made our own escape and god forgive us for not even thinking of taking a single one with us burgess spat turning soberly stern after all his previous bonhomie met more of them when what was left of our regiment skirmished round new york before the surrender and evacuation and not one of our generals thought to include them in the terms before we sailed away either then india serving under your father alan in the nineteenth native infantry commanding sepoys as dark as negroes most of them learning to be the next best thing to a father to the ones in my company on campaign elbowtoelbow for months on end well it changes your way of thinking bout the socalled lesser races makes you see them just as human as us by god worry bout their wives and children just as we do get into debt gamble drink too much fight like tigers be as idle or industrious as any white man eat our salt and prove themselves even better soldiers than british regiments in india now what is a fellow to make of a lesson like that but to realise that theyre our equals but for their lack of being like us governours going tdislike you as much as he does me lewrie told him with a chuckle and a sigh of relief well he never had that great a love for you anyway burgess teased him the subject comes up i expect mother will go off into a fit of the vapours and governour will puff up like an adder and spit fire dont know what caroline will think of me dont signify to me really for ive come to believe that real chattel slaverys a degrading evil which britons should expunge wherever we hold sway not just in great britain and damn the sugar interest and yes alan once ive worked out the kinks back home id admire could you arrange me an introduction to some of reverend wilberforces people cant buy all the tomfoolery they spout but i can side with them on ending slavery and he added with a droll expression being introduced to the girl you mentioned wouldnt go amiss either god bless you for that burgess and aye i shall lewrie began to promise almost ready to confess that hed stolen his black volunteers warn him that the subject of emancipation would come up about five minutes after the welcoming hugs and kisses but was stopped by a sudden rising commotion in the dusty street beyond a din that got all their attention what the devil burgess chiswick wondered aloud removing his napkin from his collar and tossing it into his empty plate as he got to his feet there came the usual sounds of trekboer waggons the lowing and grunting of huge oxen and the steady clop of unshod hooves mingled with that were the squeals of ungreased axles the timberontimber thuds of unsprung waggon bodies and the squeak of jostled joinery as a train of pinkended waggons slowly rumbled into town under all the expected sounds though was the humum of pedestrians and shoppers on the sidewalks taken by the novelty some even tittering laughter as the waggon train heaved into sight and there were unusual sounds as well some squealing meows hisses and growls some loonlike and silly brays some nasal trumpeting lewrie joined burgess by the railing of the deep veranda facing the street up above the sidewalk and the strollers who had stopped in their tracks to witness this oddity aha lewrie cried the circus is back in town the mighty nimrods are back from a successful hunt someone been on shikar burgess had to ask to bring them back alive aye lewrie told him chuckling for there was mr daniel wigmore mounted on a decent mare in the lead he sat his saddle like a sack of heartbroken turnips head down and grumbling to himself it looked like next came a local boer on a much better horse but a man with as poor a seat as wigmore a lanky heavilybearded and thoroughly dispreputablelooking beanpole of a man who looked so filthy it might be possible to shake him hard and reclaim ten pounds of topsoil he bristled with weapons a musket laid crosswise of his saddle before him two more in scabbards hung on either side and a brace of fowling pieces bound behind him one arm hung in a sling and fresh brightred scratches crisscrossed his bare arms and what one could see of his craggy face as soon as he came in view people on the street began to hoot point and laugh out loud van der merwe gobblegobble in dutch lewrie heard some of them cry out he couldnt follow anything past the fellows name but was sure that he was clapping eyes on the very idiot whom his guide piet dutoit had disparaged after seeing the fellow he could see the why then up came arslan durschenko on an even better horse riding stiffbacked erect and easy as a proper cossack should he looked a bit worse for wear too but when he caught sight of lewrie he scowled with fresh anger his eyes brightening and his long whip cracking then came the waggons ox teams driven by nearnaked blacks with goads or lancelong thin wood poles which bore short whips at the ends some were the fabled little hottentots some stouter and taller some between waggons bore crates on their shoulders or atop their heads well im damned burgess cried look at that behind the second waggon was a menagerie there were two baby african elephants at least half a dozen actual zebras the source for those inane brays theyd heard earlier the next huge waggon carried a stout wooden cage containing a pair of cheetahs who didnt look very happy to be cape town s latest nineday wonder either atop the next waggons pile of camp gear and tentage stood a smaller cage filled with three lion cubs who hissed and spat and uttered raspy little growls of displeasure at each jounce though tumbling all over each other as clumsily as domestic kittens to take in all the strangeness of a town there were four ostriches leashed together into a kicking and outraged coffle there was a middlingsized crocodile in a cage and other cages borne by black bearers contained a halfdozen wee baboons a brace of spotted panthers and some young wildebeests or gnus looks as if they were successful burgess commented but not very happy about it lewrie pointed out the many who looked utterly exhausted and hangdog the many who sported bandages or limped on makeshift crutches lewrie had been scanning each face of the new arrivals looking for his runaway sailors groome and rodney he expected them to be on horseback if theyd been promised freedmans treatment by the circus but could not spot them finally he recognised little rodney standing inside the last waggon of the train clinging to the sideboards and the wood hoops that held up the partiallyfurled canvas cover barely for rodney was swathed in bloodspotted bandages bound round his left shoulder and chest and another set wound about his scalp hoy there lewrie yelled agilely springing over the railing of the inns veranda to the sidewalk and jostling his way through those jeering spectators he trotted up to the waggon and scrambled up on the lowered tailboard to front his deserter rodney had turned greyskinned with shock to see lewrie and shrank back as if the catoninetails was already cutting the air as lewrie got to his feet before him damn your eyes rodney you deserted lewrie accused youll come with me lad s sorry suh rodney cringed ah know ah done bad suh runnin off but please god suh don whip me i paid for it surely tgod i did oh law but ah done paid wheres groome lewrie snapped grabbing hold of the waggons hoops to stay upright he daid suh rodney stammered tears running from his eyes dot damnfool dutch feller git im kilt got a whole bunch o fellers kilt an dey woz gon leave me art there tdie too i didn git on mah feets aftah de lion maul me groome he

puddin nuttin we could do bout it neither capm suh cape buffalo lewrie asked gawping at the very idea he had been warned by his guide dutoit that they were probably the most dangerous beasts in the wilds and almost impossible to shoot and kill if one hit the boss of their massive horns lick de skin raght orf is feets fo dey knock de tree down suh coz groome couldn shin up no higher rodney told him in misery god amighty but ya shoulda heard is screams when rodney could not go on but broke down into blubbing wiping fresh tears with the back of his hand stop this waggon lewrie shouted to the oxtenders now they turned their heads to look at him but could only shrug in confusion for they knew no english only their tribal tongues or the pidgin of local dutchmen can somebody tell these bastards to stop this damned waggon lewrie cried to the onlookers it was a lounging piet dutoit who sprang off a hitching rail to the street and waved a hand at the drovers grunting out commands that thankfully brought the ox team to a plodding halt a problem kaptein lewrie the young man asked looking up at him with his hands on his hips and a smile on his face what i tell you about jan van der merwe a foolya you wish help down down aye ive a hurt man in this waggon lewrie told him a kaffir dutoit scoffed espying rodney and his bandages one of my sailors lewrie answered got mauled by a lion he says van der merwes fault id imagine hah was dutoits dismissive sneer what care he for a sambo a deserter from my ship lewrie added thinking that would be more to the boers liking it was for dutoit came round to the tailboard and actually laid hands on rodney to help lewrie lower him to the dusty street burgess chiswick was there too of a sudden offering to assist the hobbling and wincing sailor to the sidewalk in front of the inn into a bit of shade for once rodney was on his own feet the young dutch hunting guide lost all interest in him loath to touch him any more than he had to surreptitiously dutoit wiped his hands along the sides of his canvas trousers a shadow loomed over them is hurt him lewrie looked up and almost gasped to see eudoxia astride of her white gelding her face a mixture of disdain for lewrie but beneath that stillness a concern for rodneys injuries there was a sadness in the cast of her large hazel eyes too lewrie thought lion mauled him lewrie answered her you know that tavern by the piers the one with the red shutters da knowink a very subdued eudoxia replied ride there for me if you please lewrie bade her ask for coxswain andrews thats where my boat crew was eating waiting for me to go back to the ship tell andrews to come quick rodney here needs to see our surgeon is many needink surgeon eudoxia said her face working into a grimace is some circus men dead papa tell me antonio best clown and mime who tended camels and donkeys oh lewrie thought sarcastically and impatiently hellish loss a mime will you lewrie pressed please eudoxia da i go she promised already sawing at her reins i ask for c coxs sailor andrews and she did putting her gelding into a lope for the harbour fetch me some water will you burgess lewrie asked kneeling at rodneys side better yet a watered brandy rightho burgess agreed springing back over the rail of the veranda and calling for their waiter youre a goddamned fool rodney lewrie sternly told him amen tdot suh rodney said with a grimace of pain within minutes andrews and the gigs crew were back in a sweaty trot burgess had organised the gathering of long poles and canvas off the stalled waggon with which to fashion a stretcher with the help of some lingering boers who had stayed to gawk over the drama once the comedy and the circus parade was done back to the ship and mister hodson with him andrews lewrie ordered ill be along later soon as im able in a hired boat no need tmake a long row for me aye sah andrews replied as the boat crew picked up the ends of the poles with rodney stretched out atop the canvas be easy with him deserter or no lewrie told him hes one hellacious tale ttell id expect we lost groome out yonder see im safe aboard sah coxn andrews vowed heave im up an haul away lads easy now well chiswick said as the sailors and their burden began to head down the street to the piers dont we have a lobster course to come before all the excitement happened that is aye we did lewrie brightened though still plagued by what in the hell he would do with rodney lets finish our dinner since youre payin so generously for it as i remember using the steps this time they went through the inn then out onto the veranda to their table the usual way under the big square covered outdoor veranda though there was another intrusion daniel wigmore to the life still swabbing sweat and trail muck from his brow with a handkerchief two empty steins sat before him soon to be joined by a third the way he was chugging his fresh one down capm lewrie ow do wigmore said with a shamefaced grin we need ttalk mister wigmore lewrie sternly replied bout you luring two of my sailors to desert maiming one and killing the other he said turning a chair backsideround to sit down at daniel wigmores table lean close over the chair back and glower at him ah them laddies woz mad fer joinin me circus capm lewrie wigmore blustered eyes widened and his smile broader nivver knew a thing habout hit til we woz ours down th trail and i couldntve turned em back ttown thout a gun or orse wif night comin on an all sortsa beasts lookin fer supper cruel thatda been sir cruel an oos this fine gennelman wif ye capm lewrie my brotherinlaw major burgess chiswick of the nineteenth native infantry in india mister daniel wigmore owner of wigmores travelling extravaganza lewrie sarcastically did the honours one of englands notable liars and sharps admit it you really tempted something horrid promised em the moon if theyd make your shows more exotic told groome he could play othello in your dramas hey well i mighta mentioned a minor turn on stage but hah lewrie scoffed burgess quietly came back to the circus owners table with the rest of their burgundy left on theirs pouring them both a goodly measure lewrie took the offered glass and sipped slowly his eyes boring into wigmore who was now squirming in anxiety that lewrie or the indian army major had the authority to bring him up on charges or could find someone who could right quick dan wigmore uncomfortably noted that lewries eyes usually a merry blue when at the circus sniffing round eudoxia had gone a chilly arctic grey and most vulturelike making him wilt and look away in dread as he chugged down his beer and waved for another roight so i woz of a mind not much o one dye see wigmore croaked alius on th lookout fer talent so he shrugged with a weak and sickly defeated grin plastered on his sweaty face what happened to groome what happened with rodney lewrie demanded his voice was level his tone almost mild but there was a steel to it and wigmore knew he was a long way from being out of the woods now alia that were van der merwes doin at feeble digit wigmore exclaimed all but wringing his hands lord capm lewrie ye dont know wot a trial we been through worsen th wandrins o th hisraelites hin th wilderness worsen me namesake daniel hin th lions den oh yes twoz biblical ow we suffered hout there i tell ye gennulmen biblical do tell lewrie dubiously said no really tell wigmores litany of woe was long and plaintive first one of his shavepated strongmen who posed as a hindoo jetti had been bitten by a boomslang and died within minutes the second night out their kraal hadnt been properly ringed with enough thornbush and had been invaded by a pack of warthogs which had spooked the horses requiring a whole day to round them up again minus the one that got pulled into a stream by crocodiles less one that a pack of lions had eaten then there were the termite mounds and mantall ant hills that van der merwe had led them to praising the unique oddity of aardvarks and aardwolves which they captured though not without being swarmed by an army of biting ants after theyd used too large a keg of gunpowder to spread the treats as bait for the aardvarks and aardwolves and everyone had dashed off to the nearest waterhole to bathe them off shedding clothing as they went not noticing the halfdozen crocodiles lurking in said waterhole first who ran them back onto dry ground rather a long way and that change of clothing was lost to hyenas under van der merwes knacky guidance again they had ringed a tree in which a pair of spotted panthers were sleeping banging on pots and oxbells yelling to daunt the cats as they brought up stout nets unfortunately the panthers hadnt felt much like joining the circus and had leaped down at the worst possible moment and ganged up on the circle of beaters who just had to shoot their way wide of disaster but had ended up shooting mostly at each other the tree and anything inside their circle excepting the panthers of course and theyd lost a black bearer which considering the firepower at hand and the level of terror and chaos could have been a lot worse it resulted in panthers nimrods though they did manage to take another pair of panther cubs they got up another tree later then when van der merwe had suggested that hyenas just might be able to be tamed one night the dawn had revealed that three more of their native helpers had decamped and they thankfully gave up on that idea groome well van der merwe told them that cape buffalo were immensely strong beasts never got rinderpest like domestic cattle and oxen so vital to the boers did and wouldnt they be a novelty when trotted into the ring towing circus waggons once broken to the goad and the yoke and what a boon to boer mobility they had stalked a herd of them thinking to corral a few with another ring of noisy beaters and fleet horsemen with rope nooses to capture the ones they wished the queston had turned out to be who was herding whom though the herd had milled tight together flowed round as one for a bit then whirled into formation and charged with wigmore likening it to an evolution of a brigade of british dragoons or lancers perfectly bristling with hundreds of horns not sabres or lancetips that prettymuch put paid to the circle idea and everyone had run or galloped for their lives groome had run to a flimsy flame tree and scaled it but hadnt lasted two minutes once the cape buffs had circled below him and butted the damned thing down more natives had realised theyd been hired on by a nitwit by then and uttering the bantu equivalent of bugger this for a game of soldiers had melted away into the bush wigmores second false jetti had followed van der merwes sage lore that zebras calm down just sweet as anything if one pulled a jute sack over their heads and somewhere in the braying stampede jetti had gotten kicked in the head then trampled to death theyd captured durschenkos trio of lion cubs with yet another encirclement of beaters but had had to shoot the male and three females to part them from the cubs thats where rodney had been mauled when the adults in the pride had bowled through jittery gunners and beaters we found helephinks wigmore sorrowfully related sorta ard not to wot wif sbloody many of em bellerin an trumpetin so mad when we camped by th waterole they warnted hat hats where we lost pore ol h antonio the mime lewrie commented now nibbling on cold lobster with his fingers their dinner redirected to wigmores table an a goodun e were too capm lewrie an dint th litl chilren love im wigmore wistfully replied piping at his eyes with his handkerchief neer ad th voice tbe a good hactor dye see but that man knew is way wif

gasped well now an hagin but e neer meant nought by hit dan wigmore said with a mournful sigh butt huglyz hantonio woz not a woman hin th world woulda male or female burgess asked lips quivering rather oddly oh females honly sir wigmore primly declared tugging at his waistcoat as if insulted twoz nought queer bout hantonio burgess shot to his feet as if outraged beyond all countenance and crossed quickly to the veranda railing facing the street wigmore fretted with his coat lapels shrinking into it as if embarrassed til burgess chiswick erupted in laughter great heaves of laughter that sounded something very much like bwooharharhar along with the odd snort cackle and wheeze well hit appen capm lewrie wigmore explained now im at sorry we lost one o yer sailor boys an at litl rodney feller like tgot et by at mama lion but ell mostlike eal up an serve ye goodz hever oncet but that isnt the point is it mister wigmore lewrie said with a wintry crackle to his voice you had your way how many more of my hands would you have lured away by god sir i should string you to a hatchgrating and have you flogged til your backbone is exposed a fubsy such as you the cat would pare your flesh like itd cut fresh soft cheese mine arse on a bandbox i should wigmore paled blinking rapidly in dread unable to look lewrie in the eye he turned to heed burgess chiswick who was rattling that veranda railing with his laughs wigmore tried to smile it away nivver do hit hagin sir swear hit wigmore tumbled out point taken capm lewrie make hit up tye hif i could bioodmoney i could pay im told yer fond o playful furry critters sir ow bout a mongoose eys hell on rats an cute as anythin to which offer lewrie could not help but hide a grin try to maintain fierceness but said his own lips quivering with amusement no thankee have one he stood suddenly scaring the man oh drink yer damned beer wigmore but do you come sniffing round any of my sailors again ill come after you myself with a catoninetails he warned leaving the man in a speechless hangjawed sweat lewrie went to join burgess chiswick at the railings about ready to cackle too nothin queer bout antonio my lord burgess was still weakly wheezing to himself oh alan did ye ever hear the like oh probably lewrie muttered still fuming one gets about who knows worse things happen at sea burgess my apologies but i must cut things short things tsee to aboard ship you understand and we didnt even get to the main courses ah well burgess replied sobering at last as he sprang back from the rail to face him in point of fact here comes your soup and such hate twaste good victuals but i must lewrie told him digging for his purse to repay him in part but burgess waved his offer away ill sample a bit of everything and call it a feast burgess told him perhaps well find time enough for a drink or two before we sail of course we shall lewrie promised him gathering up his hat and sword from their own abandoned table failing that though allow me to offer to treat you to yer first english supper once were back home well go up to london and make a whole night of it hey come to think of it well do both burgess brightened and we may bore each other to tears with our warstories looking forward to it lewrie promised as he clapped his hat on his head and squared it away for now though adieu he got to the redshuttered tavern by the piers and began hunting for a rowboat to hire to take him out to proteus but to his utter astonishment found not one but two gigs waiting at the foot of the wooden stairs that led down to the floating landing stage a strange gig painted green and picked out with white stripes with a midshipman just debarking from it and his own gig with his tars and coxn andrews in it the sight of it made him pause halfway down the narrow stairs as the midshipman was coming up pardons sir the lad said backing down to the landing stage to make way for a senior officer he doffed his hat as lewrie finished his descent uhm might you be captain lewrie of the proteus frigate sir i am lewrie replied at which discovery the strange midshipman beamed and reached into his coat to an inner pocket from which he withdrew a foldedover sheet of paper midshipman hedgepeth captain lewrie of hms jamaica out yonder the boy added with a sweep of his hat towards the bay and the anchored gunner captain leatherwood extends to you his utmost respects sir and requests that you attend him aboard at your earliest convenience i gather sir that proteus will join our ship to escort the east india convoy homeward and thank you mister hedgepeth lewrie replied as he took hold of the letter swallowing the impatience he felt with another intrusion into what was already a tempestuous day since my own gig seems so readily available surprise that he added lifting a leery eyebrow at andrews who stood beside the boat it seems i may manage mine own conveyance to see your captain this minute do you wait a moment though of course sir hedgepeth said doffing his hat once more as lewrie brushed past him you made quick work of it andrews lewrie said standing at his gigs side out to proteus and back so soon i said id engage a bumboatman ah beggin yah pardon capm sah but we didnt go out to th ship sah not egghackly andrews waffled and whyever did you net lewrie harshly snapped dat mizz yew de russian gal sah andrews tried to explain all but wringing his doffed straw hat in his hands she tell us itd be bettah fuh rodney was de circus surgeon tsee to im capm sah we got im heah to de piers but she an dhem circus people jus bout took rodney sayin navy surgeons don know nothin bout men who got clawed up so bad an dheir sawbones handle such ever day sah and you just let em lewrie barked mine arse on a a good rant would have felt so damned fine but right after he drew in a deep breath for his first broadside lewrie shut his lips with an audible plop when they had handed little rodney down from that boer waggon the lad had been shirtless for the first time in lewries memory and he had seen the old whip scars that his former masters the beaumans on jamaica had cut into him and lewrie had felt queasy to think that he would have had to under the rigid requirements of the articles of war when dealing with recaptured deserters put rodney to the gratings for several dozen lashes he would have had no other choice else his men would have gotten the idea that he was softer on his black pets than his other crewmen that he could wink at desertion that he was turning into a popularity dick or a soft touch lewrie couldnt think of a better way to split his crew into grumbling factions and destroy what esprit they had without fear of consequences without fear of him he would lose all his authority and his officers warrants petty officers and midshipmen would lose theirs along with him might be best after all lewrie grimly told himself knowing that allowing this to stand only delayed what hed have to do uhm lewrie grunted instead might be something to that andrews i doubt either mister hodson or mister durant has ever run across a lions clawing and the sepsis sure to follow such very well well leave him aboard the festival for a short time at the least to see what their surgeon may do for him aye sah his coxn cried with both relief and pleasure and lewrie could hear the tension whooshing out of his tense boat crew return to the ship lewrie ordered jamaicas gig may bear me out to her and back aboard proteus once were done my respects to mister langlie and he is to see that our injured men in the cottage up above the bay along with mister durant and his sickberth attendants are fetched back aboard i tell him sah andrews replied knuckling his brow mister hedgepeth lewrie called whirling about might you indulge me with a boat ride out to your ship chapter twentynine hms jamaica was a hardworked ship and looked it as lewrie was rowed to her starboard entryport noting the muchfaded paintwork on her side the dribbles of tar and oakum showing between the outermost planking of her gunwales and bulwarks a laconic rural american would have said of her that shed been rode hard and put up wet lewrie could imagine if there had been shiny gilt to brighten her it had been worn off long before and it appeared that there wasnt enough of a supply of linseed oil tar or pitch to spruce up her hull to navy standards especially the standards of admirals closer to europe but lewrie also noted that jamaica s yards were mathematically squared her standing and running rigging well set up and tautly blocked or belayed her gunports stood open for a cooling breeze on both decks red paint faded too on the inboard faces but the cannon muzzles tompions were still bright and every piece squatted in the same exact position as its mate up alongside jamaicas boarding battens mainchain platform and deadeyes for the mainstays were sound and her manropes strung shallowly through the outboard ends of the batten steps were white and fresh served with turks head knots the battens were clean sanded though the twodeckers waterline was a gently waving garden of weed despite her coppering and despite her obvious long and hard service lewrie could on his way up to the starboard gangway note that the smell of her that wafted from those opened gunports on both decks wasnt the reeky fug that one could expect aboard such a small lineofbattle ship crewed by several hundred men pent in such close quarters for so long either her captain surely put a great stock in cleanliness lewrie imagined he attained the gangway taking the salute from clean and welldressed marines and sailors from hands scattered about her decks who doffed shiny black tarred hats pausing from their labours for a bit lewrie of the proteus frigate he said to a sober gangly officer your captain requested me to attend him and why waste time on notes back and forth of course captain lewrie the man replied welcome aboard sir allow me to name myself suddarth first lieutenant glad tmake your acquaintance lieutenant suddarth i will inform captain leatherwood youve come aboard sir he is aft at the moment lt suddarth offered but such task was not necessary for his own captain emerged from his greatcabins beneath the poop to the aft end of the quarterdeck still shrugging his way into a rather shabby undress coat and hat without summons suddarth made the introductions as leatherwood approached yer servant sir lewrie said doffing his hat in salute and welcome you are captain lewrie leatherwood genially said in reply waving an arm aft in invitation do join me in my cabins where we may get down to business sir capt leatherwoods private quarters were a lot more spacious than lewries the painted canvas deck chequer as bright as the true tile that it imitated only pounders marred its interior to give it a martial air and whilst his deal partitions and panelling gleamed with paint or polish leatherwoods furnishings were rather plain and spartan and wellused instead of a formal interview with leatherwood seated behind his desk and lewrie in a chair before it he was led to a folding settee on the larboard side of the daycabin with capt leatherwood taking a padded woodframe chair on the other side of the ivoryinlaid low table between which rested on a brasstrimmed ebony folding frame the small carpets which livened both the daycabin and the diningcoach were of a set both of hindoo manufacture and mostlikely bargains obtained in bombay or calcutta within a few breaths a cabin servant in nattily tailored sailors togs appeared with a tray that held a bottle of hock and two shortstemmed glasses i trust you dont mind hock captain lewrie leatherwood said with an easy smile on his weathered face but ive always been partial to white wines stead of claret this ones what the germans call the spaetlese variety a touch sweet but spicy and we will not ask how it was exported past the french hmm honoured sir lewrie replied as he accepted a glass and took an appreciative sip liking it rather well appreciative too of capt leatherwoods welcome many captains senior to him hed found would play their little games of selfimportance forcing him to wait on the quarterdeck in foul weather or stand and stew before their desks while they pretended to frown sternly over charts or paperwork kneading their brows as if the wars turning hinged completely on them alone others lewrie thought with a hidden grimace who knew him would act much the same but their motive was mostly personal dislike leatherwood looked to be a pleasant sort he was about an inch taller than lewrie in his early fourties or so sunburned to a mellow colour by years under tropic skies careworn and overworked but with merry brown eyes he wore his own hair with a short beribboned queue atop his collar his hair saltandpepper and receding at his temples slimly framed and perhaps the victim of some tropic illness for his uniform fit rather looser than his tailor might have originally sewed it quite good and spicy lewrie adjudged the cape squadron informs me that your frigate is free to join me leatherwood began after a few sips of his own and a shift in his chair to a more comfortable nighslouch havent much to spare else they also told me youve just finished some repairs ready for sea in all respects sir lewrie assured him giving leatherwood a thumbnail sketch of the convoy battle his rudder problems his reduced and altered gun battery along with being a few hands short sounds about as good as we can expect capt leatherwood said with a resigned grunt and nod i should have six hundred and fiftyodd aboard jamaica but what with sickness accidents and desertions were about fifty people short as well and badly in need of refit you noted my decorative water garden as you came alongside sir your ah weed sir lewrie agreeably said damned tropics leatherwood said with a sigh the seas are so rich with marine growth and whatever they feed upon that i might as well have dunged and fertilised deliberately four years we have spent out here captain lewrie saint helena to calcutta or bombay and back again with but two careenings when we could be spared to fire and scrape her clean in all that time too few warships too much of a threat from the french too many convoys and never enough time off but thats about to change leatherwood perked up we are bound for home at long last to pay off twill be a slow passage i fear slow but steady as they say jamaica might attain a knot or two more than our indiamen and that on a stout wind mind your own quickwork sir you said you recoppered at halifax last year sir that lewrie had to tell him so my one weed has grown apace but on our short test sail after the new rudder was in place proteus seems fairly fast still and that new rudder is a tad broader than an english yard might install so shes very quick on the helm more manoeuvrable good leatherwood declared sounding relieved for our slow plod north ill place you astern of the convoy and will take the van position myself do i not work out on a flank now and again youll bear the onus should the french have a go at us with the winds from the soueast and with the agulhas current shoving us along even the indiamen could make enough sail to outfoot a beam approach and twould be the rare frog working far enough north to intercept us or lie in wait sir lewrie pointed out exactly so the main threat will come from astern leatherwood said with a vigourous nod of his head the convoy commodore tells me another ship will sail with us what do you know of this festival she will lewrie exclaimed in surprise makes sense i do suppose now theyve rounded up their new menagerie of beasts shes a circus ship sir mister daniel wigmores travelling extravaganza circus theatrical troupe fireeaters swordswallowers acrobats and clowns we escorted her here as part of my former convoy not the swiftest old tub i fear sir slower than an indiaman by day under all plain sail and even slower at night lots of visiting aboard her on the way to the cape not in my convoy captain lewrie leatherwood interjected i want us as far north as we can manage as quickly as we can manage and therell be no shillyshally ill place her at the stern of the trade and you can play whipperin to keep her up with the rest the frogs come after us shed be no loss lewrie thought just like the russians throw somebody off the back of the sled to delay the wolves spose so compared to the wealth in the indiamen the festivals not worth a groat an amusing prize but i didnt much care to hear of the french having a go at your former convoy so close to cape town captain lewrie deed i didnt capt leatherwood told him looking pensive and a bit fretful setting his glass on the table between them to rub his horny hands together a very sandpapery sound the local commanders are of the opinion it was a fluke sir lewrie told him outlining the flagcaptains explanation that it might have been a clutch of warships onpassage simply stumbling on them told me much the same leatherwood grumbled and what did you think of that captain lewrie he demanded rightsharp complete and utter horseapples sir lewrie deemed it with a derisive snort no one knows how many warships and privateers working out of mauritius the french now possess dont know whats happening past good hope but if the frogs have amassed enough strength they could be thinking of raiding further afield i believe that attack on my convoy was a test sir they know our monthly convoy schedules by now they mostlike know how few ships we have on station too that has worried me ill tell you captain leatherwood and i understand that you had a rough passage did you encounter any french ships captain lewrie i was hunted here leatherwood declared with a fierce scowl his first sign of displeasure it wasnt too bad at first til i lost the services of my companion frigate off ceylon to a blow i was almost of a mind to turn back since we were still in indian waters for we began to see strange topsls on the horizon as far north as within an hundred leagues of cape comorin avoided them or they avoided us then crossed hawses with a bombay marine brig and thank the good lord her captain agreed to see us below madagascar even if that was far from his usual cruising grounds should have turned back for certain when three of our indiamen got into their foul water casks and sickness broke out aboard them thatll be the last time john company masters try pocketing the few pence difference twixt the prices british chandlers and native chandlers charge for fresh water leatherwood told lewrie with a humourless bark not that hooghly the bombay marine brigo war wouldve been much real help if the french had been determined her guns were only sixpounders and halfrusted at that half a dozen british officers and senior hands aboard her crew but twothirds normal complement and most of them exiled european drunks neerdowells some lowcaste hindoos or lascars from god knows where might daunt the local native pirates in scabby dhows and such but not quite the thing to go against a french national ship or privateer stayed with us to about five hundred miles east of cape agulhas then had to turn back and we had to supply shot and powder in the first place then water and foodstuffs the second so they could make it back to india without starving and you saw more strange sail sir lewrie worriedly asked almost daily captain lewrie leatherwood told him summoning his cabinservant for a refill of their glasses i thought to employ a ruse the master of the lord stormont agreed to hoist a navy ensign and playact the part of a third rate seventyfour at the convoys van whilst i brought up the rear and put hooghly to work on the seaward side on the downwind run jamaica had a bit of dash perhaps lord stormont could play the same part for us sir lewrie suggested my brotherinlaw is one of her passengers and he might even like it i count on it though towards the end after hooghly departed the strange sail pressed closer leatherwood explained and im not sanguine that they didnt finally get close enough for a good look and saw through my ruse so it might not work a second time if the french that haunted us decide to lurk off cape town waiting for us to continue our passage frankly captain lewrie leatherwood gravelled i doubt ill get a wink of sleep til were above the tropic of capricorn weve had no fresh reports of any french cruising this side of the cape sir not lately at least lewrie told him about ready to chew on a thumbnail in fret aye did they follow you was viceadmiral curtiss staff any more forthcoming lewrie i very much doubt those worthies would know where and in what strength the french are til they sail round green point some night and sink take or burn all the shipping in table bay capt leatherwood exclaimed weve a hellish task ahead of us yet from what ive learned of you from the old newspapers with proteus aiding me i might manage at least a catnap or two before we come to anchor in jamess valley on saint helena you do me too much honour sir lewrie rejoined torn twixt the expected modesty and the desire to preen which he hadnt had much a chance for lately proteus and i shall hold up our end sir and after the shameful way the french mauled us my people will relish a chance for a slugging match against them should it come to that all i may ask leatherwood said pleased with the answer and looking relieved well then john companys commodore is meeting on the earl cheshire with all captains and masters tomorrow morning at four bells with any luck theyll feed us though im not sure i would yet drink their water hey captain lewrie following that do you look for me to hoist the blue peter the day after i expect is the weather fair and the winds sufficient very well sir lewrie agreed just one thing sir aye is it possible you bought this excellent german wine here at cape town sir id be much obliged did you give me a course to steer by so i could lay in some for myself book v quocirca vivite fortes fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus live then as brave men and with brave hearts confront the strokes of fate horace satires ii chapter thirty slanting westbynorth on larboard tack hms proteus was making a goodly way swanning from the starboard quarter of the convoy to the larboard quarter and beyond and it was joyous had she been steered directly norwest with the steady soueast trades right up her skirts the warm african day might have felt stifling for she would have been sailing about the same speed as the trades and the apparent wind would have been negligible now though the rush of the soueast trades almost could be heard in the miles of rigging and loose clothing could be fluttered by it bare heads and long hair disturbed by it and perspiration evaporated before one could even imagine one was sweltering like the crews and passengers aboard the indiamen that plodded despite the strength of the trades in two columns off proteuss starboard bows marine m cocky the seasoldiers champion ratkilling mongoose scuttled down the windward gangway in a sinuous arcing series of bounces between bracetenders bare feet pausing now and then to take a playnip at a particularly tastylooking toe before scampering onto the quarterdeck toulon and chalky who had been sunning atop the hammock nettings with their forelegs tucked in and their eyes halfslit in drowsiness got to their feet put their backs up and began to hiss at him the mongoose stopped rose up on his hind legs and wiggled his nose at them one paw on the nettings and one poised like a pointer on a scent for hapence hed scramble up and pester them grinning mister larkin lewrie drawled in a loud voice no private marines on the quarterdeck except in battle remember ill see to him sor sir their youngest mid replied as he came forward to doff his hat quickly then scoop up the offending mongoose clatter down the larboard ladderway to the waist and shout for sgt skipwith to come get his errant beastie again once it was safe to do so toulon and chalky settled down on their haunches to judder their little jaws and utter imgoingtokillit mews such brave callings lewrie muttered with a smile as he clung to the larboard mizen stays to enjoy the refreshing breeze his uniform coat discarded along with his formal cocked hat and waistcoat undone and flapping either side of his shirt thus lt langlie cried as proteus settled on a course a full point more westerly now they were clear of the larboardmost column of ships and could begin to range outwards to scent for trouble skulking over the horizon in the west or norwest lewrie planned to stand out nearly six miles before wearing and slanting back to the convoy he paced down the slightlyslanting deck to amidships by the binnacle and compass cabinet and the double helm damn my eyes mister langlie lewrie exulted but it feels so good tbe back at sea does it not indeed it does sir his first officer happily agreed and on the faces of the two quartermasters manning the helm brief smiles alit to say that it felt good to them too after so many weeks of drudgery in table bay and too few chances for ease making the quartermasters smile too was the last full day of shore liberty that lewrie had granted the crew after the commodores conference aboard the earl cheshire before capt leatherwood had put up the blue peter pendant now two days past everyone had gotten a last chance for some deep drinking in dutch boer taverns a last shot of putting the leg over some willing or commercial wench and buying remembrances of cape town that had resulted in rather a lot of small jewellike birds in woven cages one grey parrot with a salty vocabulary an odd foxfaced little creature called a bushbaby that was already proving himself to be a very noisy pest and a genyooine african mongoose adverted to its new owners as quicker fiercer and a lot cleverer than any indian mongrel the marines had there would be a new contender for champion in a few weeks it seemed at least lt catterall and bosun pendarves had prevented the boarding of an entire troop of baby monkeys the ship was crowded enough with new livestock for later consumption up forward in the ships manger a whole new set of piglets chickens goats and two small scruffy locallyobtained cattle no bigger than some shaggy scottish breeds two days north of cape town they were out of the variables and fully into the soueast trades skirting the edge of the great counterclockwise swirl of the south atlantic current which fed like a river into the agulhas current to whisk the convoy along it was just about two thousand miles to st helena but the northward passage would be much quicker than the passage it had taken to get to the cape of good hope and every hour took them farther from threat of french raiders hopefully leatherwood had ordered proteus out to sea with him fully twelve hours before the convoy was to upanchor on the next tide for a good looksee over the waters near cape town searching for a single scrap of suspicious sail on the horizons and had found none yet like capt leatherwood lewrie was now so infected by his nervousness that he felt as if he would not have an untroubled nights sleep til they anchored in jamess valley harbour either where proteus went from there well on a monthly rotation of homebound and outbound trades there would be a convoy of indiamen waiting at st helena that convoys escort force would split up as his own had on the outward journeythe bulk of it sailing back to england to reenforce the small escort that had fetched the homebound convoy that far if there was a greater french threat on the atlantic side of the cape of good hope there was a very good possibility that proteus would be conscripted by the outbound convoy commodore as part of his escort force just because treghues had sailed away on his own did not mean that lewrie and his frigate could consider themselves as independent free to toddle back to great britain there was no formal squadron or fleet assigned to convoy duties warships got assigned that task catchascatchcan and lewrie and proteus had been caught in truth once repaired should lewrie cross hawses with treghues hed still be under his orders til officially reassigned by a flagofficer senior to treghues and should proteus be forced to bolster an outbound convoy it was very likely that such a meeting would occur off the southern coast of africa and proteus would be forced to soldier on under that tetchy mans eye for years much as capt leatherwood and hms jamaica had been stuck on grueling convoy work til the bottom threatened to fall off his ship for now though free of the land where lewrie just naturally found himself in trouble more often than not and with a single and specific task to perform he could be happy enough twenty years hed spent wearing kings coat at sea and holding an active commission much longer than most of his contemporaries and hed always felt this way this sense of relief and of new beginnings these first few days after sailing when the shoreline sank away and there was nothing but the immensity of the oceans and limitless horizons boredom could come later as it always did but for now lewrie was happy and would be happier still if they attained harbour at st helena without incident is that gunfire the sailing master mr winwood mused aloud pausing in his perambulations along the starboard bulwarks he lifted his nose as if he could smell the source of gunpowder my word all eyes swung to the convoy the only ships in sight mister larkin lewrie bade the midshipman of the watch do you lay a glass on jamaica and tell us what you make out aye sir larkin responded clambering up the starboard ratlines of the mizen stays with a telescope signal sir gundrill sir shes workin her greatguns and sore th indiamen ah mr winwood said with a whoosh of a sigh why those poor skinflints lewrie chortled forcin john company captains tblow away money tsk tsk cut into their profits something sinful that sir the first officer snickered along with the rest of the quarterdeck staff do they keep at it much longer there will be angry letters sent to admiralty about it upset the passengers something sinful too sir mr winwood stated imagine being shaken from their indolent torpors the middle of their morning naps mister langlie lewrie called out jamaica s signal applies to us as well let us hold live firing from this instant to seven bells of the forenoon our own guns and crews need the rust blown off aye aye sir bosun pipe all hands beat to quarters what a perfectly fine morning lewrie gladly thought as silver bosuns calls piped as a marine drummer began a long roll and hands came scampering up from below to man the guns cast off and begin to serve their pieces as seachests and messtables were slung below to the orlop deal and canvas partitions came slamming down and hundreds of feet pounded on decks and ladderways the wind was fresh the south atlantic was a sparkling blue under an azure sky framed by highpiled white clouds and soon the guns would be bellowing the reek the roar the hullshaking explosions and the squeal of recoiling carriages the gushes of spent powder all of it pleased capt alan lewrie the live firing would make him happy too even more so at least admiralty lets me have powder and shot for free he could gloat chapter thirtyone oh it had been a grand day at sea even after gundrill the rum issue and the crews noonday mess lewrie had ordered an hour and a half of small arms practice with boarding pikes and cutlasses to whet the rust off those skills too after so much harbour sloth by the end of the first dog watch as the sun was sinking into the west in a spectacular red amber and pink glory proteuss people were spentwearily but garrulously happily so if the lack of hornpipe dancing but the cheerful songs and music were anything to go by even if the horizon to the east and soueast gloomed up darker than the usual sunset greys downsun the farther one sailed north along the coast of africa once past the arid regions that bordered the dutch settlements the more often rain squalls were commonplace a passage close to shore took a vessel through a zone termed the rains after all mr winwood stood on the quarterdeck at the change of watch at six of the evening hands clasped behind his back and sniffing at the air again much as he had at midmorning when seeking the source for gunpowder and frowning sternly a squally night captain winwood slowly pronounced at last a rising wind and heavy rain this evening rains which might continue through midmorning tomorrow i do avow sir can you not get a whiff of it on the wind it is muggier and cooler lewrie agreed noticing a hint of fresh water in his own nostrils as the trades gusted slightly as it grew dark proteus had ceased her wearing from one flank of the trade to the next and had fallen in three miles astern of the convoy with the two columns of ships equidistant from each bow and steering norwest with the wind right astern yet even with her sailing no faster than those winds could blow now and then a stronger gust caught up with them to presage a stormy night just as well lewrie decided that it was the convoys practice to reduce so much sail at dusk this particular dusk especially for it could be a rough night deck there a foremast lookout shrilled flagships lightin er lanthorns convoys lightin eir lanthorns thankee aloft lt adair shouted back through his brass speakingtrumpet mister adair lewrie said light our own taffrail lanthorns focsle lanthorns and binnacle cabinet be sure all masthead fusees and signal rockets are near to hand as well very well sir permission to call masthead lookouts down to the deck captain adair responded not til weve reefed down for the night lewrie told him as he paced aft to take a peek into the binnacle cabinet to see that the proper course was being steered pipe all hands on deck to reduce sail even as he ordered that another much cooler gust came sweeping up from astern and to the starboard quarter additionally sir ill have quicksavers rigged on the fore course and all three topsls and should any lurking frog upset things make certain that quicksavers are borne aloft to the tops for rigging on the main course and the tgallants just in case he said with a shrug aye aye sir quicksavers crowfooted over the faces of the squaresls to keep them from blowing out into tatters in a hard blow were a lastditch reenforcement of ropes to gird the sails canvas with growl ye may but go ye must groans proteuss achy crew went aloft to perform their duties knowing that soon once this last hard chore was over theyd be piped below to their suppers a little after that down hammocks would be piped and half of them could turn in for a few hours of sleep aye twill be a wet and windy night mr winwood prophecied by the time sail was taken in for the night and the precaution of the quicksavers had been rigged or stored aloft for future use it was already raining and the evening had gotten darker squalls of rain swept like curtains over the convoy from the eastsoueast to the westnorwest even blotting out hms jamaica and the lead ships of the short columns for brief moments the seas were rapidly making up and proteus began to ride them in a more lively manner performing a long slow pitching motion along with a leeward roll the nearest ship to them the festival off their starboard bows was pitching as well and heeling her larboard shoulder to the seas they could witness her taffrail lights swing down left from horizontal in slow arcs and see her forecastle belfry lamp rise up above the taffrail lanthorns for a bit then sink ponderously below them and out of sight as the old merchantman made heavy work of the night beyond her other pairs of taffrail lights wanly glimmered as the other six indiamen struggled to remain on course to the norwest and in lineastern of each other trusting to follow the leader like sheep following the bellwether and hoping that the lead ships knew what they were about another halfhour and it would be the end of the second dog and the watch would change once more this time for a full four hours which would let lewrie go aft and below to his own supper for now he stood in tarred tarpaulins on the quarterdeck stifling inside the supposedly impermeable hooded canvas coat with wetness trickling down the back of his neck and his old slop trousers soaked from midthigh down to his boots he would dine alone this night saving himself a few shillings by not entertaining officers warrants or midshipmen meagre though a typical solitary supper usually wasreconstituted portable soup the last of his fresh shore greens for a salad toasted stale rolls of what had been fresh bread and a riceandbiltong stewhe found it hard to wait that long he wanted to be dry to open a bottle of that spaetlese german hock hed found at the last minute in cape town then soak those stale rolls into the soup and slurp up something warm for the rain was a chill soaker when it was whipping cross the decks and it did not help that the last savoury smoke from the galley funnel got swirled as far aft as the quarterdeck bringing lipsmacking aromas of boiled pork to him along with the sound of fiddle fife or liam desmonds uillean lappipes and the rough good humour of sailors hunched over messtables half groggy from the last rum issue what in the name o god is that lewrie yelped like to leap out of his boots as an unholy piercing wail arose from below ah thatd be our bushbaby sir lt langlie told him with a wince of his own as the highpitched caterwauling continued i wish wed known what a racket it could make before allowing it aboard a member of the lemur family im now told and able to hoot cry and screech half like a howler monkey half like a human infant eerie eerie and irritating lewrie growled already miserable and that damned thing wasnt helping it keeps that up itll end up in a pie fore the next dog watch eerie aye and ominous thellwith this lewrie thought suffrin like this is what lieutenants are for mister langlie you have the deck til the end of the dog ill be below aye sir i have the deck langlie crisply responded he clattered down the larboard ladderyway to the main deck just as the bushbabys cries set off the parrot which began to squawk and then scream its few english words which consisted mostly of curses or blasphemies which squawking frightened the other caged birds atwitter which tumult made the goats lambs cattle and piglets bleat bawl or squeal and it really couldnt be not with proteus up to windward of festival but lewrie could almost swear that he heard a lions roar and some baby elephant trumpets in answer aint a warship its a bloody ark he fumed as he got near his soppingwet marine sentry by the doors to his greatcabins to punctuate his escape from foul weather there was a first flash of lightning and a notsofaroff roll of thunder the storm was getting worse and lewrie resigned himself to a quick meal then a whole sleepless evening on deck sodden to the skin dye hear there came a thin cry from one of the ondeck lookouts on the quarterdeck that he had just quit dark ship on th starbd quarter miler two off offcer o th watch theys deck there the lookout atop the main mast crosstrees added with the same urgency threemasted ship four points orf th starboard quarter looks tbe a frigate beat to quarters mister langlie lewrie bellowed after he had slammed to a stop and whirled about to swarm back to his quarterdeck now he added as he got to the top of the ladderway by the uselesslyempty hammock nettings night signals quick as you can to warn the convoy someone lay aloft and light the fusee on the main truck he jogged over to the starboard bulwarks stoicism and a serene demeanour bedamned to add his own eyes to the frantic search as harsh voices and bosuns calls shrilled a curtain of heavier rain blotted out the sea for a long and frustrating minute then there in the splitsecond flash of another lightning bolt several lookouts yelped discovery just as the marine drummer began a long roll and the ship began to drum as well to the stamping of running feet inspiring that bushbaby to even louder cries the lightning bolt struck up to windward in the eastsoueast a sizzling actinic blue and writhing fork of fire that silhouetted a lean threemasted ship so thoroughly that her sails momentarily turned ghostly white not a mile off more like three lewrie thought with a shuddery feeling of relief and fear under his heart big enough a bugger but we just may have enoughtime thank god topmen aloft mister langlie lewrie said over his shoulder sure that the reliable first officer would be nearby trice up and lay out tloose topsls with quicksavers then shake out the main course to the third reefs lets get some speed in hand a second closer lightning flash lit up the enemy warship letting them all see that she was flying full topsls a full fore course and main course and what looked to be threereefed tgallants along with almost her full set of headsls how the devil did she find us in all this sir langlie asked in puzzlement once the requisite orders had been passed and the crew had thrown themselves into welldrilled action inshore of us round dusk lewrie rasped shrugging his own puzzlement stalked us as the weather made up in late afternoon on the front edge of the storm perhaps came closer as the visibility reduced figuring the convoy would hold the same course all day and all night second lookout aloft mister langlie on the mizen the last time we met these shits they were working in pairs hes tkeep his eyes peeled astern so we dont get buggered a second time aye sir even as the peal of thunder from the last lightning strike was dying like a titanic game of bowls a third bolt far to the south lit up the sea a quick measurement against proteuss stays and stanchions told lewrie that the enemy ship had only outfooted them a trifle and he frowned and pursed his lips in furious scheming the convoy had been making about four or five knots in typical indiaman night fashion but were now spreading more sail and might be up to six knots by now the enemy frigate might have two knots more inhand and could catch them up on her present course eventually butanother lightning flash she seemed to be steering with the gusting rising winds directly astern not hauling off a point to fall down on them not yet as if the french captain over there wished to dash in and wade into the merchantmen but might plan to race up abeam of the starboard column before hauling his wind to alter course two points to the west would put the wind fine on her larboard quarter so why hadnt her captain already done so that could boost her rate of advance two more knots easily and still place her alongside that starboard column of indiamen without losing the weather gage lewrie swivelled about to peer forward over proteuss bows to see what he could espy of the convoy whose safety he was supposed to be guarding he could still make out the dark bulk of festival and a pair of taffrail lanthorns now with a fusee alit atop her main mast other tiny glims of amber oil or blue pyrotechnic lights looked all agaggle in no particular order as individual merchant masters swooped about to either flank to put the storms wind fine on their quarters so freshlyspread sail could snap and strain completely full to give them just a knot or two more speed free of the windshadows cast by the indiamen behind them up to weather it was like peering through a filthy pane of pebbly glass in a driving night rain to try and count the number of cigar smokers on a hill a mile off small redamberyellow signal rockets went soaring up from the lead ships or hms jamaica lewrie surmised too many to count or make a conjecture as to what signal capt leatherwoods gunner had meant to convey lewrie thought that leatherwood was a sensible sort once hed seen proteuss alert rockets relayed to him by even more rockets that doughty fellow should be trying to order all ships to bear off to the west wind fine on their quarters to try and outrun the french til the storm passed or the dawn came with any luck the worst of the storm was still to come and the convoy could break away as visibility shrank to nothing never to be found again hms jamaica should also be coming about to deal with the threat out of the eastsoueast and soueast to bolster proteus and daunt the french but lewrie saw no sign of that either and on these winds and butting against the making seas hms jamaica already admitted to be a slow sailer would make but a snails progress steering full and by no help there lewrie sourly thought and in this gloom one of the indiamen pretendin tbe a seventyfour wont work worth a tinkers dam either if it ever did if froggie didnt see through it all along just thankee jesus i a point to starboard mister langlie lewrie ordered after he swung back about to catch another eyeblink lightning flash of the foe crowd her a little and lets see what jean crapaud will do aye aye sir langlie replied sounding all businesslike now that the initial shock had worn off and somebody strangle that damn bushbaby lewrie griped as the beast began a new aria he peered upwards in satisfaction to note that his frigate now sported more sail that the fusee was lit and burning and that the topmen were already shuffling inwards along the footropes to the crosstrees and tops guns manned and ready sir lt catterall reported from below in the waist in his usual eager bawl the ship is at quarters very well mister catterall lewrie called back stepping up to the hammock nettings which were once more stuffed with the sailors rolled up bedding and hammocks not only on the quarterdeck but along the bulwarks as well perhaps not as tightlyrolled as they might be to pass through the ringmeasure each morning in the crews haste but there was now some level of protection for waisters and bracetenders on the gangways the marines prepared to volley behind the thick oaken bulwarks and for the vital command group on the quarterdeck lewrie had been so absorbed with his own concerns that he hadnt paid attention to the slams bangs and thuds of a warship being stripped for action the red glows of battlelanthorns between the guns and the weak sparks of lengths of slowmatch coiled about the tubs of swabwater that would be used to douse any lingering embers in gun barrels before reloading gave him a momentary reassurance that this time theyd be ready for whatever came at them from whichever quarter and if the rain slicked the flints so they did not sparkoff the igniting quills stuck down through the touchholes to the powder bags the slowmatch could be jammed onto them and his artillery most likely would still fire a stillness fell over the frigate now that the din of preparation was over and the only sounds to be heard were the keening of the wind in the miles of rigging and the snuffly thunder of the hull that butted its bows through the longrolling whiteflecked waves that and the crack and rumble from the storm of course the french out yonder lewrie bellowed down to his crew his hands gripping the caprails of the hammock nettings mean to screw up their courage and try a second time to finish what failed before they mightve given us a little dusting then but now its their turn ttaste iron if they dare are ye ready tkill some frenchmen lads ye ready tget some of your own back the snarling vengeful cheer that arose told him all he wished to know of the mettle of his crew lewrie looked over towards the foe to judge her distance and how long they had before they came to grips fiddler fifer desmond give us a tune a lively one he roared and the ships finest musicians got with the marine drummer and launched into the stool of repentance then lord dunmore yah sword an pistols capm coxn andrews said at his side and helped him jam his pair of doublebarreled mantons into pockets in his uniform coat beneath the tarpaulin foulweather coat where their primings might stay dry cats is below on th orlop with aspinall sah an he said tsend ya dis andrews added once hed also helped lewrie strap on his hanger andrews held out a large tin mug of soup and stew combined with some stale toasted rolls crumbled up and sopping juices in it a cheap older horn spoon jutted upwards from one side both mug and spoon no loss if lewrie had to throw them overside or let them fall to the deck to get trampled thankee andrews lewrie said looking him square in the eyes and give me thanks to aspinall should you see him first when this is done and i expect tsee your ugly phyz amongst the living then hear me have a care with yourself an don ya go bein too bold yahself sah andrews replied with a shrug and a sketchy smile beggin ya pahdn fo sayin such capm lewrie sah andrews knuckled his forehead in salute then he was off along the weather gangway with both lewries breechloading ferguson rifle and the girandoni air rifle hed gotten in new orleans for a little manhunting should the french come within near shot cast of the log mister langlie lewrie snapped coming back to proper concern lightning flash and a crash of thunder lewrie snapped his attention to the french frigate the sea astern the sea abeam for all that he could glean from that fingersnap of revelation might be as fast as she is or soon will be he told himself i could stay ahead of her a bit block her direct approach looked tbe no more than a mile off our starboard quarter that time do i slow let her rush up abeam were proteus a bit slower over the ground it might be possible to get to grips quicker then wheel a point or two more to starboard and force the enemy frigate to accept battle broadside to broadside or the bugger ducks under our stern and goes for the merchantmen lewrie thought with a scowl shoots right up our transom again then dashes past with the wind right up his own arse and id have to wear tcatch him up have the weather gage but no by the time we got worn about we d be lucky to spot her again in all this chase the gun flashes half the night same as we did before proteus was out on the starboard quarter of the convoy after her turn up more northerly and the convoy was doing something right wearing off slowly and cautiously more westerly out into the open atlantic with their much smaller civilian crews and so much sail the indiamen were taking a hell of a risk of dismasting to alter course even so slightly to take the hard wind on their larboard quarters a single mistake and one of them could end up lying crippled and lost to the french to broach get shoved on their beamends would be even worse for then theyd be lost to the sea and the storm we wear on this wind we could suffer the same fate he thought with a sudden chill yet so could the french could i make her do it the musicians were now staggering up and down between the tiers of guns in the waist well into a medley of banish misfortune go to the deil and shake yourself and the rakes of mallow and the crew stamped their feet and their guntools on the deck in time with the marine drummer jauntily plying his sticks as if on sunday parade on the ramparts of southsea castle in portsmouth a loud crack and a lightning flash mister langlie does she look tbe hauling her wind a half a point lewrie demanded putting the wind squarer on her stern about that sir the first lieutenant replied trying to keep a fretful tone from his voice might she be readying to wear possibly lewrie said rubbing his chin and looking aloft at his sails and yards helm up a point mister langlie bring us back to our original course of norwest a look alee showed their merchantmen now off proteuss bows to larboard after her jog outwards and their own slight turn away from the threat of the enemy warship very disappointingly far off there was a taffrail light and a masthead fusee to the right of the fleeing indiamen hms jamaica evidently had worn about to the noreast and was most likely trying to come up to the wind for a tack which in such a stiff wind and a rough sea would be nighmiraculous should leatherwood pull it off without getting the sticks ripped right out of her the french frigate was closing with them now within less than a mile but foreshortening her profile aspect turning more bowson just a tantalising bit to follow the convoy even if her first attempt had been misjudged and her captain now would settle for a sternchase if he could just get past this pestiferous bloodies frigate would she wear about shift the winds onto her larboard quarters duck under hms proteus and force lewrie to chase her prepare to come about to larboard mister langlie i think we will attempt to wear lewrie decided of a sudden and when we do i will have the topsls clewed up for the heavy haul batwing them in spanish reefs for a bit til were round thatll ease the strain on the masts and spars and the bracetenders that frog yonder wears so do we hands to stations and stand ready aye sir langlie replied though there was a leery squint to his eyes it could have been the driving rain that caused it bosun pipe hands to stations to wear yet they stood on for about a minute more straining for sight of each other waiting for the lightning to illuminate what their respective foes were doing nature obliged with another crackling bolt of lightning one that seemed to leap from the sea not from the low and racing clouds a triple forked bolt that jerked across the sky like the flailing arms of a marionette headsls are shivering lt langlie yelled pointing his useless night telescope at the french frigate shes going about sir sure enough the enemy was swinging nearly bowson to proteuss starboard quarter jibboom and bowsprit pitching upwards as she rose foreandaft headsls getting smothered for air as her fore course came directly downwind and stole the force of the wind just as an impenetrable squall of rain swept over her from astern and blotted her out helm up mister langlie lewrie shouted get us about quick as dammit clew up topsls there and the wear was quick for with so little pressure aloft the bracetenders could swing the yardarms just that more easily despite the gale of wind and that new broader rudder helped her get round too quartermasters make your new course due west lewrie cried it was still a staggering thrashing muddle for hands tending to the freed running rigging for the gun crews whose brutally heavy pieces along the larboard side strained breeching ropes and handling tackle til they groaned with the frigate laid over nearly fourty degrees on her starboard side for a long minute proteuss hull groaned and creaked the masts gave out ominous moans but there were none of the crackling popping or snapping sounds of imminent disaster the music stopped of course with everyone slid over to leeward and the distraught bushbaby and the rest of the livestock found something new to wail about and as she slowly rolled back upright as the tumbled waisters bracetenders and gunners got back on their feet and regained control the curtain like rain of the squall passed and the stiff wind lowered its pitch and volume for a moment let fall the topsls lt langlie shouted through his speaking trumpet sheet home sheet home then there was the french frigate now also steering due west on larboard tack about a half a mile up to weather and three points off proteuss larboard quarter sailing parallel with them what dye plan tdo now ye snaileatin sonofabitch lewrie roared cupping his hands to his mouth as if his voice could carry all that way in the storm weve dry priming up forrud mister langlie one would hope sir the first officer replied laughing like a hyena to see the french countered fire a challenge shot from one of the sixpounder chaseguns lewrie demanded chortling himself the only way he gets to the merchant ships is through us by god lets see if monsieur crapaud has the nutmegs for a standup fight mister adair langlie shouted over the din of the weather and the rush of the sea against the hull as proteus began to step out rightlively under her respread sails fire chasegun to windward the bows dipped in a steady hobbyhorse fashion spray flying up over the beakhead rails over the top of the roundhouse and forecastle platform but a pounders flintlock striker was cocked then the trigger string tugged and the chasegun erupted with a sharpish noise almost lost against the drum of rain with a bright red flash a spurt of greywhite gunpowder and a shower of bright cloth embers from the cartridge flannel and the crew cheered some more to know a formal challenge had been made and the french could not pretend that they hadnt seen it or the puny feather of ricochet that leaped from the sea before the enemy frigates bows had they any honour combat warship to warship broadside to broadside must be accepted now shes reducing her main course sir lt langlie pointed out and shaking out a reef in her topsls wants a bit more speed inhand aye lewrie agreed though shell not pass ahead of us and on this wind therell be no clever manoeuvring being on her lee will work in our favour hard as both of us are pressed shell not be able to fire on our masts and sails as they usually do cant lower the breeches low enough for that whilst we heeled at this angle have our choice of shooting at hers langlie realised with a smile or jamming the quoins fully under our guns breeches and hull her twixt wind and water aha it is quite advantageous for us sir my congratulations the old adage of always seizing the weather gage doesnt always avail itd seem well lewrie replied shrugging in perplexity for how best to answer for the tactic truly hadnt occurred to him he merely wished to get to grips and put himself twixt the enemy and the convoy and langlie pissing down his back with praise that wasnt his typical demeanour false modesty wouldnt suit neither would polishing nails on the lapel of his coat to preen were he baldly honest about it do i owe him money lewrie wondered in a hardsnatched moment of idleness there came another flash of lightning another peal of thunder and with it the burst of a cloud of white smoke on the enemy warships starboard bow the challenge had been noted and accepted dye hear there yelped the lone lookout who had been sent to the mizen crosstrees to watch their stern who til that moment had little to do except cling like a leech to the swaying mast and hang on for dear life hoy th deck second enemy frigate two points offa th starbd quarter oh my christ lewrie thought in sudden shivers of dread chapter thirtytwo it took a further lightning strike on the sea one more of those lingering flickering monsters to espy the second frenchman from their decks smaller than the first perhaps or just farther off she was running both sheets aft with the wind right up her stern to the norwest or a touch westnorwest bounding pitching and slithering over the blueblack whiteflecked sea for the convoy nothing we can do about it lewrie spat through gritted teeth his jaw ruefully clenched they do work in pairs and in all this excitement i forgot that damn my eyes nothin tbe done but shoot the shit out o thisun and devil take the hindmost which would be festival the slowest lewrie thought the poor old cow for the only taffrail lights still anywhere near enough to be made out clearly were certainly the circus ships eudoxia he cringed fearful for her in french hands even if she had come within a hair of clawing his eyes out first honours to mister adair and his chaseguns lewrie felt need to shout to keep his crews spirit up and put his own impending fight ahead of anything else lets have tunes more to his liking he ordered turning to face the enemy frigate which was now surging up closer to abeam of proteus and slowly falling down onto her desmond and the other musicians launched into livelier more scottish airs campbell s farewell to red castle hey johnny cope the flowers of edinburgh and one of lewries old favourites the high road to linton he stood at the larboard bulwarks the windward side that was a captains proper post clinging against proteuss motion with his left hand on the mizen stays his right hand beating the tempo of the music waiting and shamming utter serenity for his officers and sailors which was about the hardest thing to do before the iron began to fly run out the larboard battry mister catterall he shouted as the range diminished and gunport lids swung up and out of the way to bare their bloodred painted inner faces stark against the lighter colour of the gunwale hull paint black iron muzzles slowly juddered forward as the blocks of the runout tackles skreakily sang and everyone could hear lt catterall bellowing at his gun crews in a harsh and loud voice full of blasphemies and goodnatured curses for one and all and their foe rising to new heights of his burly rumbletumble style that had even old salts grinning over his inventiveness the frenchmans gunports also opened her own muzzles seeming to waver as their crews fiddled with their aiming most likely trying to slide the thick wooden quoins out from under the breeches with their usual intent to fire high and cripple proteus with chainshot or starshot to take down her masts and sails and allow their frigate to dash past and get at the convoy he really have his heart in this lewrie had to ask himself as he steeled himself for the first crashing broadsides a long slugging match was not what most raider captains had in mind he knew the point was to take merchantmen to pummel a convoy with a rapid strike cutting out a few before the escorts could intervene and deal out real cruiseending damage rake in prizemoney and loot punish the hated anglais the bloodies frighten their ships husbands and sponsors their insurance cartels captains and crews alarm admiralty in london and stop overseas trade which the british had but the french did not just a bit closer lewrie silently urged the french frigate just a tad a cables distance or less doubleshotted guns cant miss that close cant waste the first and best broadside quartermasters put your helm down half a point easy he snapped over his shoulder take the wind a bit more abeam put proteus on a broad reach and ease the angle of heel provide a flatter firmer deck for the guns thus he cried now satisfied with the course mister catterall at half a cable you may open upon her take aim you rowdy bastards lt catterall barked on the uproll by broadside wait for it by broadside fire twelve pounders three pounders and four monstrous pounder carronades roared almost as one the great gouts of spent gunpowder smoke caught by the wind turned into a solid bank of choking fog for a second or two before the wind rapidly whisked it over the decks and alee and that quickkeening wind brought to them the glad sound of solid shot aimed twixt wind and water crashing and crunching into the french ships side the parroty rwawrk screech of shattered planking the thuds of heavier timbers as her frames were battered and the thin terrified cries of frightened wounded or quickslain men just seconds before a matching great bank of gunpowder sprang to life as her own guns stabbed long reddish tongues of flames and the thunder of artillery bellowed almost lost in the cracks and roars of natures fury christ amighty aw christ amighty daniel wigmore whinnied wringing his hands in despair as rain poured down his face like tears from a whole clan upon the death of its laird plastering long strands of hair to his cheeks me silver me gold capm weed me hanimals em

already and she still wallows like a hog in mud might be we could bear away more westerly turn it into a long sternchase but thatd only gain us two more hours maybe less less we could put up some sort

nail capt weed cited right back he had himself a gloomy squint aloft for inspiration for an act of god or a sign but all he saw was dark sails and black rigging masts and spars now and then going ghostly in the lightning flashes the blue fusee at the truckcap of the main mast had finally burned out inspiring him to order the twin taffrail lanthorns to be extinguished too hoping that it might make festival harder for the french to chase in the darkness as if to scoff at that forlorn hope another long fleaflicking fork of lightning lit up the sea like a full moon revealing the french frigate pursuing them as clear as broad daylight revealing festival to them just as clearly damn em capt weed gravelled as he peered about for the rest of the convoy no matter how deeply loaded with the untold riches from the far east the east india company ships were sleeker faster their bottoms cleaner and carried much larger crews that could make the most of their acres of sail theyd scarpered for the far horizons and damn their black souls to hell for running off and leaving them though in all honesty were their places switched weed would have been halfway to st helena by then and hard cheese for the laggards capt weed also spotted one lone blue fusee still burning over a pair of stern lights off to the noreast another bolt of lightning revealed hms jamaica all too far away to be of any immediate aid but she had managed to come about in the storm and was butting pitching and crashing as close to the winds eye as she might lay almost bowson to festival on what weed thought was a course of south by west six points off the storms keening winds could we but hold them off a few minutes mister wigmore the desperate capt weed shouted almost into wigmores ear offer up some

weaponry that he had trouble standing his precious rifled jaegers and at least a full dozen of his longbarreled rifled pistols jammed in any pocket sash or belt handy strapped over with powder horns

ruined an ill haint hever last one o ye tyer dyin days keep on with doubleshot mister catterall lewrie howled to the waist and the guns keep on hullin her to the four helmsmen manning the double wheel spokes he added pinch up aweather lads another halfpoint to weather crowd up to her to shorten the range he paced feeling every rumbling squealing movement of the guncarriages as they were run out the shock and buffeting muzzle blasts from each fired gun and the rapid horseclopping of guntruck wheels over the main deck planks sanded that morning to a pristine paleness but now rapidly turning smutty grey each piece that slammed against the extreme lengths of the breeching ropes he felt that too and he could hear the groan of iron ringbolts in the bulwarks and decks crying out as tons of artillery slammed back some of them now so hot that they leaped a foot off the deck before stuttering back down in recoil twenty years in kings coat most of that at sea and lewrie could sense the rush of the hull its staggers reels and heel through his toescould wince too at each crashing arrival of round shot from the french guns and was staggered whenever a highelevated shot chewed large pieces from the larboard bulwarks and gangway staggered too by shot that missed completely and went screaming low over the deck the french guns unable to be cocked up high enough to dismast his frigate it was only on a lucky uproll when the french warship wallowed to nearly level decks that barshot chainshot or expanding starshot could punch ragged holes in proteuss sails or carry away a stay or brace frustrated the french were changing over to solid shot accepting the unfairness of fighting hulltohull as the british navy did and attempting to outshoot and smash up proteus in like manner it was a bit too dangerous to remain by the gnawedup bulwarks so lewrie sidled over to amidships and paced between the binnacle and helm to the hammock nettings overlooking the ships frenetically busy waist sixpounder quarterdeck guns barked spewing both roundshot and bags of grapeshot or musket balls as the range decreased despite the frenchman altering course to weather a bit to keep away twentyfourpounder carronades belched with titanic roars from fullycharged muzzles hurling doubleshotted loads from their stubby muzzles then came slamming back on their greased wooden pressure slides lightning flickered so fast that sweaty gunners were frozen in a jittery series of tableaus as they thumbstalled the vents swabbed hot barrels inserted the flannel powder charges and rammed them home once removed from the wood or leather cannisters that the youngest and quickest lads the powder monkeys brought in scampers from the magazine balls were snatched up from the shotgarlands guncaptains no longer concerned with perfect roundness or freedom from rust or scales just load a solid thump from a flexible rope ramrod to seat them a quick shove to tamp down wet wadding perhaps a final chore by a rammerman to seat a sack of grapeshot musket balls or langridge atop ball and it was time to pulleyhaul again up to the port sills an overhaul of the runout tackle and the breeching ropes then a leap for the traintackle maybe the employment of crowlevers and handspikes to shift the whole gun and carriage just a bit to left or right some fiddling with the elevating quoin block under the heavy breech to make sure that the piece pointed true at the blackness of the enemys hull as low as possible and a leap away from the gun feet well clear of tackle and ringbolts on the deck lest the men lose their feet as if scythed away the guncaptain off to one side with his left arm high to show ready right hand grasping the trigger line to the cocked flint striker the priming powder in the touchhole and blam to begin it all over again quick as panting and barechested men could serve their brutal pieces fuck proper aim at this range fuck drill and showiness just fire load and keep firing no matter what was happening around them a hard strike low on the waterline it felt like with proteus shuddering as if gutpunched and almost a human groan forced from her timbers another slamming hit and more larboard bulwark went flying in tatters a yards length of oak turned into armlong prickly splinters like gigantic wellchewed toothpicks that whirred and fluttered with the sound of frantic birds wings some lashing and spearing mens bodies as they went and raising a chorus of disbelieving screams a sudden lull a horrified hushed second before lt catterall could be heard screeching raspy for them to by broadside fire and murder the bastards and proteus shuffled to starboard to that shove of directed explosions a few feet alee and all lewrie could do by that point was pace observe and behave stoically for now that both warships were closeaboard of each other on the same course their jibbooms and bowsprits almost level with the other and the range down to less than sixty yards it was up to his trusted warrants and petty officers the steadiness of his guncaptains the stolid courage of officers and midshipmen the speed and stamina of his crew despite the horrors they could see on every hand did he die the next minute it would make no matter this was what a captain had to do and no amount of hopping about waving sword and crying damn my eyes could change a thing til it was concluded and there were horrors a decapitated marine hanging half off the chewedup gangway to spurt then ooze his blood onto the gunners below making the deck so slippery that a second bucket of sand had to be cast the young marine drummer boys corpse and his shattered drum was slung against the main mast trunk soon to be disposed of overside through a lee gunport to make fighting room half the crew of a quarterdeck pounder was gone strewn like bloody piles of laundry amidships another sailor from one of the engagedside carronades was being carted below on a mess table by the surgeons loblolly boys gasping like a landed fish with a twofoot length of bulwark splinter in his chest somewhere in all the bedlam lewrie could hear the sawing of a fiddle a mad rush of improbable sound that soared now and again above the deafening earhammering din but then all ships fiddlers were as mad as hatters as daft as march hares lewrie looked forward down the main deck between the guns and saw their fiddler capering a hornpipe or jig to his own urgent music over and over he played what sounded like pigeon on the gate and beaming and cackling fit to bust another hard hit another flickering whining keening flight of wood splinters and lewrie staggered again pausing in his pacing god but he wished to draw his sword bark orders shout encouragement do something useful instead he pulled out his watch and opened the ornatelyengraved lid grunting in utter surprise to see that the fight had gone on for over half an hour since the first broadsides were fired he clicked the lid shut carefully put the watch back into the pocket of his waistcoat then paced over to the compass binnacle due west and away from the convoy which the last he had seen had been steering norwest by west escaping as he delayed the frigate a quick look over at the french and he walked the few feet aft to the quartermasters on the helm another halfpoint to weather lads get us up closer still aye aye sir stoic older austen agreed shifting a dry quid of tobacco to his other cheek zipzipzip a musket ball thudded off the forward wheel taking a divot of ash with it and sudden splintery quills arose from the deck as other musket shots missed mr motte on the after wheel gave out a sudden shriek and dropped as if poleaxed with a musket ball in his neck another helmsman here mister langlie lewrie barked gulping down nausea and shock then turning away as he must by god those people are beginnin tmake me angry still with us mister langlie aye sir nother helmsman on the way swivelguns in the tops topen on theirs as we get closer lewrie snapped wishing he had his ferguson his fusil musket or even his girandoni air rifle hell with this stoic shite he determined im gonna kill some of those bastards myself as he drew out his first doublebarreled pistol to check the dryness of its priming weve been hulled several times sir lt langlie said after he had done as lewrie directed the carpenter reports better than one foot of water in the bilges so far and at least five shotholes that he can see near the waterline he also found an intact roundshot sir an eighteenpounder wedged in a starboard timber i thought yon frog was hitting rather hard lewrie said with a wince hed been sure that proteus and the foe were of equal calibre and weight of broadside but perhaps the slowness of the french gun crews had given him that impression making fast is the water sir he asked langlie not too quickly sir not yet langlie said with a shrug have to live with it for a while then lewrie decided no hands may be spared for the pumps til it gets a lot worse have any more joy for me mister langlie mister adair reports that the larboard sixpounder on the forecastle is dismounted too sir langlie added looking grim and quite grey from head to foot with powder residues as is number two twelvepounder and number eleven in your cabins from our larboard battery ill take joy from thinking that the frogs are having a worse night than we are mister langlie lewrie had to shout in his ear as several guns below their feet erupted together must have not had an impressive raiding cruise if they felt the need to toe up and slug it out honour and glory stead o loot not their ha forte lewrie said it with a fatalistic shrug of his own to think they would continue to batter each other perhaps for hours but lt langlie could see the feral rictus of a smile on his captains face take note in a flash of lighting that lewries usually merry blue eyes were gone cold arctic grey and snapping with battle joy carry on mister langlie lewrie said clapping his first officer on the shoulder pour it to em the french arent much good at this sort of yardarmtoyardarm fight give it time enough and they will lose their nerve long before us hammer em lads he shouted to the gunners all that stern stoicism the navy required gone at last hammer em and shatter their bloody bones pour it on pour it on and damned be he who first cries hold enough he thought becoming gundrunk on the bitter powder fog and the heartstopping lungshaking roar from his beloved artillery damned be he damned be him never could keep that straight he told himself with a deprecating chuckle and a faint grin which in the ruddy hellfire flashes of proteuss guns looked positively wolfish whichevers right by god it wont be us chapter thirtythree oh jaysus oh jaysus an irish sailor whispered as he stood behind the starboard bulwark a barebladed cutlass jammed into a wide belt a clumsylooking pistol stuck into a pocket of his sloptrousers and gripping a brown bess sea pattern musket in addition to all that a keenpointed boarding pike rested upright against the rack of belaying pins near the main masts stays he looked up and down the rainy gangway at his mates similarly armed who crouched down out of sight and felt the need to cross himself mither mary comfort me arr stop yer gob paddy one of the hidden chid him where away now m musketshot oi thinks the irishman said with a shudder as lightning crashed bright ghoulblue and lit up the sea showing the dark frigate closing rapidly sailors stood atop her bulwarks up her larboard shrouds with even more crowding elbowtoelbow along her sailtending gangway every motherson of them waving cutlasses hooting jeering and whooping fit to bust like beelzebubs demon army fook if they are the hidden sailor spat after a quick peek still arf a cable off no wonder th doxies dont fancy ye paddy caint judge distance worth a tinkers dam tells em es got seven inches an th hoors kin only mark three har har wait fer it the first mate was intoning from the quarterdeck wait fer it everbody stay hid til th capm says leap there gonna kill us all paddy whispered his lips trembling and a hand clawing inside his sodden shirt for his rosary gonna hesh lad an older shipmate hissed buck up laddy the frigate sidled down upon them no matter the futile alteration of course the dangerous release of reefed sails but her gunports were still closed and did not flap open to her rolling motion they werent even freed yet it would be a boarding hull pressed and grinding against hull wait for it almost there the first mate shouted again heu a harsh voice came down to them on the noisy wind from the foe void le frigate vesuve a marine francais eave to zere et surrendre vous not ve fire on vous comprendre we cannot heaveto in this weather you nosailor you capt weed could be heard shouting back through a speakingtrumpet we must keep a way on downwind comprendre surrendre vite vite came the harsh answer as the vesuve continued to close take in votre voiles you damn sails and in seeming obedience some free sailors began to clew up topsls as the french frigate shuffled down within mere yards of them and the gunports were still shut french sailors at bow stern and amidships on her bulwarks appeared with heaving lines and grapnels to bind the two ships together were all gonna die damn yer blood daniel wigmore said from chattering jaws snuffled and wiped his nose on his coat sleeve aw you lived too long anyway you old fraud weed told him jamaica s but five miles off and coming hard who knows with any luck at all youll live and reap a years free advertisements from this wait for it thousands o th buggers though hundreds anyways capt weed professionally noted hed had his own start in the royal navy during the american revolution and i do think i see half her crew or better still below her gangways on her starboard guns and such they mean to send a fairsized boarding party to us yet keep enough men inhand to stall jamaica whilst they make off with us this just might work after all the heavy grapnels flew biting into festivals timbers as the vesuve came to within handshaking distance now by god capt weed howled now up and repel boarders gunners fire french sailors were leaping across the empty air between ships howling in glee or swinging in piratical fashion on freed lines but were countered by the acrobats and aerialists nets hung from the tips of the yardarms pinning themselves against them like flies glued to a spiders web and their victory cries turned ugly and harsh but then the muskets began to bark and flash as pistols were emptied right in their faces as cutlasses and smallswords and sabres were thrust into the bellies of those clambering upon the nets as the puny old castoff artillery pieces doubleshotted with scrap metal musket balls and grape erupted quoins fully out and aimed up high to scythe the french frigates bulwarks and gangway rusty swivelguns in the tops yapped pointing down at acute angles at the gangway as well and french sailors were suddenly screaming in pain and terror as they were plucked from the rails caught in midswing and dropped in the foaming millrace between the hulls to be crushed or drowned tarakans whoosh nasyekomayehs whoosh peesas whoosh cockroaches insects pricks eudoxia durschenko shrilly hallooed each curse a punctuation to a loosed arrow chyepooha whoosh and that for rubbish as another broadpoint hunting arrow skewered a welldressed man with a foreandaft bicorne hat and a costly sword whod gained festivals bulwark and was chopping at the nets he screamed as he looked down to the doom buried deep in his chest eyes widened by utter astonishment that hed be slain by such an ancient thing just before he tottered backwards and disappeared between the grinding hulls snova girl her father bellowed again and again bastrd yew mine rodney swore as he took careful aim from behind the poop decks bulwarks alongside the clowns firing one of the swivelguns his target was an older man maybe a petty officer who was shoving french sailors forward the musket shoved him in his good shoulder as he fired and that petty officer died so quick he didnt even have time to clap a hand to his chest where acalibre ball smashed his heart and fell off the gangway to sprawl atop one of the cannon the clowns in full whitefacetheir warpaint they said whooped over his accuracy as they charged their railmounted shotgun for another round got you yeah rodney cheered too as he tossed the musket to the rear and flapped his right hand to demand a fresh weapon from the little blond acrobat girl who was loading for him this weapon was one of durschenkos pennsylvania rifles like the ones that he and proteuss marine marksmen used from the tops in action and he smiled an evil little smile as he brought it forward over his injured left forearm for a rest and drew the dog sjaws back to full cock there on the quarterdeck that was an officer for sure he reckoned all bellow giltandbeshit you mine butt fuckah lashed together hulls grinding paint tar and linseed oil off the french were but briefly daunted the unexpected check was like a red flag waved at a bull enflaming their blood lust swords chopped through nets slashing suspending ropes and parts of the netting came down at last allowing a small flood of boarders to gain footing along festival gangway vaya con dios amigos jose whispered as he removed muzzles from his bears and cuffed them hard on their snouts to enrage them go hasta luego ninos eat frenchmen he directed pointing then shoving them in the right direction fredo and paulo might not have been all that hungry or all that enraged either perhaps imagined a time free of their constricting muzzles was a time to play whatever they made of it the pair of brothers usually as gentle as baalambs as jose had promised made a distinct impression on the french sailors who had gained the gangway as they loped towards them on all fours with their mouths open their fangs flickering in the backflashes of the lightning and their claws skittering rather loudly on the oak planks it didnt help that jose in his second role as knifethrower was whickering butcherknives at the french as he ran behind his bears and shrieking curses aiming to hit for a change not outline the girl who spun on his large wooden wheel with nearmisses ilya mean old son of bitch arslan durschenko cooed into one ear of his lone adult lion after he had led him up from his cage down in the upper hold ya lyubeet tiy syegda lovink you always even if you no damn good chase there da want head for bitink there ilya there sweet meat fransooski bastards the lion whuffed at the din of combat of clashing swords and howling men his mane shivering at every discharge of musket or pistol ilya was old as old as poor dead vanya and he had never had what one might call a sweet disposition his rheumy eyes lit up with an ancient joy though and free for once of a controlling leash and collar after durschenko removed it and gave him an encouraging slap on his rump the lion just had to do what a lion had to do he leaped from the weather deck to the gangway with the spryness of a young male huge hind paws not even having to scrabble at its edge found himself a victim on the gangway and rose up to drape his front paws on a mans shoulders his gaping fangfilled mouth inches from his nose as he let out a roar thankfully for festivals crew ilyas first choice was french though nothing about lions was giltedged guaranteed the french tar shrieked sword clattering to the deck in terror and fainted away a good thing for him for ilya didnt think that was very much fun nor was it even tasty so he rose up again and began slapping those platesized sharptaloned paws about to right and left this time draping himself on the sole remaining trio of frenchmen who hadnt been swatted into bloody tatters and took himself a lovely mouthful of face stay th divil away fum me ye bastards paddy was shouting musket emptied into one man pistol emptied into another then used as a club to shatter a thirds skull his boarding pike had been lost in a frenchmans belly a man who had joined his shipmates in the sluice between the hulls and he was now reduced to whirling his cutlass like a frantic st catherines wheel and he was holding off two swordarmed enemies by creating a steel fan in front of him but his arms were now growing leadheavy and weak i dont wanna die jaysus mary an joseph dont hurt me or oill kill yd good damn he gawped ilya had come to his rescue pouncing rather playfully kittenlike it could be described onto their backs and naturally going for the triedandtrue neckbite on one of them jostling the other to his knees with his cutlass down and paddy whisked his blade like an axe cleaving right down through the crown of his foes skull deep into his brain oi told ye oi warned ye oh shite his foe bleated out a deathscream ilyas prey shrieked his own as long fangs met together in the unfortunate sailors throat ilya gave him a good shake then looked at paddy with his eyes glowing in eager green chatoyance gooood kitty paddy whinnied leaping rather spryly himself for the main mast shrouds and ratlines noice kitty he whimpered as he shot up the stays past the catharpings in an eyeblink hoping that lions didnt much care for nighvertical ascents on shaky ropes and swearing that if he survived hed never sign aboard a ship which carried any sort of critters mither he cried to the main truck as the lion took a moment to look up at him and ponder his chances what are you fools a french lieutenant bellowed as sailors came tumbling back aboard the frigate vesuve attack i say go back and attack eeekk as a liona shaggymaned lionsprang from one bulwark to the next balanced for a short second on all four paws like a domestic cat on a balcony railing then sprang for him and took him down with his massive weight the bloodymawed beast landed atop him embraced him with gigantic front paws and clawed his torso from breastbone to groin with his hind paws roaring in his face and fine broadcloth wool and clean white silkalways to be worn when in combat for it was easier to withdraw from woundswent flying like a ragpickers rejected quilt pieces his sailors shot stabbed and bayoneted the beast but it was far too late for the lieutenant and ilya actually managed to claw a matelot to ribbons before he died managing to shatter the night with one last prideful roar that sounded like utter satisfaction and the total domination of all africa that he had been denied when captured as a cub so many years before i not cry arslan durschenko muttered as he heard his lions last victory roar even so he had to pipe at his good left eye for a second before turning to receive a freshloaded rifled musket from a wee redheaded actress and brought it to his left shoulder to take careful aim the french were still so close that durschenko could aim then shut his left eye before he pulled the trigger to prevent the loss of his remaining sight a lifetime of marksmanship assured him that he would strike his man and even before he opened his eyes the shout of pain that followed the snap of the lock and the flash in the pan then the bark and recoil of the rifled weapon told him he had scored a pity the brazenly pert little redhead told him as she took the rifle back and handed him a pair of doublebarreled pistols e were a good lion mostly ilya was devil son of bitch arslan durschenko snarled as he cocked all four locks but he die good i give him one last chance those two pistols too kraseeya dyevooshka and i showink somethink keep down dyevooshka too pretty to fight watchink this the girl ducked down behind the compass binnacle as durschenko strode forward towards the starboard gangway with a pistol in each of his hands the french were retreating flowing back to their frigate but durschenkos blood was up offhanded shooting from the hip with his left eye squinted he volleyed off first from the right hand and then from the left alternating rightside and leftside barrels from both guns and four frenchmen slumped to the deck he dropped both of his empty pistols and drew his last pair of singlebarreled duellers raising the right one to shoulder level the other foemen spotted the threat at last some raising their cutlasses or swinging muskets towards him but not before durschenko blasted one of them backwards to slam into the gangway bulwark with a ball in his heart folded over himself durschenko raised his other pistol just as the frenchman who had levelled his musket right at him yelped in agony as an arrow drove deep into his right side and pulled the trigger as the muzzle dropped to drive the ball deep into the oak deck before the french could react to this new threat yet another arrow went into the left eye socket of the man who had swung to find the source and his deathscream was as unnerving as a dying womans then the bears arrived from up forward both fredo and paulo clumsily stalking aft on their hind feet rolling their massive heads and roaring with their mouths open and their upper lips laid back from long though unbloodied fangs durschenko fired his last pistol and found his mark and the french at last broke and ran scrambling from festival to the relative safety of their frigate abandoning weapons to free their hands for the desperate and dangerous crossing men on both ships with good reason were hacking at the grapnel lines with boarding axes and swords astern of them capt weed was shouting orders for bracetenders and sheethandlers as he spun the spokes of the wheel to a blur to get his ship away into the darkness as quickly as he could her own battle lust not yet slaked eudoxia smoothly plucked a shaft from the sheaf on her back notched it and drew to her cheek in one slick motion firing four more arrows in as few seconds it seemed and tumbling all four of her marks into the widening gap between the hulls or making them drop onto the frigates gangways where their shouts and cries and confusioncausing bodies kept the recent shock and terror redly alive urrah arslan durschenko shouted both arms and empty pistols thrust at the stormy night sky in triumph we win urrah he cried looking up at the poop deck where a bandaged black man stood with his hunting rifle in one hand and cheering too urrah eudoxia seconded coming to hug her father to dance in place and bounce on her toes in victory cossack forever fransooski bastards her poppa howled damned hif we didnt daniel wigmore marvelled in complete astonishment ready to feel himself over for wounds as he rose from a handy hiding place near the break of the poop he had an unfired pistol and an unbloodied sword but he waved them aloft with as much exuberance as the rest damme hif hit didnt work ha ha eeek he added as fredo and paulo their playpretties now gone came loping aft looking for more excitement jose come git yer damn bears i say p please jose hoy th deck came a forlorn voice from the main mast truck astride the furled and gasketed sail and yard kin i come down now is at lion gone arrah chapter thirtyfour hms proteus shuddered to another hit thick oak scantlings crying as they were punctured and a framing timber under the number five larboard gunport gave out a great groan of pain as the pdr roundshot thonked into it inches deep and lodged there two feet or more in the bilges now sir lt langlie had to report his cocked hat gone and his face smeared with grey gungrit their rate of fires slackin lewrie commented giving that dire news but half an ear the storm was finally blowing itself out the winds moderating and the rain coming down in sullen vertical showers instead of being whipped horizontally into their faces the worst of the weather had scudded off norwest with its heavy lightning so if a bolt now struck it was no longer closeaboard and there were several seconds between the crack and the rumbling thunder roll there lewrie snapped pointing at their foe in a weaker glimmer of a distant lightning strike see there mister langlie hands to the braces and well make up a bit closer to her still quartermasters another halfpoint to weather the enemy frigate in that blinkofaneye flash stood revealed as a battered shell her hull planking stove in and riddled with starshaped shotholes several of her gunports hammered into one and her starboard bulwarks gnawed away in places from abaft her catheads and swungup anchors to abeam of her mizenmast lewrie grimly supposed that proteus probably didnt look a whit better after more than a full hour of trading shot but his masts still stood whilst the frenchmans lower main and mizen seemed canted from the proper angle of rake proteuss sails still drew with only a few holes punched through them and her yards standing rigging and running rigging were still mostly intact shes fallen astern a tad too lewrie took satisfying note a bit not enough for us tdraw ahead and bowrake her but time to end this mister catterall quoins fully out and aim for her rigging lewrie shouted down to the waist mister langlie brace and sheet men will haul in too taut and get us heeled far over the french frigate was it starting to brace up as well going more south of west to break off the action and run lewrie speculated mister catterall a controlled broadside shot and grape aye sir load load load ye miserable cripples or i lt catterall chortled in a voice gone creaky with overuse stamping about the deck in bloodlusty glee proteus fell silent for about a full minute as fresh pdr shot was fetched up from below the hatchway shot racks and the thick rope shotgarlands between the guns nigh expended lewrie noted a gun here and there being charged with powder with wooden ladles for their overample store of premade powder cartridges and empty flannel bags for filling in the magazine had already been shot away for certain they had mostlike used up the upper tier of powder casks as well and were into the older stuff from the second tier the french warship continued her fire and proteus had to stand and take it but lewrie could count only eight discharges from her battery and those were fired independently haltingly with better than two minutes between explosions from those gunports ready sir catterall bellowed his voice cracking raspily thus quartermasters lewrie cried chopping his hand to show the alteration of course desired sheet home brace up sharp stand ready proteus seemed to gather a bit more speed a quarterknot or so like a good hunter bunching its hindquarter muscles to take a hedge as she did so amid the loud squealing of blocks as the square sails were drawn at right angles to the wind and the foreandaft sails were put flat to it she began to heel over onto her starboard shoulders rose then paused pent atop a passing beam wave as well steadied and fire mister catterall the brief gap between the frigates lit up harsh and orange for a second and the range was still so close that proteuss weary gunners could see the results of their handiwork for once before the bank of powder fog rolled back down on them and over the lee side giving them a cause to cheer and howl in pleasure no matter how drymouthed weak or tired the frenchmans main mast shivered as a great ratbite appeared in it halfway twixt her bulwark and main top clouds of grape ravaged her upper and lower shrouds blasting away the deadeyes that kept her topmast erect by the edge of the main top shattering her slender topmast and bringing the whole thing from truck and cap to halfway up above the main top swinging down in ruin the furled and gasketed royal halfreefed tgallant and tops with all their mile of rigging collapsed alee to drape utter chaos and highly flammable sails over her engaged side ease her mister langlie lewrie shouted so pleased that he justabout started to caper in delight mister catterall secure arm your people and prepare tboard her close reach for a bit sir and fetch us alongside mister langlie mister devereux are you with us aye sir his marine officer shouted from the larboard side ready to volley and clear the way for us lewrie directed as he tore off his foulweather coat at last and patted his pockets to assure himself that his pistols were still there then drew his hanger an inch or two to determine that it would draw easily when needed but was snug enough to stay in its scabbard during his clamber across with an upper mast and sails dragging over her lee side and a catastrophic loss of sail area with which to maintain her speed and her agility the french warship sagged down on proteus even as the british frigate swung up to meet her ready grapnels there bosun pendarves was shouting proteus had not rigged boarding nets and the french ship with the intent of a rapid assault on a captured merchantman had not rigged hers either there would only be wreckage to hack away or use as a handy footbridge for the quicker and more agile proteus drew ahead angling to windward the french ships foremast falling astern of abeam before the hulls met with a titanic thud rebounded a foot or two then clashed back together as grapnels flew ready sir lt catterall rasped his teeth white in a wild and wide smile aye aye sir lt adair up on the forecastle cried as well his smaller party of gunners and sailhandlers gathered round him by the larboard cathead boarders lewrie ordered in a quarterdeck roar away swivelguns yapped from both ships from the bulwarks and tops though british guns vastly outnumbered the french lt devereux and his marines levelled their muskets volleyed as one and nigh a dozen frenchmen waiting with cutlasses and axes in hand to repel them reeled away from sight shot dead in their tracks lets go proteuses kill me some frogs ha ha lt catterall encouraged as he stood atop their bulwarks shrouds in one hand and a glittering sword in the other his gunners began to surge forward in obedience to his urging leaping and scrabbling across the gap between the tumblehome of hulls though both frigates waterlines were inches apart a swivelgun coughed and catterall grunted in agony his right arm torn completely off and his shoulder shredded well just damn my eyes if i he loudly cursed before swaying backwards to fall dead on the gangway come on lads midshipman larkin their little bogirish imp shrilled as he swung across on a freed line he gained the frenchmans gangway atop that pile of wreckage dirk in one hand and a pistol in the other he shot down one french sailor and hopelessly clashed his short and slim dirk against anothers cutlass slyly kicking his opponent in the teeth to drive him back but a boarding pike came driving upwards taking him deep in the stomach a twist of the long and slim pikehead to make it even crueller then the french pikeman lifted him like a forkful of reaped hay to fling him inboard to the enemys gundeck lewrie slid down the larboard mizenmast shrouds to the channel and deadeyes leaped onto the french ships main mast chain platform and began to scramble up praying that his left arm slightly weakened after being broken by a dutch musket ball at the battle of camperdown would serve him for he already held one of his doublebarreled pistols in his right british sailors followed his path alongside him others made the risky leap over his head muskets pistols and swivels made a minutelong fusillade before hardpressed men on both sides ran out of time for reloading and the clatter of blades replaced them up to the level of a french gunport the hint of a shadowy figure within bang went his first shot rewarded by a throaty gobbling scream and lewrie clambered higher cursing his left arm for its slowness wishing that he didnt have to do this just this once for every now and then the hulls rebounded off each other despite the taut grapnel lines and the millrace below his feet sounded as loud as a rainchoked scottish river up to level with the bulwarks into a snarl of rigging broken spars and sailcloth but a wide gap had been blown through it and it was with a great sense of relief that he flung his right arm then his right leg over the splintery timbers and crawled to his feet on the enemys decks at last shoot that bugger close enough for his pistol to set his shirt on fire before he could skewer him with a pike drop empty pistol draw sword fill his left hand with the other pistol and draw back to halfcock on both barrels with his right forearm look about and discover his own sailors and marines either side of him thank god take it to em lads skin the bastards he shouted taking a tentative step forward to peer over the inner edge of the gangway to see a butchers yard guns were dismounted massive barrels and truckcarriages overturned on squashed men splintered disemboweled halfcharred gunners betrayed by their pieces when they burst or the powder cartridges had blown up turning flesh the colour of rare roast beef and a sheet of gore on the main deck reflecting battlelanthorn light like a reddish full moon on a calm lake mounds of bodies about the main and foremast trunks smaller piles of arms legs and bits of men as well and two ragged rows of screaming writhing wounded by the unengaged larboard side still waiting to be carried below to their surgeons the french cockpit surgery already filled to bursting with the worstoff triage the frogs call it lewrie numbly recalled appalled and about to retch if these men were the betteroff he did not want to see what an urgent case looked like reddition msieur a young wideeyed french officer in the ships waist called out taking lewrie in his cocked hat with a pair of epaulets on his shoulders as in command nous surrendre please nous amener strike oui quarter msieur capitaine he tossed away a pistol and let his sword dangle from his right wrist by a strap of leather ze fregat luranie surrendre m sieur tell them lewrie roared pointing his hanger at the officer then at the melee still going on from bow to stern order your men votre matelots to desarmer lay down their arms vite vite lewrie looked aft to where his own sailors had swept the quarterdeck clean of resistance and were even then hauling down the french tricolour without their foes approval quarter lewrie bellowed hands cupped to his mouth to fore aft and amidships quarter lads theyve struck their ship is ours and to the shuddery young french officer he added best ye sheath that damned sword o yours msieur fore one o my men takes ye for a diehard comprendre guns pikes and edged weapons clattered from numb hands to the decks and physically and spiritually exhausted sailors sagged to their knees some completely spent and wheezing some in shame with tears streaking clean channels through powdersmut on their faces and some ready to weep with joy for being alive and whole only a rare few remained on their feet glaring defiancewisely disarmed defiance as british tars sore losers and spiteful victors jeered them and spat curses that they could have killed all of them if allowed mister langlie lewrie called out in the relatively peaceful silence his ears still ringing from an hour and a half of cannon fire and with the fingers of his left hand crossed for luck sir came the first officers weary voice parties to secure the ondeck prisoners mister langlie then leftenant devereux his marines and a party of our jacks to go below and chivvy any skulkers on deck make sure theyre all disarmed not even a penknife on em and no arms near them should some have a sudden change of heart and drink mister langlie dont care it its a vintage bottle you discover spirits drain em into the bilges keep a keen eye on our people keen as you will on the french right aye aye sir lewrie had seen defeat and victory before both shivering losers and strutting winners aloft and alow whod use the chaos of the aftermath to guzzle themselves senseless and did proteuss sailors get in drink the french could turn the tables on them and cut their throats mister catter no lewrie began to call out before remembering that hed seen him fall mister adair another crossing of his fingers to his relief lt adair piped up too and came to his side get with the bosun and carpenter mister adair lewrie ordered any spare hands you may now put them to the chainpumps to keep our own ship afloat til morning a survey below of thisun as well sir id admire could we get her to a prizecourt after all the trouble we went through twin her aye aye sir lt adair replied performing a shaky doffing of his hat in salute and mister adair you are now our second lieutenant he added in a sombre tone as he sheathed his hanger and uncocked his pistol very well sir adair gravely answered he felt it then that shuddery weakness and lassitude that he had suffered at the end of every seafight there were an hundred details to be seen to before dawn a myriad of repairs to be made aboard both frigates before he could feel sanguine but god he felt spent what he most craved that moment was a bracing drink a pint of water to put moisture back into his tongue and gums then a brimming bumper of brandy or yankeedoodle cornwhisky followed by a liedown and perhaps a nap maybe a long one since he wasnt getting any younger but urn msieur capitaine it was the wideeyed young officer below him on the main deck who still stood there looking up at him looking a bit embarassed to bother him mon epee sword m sieur he said offering up his smallsword now sheathed in its scabbard in formal sign of personal surrender it was bad form and ungentlemanly for lewrie to accept it the proper form would be to wave it off tell the man whose throat one wished to slit and bowels one tried to spill what an heroic defence he had put up so honourably but lewrie wasnt feeling especially charitable that evening so he took hold of it and gave the young fellow a grave nod damned if hed let any armed frog ponce about with a sword he might relent and give it back once sure that both ships would float and sail merci he said its hilt to his face in salute he stumbled aft along the enemy warships starboard gangway a tangle of dead and wounded of splintered wood sails rigging and hidden ringbolts to the enemys quarterdeck where some of his sailors were capering and laughing that particular uproarious good humour that only whole survivors could laugh atop slain foes capm sir ordinary seaman martyn chortled handing him yet another sheathed sword eres er capms blade sir wont ave a need fr it in is life no more capm nosirree mus be worth fifty guineas sor able seaman clancey hooted producing yet another an thayr first off cers sword ere tis a fineun too sor poor fellers not long fr this world neither we reckon clancey callously snickered pointing back towards the wheel where an officer whod had a leg shot off at the hip and the other one bent at an unnatural angle was being tended by two french sailors a guinea for each of you lads lewrie told them but lets not be makin a career of lootin the dead even frenchmen thankee sor and lets stay cold sober too fore i have ye all at mast lewrie sternly reminded them lewrie took a tour of the quarterdeck taking in the heavy damage the strewn corpses and dismounted guns with his lips pursed in a silent whistle unlike most combats reported in the marine chronicle where the french fired a few broadsides to salve their captains conscience and uphold honour before striking this ship had fought to win and had paid the price it was a slaughterhouse french frigates carried overlarge complements compared to english warships sometimes as many as or more for raiders such as this l uranie intent on prizetaking and long cruises they carried more officers petty officers and sailors to man and safeguard those ships they took leaving enough aboard to maintain the raider at full strength if she was required to fight to keep possession of her prizes but with so many men aboard it was no wonder that every shot through her hull or bulwarks had reaped luranies overmanned crew as thickly as a farmers scythe would cut down a field of grain excess hands could replace gunners and sailtenders for a time but if battle lasted long enough to lewrie gazing down into the waist it looked as if half of those frenchmen lay on deck where they fell or whimpered their lives away in those two long rows of savagely mutilated a few more lanthorns bobbed about fetched from proteus so his own petty officers could survey their own frigates damage from outboard or rig thick rope mats as fenders to protect both ships as their hulls thudded together or to pick and hunt among the dead and wounded for their shipmates leaving the french where they were for now triage but of a different form from the french quarterdeck lewrie could look over at his own ship and shake his head at how many shotholes and shattered planks he could count in the feeble bobbing handlanthorn lights and whats me own butchers bill he sourly wondered feeling sick at his stomach in addition to bonetired whatd twigg tell me back in london save mine arse from the gallows whilst far overseas by doin somethin glorious he felt like spitting a foul taste from his mouth this glorious enough for em hey i slay enough frogs sacrifice enough omy people tkeep me neck unstretched price is too damned high surgeon mr hodson and surgeons mate mr durant would tell him the cost soon enough lewrie was sure he shoved himself erect from his slump on shotgnawed railings all but shook himself like a hound to wake himself from his lassitude with three captured swords under his left arm lewrie descended an undamaged ladderway on the larboard side to pace the main deck and waist of the french frigate looking up at the crossdeck beams and the boattier where the ruins of cutter launch gig and jollyboat sat like a pile of gaylypainted scrap lumber sir a voice intruded and lewrie turned to face it mr midshipman darcy gamble stood there tears in his eyes nearby mr midshipman grace knelt by a still form just rolling it over faceup tis mister larkin sir gamble told him and lewrie looked down to see the rictus of agony on the poor lads face his final expression to the fact of his own hard death so early in life and the flickers of midshipman graces cheap tin candlelanthorn made the lads wounds even more lurid oh damn lewrie softly muttered poor wee lad still has his pistol and dirk in his hands sir grace added snuffling as he looked up at his captain he went down fighting sir honourable wounds to the front aye gamble pointed out striving for the stoicism the navy demanded but still on the ragged edge of open sorrow for a fallen messmate we cannot let him just lie here sir perhaps grace said time enough for mister larkin later mister grace lewrie told him after harumphing to clear his throat theres our ship and our wounded to see to first first last and always mister gamble sir pick one lewrie told him extending the three sheathed swords to him hilts first with lieutenant catterall fallen you are now an actinglieutenant and third officer into proteus you mister grace are now our senior midshipman for now our only midshipman though there may be a likely lad or two i may advance later i see sir grace replied sadly thoughtful up to you tshow em the ropes of table duties and cockpit lewrie further said hoping new and demanding duties and responsibilities might take his mind off larkins loss hmm a bit grand these sir gamble said his mouth cocked into a shy moue selecting the plainer sword though one with a finer and more serviceable blade midshipman the honourable darcy gamble came from welltodo parents and could when confirmed by admiralty easily afford better to wear on his hip but for now his choice gave lewrie an even better estimation of him very well lieutenant gamble seek out lieutenant langlie and tell him my decision lewrie ordered my respects to him and he is to work you til you drop to make both ships fit to sail again aye aye sir actinglieutenant gamble said with sudden pride awakening in his eyes ill have andrews see to mister larkin mister grace lewrie added for now weve need what he asked feeling a cold chill in his innards as graces face screwed up in fresh shy grief sorry sir grace all but wailed as he got to his feet we saw your man fall didnt wish tbe the one ttell you sir but i spose i must he was in the main top with the other marksmen and was shot and tumbled out and hit the grace had to pause and gulp the edge of the gangway sir and hes gone lewrie croaked suddenly much weaker and wearier andrews is gone all these years my righthand man coxn and he thought squinting his eyes in pain how many people must i get killed strangers enemies friends for he was they passed him out a starboard gunport sir with the other dead mr grace managed to relate sorry sir sorry gone fallen was the euphemism of the age it was what was done with navy casualties in battle the dead were put over the side at once to clear the decks for those who still fought a brutal necessity to maintain their morale in many cases the hopelessly mangled and sure to die were put out of their misery by a petty officer with a heavy mallet then shoved unconscious and unknowing out the ports too as a mercy for an old shipmate whom the surgeons couldnt save it was why the inner sides of the hull by the guns were traditionally painted red as red as freshspilled or freshsplattered blood in the heat of action the living might not notice lewrie looked down not at larkin but at a bare patch of deck willing himself not to weep andrews matthew andrews a longtime companion was dead and gone no matter the gulf between common sailors and officers how aloof and apart a captain must appear to his hands andrews and aspinall had been his touchstones with reality a pair of close friends really and his loss felt like an abyss a part of his own years incompany with him had been cut away and lost in a way perhaps it was best that andrews had been put over the side best that he was physically gone for lewrie didnt think hed be able to bear to look on many more familiar dead faces there would surely be enough of them already blaming himself too scathing himself for andrews had been the one to go ashore and lead his dozen free black volunteers aboard the night in portland bight on jamaica when hed stolen them from one of the beauman familys plantations as a cocksnooking lark had he not would andrews still live without that act proteus might still be in the caribbean not here in this hour engaged with a french frigate of greater firepower groome and bodney might not have run away were there no circus to lure them no africa in which to die whitbread the others might not be buried at cape town yet had not andrews run from his own master on jamaica first bun from the softer chains of a house slave better fed than the field hands garbed in wealthflaunting livery yet run in spite of all as the others had run put everything at risk for a whiff of freedom even the royal navys harsh version andrews and they had endured sailors poverty plain victuals and unending backbreaking work in all sorts of weather living with the constant risk of death or disablement the sure coming of rheumatism or arthritis the sicknesses that arose when hundreds of men were pent together so closely in a foul and reeking wet gundeck for what to be free men to live a wild and adventurous life as free deep sea rovers paid for their suffering and worthy of their hire freely entered into and in the navy ready to fight the enemy the ocean itself to live and maybe die free damme lewrie softly spat raising his head at last stiffening his spine after a long sad sigh steeling himself to playact a role of captain second only to god he had two ships to save perhaps hundreds of men his own and the enemys to succour and tend to prisoners to keep a wary eye on and sometime after the sun rose another french frigate to be alert for and possibly fight and he was mortalcertain the first of many atsea burials as early as tomorrows forenoon watch with more to follow as they sailed into the equatorial heat there was a convoy to rejoin and round back up should anything have happened to jamaica duty that grim demanding bitch come to call with all her nagsome sisters would never give a man a moment of his own there would be a time to grieve andrews and all his dead once anchored in a safe harbour very well sirs lewrie forced himself to rasp clapping both hands together in the small of his back lets be about it hmm stern now a facade of grim stoicism back on his face lewrie made the shaky crossing back aboard proteus though his shuddery limbs threatened to betray him there was no formal welcome from sideparty or bosuns calls just a boneweary man clumping awkwardly to the oak planks of the larboard gangway of a shottopieces ship sir sailing master winwood said doffing his hat as he came forward from the quarterdeck limping from a leg wound upon his right thigh his breeches cut away to reveal a thick padded bandage mister winwood lewrie acknowledged oh i know mr winwood held in his hand a coinsilver bosuns call on its chain andrewss call and mark of his post as coxswain crushed by the musket ball that slew him or by his fall from high aloft so many sir mr winwood said in his usual mournful way i am told by mister hodson that weve nigh twenty fallen and ten more in a bad way with at least thirty others moreorless lightly wounded admiralty will be so impressed lewrie sarcastically growled even so it is a signal victory sir mr winwood said in his gravest manner off to the noreast jamaica has come to grips with the other frenchman or so it would appear the lights of both ships are closeaboard each other and all gunfire has ceased so one might assume that she has conquered her foe as well captain we have won and from what little i saw aboard our foe before i sustained my own trifling wound he proudly alluded to his leg no matter how stoic he wished to appear they must have suffered over an hundred fallen and a like number disabled aye captain lewrie admiralty should be impressed perhaps a quarter or a third of the french squadron in the indian and southern oceans eliminated at one blow too sir well forgive me mister winwood but at the moment lewrie attempted to apologise i understand completely sir winwood replied with a knowing nod no matter how much he didnt really understand andrews was your coxn for a long time god save me i shall even miss mister catterall impious as he was but andrews gave his all as they all did did their best and we shall miss them all some more personally dye see lord dont give me a sermon you lewrie silently fumed up to us to do our best to honour their memories and take comfort from the thought that they passed over doing what they freely agreed to endure mr winwood was prosing on in andrews case and the other black volunteers perhaps it is also up to us to shew all of britain that they could fight and fall as bravely as british tars i do believe sir prove to the world the truth of the tracts from the evangelical and abolitionist societies declare aye we could lewrie suddenly decided and not just to stop winwoods mournful droning either they did didnt they andrews and all our blacks who ran away to this you have a point mister winwood we could we should and we shall then you wouldnt have died for bloody nothing matthew lewrie told himself feeling a weight depart his shoulders a halfturn wrench of his heart tell him that it wasnt expedience had nothing to do with saving his precious neck from a hanging but might become a real cause a noble cause ah there ye are sir his cabinservant aspinall exclaimed in great relief to see him at last as he came forward from where the greatcabins would be once the deal and oak partitions were erected sorry tsay sir but yer cabinsre a total wreck again but soon to be put trights the kitties are safe long with the mongooses an that damn bushbaby hes took up with toulon an chalky an hardly dont cry no more long as he can snuggle up with em no coffee aspinall lewrie interrupted i know im babblin sir tis just hard tknow ol andrews is gone aspinall said after a gulp and a snuffle on his sleeve him an so many good lads but didnt we hammer th french though aye we did lewrie agreed beginning to realise what theyd done what a victory theyd accomplished at last and beginning to feel that it had been worth it no matter the price theyd paid is that irish rogue liam desmond aboard do you know aspinall aye sir on th pumps i think pass the word for him then lewrie ordered a minute later liam desmond came cautiously up the ladderway to the quarterdeck hed been summoned before usually to suffer for his antics lewrie noted that his longtime mate patrick furfy lurked within hearing distance at the foot of the steps aye sor desmond warily asked hat in hand looking fearful lewrie held out the crushed bosuns call to him ah i know capm desmond said with a sad sigh of his own at the sight of it glittering amberysilver in the glow of oil or candle lamps andrews woz a foin feller he woz always fair an kindly with us sorry we lost him sor you once said during the mutiny at the nore that youd be my righthand sword if all others failed me lewrie gravely said ive lost my righthand man desmond are ye still willing be yer coxn sor desmond gaped in astonishment sure and i meant it capm faith but ye do me honour and aye ill be well get a better when next in port but lewrie said as desmond took the call from him and looped it round his neck on its silver chain he took a moment to look down at it battered though it was sitting on the middle of his chest and puffed up his satisfaction have to stay sober and ready at all hours mind lewrie said and could hear furfy groan in pity on the main deck even starting to snigger over his friends new more demanding predicament and we could do with furfy in my boat crew too hmm a strong oarsman and we wouldnt let him go adrift without your influence a rightgood idea that sor desmond chuckled looking over his shoulder and calling out hear that pat another favour desmond lewrie said get your lappipes a fifer too perhaps and play something for us now for andrews and those who wont get a proper burial sewn up in canvas under the flag have ye a tune in mind capm desmond asked play johnnie faa lewrie told him it was sad slow celtic and poignant sad enough for even the french survivors to feel what it spoke sad enough a tune to excuse even a postcaptains quiet tears epilogue quid stutdiosa cohors operum struit hoc quoque curo quis sibi res gestus augusti scribere sumit bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum what works is the learned staff composing this too i want to know who takes upon him to record the exploits of augustus who adown distant ages makes known his deeds in war and peace horace epistles i in chapter thirtyfive there was no need for a fire in the magnificently and ornately carved fireplace in the board room of admiralty in london for it was a fine summer day and the tall windows had been thrown open to take the stuffiness and enclosed warmth from the room the equallyshowy chronometer on one gleaming panelled wall slowly ticked and now and then a shift of wind off the thames forced the large repeater of the wind vane on the roof to clack about to display whether the weather stood fair or foul for british warships and merchantmen to depart or whether nature might favour a sally by the french or a combination of french dutch batavian and spanish navies together the first lord of the admiralty john earl spencer sat at the head of a highlypolished table to his right sat the controller of the navy adm sir andrew snape hammond down at the other end of the table not so far away as to be out of earshot for the board room was not so grand in scale as most imagined sir evan nepean the first secretary to admiralty sat and shuffled his notes and records brought by a junior clerk a pen poised to record decisions the mans not worthy of a knighthood i tell you sir he is a scandal a seagoing scandal the youngish earl spencer declared in some heat a mountebank more suited to the company of those scandalous sordid circus people captain leatherwood rescued do we not put his name forward milord adm hammond mildly pointed out between sips of his tea then leatherwood cannot be placed on the honours list either and in all captain leatherwood had a trifling action gainst a panicked and rudderless ships company once those horrid circus people had slain half their officers it was proteus that bore the brunt of it fighting an action lasting one and a half hours whilst jamaica barely fired two full broadsides before her foe struck i grant you milord that captain lewries ah repute is not completely of the best beyond his fame as a pugnacious and sly sea officer fame sir andrew the earl spencer scoffed try notoriety even so milord hed earned a bright name in the fleet before this most recent exploit and the newspapers and the public are falling over themselves in praise of him to the earl spencers distress sir evan nepean had been saving london papers from the best publishers to the most scurrilous and the many articles snipped out and piled on one corner of the table made an impressive stack alongside them was a second pile mostly of reformers tracts complete with woodcut art of two frigates battling in what a lubberly artist portrayed as a hurricane there were portraits of the aforesaid capt alan lewrie rn as well even more imaginative and saintly along with drawings of black and white sailorssome labelled with the names of the heroicallyfallen blacks with lewrie leading them in the boarding of the french frigate luranie as overarmed as an old depiction of a fearsome pirate without the beard and with better hair of course may i say so milord sir evan nepean piped up from the bottom of the table for many of admiraltys daytoday decisions were his to make so that the responsible and lucrative post of first secretary held much more influence than most outside the navy thought but the reverend wilberforce and his followers had made a public figure of him already not quite on the level of an admiral nelson but close do we not offer captain lewrie significant and nearequal rewards that any successful captain and the public has come to expect there might be suspicions that his majestys government not just admiralty favours the side of slaveowners colonial planters and the sugar and shipping interests over what is quickly becoming a widespread sentiment against the institution of slavery preposterous the earl spencer snapped been a while since nelson at the nile milord adm hammond softly stuck in from the other side the common folk and the mob are starved for continued good news anent the war even what may be called a minor frigate action for the most part has quite elated them and sir evan is correct i believe lewrie must be awarded something milord beyond the accolades hes gotten already the earl spencer sourly rejoined tugging the velvet pullcord to summon them more tea thanks of parliament the usual presentation of a plate service and an hundredguinea sword from the east india company for leatherwood and lewrie both both officers granted the freedoms of their towns or villages along with the freedoms of portsmouth london the keys to hearnebay for all i know both agreed that they were insight of each other and with two french national ships brought in as prize the earl spencer continued to carp so proteus and jamaica will reap a pretty penny from being bought into navy service as well the next step might be presenting them at saint jamess palace and knighthoods but as you say leatherwood didnt do all that much and lewrie is simply too we might as well knight that cockney wigmore his actresses and his bears into the bargain no sir andrew i am extremely loath to place captain lewries name to the king twould be too embarrassing his first officer anthony langlie sir evan nepean suggested more mildly promoted to commander of course milord and given an active commission into a suitable vessel the usual thing aye adm hammond nodded with a smile on his face though i doubt leatherwoods first earned the same thing or should we right then both of them promoted he happily said after a resigned nod of assent from the first lord a spell of shore leave for both lewrie and leatherwood then new active commissions for both to better ships hmm the first lord cocked his head towards nepean jamaica was due to be paid off and hulked milord sir evan quickly supplied after a quick shuffle of his notes a very old and bluff bowed sixtyfour gunner as slow as treacle even when new built just before the seven years war but there are several third rates of seventyfour guns coming available and captain leatherwood will be honoured to command one im certain as for captain lewrie hmm he shuffled some more as a steward in livery entered with tray and pot to replace the used cups and empty teapot then silently went out like a zephyr of summer wind proteus is fairly new but has seen rather more action than one may expect milord lewrie was her first and only captain sir andrew stated as if trying to tweak the earl spencer leaning towards him and grinning the surveyors think she will require a total refit sir evan nepean continued four to six months work might you wish captain lewrie to sit ashore on halfpay that long milord by god i do not the first lord barked theres no telling what deviltry the mans capable of with that much idle time available him and there is the ah possibility of being tried for his theft of slaves on jamaica out of sight out of mind seems apt at this moment i will not knight a man who stands a chance of being put in the dock a few months later nor will i allow the papers and public time to discover what sort of man he really is a new ship something larger and suitable of a certainty preferably one able to sail far from england and possible embarrassment sir evan exactly what the foreign office appointee to the privy council suggested might be best for the crown nepean thought hiding his sly grin ah in two more months or so milord sir andrew an eighteenpounder gunned fifth rate frigate will be returned from the dockyards at portsmouth and ready for recommissioning she is the hms savage originally built in just after the start of the war and in very good structural condition barring the usual problems with her bottom and such her former captain has already been reassigned so two whole months with him ashore and unemployed though the first lord mused with a suspicious frown then however long it will take him to gather a new crew there would be no delay in it either milord nepean brightly added for we are in possession of a letter from both the officers and crew of proteus even the marines and cabin steward lads expressing their wish to remain under captain lewrie entire remarkable adm sir andrew hammond allowed he was royal navy man and boy and knew what sort of officer might elicit such loyalty even if the first lord a civilian did not appreciate it we could pay off proteus into the portsmouth yard where she currently is anchored i believe then turn over proteuss people into savage quite neat milord and with little reason for lewrie to come up to london into the clutches of the newspapers hmm oh my yes the first lord quickly enthusiastically agreed make it so sir evan now as to the next matter on our agenda the exotic beasts the jugglers and acrobats the fireeater and his bursts of flame from his mouth the capering clowns and their pig bladders and antics and the clattering waggons painted in fresh bright red and yellow drew such a crowd as any that the marine garrison from portsmouth dockyards had ever drawn the circuss band replenished by new musicians and outfitted in garishlytrimmed uniforms more imposing than the army list of generals including all retired ones oompahhed crashed drummed and tooted along at the head of the parade children of the town deserting the kerbings for the cobblestones to prance and march along with them goggleeyed and shrieking with utter delight at such a wonder helefinks lions dancing bears zebras and god knew whatall and some of them like the performers in their show costumes had fought the filthy french and won for didnt all the newspapers say so all the flyers printed by the circus too say it it wasnt just any tawdry old circus and theatrical troupe it was wigmores travelling extravaganza honoured with a proclamation by the crown with thanks of parliament to boot back from deepest darkest africa bigger and better than ever and oh mummy we must see it we must attend puhlease individual blossoms whole nosegays were flung at the parading performers and beasts even the hyena and the anteaters and the redarsed baboons in their waggon cage the same sort of accolades given a regiment just back from a victorious campaign and there was good old daniel wigmore on a fine horse tipping his hat to one and all a patcheyed foreignlooking cove with a riflemusket in one hand and one of his squawling lion cubs on his saddles pommel a cove who could swing to face backwards turn a flip on his horses back slide down to hang on the side of his mount like a wild red american indian and gallop up the street like the very wind huzzah and that remarkably beautiful girl on the white horse riding astride in breeches and boots so snug you could see and childrens eyes were covered and women tittered into handkerchiefs but my but she was a horsewoman too and with that spiky crown that flowing mane of curly black hair and that bow my gawd she was the lovely eudoxia slayer of a dozen twodozen odious frenchmen intent upon her ravishing or worse and when she stood on her mounts bare back everyone cheered whistled and fell in love with her daring and her bravery then she swerved from the parades course right to the doors of a venerable old posting house frequented by naval officers right onto the sidewalk she forced her horse kapitan lewrie she gaily cried zdrasvutyeh hello again black fellow rodney is healed up da little shooter is well mistress eudoxia lewrie nervously replied doffing his hat to her though with one eye on her father for arslan durschenko had brought his horse to a stop quite nearby and he did hold a musket in his hand and it might be loaded and seaman rodney is now fine fit as a fiddle and the crowd about him began to whisper then cry out that thatthere navy man was black alan lewrie by jingo the emancipator and hero of the south atlantic wot woz in all o them tracts an sich i spose your circus will do well now that lewrie began to say but eudoxia got that impish look in her big almondshaped amber eyes making lewrie glance at her father who was scowling fiercely by then and starting to wheel his horses head round and bravest man in all navy eudoxia loudly declared kapitan is my hero a moment before she leaned down took him by an epaulet and kissed him smack on the mouth with a sly bit of tongue to boot it here must be noted as the crowd went wild with amusement oh christ dont do that not now not lewrie frantically thought though it here must be noted as well he did not find the experience completely disagreeable mummy whos that lady kissing papa his daughter charlotte crossly demanded as his children and his wife caroline bustled from the inns doors whys she dressed like that is she foreign or why i do not know dear but i am certain we shall discover who she is soon caroline lewrie drawled fixing her husband with a very jaundiced glare middle son hugh guffawed his eyes alight with instant heroworship of the famous eudoxia right before his eyes in the flesh so to speak whilst lewries eldest sewallis ever a cautious lad merely gawked and turned red is jenai wife eudoxia asked turning on her sugary charm mistress lewrie wife of bravest kapitan in whole world who savink us from fransooski bas bad peoples spasiha kapitan lewrie speak of you and dyed children so often is right word often i am honoured to be meetink you she gushed you comink to circus you and children will be bolshoi show we will see caroline coolly rejoined honoured to meet you as well since ive read so much about you mistress eudoxia must go now eudoxia said wantink to say bootyeh zdarovi to kapitan lewrie one last time meanink bless you yes for all he do for us dosvidanya kapitan paka snova have a grand tour of britain mistress durschenko lewrie bade her in turn doffing his hat and making a leg to keep it formal and innocent eudoxia kneed her horse and made him perform a kneeling bow to lewrie to the further amazement of the crowd as she swept something like a formal eastern salaam while seated on his back too and that means caroline warily enquired goodbye and see you i think in russian my dear he told her thanking god that carolines only foreign tongue was a little french for paka snovasee you againhad been delivered with such a light in eudoxias eyes laden with so much impish promise and shall we attend the circus alan caroline icily posed well im certain the children would enjoy it dear lewrie replied with as much offhanded blitheness as he could muster actually managing to look his wife in her eyes stead of blinking too much oh mummy could we charlotte squealed about to bounce out of her shoes and her face as squinted as when she needed to pee and hugh and sewallis clamoured for it too weve never seen a circus we shall see children caroline told them im sure that it would be educational though perhaps it might prove too exciting for some of us she added a brow cocked in her husbands direction i believe your father has seen it several times already and what with all that is needful to commission his new ship might have no time to spare for further attendance well lewrie glibly rejoined shrugging again higher and i never laid a finger on the mort he thought well maybe a hand a lip or two but damned if i did damned if i didnt and carohnell think the worst o me either way gawd but this is going t be a long reconciliation ain t i a bloody hero aint that worth something in my own house come along children caroline serenely instructed gathering her brood her regal air parting the press of the crowd before them as sure as moses parted the red sea come alan she bade her husband with a trifle less patience as he lagged behind a little wondering for a second or two whether she meant him to be in their company after all were going to the chandlers shops for your needs dearest or so i thought she said for the benefit of the closepressed spectators oh o course my dear lewrie replied joining them at last he linked arms with her and plastered as much of an untroubled expression on his phyz as caroline wore on hers but what about the circus mummy little charlotte whined oh we shall attend dears caroline vowed turning to smile at her children of course we shall your father will take us for are we not a family after all thank bloody christ lewrie thought with glad relief there is a thaw maybe then began to contemplate how uninterested aloof and semibored he must act at the performance that night and make his wife actually believe it afterword at one time in the fardistant past i rather naively assumed that i had alan lewries career in the royal navy plotted out with an appearance in a series of major events from his entry into the fleet in all the way through to wrong wrong wrong the more i associate with the rogue the further afield i end up departing from that early stab at a curriculum vitae its as if my rubber bracelet which bears the initials wwldwhat would lewrie dowas ensorcelled by a cutrate wizard down on lower broad here in nashville quite near tootsies orchid lounge and the old ryman theatre so that lewries perverse streak of oh no lets go there sometimes takes over it could be worse i could have been possessed by the ghost of hank williams and drunk myself to an early death years ago this all started quite innocently when i ran across a mention in a reference book about a british circus and theatrical troupe that had sailed to america in and had had a wildly successful years tour down the coast of the united states from new england to savannah and lewrie and i both said hmmm about the same time him first me first im still not quite sure but the thought of actresses agile acrobats bareback riders which had a very sexual connotation in the eighteenth centuryfigure it out for yourself skimpily clad aerialists breathy little theatrical ingenues and actresses did i mention actresses the only drawback was the clowns and mimes along with the zoodoo left by a menagerie of exotic beasts as for those slaves the rev william wilberforce and other people whom lewrie met in london before his little odyssey were actual people who were in the relentlessly grim process of reforming every wee bit of english society the word respectable didnt even come into common usage til the late s after wilberforce and hannah more got their talons into things sarah trimmer really wrote dismayingly cute childrens books damning all the old bloodandguts and scarethemtosleep folk tales as too traumatic for such shrinking violets as british children the first roots of the politically correct movement put out their first runners deep under the soil at that moment so successful were the reformers the clapham sect the evangelical society and the society for the abolition of slavery that britons became a very tightassed people just in time for the victorian age to this day you put up a sign demanding that brits line up for something and youll get a queue the likes not seen outside ticket offices for super bowl seats as hannah more gleefully said slowly we shall take away all the bad old influences til the only thing they have to look upon is ourselves or something very much like that but you may get the gist they were social engineers so successful that they made lenin weep with envy slavery in the british isles disappeared in the s though rich business interests fought tooth and nail to keep the sugar teas and coffee crops coming in from the caribbean it was not til that the slave trade was officially abolished throughout the british empire a ban honoured more with lipservice til when the napoleonic wars ended and the government could pay attention to enforcing its laws a peacetime royal navy became active in policing the african coasts with antislavery patrols to stop the continued export of slaves by other countries slavery itself was not abolished in all british colonies until while lewrie is not much of a real musician with his wee pennywhistle and i have had my bad moments with bagpipe lessons and badlydone banjo playing both he and i like music in the last few books readers will have run across the titles of eighteenthcentury tunes and for those who havent been to the smithville old time fiddlers jamboree uncle dave macon days down in murfreesboro tennessee been to the ryman and the grand ole opry or been fortunate enough to be my downstairs neighbours at one in the am who just adore my cds let me cite a couple of them to put you in a lewrie state of mind drink low companions seedy dives and women no better than they ought to be are up to you though smash the windows is by a group called the virginia company a collection of prerevolutionary tavern music on authentic instruments write the virginia company box williamsburg va or call another is nottingham aletavern music from colonial williamsburg recorded at the raleigh tavern contact the williamsburg foundation box williamsburg va so heres lewrie a national hero and actually sortakinda reconciled with his wife but will it all end up aboard tom turdmans barge at dung wharf as things involving lewrie usually do and what is zachariah twigg really up to and has alan been set up as a readymade martyr for the antislavery crowd as lewrie suspects when will the beaumans and their lawyers boo hiss arrive and may lewrie get his new frigate out to sea before they do and finally just what did eudoxia durschenko have in mind when she bade him that enigmatic pakasnovasee you again no lewrie you cant go to the circus again damn yer eyes or maybe he might wwld yall
