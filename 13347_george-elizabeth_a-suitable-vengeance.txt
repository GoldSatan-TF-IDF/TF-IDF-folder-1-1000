to make the most of what little she had she liked to believe it was a natural talent some floors above the rumble of nighttime traffic her naked silhouette gargoyled against the wall of her halfdarkened room and she smiled as her movements made the shadow shift creating ever new forms of black upon white like a rorschach test and what a test she thought practising a gesture of comehither quality what a sight for some psycho chuckling at her talent for selfdeprecation she went to the chest of drawers and affectionately appraised her collection of underwear she pretended hesitation to prolong her enjoyment before reaching for an appealing arrangement of black silk and lace bra and briefs theyd been made in france cleverly designed with unobtrusive padding she donned them both her fingers felt clumsy largely unused to such delicate clothing she began to hum quietly a throaty sound without identifiable melody it served as a paean to the evening to three days and nights of unrestricted freedom to the excitement of venturing out into the streets of london without knowing precisely what would come out of the nights mild summertime promise she slid a long painted fingernail under the sealed flap of a package of stockings but when she shook them out they caught against skin that was more workhardened than she liked to admit the material snagged she allowed herself a singleword curse freed the stocking from her skin and examined the damage an incipient ladder high on the inner thigh she would have to be more careful as she pulled on the stockings her eyelids lowered and she sighed with pleasure the material slid so easily against her skin she savoured the sensation it felt just like a lovers caress and heightened her own pleasure by running her hands from ankles to calves to thighs to hips firm she thought nice and she paused to admire her shape in the cheval glass before removing a black silk petticoat from the chest of drawers the gown that she took from the wardrobe was black the neck high the sleeves long she had purchased it solely for the manner in which it clung to her body like a midnight liquid a belt cinched in its waist a profusion of jet beadwork decorated its bodice it was a knightsbridge creation whose cost mounting on all the other calls upon her finances had finally precluded the indulgence of travel by taxi for the rest of the summer but that inconvenience was no matter really tina knew that some things ultimately pay for themselves she slid her feet into black highheeled pumps before finally switching on the lamp next to the daybed to illuminate a simple bedsittingroom with the sole delicious luxury of a private bath on her first trip to london all those months ago newly married and looking for a haven of escape she had made the mistake of taking a room in the edgware road where shed shared the bath with a floor of smiling greeks all eager to observe the ins and outs of her personal hygiene after that experience sharing so much as a washbasin with another human being had been inconceivable to her and although the additional cost of a private bath had presented something of a challenge at first she had managed to surmount it in a competent fashion she made a final assessment of her makeup and gave approval to eyes correctly shadowed in order to accentuate their colour and correct their shape to brows darkened and brushed into an arch to cheekbones shaded artfully to soften what would otherwise be a rectangular face to lips defined by both pencil and colour to express sensuality and invite attention she shook back her hair as black as her dress and fingered the wispy fringe that fell across her brow she smiled she would do with a final glance round the room she picked up the black handbag she had tossed on the bed checking to make sure she carried only money her keys and two small plastic bags which contained the drug that done her preparations complete she left a few moments in the lift and she was out of the building breathing in the mixed perfumes of the city night that teeming blend of machinery and humanity peculiar to this corner of london as always before heading towards praed street she glanced fondly at the smooth stone exterior of her own building her eyes gliding over the words shrewsbury court apartments which served as epigraph above the double front doors they opened upon her hideaway and harbour the only place on earth where she could be herself she turned away walking towards the lights of paddington station where she took the circle line to notting hill gate and from there the central to tottenham court road with its heady miasma of exhaust fumes and its pushing crowds of a friday night she made her way quickly to soho square here the patrons of nearby peepshows were milling about their voices ringing with every possible accent as they exchanged lewd evaluations of the titillating sights theyd had of breasts and thighs and more they were a surging mass of prurient thrillseekers and tina knew that on another night she might have considered one or more of them as possibilities for an amusing encounter of her own but tonight was different everything was in place in bateman street a short distance from the square she saw the sign she was looking for swinging above a malodorous italian restaurant kats kradle it announced with an arrow pointing into an unlit alleyway next door the spelling was absurd an attempt to be clever that tina always found especially repellent but she had not been the one to select the rendezvous so she made her way to the door and descended the stairs which like the alley in which the club was housed were gritty and smelt of liquor and vomit and plumbing gone bad in nightclub hours it was early yet so the crowd in kats kradle was small confined to a scattering of tables that surrounded a postagestamp dancefloor at one side of this musicians were taking up a melancholy piece of jazz on saxophone piano and drums while their singer leaned against a wooden stool smoking moodily and looking largely bored as she waited for the appropriate moment to make some sort of noise into a nearby microphone the room was quite dark lit by one weak bluish spotlight on the band candles on the tables and a light at the bar tina made her way to this slid onto a stool ordered a gin and tonic from the barman and admitted to herself that for all its grime the location was truly inspired the best soho had to offer for a liaison meant to go unobserved drink in hand she began to survey the crowd a first viewing that gleaned nothing but an impression of bodies a heavy cloud of cigarette smoke the occasional glitter of jewellery the flash of a lighter or a match conversation laughter the exchange of money couples swaying on a dancefloor and then she saw him a young man seated alone at the table farthest from the light she smiled at the sight it was so like peter to select this sort of place where he would be safe from the mischance of being seen by his family or any of his posh friends he ran no risk of condemnation in kats kradle he faced no fear of trouble of being misunderstood he had chosen well tina watched him anticipation curled in her stomach as she waited for the moment when he would see her through the smoke and the dancers oblivious of her presence however he looked only at the door running his fingers through closecropped blond hair in nervous agitation for several minutes tina studied him with interest seeing him order and down two drinks in rapid succession noting how his mouth became harder as he glanced at his watch and his need expanded from what she could see he was dressed quite badly for the brother of an earl wearing a tattered leather jacket jeans and a tshirt bearing the faded inscription hard rock cafe a gold earring dangled from one pierced earlobe and from time to time he reached for this as if it were a talisman he gnawed continually at the fingers of his left hand his right fist jumped in spasms against his hip he stood abruptly as a group of boisterous germans entered the club but he fell back into his chair when it became apparent that the person he sought was not with them shaking a cigarette from a pack that he removed from his jacket he felt in his pockets but brought forth neither lighter nor matches a moment later he shoved back his chair stood and approached the bar right to mamma tina thought with an inward smile some things in life are absolutely meant to be by the time her companion nosed the triumph into a parkingspace in soho square sidney st james could see for herself how finely strung his nerves had become his whole body was taut even his hands gripped the steeringwheel with a telling control which was inches short of snapping altogether he was trying to hide it from her however admitting need would be a step towards admitting addiction and he wasnt addicted not justin brooke scientist bon vivant director of projects writer of proposals recipient of awards youve left the lights on sidney said to him stonily he didnt respond i said the lights justin he switched them off sidney sensed rather than saw him turn in her direction and a moment later she felt his fingers on her cheek she wanted to move away as they slid down her neck to trace the small swell of her breasts but instead she felt her bodys quick response to his touch readying itself for him as if it were a creature beyond her control then a slight tremor in his hand child of anxiety told her that his caress was spurious an instants placation of her feelings prior to making his nasty little purchase she pushed him away sid justin managed a respectable degree of sensual provocation but sidney knew that his mind and body were taken up with the illlit alleyway at the south end of the square he would want to be careful to hide that from her even now he leaned towards her as if to demonstrate that foremost in his life at the moment was not his need for the drug but his desire to have her she steeled herself to his touch his lips then his tongue moved on her neck and shoulders his hand cupped her breast his thumb brushed her nipple in deliberate strokes his voice murmured her name he turned her to him and as always it was like fire like loss like a searing abdication of all common sense sidney wanted his kiss her mouth opened to receive it he groaned and pressed closer to her touching her kissing her she snaked her hand up his thigh to caress him in turn and then she knew it was an abrupt descent to reality she pushed herself away glaring at him in the dim light from the streetlamps thats wonderful justin or did you think i wouldnt notice he looked away her wrath increased just go buy your bloody dope thats why weve come isnt it or was i supposed to think it was for something else you want me to go to this party dont you justin demanded it was an ageold attempt to shift blame and responsibility but this time sidney refused to play along dont you hit me with that i can go alone then why dont you why did you phone me sid or wasnt that you on the line this afternoon honeytongued and hot to get yourself laid at the evenings end she let his words hang there knowing they were true time after time when she swore shed had enough of him she went back for more hating him despising herself yet returning all the same it was as if she had no will that was not tied to his and for gods sake what was he not warm not handsome not easy to know not anything she once dreamed shed be taking into her bed he was merely an interesting face on which every single feature seemed to argue with all the others to dominate the bony skull beneath it he was dark olive skin he was hooded eyes he was a thin scar running along the line of his jaw he was nothing nothing except a way of looking at her of touching her of making her thin boyish body sensual and beautiful and flaming with life she felt defeated the air in the car seemed stifiingly hot sometimes i think of telling them she said they say thats the only way to cure it you know what the hell are you talking about she saw his fingers curl important people in the users life find out his family his employers so he bottoms out then he justins hand flashed caught her wrist twisted hard dont even think of telling anyone dont even think of it i swear if you did sid if you do stop it look you cant go on like this what are you spending on it now fifty pounds a day one hundred more justin we cant even go to a party without you he dropped her wrist abruptly then get out find someone else leave me bloody well alone it was the only answer but sidney knew she couldnt do it and she hated the fact that she probably never would i only want to help then shut up all right let me go down that sodding alley make the buy and get out of here he shoved open the door and slammed it behind him sidney watched him walk halfway across the square before she opened her own door justin stay there he sounded calmer not so much because he was feeling any calmer she knew but because the square was peopled with sohos usual fridaynight throng and justin brooke was not a man who generally cared for making public scenes she ignored his admonition striding to join him disregarding the certain knowledge that the last thing she ought to be doing was helping him get more supplies for his habit she told herself instead that if she werent there sharply on the lookout he might be arrested or duped or worse im coming she said when she reached him the whipcord of tension in his features told her he had moved beyond caring as you like he headed towards the gaping darkness of the alley across the square construction was under way there making the alley mouth darker and narrower than usual sidney made a moue of distaste at the smell of urine it was worse than she had expected it to be buildings loomed up on either side unlit and unmarked grilles covered their windows and their entryways housed shrouded moaning figures who conducted the sort of illicit business which the nightclubs of the district seemed eager to promote justin wherere you planning to brooke raised a cautionary hand up ahead a mans hoarse cursing had begun to fill the air it came from the far end of the alley where a brick wall curved round the side of a nightclub to form a sheltered alcove two figures writhed upon the ground there but this was no lovetryst this was assault and the bottom figure was a blackclad woman who appeared to be no match in either size or strength for her ferocious assailant you filthy the man blond by the appearance of him and wildly angry by the sound of his voice pounded his fists against the womans face ground them into her arms slammed them into her stomach at this sidney moved and when brooke tried to stop her she cried out no its a woman and ran towards the alleys end she heard justins sharp oath behind her he overtook her less than three yards away from the couple on the ground keep back let me see to it he said roughly brooke grabbed the man by his shoulders digging into the leather jacket he wore the action of pulling him upwards freed his victims arms and she instinctively brought them up to protect her face brooke flung the man backwards you idiots do you want the police after you sidney pushed past him peter she cried justin its peter lynley brooke looked from the young man to the woman who lay on her side her dress dishevelled and her stockings in tatters he squatted and grabbed her face as if to examine the extent of her injuries my god he muttered releasing her he stood shook his head and gave a short bark of laughter below him the woman drew herself to her knees she reached for her handbag retching momentarily then most oddly she began to laugh as well part two london afternoons lady helen clyde was surrounded by the trappings of death crimescene exhibits lay upon tables photographs of corpses hung on the walls grisly specimens sat in glassfronted cupboards among them one particularly gruesome memento consisting of a tuft of hair with the victims scalp still attached yet despite the macabre nature of the environment lady helens thoughts kept drifting to food as a form of distraction she consulted the copy of a police report that lay on the worktable before her it all matches up simon she switched off her microscope b negative ab positive o positive wont the met be happy about that hm was her companions only response monosyllables were typical of him when he was involved in work but his reply was rather aggravating at the moment since it was after four oclock and for the last quarterhour lady helens body had been longing for tea oblivious of this simon allcourtst james began uncapping a collection of bottles that sat in a row before him these contained minute fibres which he would analyse staking his growing reputation as a forensic scientist upon his ability to weave a set of facts out of infinitesimal bloodsoaked threads recognizing the preliminary stages of a fabric analysis lady helen sighed and walked to the laboratory window on the top floor of st james house it was open to the late june afternoon and it overlooked a pleasant brickwalled garden there a vivid tangle of flowers made a pattern of undisciplined colour walkways and lawn had become overgrown you ought to hire someone to see to the garden lady helen said she knew very well that it hadnt been properly tended in the last three years yes st james took out a pair of tweezers and a box of slides somewhere below them in the house a door opened and shut at last lady helen thought and allowed herself to imagine joseph cotter mounting the stairs from the basement kitchen in his hands a tray covered by fresh scones clotted cream strawberry tarts and tea unfortunately the sounds that began drifting upwards a thumping and bumping accompanied by a low grunt of endeavour did not suggest that refreshments were imminent lady helen sidestepped one of st james computers and peered into the panelled hall whats going on st james asked as a sharp thwack resounded through the house metal against wood a noise boding ill for the stairway banisters he got down awkwardly from his stool his braced left leg landing unceremoniously on the floor with an ugly thud its cotter hes struggling with a trunk and some sort of package shall i help you cotter what are you bringing up managing quite well was cotters oblique reply from three floors below but what on earth next to her lady helen felt st james move sharply away from the door he returned to his work as if the interruption had not occurred and cotter were not in need of assistance and then she was given the explanation as cotter manoeuvred his burdens across the first landing a shaft of light from the window illuminated a broad sticker affixed to the trunk even from the top floor lady helen could read the black print across it d cotterusa deborah was returning and quite soon by the look of it yet as if this all were not occurring st james devoted himself to his fibres and slides he bent over a microscope adjusting its focus lady helen descended the stairs cotter waved her off i cn manage he said dont trouble yourself i want the trouble as much as do you cotter smiled at her reply for his labours were born of a fathers love for his returning child and lady helen knew it he handed over the broad flat package which he had been attempting to carry under his arm his hold on the trunk he would not relinquish deborahs coming home lady helen kept her voice low cotter did likewise she is tonight simon never said a word cotter readjusted his grip on the trunk not likely to is e he responded grimly they climbed the remaining flights of stairs cotter shouldered the trunk into his daughters bedroom to the left of the landing while lady helen paused at the door to the lab she leaned the package against the wall tapping her fingers against it thoughtfully as she observed her friend st james did not look up from his work that had always been his most effective defence worktables and microscopes became ramparts which noone could scale incessant labour a narcotic that dulled the pain of loss lady helen surveyed the lab seeing it for once not as the centre of st james professional life but as the refuge which it had become it was a large room scented faintly by formaldehyde walled by anatomy charts and graphs and shelves floored by old creaking hardwood ceilinged by a skylight through which milky sun provided an impersonal warmth scarred tables furnished it as did tall stools microscopes computers and a variety of equipment for studying everything from blood to bullets to one side a door led into deborah cotters darkroom but that door had been closed for all the years of her absence lady helen wondered what st james would do if she opened it now flinging it back like an unavoidable invasion into the reaches of his heart deborahs coming home tonight simon why didnt you tell me st james removed one slide from the microscope and replaced it with another adjusting the dials for a higher degree of magnification after a moment of studying this new specimen he jotted down a few notes lady helen leaned across the worktable and clicked off the microscopes light shes coming home she said youve not said a word about it all day why simon tell me instead of answering st james looked past her shoulder what is it cotter lady helen swung around cotter was standing in the doorway frowning wiping his brow with a white linen handkerchief youve no need to fetch deb from the airport tonight mr st james he said in a rush lord ashertons to do it im to go as well he rang me not an hour ago its all arranged the ticking of the wall clock made the only immediate response to cotters announcement until somewhere outside a childs frantic weeping rife with outrage rose on the air st james stirred to say good thats just as well ive a mountain of work to get through here lady helen felt the sort of confusion that requires an accompanying cry of protest the world as she knew it was taking on a new shape longing to ask the obvious question she looked from st james to cotter but their reserve warned her off still she could tell that cotter was willing to say more he appeared to be waiting for the other man to make some additional comment that would allow him to do so but instead st james merely ran a hand through his unruly black hair cotter shifted on his feet ill be about my business then with a nod he left the room but his shoulders looked burdened and his steps were heavy let me understand this lady helen said tommys fetching deborah from the airport tommy not you it was a reasonable enough question thomas lynley lord asherton was an old friend to both st james and lady helen something of a colleague as well since for the past ten years he had worked in the criminal investigation department of new scotland yard in both capacities he had been a frequent visitor to st james cheyne row house but when on earth lady helen wondered had he come to know deborah cotter well enough to be the one to meet her at the airport after her time away at school to phone her father coolly with the arrangements every bit as if he were what on earth was tommy to deborah hes been to america to see her st james replied a number of times he never told you that helen good heavens lady helen was nonplussed how do you know that surely deborah didnt tell you as for tommy he knows that youve always cotter told me last year i suppose hed spent some time wondering about tommys intentions as any father might his dry factual tone spoke volumes more than any telling comment he might have chosen to make her heart went out to him its been dreadful for you hasnt it these last three years without her st james drew another microscope across the table and gave his attention to the removal of a speck of dust that seemed to be adhering stubbornly to its eyepiece lady helen watched him seeing clearly how the passage of time in conjunction with his wretched disability was doing its best to make him every year less of a man in his own eyes she wanted to tell him how untrue and unfair such an assessment was she wanted to tell him how little difference it made but to do so bordered too closely upon pity and she would not hurt him by a display of compassion he did not want the front door slamming far below saved her from having to speak at all rapid footsteps followed they flew up three flights of steps without a pause for breath and served as harbinger of the only person with sufficient energy to make so steep a climb in so little time that sounds like sidney st james said moments before his younger sister burst into the room i knew id find you in here sidney announced brushing a kiss against his cheek she flopped onto a stool and said by way of greeting her brothers companion i do love that dress helen is it new how can you manage to look so put together at a quarter past four in the afternoon while were talking of being put together st james eyed his sisters unusual attire sidney laughed leather pants what dyou think theres a fur as well but i left it with the photographer rather a warm combination for summer lady helen said isnt it beastly sidney agreed happily theyve had me on albert bridge since ten oclock this morning in leather pants a fur coat and nothing else perched on top of a taxi with the driver i wish someone would tell me where they get these male mannequins leering up at me like a pervert oh yes and a bit of au natural showing here and there my au naturel if it comes to that all the driver has to do is look like jack the ripper i borrowed this shirt from one of the technicians were breaking for now so i thought id pop over for a visit she looked round the room curiously so its past four wheres tea st james nodded towards the package which lady helen had left leaning against the wall youve caught us in disarray this afternoon deborahs coming home tonight sid lady helen said did you know sidneys face lit is she at last then those must be some of her snaps wonderful lets have a peep she hopped off her stool shook the package as if it were an early christmas gift and blithely proceeded to remove its outer wrapping sidney st james admonished her pooh you know she wouldnt mind sidney tossed away the sturdy brown paper untied the cords of a black portfolio and picked up the top portrait from the stack within she looked it over whistling between her teeth lord the girls handier with a camera than shes ever been she passed the photograph to lady helen and went on with her perusal of the others in the stack self and bath the three words were scrawled in haphazard script across the bottom edge of the picture it was a nude study of deborah herself arranged in threequarter profile to the camera she had composed the piece cleverly a shallow tub of water the delicate arch of her spine a table nearby on which sat a pitcher hairbrushes and comb filtered light striking her left arm her left foot the curve of her shoulder with a camera and using herself as a model she had copied the tub by degas it was lovely lady helen looked up to see st james nod as if in appreciation of it he walked back to his equipment and started sorting through a stack of reports did you did you know it sidney was asking them impatiently know what lady helen said that deborahs involved with tommy tommy lynley mummys cook told me believe it or not from what she said cotters quite up in arms about it honestly simon you must talk some sense into cotter for that matter talk some sense into tommy i think its completely unfair of him to choose deb over me she resumed her stool that reminds me ive got to tell you about peter lady helen felt a margin of relief at this welcome change of subject peter she said helpfully imagine this sidney used her hands to dramatize the scene peter lynley and a lady of the night dressed all in black with flowing black hair like a tourist from transylvania caught in flagrante delicto in an alley in soho tommys brother peter lady helen clarified knowing sidneys proclivity for overlooking pertinent details that cant be right hes in oxford for the summer isnt he he looked involved in things far more interesting than his studies history and literature and art be damned what are you talking about sidney st james asked as she hopped off the stool and began to prowl around the lab like a puppy she switched on lady helens microscope and had a look through it crikey what is this blood lady helen said and peter lynley sidney adjusted the focus it was let me see friday night yes thats right because id a grim little drinksparty to attend in the west end on friday and that was the night i saw peter on the ground in an alley scuffling with a prostitute wouldnt tommy be pleased if he heard about that tommys not been happy with peter all year lady helen said doesnt peter know it sidney looked at her brother plaintively what about tea is there hope always finish your saga sidney grimaced theres not much else to tell justin and i came upon peter grappling with this woman in the dark he was punching her in the face as a matter of fact and justin pulled him off the woman now this was a bit odd began to laugh and laugh of course she must have been hysterical but before we had a chance to see if she was fit she ran off we drove peter home squalid little flat in whitechapel simon with a yelloweyed girl in filthy blue jeans waiting for peter on the front steps sidney shuddered anyway peter wouldnt say a word to me about tommy or oxford or anything embarrassed i suppose im sure the last thing on earth he expected was to have a friend stumble upon him as he rolled round an alley what were you doing there st james asked or was soho justins idea sidney avoided his gaze dyou think debll take a set of photos of me i ought to start work on a new portfolio now my hairs cut off youve not said a word about it simon and its shorter than yours st james was not to be so easily diverted havent you had enough of justin brooke helen what do you think of my hair what about brooke sid sidney directed a wordless apology towards lady helen before she faced her brother down the resemblance between them was remarkable a sharing of the same curly black hair the same spare aquiline features the same blue eyes they looked like skewed mirror images the liveliness of one was replaced by resigned repose in the other they were beforeandafter pictures the past and the present joined by an undeniable bond of blood sidneys words however seemed an effort to deny this dont motherhen me simon she said the sound of a clock chiming in the room startled st james out of sleep it was am for a dazed moment halfsleeping halfwaking he wondered where he was until a knotted muscle cramping painfully in his neck brought him fully awake he stirred in his chair and got up his movements slow his body feeling bent stretching tentatively he walked to the study window and looked out on cheyne row moonlight lit treeleaves with silver touching upon the restored houses opposite his own the carlyle museum and the corner church in the past few years a renaissance had come to the riverside neighbourhood taking it from its bohemian past into an unknown future st james loved it he went back to his chair on the table next to it a balloon glass still held a halfinch of brandy he drained it switched off the lamp and left the study making his way down the narrow hallway to the stairs these he mounted slowly pulling his bad leg up next to him gripping the handrail against the strain of dead weight he shook his head in weary denigration at his solitary fanciful dance of attendance upon deborahs return cotter had been back from the airport for some hours but his daughter had stopped in only briefly remaining for the entire time in the kitchen from his study st james could hear deborahs laughter her fathers voice the barking of the dog he could even imagine the household cat jumping down from the windowsill to greet her this reunion among them had gone on for half an hour then instead of deborah coming up to bid him hello cotter had stepped into the study with the uneasy announcement that deborah had left again with lord asherton thomas lynley st james oldest friend cotters embarrassment at deborahs behaviour only promised to worsen an already uncomfortable situation said shed only be a while cotter had stammered said shed be back directly said shed st james wanted to stop the words but couldnt think how to do it he resolved the situation by noting the time and declaring his intention of going to bed cotter left him in peace knowing sleep would elude him he remained in the study trying to occupy himself with reading a scientific journal as the hours passed and he waited for her to return the wiser part of him insisted there was no point to a meeting between them now the fool longed for it in a welter of nerves what idiocy he thought and continued climbing the stairs but as if his body wished to contradict what his intellect was telling him he made his way not to his own bedroom but to deborahs on the top floor of the house the door stood open it was a small room with a jumble of furnishings an old oak wardrobe lovingly refinished leaned on uneven legs against the wall a similar dressing table held a solitary pinkedged belleek vase a once colourful rug handmade by deborahs mother just ten months before her death formed an oval on the floor the narrow brass bed that had been hers from childhood stood near the window st james had not entered this room for the three years of deborahs absence he did so now reluctantly crossing to the open window where a soft breeze rustled white curtains even at this height he could catch the perfume of the flowers planted in the garden below it was faint like an unobtrusive background on the canvas of night as he enjoyed the subtle fragrance a silver car glided round the corner from cheyne row into lordship place and halted next to the old garden gate st james recognized the bentley and its driver who turned to the young woman next to him and took her into his arms the moonlight that earlier had served to illumine the street did as much for the interior of the car as st james watched unable to move from the window even if he had wanted to which he did not lynleys blond head bent to deborah she raised her arm fingers seeking first his hair then his face before drawing him nearer to her neck to her breast st james forced his gaze from the car to the garden hyacinth larkspur alyssum he thought kaffir lilies that wanted clearing out there was work to be done he needed to see to it but he couldnt use the garden to avoid his heart he had known deborah from the day of her birth she had grown up a member of his small chelsea household the child of a man who was to st james part nurse part servant part valet part friend during the darkest time of his life shed been a constant companion whose presence had saved him from the worst of his despair but now shes chosen he thought and tried to convince himself in the face of this knowledge that he felt nothing that he could accept it that he could be the loser that he could go on he crossed the landing and entered his laboratory where he turned on a highintensity lamp that cast a circle of light upon a toxicology report he spent the next few minutes attempting to read the document a pitiful endeavour to put his house in order before he heard the cars engine start a sound that was shortly followed by deborahs footsteps in the lower hall he put on another light in the room and walked to the door feeling a rush of trepidation a need to find something to say an excuse for being up and about fully dressed at three in the morning but there was no time to think for deborah came up the stairs nearly as quickly as sidney had done bringing their separation to an end she stepped on to the final landing and started when she saw him simon acceptance be damned he held out a hand and she came into his arms it was natural she belonged there both of them knew it without another thought st james bent his head seeking her mouth but finding instead her mane of hair the unmistakable smell of lynleys cigarettes clung to it a bitter reminder of who she had been and who she had become the odour brought him to his senses and he released her he saw that time and distance had caused him to magnify her beauty attributing physical qualities to her that she didnt possess he admitted to himself what he had always known deborah was not beautiful in any conventional way she didnt have helens sleek aristocratic lines nor had she sidneys provocative features instead she was a compilation of warmth and affection perception and wit qualities whose definition rose from her liveliness of expression from the chaos of her coppery hair from the freckles that dashed across the bridge of her nose but there were changes in her she was too thin and inexplicable illusory veins of regret seemed to lie just beneath the surface of her composure nonetheless she spoke to him much as she always had done have you been working late youve not waited up for me have you it was the only way i could get your father to go to bed he thought tommy might spirit you away this very night deborah laughed how like dad did you think that as well tommy was a fool not to st james marvelled at the rank duplicity behind their words with one quick embrace they had neatly sidestepped deborahs reasons for having left england in the first place as if they had agreed to play at their old relationship one to which they could never return for the moment however even spurious friendship was better than further disjunction i have something for you he led her through the laboratory and opened the door of her darkroom her hand went out for the light and st james heard her gasp of surprise as she saw the new colour enlarger standing in place of her old black and white one simon she was biting the inside of her lip this is how very kind of you truly its not as if you had to and youve even waited up for me colour smudged across her face like unattractive thumbprints a reminder that deborah had never possessed any skills of artifice to fall back upon when she was distressed in his grasp the doorknob felt inordinately cold in spite of the past st james had assumed she would be pleased by the gift she was not somehow his purchase of it represented the inadvertent crossing of an unspoken boundary between them i wanted to welcome you home somehow he said she didnt respond weve missed you deborah ran her hand over the enlargers surface i had a showing of my work in santa barbara before i left did you know that did tommy tell you about it i phoned him because well its the sort of thing that one dreams of happening isnt it people coming liking what they see even buying i was so excited id used one of the enlargers at school to do all the prints and i remember wondering how id ever afford the new cameras i wanted as well as and now youve done it for me she inspected the darkroom the bottles of chemicals the boxes of supplies the new pans for the stop bath and the fixer she raised her fingers to her lips youve stocked it as well oh simon this is more than really i didnt expect this everything is its exactly what i need thank you so much i promise ill come back every day to use it come back abruptly st james stopped himself realizing that he should have had the common sense to know what was coming when he saw them in the car together dont you know deborah switched off the light and returned to the lab ive a flat in paddington tommy found it for me in april he didnt tell you dad didnt im moving there tomorrow tomorrow you mean already today i suppose i do mean today dont i and well be in poor shape the both of us if we dont get some sleep so ill say good night then and thank you simon thank you she briefly pressed her cheek to his squeezed his hand and left so thats that st james thought staring woodenly after her he headed for the stairs in her room she heard him go no more than two steps from the closed door deborah listened to his progress it was a sound etched into her memory one that would follow her right to her grave the light drop of healthy leg the heavy thump of dead one the movement of his hand on the handrail clenched into a tight white grip the catch of his breath as precarious balance was maintained and all of it done with a face that betrayed nothing she waited until hearing his door close on the floor below before she moved away from her own and went as she could not know he had done himself only minutes before to the window three years she thought how could he possibly be thinner more gaunt and ill an utterly unhandsome face of battling lines and angles on which was engraved a history of suffering hair always too long she remembered its softness between her fingers haunted eyes that spoke to her even when he said nothing himself mouth that tenderly covered her own sensitive hands artists hands that traced the line of her jaw that drew her into his arms no no more deborah whispered the words calmly into the coming dawn turning from the window she tugged the counterpane off the bed and fully clothed lay down dont think of it she told herself dont think of anything always it was the same miserable dream a hike from buckbarrow to greendale tarn in a rain so refreshing and pure it could only be phantasmagorical scaling outcroppings of rock running effortlessly across the open moor sliding helterskelter down the fell to arrive breathless and laughing at the water below the exhilaration of it all the pounding of activity the rush of blood through his limbs that he felt he would swear it even as he slept and then awakening with a sickening jolt to the nightmare lying in bed staring at the ceiling willing desolation to fade into disregard but never quite able to disregard the pain the bedroom door opened and cotter entered carrying a tray of morning tea he placed this on the table next to the bed eyeing st james guardedly before he went to open the curtains the morning light was like an electrical current jolting directly through his eyeballs to his brain st james felt his body jerk let me get your medicine cotter said he paused by the bed long enough to pour st james a cup of tea before he disappeared into the adjoining bathroom alone st james dragged himself into a sitting position wincing at the degree to which sounds were magnified by the pounding in his skull the closing of the medicinecabinet was a rifle shot water running into the bath a locomotive roar cotter returned bottle in hand two of thesell do it he administered the tablets and said nothing more until st james had swallowed them then casually he asked see deb last night as if the answer didnt really matter to him cotter returned to the bathroom where st james knew he would test the heat of the water pouring into the tub this was a completely unnecessary civility an act giving credence to the manner in which cotter had asked his question in the first place he was playing the servantandmaster game his words and actions implying a disinterest which he didnt feel st james sugared his tea heavily and swallowed several mouthfuls he leaned back against the pillows waiting for the medicine to take effect cotter reappeared at the bathroom door yes i saw her a bit different wouldnt you say thats to be expected shes been gone a long time st james added more tea to his cup he forced himself to meet the other mans eyes the determination written across cotters face told him that if he said anything more he would be extending a blanket invitation to the sort of revelations he would rather not hear but cotter didnt move from the doorway it was a conversational impasse st james surrendered what is it lord asherton and deb cotter smoothed back his sparse hair i knew that deb would give erself to a man one day mr st james im no fool but knowing ow she always felt about well i suppose id thought that cotters confidence seemed to dwindle momentarily he picked at a speck of lint on his sleeve im that worried about er whats a man like lord asherton want with deb to marry her of course the response came like a reflex but st james didnt voice it even though he knew that doing so would give cotter the peace of mind he sought instead he found himself wanting to voice warnings of lynleys character how amusing it would be to limn his old friend as a dorian gray the desire disgusted him he settled on saying its probably not what you think cotter ran his finger down the doorjamb as if testing for dust he nodded but his face remained unconvinced st james reached for his crutches and swung himself to his feet he headed across the room hoping cotter would see this activity as a conclusion to their discussion but his design was foiled debs got erself a flat in paddington did she tell you that lord ashertons keeping the girl like she was some tart surely not st james replied and belted on the dressinggown that cotter handed him what moneys she got then cotter demanded how else is it paid for if not by im st james made his way to the bathroom where the rush of water told him that cotter in his agitation had forgotten that the tub was rapidly filling he turned off the taps and sought a way to put the discussion to an end then you must talk to her cotter if thats what you think set your mind at rest what i think its what you think as well and theres no denying it i cn see it plain as plain on your face cotter warmed to his topic i tried talking with the girl but that was no good she was off with im last night before id the chance and off again this morning as well already with tommy no alone this time to paddington go to see her then talk to her she might welcome the chance to have some time alone with you cotter moved past him and began setting out his shaving equipment with unnecessary care st james watched warily his intuition telling him the worst was on its way a solid good talk just what im thinking but its not for me to talk to the girl a dads too close you know what i mean he did indeed you cant possibly be suggesting debs fond of you thats always been the case cotters face spoke the challenge beneath the words he was not a man to avoid emotional blackmail if it took him in the direction which he believed that he and st james ought to be travelling if youd caution the girl thats ail id ask caution her how would it run dont have anything to do with tommy deborah if you do god knows you may end up his wife it was beyond consideration just a word cotter said she trusts you as do i st james fought back a sigh of resignation damn cotters unquestioning loyalty throughout the years of his illness blast the fact that he owed him so very much there is always a day of accounting very well st james said perhaps i can manage some time today if you have her address i do cotter said and youll see debll be glad of what you say right st james thought sardonically the building that housed deborahs flat was called shrewsbury court apartments st james found it easily enough in sussex gardens sandwiched in between two seedy boardinghouses recently restored it was a tall building faced with unblemished portland stone ironfenced in the front its door gained by passing across a narrow concrete walkway that bridged the cavernous entrance to additional flats below the level of the street st james pressed the button next to the name cotter an answering buzz admitted him into the small lobby with a floor covered by black and white tiles like the outside of the building it was scrupulously clean and a faint odour of disinfectant announced the fact that it intended to stay that way there was no furniture just a hallway leading to the groundfloor flats a door discreetly hung with a handlettered sign reading concierge as if a foreign word might attest to the buildings respectability and a lift deborahs flat was on the top floor riding up to it st james reflected upon the absurdity of the position in which cotter had placed him deborah was an adult now she would hardly welcome anyones intrusion into her life least of all would she welcome his she opened the door at once to his knock as if shed spent the afternoon doing nothing save awaiting his arrival her expression shifted quickly from welcome to surprise however and it was only after a fractional hesitation that she stepped back from the door to admit him simon id no idea she offered her hand in greeting seemed to think better of the gesture and dropped it to her side youve quite surprised me i was expecting this is really youve only oh why am i babbling please come in the word flat turned out to be a euphemism for her new home was little more than a cramped bedsittingroom still much had been done to fill it with comfort pale green paint refreshing and springlike coated the walls against one of them a rattan daybed was covered with a bright multicoloured counterpane and embroidered pillows on another a collection of deborahs photographs hung pieces which st james had never seen before and realized must represent the result of her years of training in america music played softly from a stereo near the window debussy afternoon of a faun st james turned to comment upon the room what a far cry it was from the adolescent eclecticism of her bedroom at home and caught sight of a small alcove to the left of the door it comprised a kitchen where an undersized table was set with a china teaservice two places were laid he should have realized the moment he saw her it was hardly in character for her to be lolling around in the middle of the day wearing a soft summer dress in place of her usual blue jeans youve someone coming im sorry i should have phoned im not connected yet it doesnt matter really what do you think do you like it the entire bedsit was he thought pretty much what it was intended to be a room of peace and femininity in which a man would want to lie at her side throwing off the days burdens for the pleasure of making love but that was hardly the response deborah wanted from him to avoid having to give one he walked to her pictures although more than a dozen hung on the wall they were grouped in such a way that his eyes were drawn to a striking black and white portrait of a man standing with his back to the camera his head turned in profile his hair and skin both lit with a shimmering cast of water acting as contrast to an ebony background tommy photographs well deborah joined him he does doesnt he i was trying to give some definition to his musculature im not at all sure about it though the lighting seems off i dont know one minute i like it and the next i think its about as subtle as a mug shot st james smiled youre as hard on yourself as you ever were deborah i suppose i am never satisfied with anything thats always been my story id say a piece was fine your father would agree wed bring in helen for a third opinion then youd celebrate your success by throwing it away and claiming we all were hopeless judges she laughed at least i didnt fish for compliments no you didnt do that he turned back to the wall the brief pleasure of their exchange withered to nothing a different sort of study had been placed next to the black and white portrait it too was of lynley seated nude in an old iron bed rumpled bedlinen thrown over the lower part of his torso with one leg raised an arm resting on his knee he gazed towards a window where deborah stood her back to the camera sunlight gleaming along the swell of her right hip yellow curtains billowed back frothily no doubt serving to hide the cable release that had allowed her to take the picture the photograph looked completely spontaneous as if she had awakened at lynleys side and found an opportunity in a chance of light in the contrast of curtains and morning sky st james stared at the picture trying to pretend he could evaluate it as a piece of art knowing all the time it was affirmation that cotter had guessed the entire truth about deborahs relationship with lynley in spite of the sight of them together in his car last night st james knew that he had been holding on to an insubstantial thread of hope it snapped before his eyes he looked at deborah two spots of colour had appeared high on her cheeks heavens im not a very good hostess am i would you like something to drink gin and tonic or theres whisky and tea theres tea ive lots of tea i was about to no nothing youve someone coming ill not stay long stay for tea i can set another place she went to the tiny kitchen please deborah dont st james said quickly imagining the awkward civility of getting through tea and three or four digestive biscuits while deborah and lynley made polite conversation with him all the time wishing he would be on his way its really not right deborah paused at the kitchen cupboard a cup and saucer in her hand not right what dyou mean itll just be listen little bird he wanted only to get everything said do his miserable duty keep his promise to her father and be gone your fathers worried about you with studied precision deborah put down the saucer and then even more carefully the cup on top of it she lined them up with the edge of the worktop i see youre here as his emissary arent you its hardly the role id expect you to play i told him id speak to you deborah at that perhaps it was the change in his tone he saw the spots of colour deepen on her cheeks her lips pressed together she walked to the daybed sat down and folded her hands all right go ahead st james saw the unmistakable flicker of passion cross her face he heard the first stirring of temper in her voice but he chose to ignore both deciding to go on with what he had come to say he assured himself that his motivation was his promise to cotter his given word meant commitment and he could not leave without making certain cotters concerns were explained to his daughter in the most explicit terms your fathers worried about you and tommy he began in what he deemed a reasonable manner and what about you are you worried as well it has nothing to do with me ah i should have known well now that youve seen me and the flat as well are you going to report back and justify dads worries or do i need to do something to pass your inspection youve misunderstood youve come snooping around to check up on my behaviour what is it exactly ive misunderstood it isnt a question of your behaviour deborah he was feeling defensive decidedly uncomfortable their interview wasnt supposed to take this course its only that your relationship with tommy she pushed herself to her feet im afraid thats none of your business simon my father may be little more than a servant in your life but im not i never was where did you get the idea you could come round here and pry into my life who do you think you are someone who cares about you you know that very well someone who deborah faltered her hands clenched in front of her as if she wished to stop herself from saying more the effort failed someone who cares you call yourself someone who cares about me you who never bothered to write so much as a single letter all the years i was gone i was seventeen years old do you know what that was like have you any idea since you care so much she walked unevenly to the other side of the room and swung to face him again every day for months on end there i was waiting like an idiot a stupid little fool hoping for word from you an answer to my letters anything a note a card a message sent through my father it didnt matter what as long as it was from you but nothing came i didnt know why i couldnt understand and in the end when i could face it i just waited for the news that youd finally married helen married helen st james demanded incredulously he didnt stop to consider how or why their conversation was escalating so rapidly into an argument how in gods name could you even think that what else was i to think you might have had the sense to start out with what existed between the two of us before you left england tears sprang into her eyes but she blinked them back furiously oh i thought of that all right every night every morning i thought of that simon lying in my bed trying to come up with a single good reason to get on in my life living in a void living in hell are you pleased to know it are you satisfied now missing you wanting you it was torture a disease with tommy the cure absolutely thank god with tommy the cure so get out of here now leave me alone ill leave all right it would hardly do to have me here in the lovenest when tommy arrives to claim what hes paid for he pointed crudely at each object as he spoke tea laid out nicely soft music playing and the lady herself ready and waiting i can see id get just a bit in the way especially if hes in a rush deborah backed away from him what hes paid for is that why youre here is that what you think that im too worthless and stupid to support myself that this is tommys flat who am i then simon who bloody well am i his bauble some scrubber his tart she didnt wait for the answer get out of my flat not yet he decided by god not yet you talk a pretty piece about torture dont you so what the hell do you think these three years have been like for me and how do you imagine i felt waiting to see you last night hour after hour after three goddamn years and knowing now you were here all that time with him i dont care how you felt whatever it was it couldnt come close to the misery you foisted on me what a compliment to your lover are you sure misery is the word you want to use it comes back to that doesnt it sex is the issue whos screwing deb well heres your chance simon go ahead have me make up for lost time theres the bed go on he didnt reply come on screw me have me for a quickie thats what you want isnt it damn you isnt it when still he was silent she reached in a fury for the first available object that came into her hand she threw it at him with all her strength and it crashed and splintered against the wall near his head they both saw too late that in her rage she had destroyed his gift to a longago childhood birthday a porcelain swan the act ended anger deborah started to speak a fist at her lips as if she were seeking the first horrified words of apology but st james felt beyond hearing another word he looked down at the broken fragments on the floor and crushed them into powder beneath his foot a single sharp movement with which he demonstrated that love like clay can be pitiably friable with a cry deborah rushed across the room to where a few pieces lay beyond his reach she picked them up i hate you tears finally coursed down her cheeks i hate you this is just the sort of thing id expect you to do and why not when everything about you is crippled you think its just your stupid leg dont you but youre crippled inside and by god thats worse her words knifed the air every nightmare come to life st james flinched from their strength and moved towards the door he felt numb weak and primarily conscious of the terrible awkwardness of his gait as if it were magnified a thousand times for her to see simon no im sorry she was reaching towards him and he noted with interest that shed cut herself on the edge of one of the pieces of porcelain a hairline of blood ran from palm to wrist i didnt mean it simon you know i didnt mean it he marvelled at the fact that all previous passion was quite dead in him nothing mattered at all save the need to escape i know that deborah he opened the door it was a mercy to be gone the blood felt like rising floodwaters within his skull the usual precursor of intolerable pain sitting in his old mg outside the shrewsbury court apartments st james fought it knowing that if he gave it even a moments sway the agony would be so excruciating that finding his way back to chelsea without assistance would be impossible the situation was ludicrous would he actually have to telephone cotter for assistance and from what from a fifteenminute conversation with a girl just twentyone years old surely he eleven years her senior with a world of experience behind him ought to have emerged the victor from their encounter rather than what he was at the moment shattered weakkneed and ill how rich he closed his eyes against the sunlight an incandescence that seared his nerves one that he knew did not really exist but was only the product of his heatoppressed brain he laughed derisively at the tortured convolution of muscle bone and sinew that for eight years had been his bar of justice prison and final retribution for the crime of being young and being drunk on a winding road in surrey long ago the air he drew in was hot fetid with the scent of diesel fuel still he sucked it in deeply to master pain in its infancy was everything and he did not pause to consider that doing so would then give him leave to examine the charges which deborah had hurled against him and worse to admit to the truth of every one for three years he had indeed not sent her a message not a single letter not a sign of any kind and the damnable fact behind his behaviour was that he could not excuse it or explain it in a way she might ever come to understand even if she did what point would it serve for her to know now that every day without her he had felt himself growing just a bit more towards nothing for while he had allowed himself to die by inches and degrees lynley had taken up position within the sweet circumference of her life and there he had moved in his usual fashion gracious and calm completely selfassured at the thought of the other man st james made himself stir and felt for the car keys in his pocket determined not to be found looking like a puling schoolboy in front of deborahs block of flats when lynley arrived he pulled away from the kerb and joined the rushhour traffic that was hurtling down sussex gardens as the light changed on the corner of praed street and london street st james braked the car and let his glance wander forlornly with a heaviness that matched the condition of his spirit without registering any of them his eyes took in the multifarious business establishments that tumbled one upon the other down the paddington street like children eager to grab ones attention on the pathway to the tube a short distance away beneath the blue and white underground sign a woman stood she was making a purchase of flowers from a vendor whose cart stood precariously one wheel hanging over the kerb she shook back her head of closecropped black hair scooped up a spray of summer flowers and laughed at something the vendor said seeing her st james cursed his unforgivable stupidity for here was deborahs afternoon guest not lynley at all but his very own sister the knocking began at her door just moments after simon left but deborah ignored it crouched near the window she held the broken fragment of a fluted wing in her hand and she drove it into her palm so that it drew fresh blood just a drop here and there where the edges were sharpest then a more determined flow as she increased the pressure let me tell you about swans he had said when they choose a mate they choose once and for life they learn to live in harmony together little bird accepting each other just the way they are theres a lesson in that for us all isnt there deborah ran her fingers over the delicate moulding that was left of simons gift and wondered how she had possibly come to engage in such an act of betrayal what possible triumph had she managed to achieve beyond a brief and blinding vengeance that had as its fountainhead his complete humiliation and what after all had the frightful scene between them managed to prove at the heart of the matter merely that her adolescent philosophy spouted to him so confidently at the age of seventeen had been incapable of standing the test of a separation i love you she had told him nothing changes that nothing ever will but the words hadnt proved true people werent like swans least of all was she deborah got to her feet wiping at her cheeks roughly with the sleeve of her frock uncaring if the three buttons at the wrist abraded her skin rather hoping they would she stumbled into the kitchen where she found a cloth to wrap round her hand the fragment of wing she placed in a drawer this latter she knew was fruitiess activity carried out in the ridiculous belief that the swan itself might someday be mended wondering what excuse she could make to sidney st james for her appearance she went to the door where the knocking continued wiping her cheeks a second time she turned the knob trying to smile but managing only a grimace what a mess im perfectly deborah faltered a bizarrely clad but nonetheless attractive blackhaired woman stood on the threshold she held a glass of milky green liquid in her hand and she extended it without a prefatory remark nonplussed deborah took it from her the woman nodded sharply and walked into the flat men are all the same her voice was husky with a regional accent she seemed to be trying to shed she padded on bare feet to the centre of the room and continued to speak as if she and deborah had known each other for years drink it up i go through at least five a day itll make you feel a new woman i swear it and christ knows these days i need to feel like new after every she stopped herself and laughed showing teeth that were extraordinarily white and even you know what i mean it was hard to avoid knowing exactly what the woman did mean in a black satin negligee with voluminous folds and flounces she was a walking advertisement for her calling in life deborah held up the glass which had been pressed upon her what is this a buzzer sounded indicating the presence of someone in the street below the woman walked to the wall and pressed the reciprocal bell for entry this place is as busy as victoria station she nodded to the drink removed a card from the pocket of her dressinggown and handed it to deborah nothing but juices and vitamins that a few veggies thrown in a little pickmeup ive written it all down for you hope you dont mind the liberty but from the sound of today youll be needing a lot of it drink it go on she waited until deborah had raised the glass to her lips before sauntering to her photographs very nice this your stuff yes deborah read the list of ingredients on the card nothing more harmful than cabbage which shed always loathed she placed the glass on the worktop and smoothed her fingers across the cloth that was wrapped round her palm she lifted her hand to her tangled mess of hair i must look a sight the woman smiled im a wreck myself until after nightfall i never bother much in the light of day whats the point i say anyway youre a perfect vision as far as im concerned how dyou like the drink its not quite like anything ive ever tasted special isnt it i ought to bottle the stuff yes well its good very good thank you im terribly sorry about the row it was a great one i couldnt help overhearing most of it walls being what they are and for a bit i thought it might come to blows im just next door she cocked her thumb to the left tina cogin deborah cotter i moved in last night is that what all the thumping and pounding was about tina grinned and to think i was imagining some competition well none of that talk you dont look the type to be on the game do you deborah felt herself colouring thank you hardly seemed an appropriate response apparently finding reply unnecessary tina busied herself looking at her reflection in the glass that covered one of deborahs photographs she rearranged her hair examined her teeth and ran a long fingernail between the front two im a ruin makeup just cant do it all can it ten years ago a bit of blusher was all it took and now hours in front of a mirror and i still look like hell when im done a knock sounded on the door sidney deborah decided she wondered what simons sister would say about this unexpected visitor to her flat who was currently studying the photograph of lynley as if she were considering him a source of future income would you like to stay for tea deborah asked her tina swung from the picture one eyebrow lifted tea she said the word as if the substance had not passed her lips for the better part of her adult life sweet of you deb but no three in this kind of situation is a bit of a crowd take it from me ive tried it three deborah stammered its a woman oh no tina laughed i was talking of the table love its a bit small you see and im all elbows and thumbs when it comes to tea you just finish that drink and return the glass later right yes thank you all right and well have a nice litde chat when you do with a wave of her hand tina opened the door swept past sidney st james with an electric smile and disappeared down the hall peter lynley hadnt chosen his whitechapel flat for either amenities or location of the former there were none unless one could call four walls and two windows both painted shut a strong selling feature as to the latter the flat indeed had ease of access to an underground station but the building itself was of previctorian vintage surrounded by others of a similar age and nothing had been done to clean or renovate either buildings or neighbourhood in at least thirty years however both the flat and its location served peters needs which were few and more importantly his wallet which as of today was nearly empty the way he had it worked out they could make it another fortnight if they played it conservatively and held themselves to just five lines a night all right perhaps six then during the day theyd start looking for work in earnest a job in sales for him new performances for sasha he had the brains and the personality for sales and sasha still had her art she could use it in soho theyd want her there hell theyd probably never seen anything like her in soho it would be just like oxford with a bare stage a single spotlight and sasha on a chair letting the audience cut her clothes off daring them to cut off everything get in touch with yourself know what you feel say what you want all the time shed be smiling all the time superior all the time the only person in the room who knew how to be proud of who and what she was head high held confidently arms at her sides iam her posture declared i am i am where was she peter wondered he checked the time his watch was an unattractive secondhand timex that managed to exude an air of unreliability simply by existing hed sold his rolex some time ago and had quickly discovered that relying on this current piece for accuracy was just about as ridiculous as relying on sasha to make a score on her own without latching on to a coppers nark by mistake he avoided dwelling upon that thought by shaking his wrist anxiously and peering at the watch had its blasted hands even moved in the last halfhour he held it to his ear swore in disbelief at the gentle ticking could it only have been two hours since shed left it seemed like ages restlessly he got up from the sagging sofa one of the rooms three pieces of fourthhand furniture if one didnt count the cardboard cartons in which they kept their clothes or the overturned vegetablecrate that held their only lamp the sofa unfolded into a lumpy bed sasha griped about it daily saying it was doing in her back saying she hadnt had a decent hours sleep in at least a month where was she peter went to one of the windows and flicked back its covering a bedsheet crudely fashioned into a curtain by shoving a rusting rod through its hem he gazed through the pane it was grimy inside as well as out as peter searched the street for sashas familiar form for a glimpse of the old carpetbag satchel she always carried he took a dirty handkerchief from the hip pocket of his blue jeans and wiped his nose it was an automatic reaction done without thought and the brief spurt of pain that accompanied it was gone in an instant and thus easily ignored as inconsequential without looking at the linen or examining the new rustcoloured stains upon it he replaced the handkerchief and chewed with rabbit bites on the side of his index finger in the distance at the mouth of the narrow street in which they lived pedestrians passed in brick lane commuters on their way home for the day peter tried to focus upon them making a deliberate exercise of attempting to pick sasha out of the bobbing heads on their way to or from aldgate east station shed come on the northern he told himself make a switch to the metropolitan and home so where was she what was so hard about one buy after all give over the money get the stuff what was taking so long he mulled over the question what was taking sasha so long for that matter what was to prevent the little bitch from taking off with his cash making the score on her own and never coming back to the flat at all in fact why should she bother to return shed have what she wanted thats why she continued to hang about peter rejected the idea as completely impossible sasha wouldnt leave she said only last week that shed never had it as good as she had it from him didnt she beg for it practically every night pensively peter wiped his nose on the back of his hand when had they last done it last night wasnt it she was laughing like crazy and hed caught her up against the wall and wasnt that last night sammy from across the hall pounding on the door and telling them to hold it down and sasha shrieking and scratching and gasping for breath only she wasnt shrieking she was laughing and her head kept bouncing back against the wall and he didnt finish with her couldnt finish but it didnt matter at the time because both of them were up in the clouds that was it last night and shed be back when she scored with his teeth he pulled at the rough edge of a fingernail so what if she couldnt make the buy shed talked big enough this afternoon about hampstead a house near the heath where deals went down if the money was right so where was she how long could it take to get there and back where the hell was she peter grinned tasted blood where hed bitten through the skin it was time for control he inhaled he stretched he touched his toes it didnt matter anyway he had no real need of it he could stop any time everyone knew that one could stop any time still and all he was something with it master manipulator king of the world the door opened behind him and he spun to see that sasha was back in the doorway she pushed her lank hair off her face and watched him warily her stance reminded him of a cornered hare where is it he asked an emotion flickered across her features she kicked the door closed and went to the sofa where she sat on its threadbare brown cushions her back to him her head dropped forward peter felt the skeletal fingers of warning dance against his skin where is it i didnt i couldnt her shoulders started shaking control disintegrated in an instant you couldnt what what in hells going on he dashed to the window and inched back the curtain christ had she blown it had she been followed by the police he peered at the street there was nothing out of the ordinary there no unmarked police car held occupants busily observing the building no van stood illegally against the kerb no plainclothes policeman loitered beneath the streetlamp there was nothing he turned back to her she was watching him over her shoulder her eyes like a dogs curious shade of yellow and brown were watery redrimmed her lips trembled with defeat he knew jesus christ he flew across the room shoved her to one side and grabbed the carpetbag he dumped its contents on to the sofa and sifted through them his hands were clumsy his frantic search useless where the hell wheres the stuff sasha where is it where i didnt then wheres the cash sirens shrieked in his head the walls tilted in sasha what the fuck have you done with the cash sasha reared up at that right off the sofa and across the room thats it she shouted where the fuck is the cash not whereve you been not ive been worried but where the fuck is the cash she whipped back the sleeve of her stained purple jersey deep scratches covered her jaundiced skin bruises were rising to the surface there look for yourself i was mugged you little bastard you were mugged the question climbed a scale of disbelief dont give me that crap whatve you done with my cash i told you your sodding wad of cash was pinched on the bloody platform of the bloody station ive spent the last two hours socializing with the bloody hampstead police ring them yourself if you dont believe me and she began to sob he couldnt believe it he wouldnt christ you cant do anything can you no i cant and neither can you if youd got it yourself last friday like you said you would i told you god damn it how many times do i have to repeat it it didnt work out so you got me to do it didnt you i got you you did you bloody well did her face worked bitterly you were too flipping terrified that youd get busted werent you so you left it to me dont harp on it now when it didnt work out peter felt his palm itch with the need to strike her to see the red rush of blood on her skin he walked away from her buying time seeking calm trying to think what to do youve got them sash all the facts all in order it was all right wasnt it if i took the fall what difference would that make sasha nifford nobody nothing in the newspapers about her right but what would it look like if the honourable peter got his little hands slapped shut up about that making smelly little messes on the family name shut up upsetting the applecarts of three hundred years of lawabiding lynleys upsetting mummy upsetting big brother at scotland yard cid god damn you shut up someone below them pounded on the ceiling shouting for peace still sasha glared at him her posture and expression daring him to disprove what shed said he couldnt lets just think this out he muttered he noticed that his hands were shaking every joint had begun to sweat as well and he shoved them into his pockets theres always cornwall cornwall sasha sounded incredulous why the hell i dont have enough money here i dont believe it if youre out of money ask your brother for a cheque hes rolling in cash everyone knows that peter went back to the window gnawing his thumb but you wont do that will you sasha continued you wouldnt dare ask your brother for a loan were going to traipse all the way to cornwall because youre scared to death of him youre absolutely petrified at the thought of thomas lynleys getting wise to you and what if he does what is he your keeper just some big toff holding an oxford degree are you such a little pansy that stow it i wont what the hells in cornwall that weve got to go there howenstow he snapped her jaw dropped howenstow a little visit with mummy jesus thats just about what id expect of you next either that or sucking your thumb or playing with yourself fucking bitch go ahead hit me you pathetic little twit youve been aching to do it ever since i walked in the door his fist clenched and unclenched god how he wanted to years of upbringing and codes of behaviour to hell he wanted to pound on her face see blood pour from her mouth break her teeth and her nose blacken both of her eyes instead he fled the room sasha nifford smiled she watched the closed door meticulously counting the seconds that it would take peter to crash down the stairs when a sufficient amount of time had elapsed she cracked the bedsheet back from the window and waited for him to fling himself from the building and stumble down the street towards the corner pub he did not disappoint her she chuckled getting rid of peter hadnt been difficult at all his behaviour was as predictable as a trained chimpanzees she went back to the sofa from the spilled contents of her carpetbag she took a chipped compact and flipped it open a pound note was folded into the mirror she removed it rolled it and reached into the v neck of her jersey brassieres she thought drily have such varied uses she removed a plastic bag which held the cocaine shed bought for them in hampstead cornwall be damned she smiled her mouth watered as she poured a small quantity of the drug on to the compacts mirror hastily using a fingernail to chop it into dust using the rolled pound note she inhaled in greedily heaven she thought leaning back against the sofa unutterable ecstasy better than sex better than anything bliss thomas lynley was on the telephone when dorothea harriman entered his office a sheet of memo paper in her hand she gave the paper a meaningful shake and winked at him like a fellow conspirator seeing this lynley brought his conversation with the fingerprint officer to a conclusion harriman waited until he had hung up the phone youve got it detective inspector she announced using his full organizational title in her cheerfully perverse fashion harriman never referred to anyone by mister miss or ms when she had the opportunity to string six or ten syllables together as if she were making introductions at the court of st james either the stars are in the right position or superintendent webberlys won the football pools he signed without a second glance i should be so lucky when i want time off lynley took the memo from her his superior officers name was scrawled in approval across the bottom along with the barely legible note have a care if youre flying lad seven words that telegraphed webberlys accurate guess that he planned upon heading to cornwall for a long weekend lynley had no doubt that the superintendent had also deduced his reason for the trip webberly had after all seen and remarked upon the photograph of deborah on lynleys desk and although he was not himself uxorious the superintendent was always first with congratulations when one of his men got married the superintendents secretary was examining this picture herself at the moment she squinted to bring it into focus once again eschewing the spectacles which lynley knew were in her desk wearing spectacles detracted from the marked resemblance harriman bore to the princess of wales a resemblance which she did much to promote today lynley noted harriman was wearing a reproduction of the blacksashed blue dress which the princess had worn to the tomb of the unknown soldier in america royalty had looked quite svelte with it on harriman however was given over just a bit too much to hips rumour has deb back in london harriman said replacing the picture and frowning at the unorganized clutter of his desktop she gathered up a fan of telephone messages clipped them together and straightened five files shes been back for more than a week lynley answered thats the change in you then grist for the marriage mill detective inspector youve been grinning like a fool these last three days have i walking on bubbles with not a trouble in the world if this is love ill take a double portion thank you he smiled sorted through the files and handed two of them to her take these instead will you webberlys waiting for them harriman sighed i want love and he gives me she examined them fibre optic reports from a killing in bayswater how romantic im in the wrong line of work but its noble work harriman just what i need to hear she left him calling out to someone to answer a phone that was ringing in an unmanned office nearby lynley folded the memo and flipped open his pocket watch it was halfpast five hed been on duty since seven there were at least three more reports on his desk waiting for comment but his concentration was dwindling it was time to join her lynley decided they needed to talk he left his office making his way down to the lobby and out the revolving doors onto broadway he walked along the side of the building such an unprepossessing combination of glass grey stone and protective scaffolding towards the green deborah still stood where he had seen her from his office window in the corner of that misshapen trapezoid of lawn and trees she appeared to be alternating between studying the top of the suffragette scroll and gazing at it through her camera which she had mounted on its tripod perhaps ten feet away whatever she hoped to capture through the lens seemed to elude her however for as lynley watched she scrunched up her nose dropped her shoulders in disappointment and began disassembling her equipment packing it away in a sturdy metal case lynley prolonged the moment before he crossed the green to join her taking pleasure in a study of her movements he savoured her presence he had no fondness for the tender angst of being in love with a woman who was six thousand miles away so deborahs absence had created anything but an easy time for him most of it he had spent with his mind fixed upon when he would next see her on one or another of his quick trips to california but now she was back she was with him he was fully determined to keep it that way he crossed the lawn scattering pigeons who were pecking about in search of crumbs from afternoon lunches they took hasty flight and deborah looked up her hair which had been pulled back with a haphazard arrangement of combs tumbled towards freedom she muttered in exasperation and began to fuss with it you know she said by way of greeting him i always wanted to be one of those women whore described as having hair like silk you know what i mean an estella havisham type did estella havisham have hair like silk he pushed her hand away and saw to the snarls himself she must have can you imagine poor pip falling for someone who didnt have hair like silk ouch pulling a bit honestly isnt it pathetic i lead one life and my hair leads another well its fixed now sort of thats encouraging they laughed together and began gathering her belongings which were scattered on the lawn shed come with tripod cameracase a shoppingbag containing three pieces of fruit a comfortable old pullover and her shoulderbag i saw you from my office lynley told her what are you working on a tribute to mrs pankhurst actually i was waiting for the light to strike the top of the scroll i thought to create some diffraction with the lens utterly defeated by the clouds im afraid by the time they decided to drift away the sun had done so as well she paused reflectively and scratched her head what an appalling display of ignorance i think i mean the earth she fished in her shoulderbag and brought out a mint which she unwrapped and popped into her mouth they strolled back towards scotland yard ive managed to get friday off lynley told her monday as well so were free to go to cornwall im free that is and if youve nothing planned i thought we might he stopped wondering why he was adding the verbal apologia cornwall tommy deborahs voice was no different when she asked the question but her head was turned away from him so he couldnt see her expression yes cornwall howenstow i think its time dont you i know youve only just come back and perhaps this is rushing things but youve never met my mother deborah said only ah yes your coming to cornwall would give your father an opportunity to meet her as well and its time they met she frowned at her scuffed shoes and made no reply deb it cant be avoided for ever i know what youre thinking theyre worlds apart theyll have nothing to say to each other but that isnt the case theyll get on believe me he wont want to do this tommy ive already thought of that and of a way to manage it ive asked simon to come along its all arranged in fact he did not include in the information the details of his brief encounter with st james and lady helen clyde at the ritz they on their way to a business dinner and he en route to a reception at clarence house he also didnt mention st james illconcealed reluctance or lady helens quick excuse an enormous backlog of work shed said promising to keep them busy for every weekend over the next month helens declining the invitation had been too quick to be believable and the speed of her refusal in combination with the effort she made not to look at st james told lynley how important absence from cornwall was to them both even if he had wanted to lie to himself he couldnt do so in the face of their behaviour he knew what it meant but he needed them in cornwall for cotters sake and the mention of the older mans possible discomfort was what won them over for st james would never send cotter alone to be wretchedly enthroned as a weekend visitor to howenstow and helen would never abandon st james to what she clearly visualized as four days of unmitigated misery so lynley had used them it was all for cotters sake he told himself and refused to examine the secondary reasons he had even more compelling than cotters comfort for arriving at howenstow with a surfeit of companions deborah was inspecting the silver letters on the yards revolving sign she said simons to go and helen sidney as well lynley waited for her further reaction when there was none other than the smallest of nods he decided they were finally close enough to the single area of discussion which they had long avoided it lay between them unspoken putting down roots of potential doubt which needed to be extirpated once and for all have you seen him deb yes she shifted her tripod from one hand to the other she said nothing else leaving everything up to him lynley felt in his pocket for cigarette case and lighter he lit up before she had a chance to admonish him feeling weighted down by a burden he did not wish to define he sighed i want to get us through this deb no thats not quite true is it we need to get through it i saw him the night i got home tommy he was waiting up for me in the lab with a homecoming present an enlarger he wanted me to see it and then the next afternoon he came to paddington we spoke thats all was left unsaid lynley tossed his cigarette to one side angry with himself he wondered what it was that he really wanted deborah to say and why he expected her to account for a relationship with another man that had spanned her entire life and how on earth she could ever begin to do so he disliked the belief that was eating at his confidence a gnawing conviction that somehow deborahs return to london had the power to nullify every word and act of love that had passed between them in the last several years perhaps hidden beneath the most troubling of his feelings was the real reason he was determined to have st james with them in cornwall to prove to the other man once and for all that deborah was his it was a contemptible thought tommy he roused himself to find that deborah was watching him he wanted to touch her he wanted to tell her how he loved the way her green eyes were flecked with bits of gold the way her skin and hair reminded him of autumn but all of that seemed ridiculous right now i love you tommy i want to be your wife that lynley decided didnt seem ridiculous at all part three blood score nancy cambrey scuffed her feet along the gravel drive that wound from the howenstow lodge to the great house she sent up delicate puffs of dust like miniature brown rainclouds it had been an unusually dry summer thus far so a greyish patina of grime dressed the leaves of the rhododendrons that lined the roadway and the trees arching overhead seemed not so much there to provide shade as to trap the heavy dry air beneath their boughs out from under the trees the wind whipped round from gwennap head on its way into mounts bay from the adantic but where nancy walked the air was still as death and it smelt of foliage burned to cinders by the sun perhaps she thought the heaviness pressing so uneasily upon her lungs was not really born of the air at all but was instead a child of her dread for she had promised herself that she would speak to lord asherton the first time he came on one of his rare visits to cornwall now he was coming she ran her fingers through her hair it felt limp its ends brittle in the last few months she had taken to wearing it pulled back with a piece of plain elastic at the nape of her neck but today she had given herself a shampoo and left her hair to dry hanging straight and simple bluntly cut round her face and shoulders it didnt feel right she knew it didnt look right unattractive and unflattering when once it had been a source of bashful pride how your hair shines nance yes how it had the sound of voices up ahead made her pause and squint myopically through the trees vague figures moved near a table set out on the lawn where an old oak provided a substantial area of shade two of the howenstow dailies were at work there nancy recognized their voices they were girls she had known from childhood acquaintances who had never quite become her friends they belonged to that collection of humanity who lived behind the barrier which she had erected between herself and others on the estate barring her from intimacy with the lynley children as effectively as with the children of the tenants the farmers the day workers and the servants nowhere nancy she had labelled herself and her life had been an effort to carve out a singular place where she might belong she had that place now nominal at best but decidedly her own a world circumscribed by a fivemonthold baby daughter gull cottage and mick mick michael cambrey university graduate journalist world traveller man of ideas and husband of nancy she had wanted him from the first eager to bask in his charm to relish his looks to hear his conversation and his easy laughter to feel his eyes upon her and hope to be the cause of their animation so when she went on her weekly visit to his fathers newspaper to check over the bookkeeping as shed done for two years when she found mick there in place of his father his invitation to linger and chat for a bit had been welcome how he loved to talk how she loved to listen with little to contribute save her admiration however how simple it had been to arrive at the belief that she needed somehow to contribute more to their relationship and she had done so on the mattress in the old howenstow mill where theyd spent an entire april making love starting januarys baby shed given little thought to how her life might change shed given less thought to how mick himself might change only the moment existed only sensation mattered his hands and mouth his hard male body insistent and eager the faint salt on his skin his groan of pleasure as he took her the knowledge that he wanted her superseded any reflection upon the possible consequences they were insubstantial how different it was now can we talk about it roderick shed heard mick say with our money situation being what it is i hate to see you make a decision like this lets talk about it when i get back from london hed listened laughed once replaced the telephone receiver and turned to find her shrinking back from the doorway a flamefaced eavesdropper but he wasnt concerned by her presence he merely ignored her and returned to his work while above them in the bedroom little molly wailed nancy had watched as he tapped on the keys of his new word processor she heard him mutter and saw him pick up the manual to read a few pages she didnt cross the room to speak to him instead she wrung her hands with our money situation being what it is they didnt own gull cottage it was merely a rental let to them on a monthly basis but money was tight mick spent it too freely the last two rental payments hadnt been made if dr trenarrow intended an increase now if that increase were added to what they already owed they would sink and if that happened where on earth could they go certainly not to howenstow where they would have to live in the lodge on her fathers angry charity linens gotter ole in it mary brought another not with set a plate down ont oo the ells gonna sit squat in the middle of the table mar laughter drifted nancys way as the dailies shook out a crisp white tablecloth it billowed from their hands caught in a sudden gust of wind that managed to find its way through the armour of the trees nancy raised her own face to it but it captured a patch of dead leaves and dust and flung them up at her so that she tasted fine grit she lifted a hand to brush at her face but the effort drained her of strength sighing she trudged on towards the house it was one thing of course to talk of love and marriage in london it was another to feel the full range of implications behind those easy words when she saw them spread out before her in cornwall by the time she got out of the limousine that had met them at the lands end airstrip deborah cotter was feeling decidedly lightheaded her stomach was churning as well because she had never known lynley in any way other than in her own environment and upon her own terms she hadnt thought about what it would mean to marry into his family she knew he was an earl of course shed ridden in his bentley been to his london house even met his valet shed eaten off his china drunk from his crystal and watched him dress himself in his handtailored clothes but all of that had somehow fallen into a category of behaviour which she had conveniently labelled how tommy lives none of it had ever affected her own life in any way however seeing howenstow from the air as lynley circled the plane twice over the estate had served as the first indication to deborah that life as she had known it for twentyone years faced potential and radical alteration the house was an enormous jacobean structure built in the shape of a variegated e with its central leg missing a large secondary wing grew in reverse direction from the buildings west leg and to the northeast just beyond its spine stood a church beyond the house clustered a scattering of outbuildings and stables and beyond these the howenstow park spread out in the direction of the sea cows grazed on this parkland amid towering sycamore trees that grew in abundance protected from the sometimes inclement southwestern weather by a fortuitous natural slope of land at the perimeter of all this a skilfully crafted cornish wall marked the boundary of the estate proper but not the end of the asherton property which was deborah knew divided among dairy farms agriculture and abandoned mines that had once provided the district with tin faced with the concrete undeniable reality that was tommys home no longer an illusory setting for the weekend houseparties she had overheard discussed by st james and lady helen for so many years deborahs mind became taken up with the risible notion of herself deborah cotter the child of a servant moving blithely into the life of this estate as if it were manderley with max de winter brooding somewhere within its walls waiting to be rejuvenated by the love of a simple woman hardly an act in her line she thought what on earth am i doing here the entire situation felt like a dream with chimerical elements stacking one upon the other the flight down in the plane the first viewing of howenstow the limousine and uniformed chauffeur waiting on the airstrip even lady helens lighthearted greeting of this man jasper my god so sartorially splendid the last time i was here you hadnt even bothered to shave did little to allay deborahs qualms at least nothing was expected of her on the drive to howenstow other than to admire cornwall and she had it was a wild part of the country comprising desolate moors stony hillsides sandy coves whose hidden caves had long been used as smugglers caches sudden lush woodlands where the countryside dipped into a combe and everywhere tangles of celandine poppy and periwinkle that dominated the narrow lanes the main drive to howenstow shot off from one of these canopied by sycamores and edged by rhododendrons it passed a lodge skirted the park dipped beneath an ornate tudor gatehouse circled a rose garden and ended before a massive front door above which a hound and a lion battled resplendently in the asherton coat of arms they got out of the car with the usual jumble that accompanies an arrival deborah favoured the building with a single fleeting look it appeared to be deserted she wished that were the case ah heres mother lynley said turning deborah found him looking not towards the front door where she had expected to see an excessively welldressed countess of asherton standing with one white hand extended limply in welcome but towards the southeast corner of the house where a tall slender woman was striding towards them through the shrubbery deborah could not have been more surprised at the sight of lady asherton she was wearing old tennis clothes with a faded blue towel flung round her shoulders this she used vigorously to wipe perspiration from her face arms and neck three large wolfhounds and a gangling young retriever bounded at her heels and she paused wrested a ball from one of them and threw it with the skill of a bowler to the far side of the garden she laughed as they disappeared in frantic chase after it watching them for a moment before joining the party by the front door tommy she spoke pleasantly youve had your hair cut a bit differently havent you i like it very much she didnt touch him instead she gave embraces to lady helen and st james before turning to deborah and continuing to speak with a rueful gesture at her tennis clothes forgive my appearance deborah i dont always greet guests so decidedly unturned out but frankly im lazy and if i dont take my exercise at the same hour every day i manage to find a thousand excuses for not taking it at all tell me youre not one of those dreadful health fiends who jog every morning at dawn it was certainly not a welcometoourfamily salutation but on the other hand it wasnt the sort of clever greeting that managed to mix requisite courtesy with unmistakable disapproval deborah wasnt sure what to make of it as if she understood and wanted to get them through the first moments as smoothly as possible lady asherton merely smiled squeezed deborahs hand and turned to her father throughout the exchange cotter had been standing to one side in the heat sweat sheened his face he was managing to make his clothes look as if theyd been made for a man several inches taller and much heavier than he mr cotter lady asherton said may i call you joseph im only too delighted that you and deborah shall be part of our family so here was the standard welcome wisely lynleys mother had saved it for the person she had intuitively known would most need to hear it thank you mlady cotter clasped his hands behind him as if in the fear that one might jump out and begin pumping lady ashertons arm of its own volition lady asherton smiled it was a duplicate of tommys crooked smile its dorothy actually although for some reason that ive never quite understood my family and friends have always called me daze which is better than diz i suppose since that suggests dizzy and im afraid i should have to draw the line at something that comes so perilously close to describing my personality cotter looked rather dumbfounded at what was clearly an invitation to address the widow of an earl by her christian name nonetheless after a moment for thought he nodded sharply and replied daze it is good lady asherton responded lovely weve a beautiful weekend for a visit havent we its been a bit hot of course todays quite warm isnt it but i expect well have a breeze this afternoon sidneys already arrived by the way and shes brought the most interesting young man with her rather dark and melancholy brooke st james asked sharply yes justin brooke do you know him simon rather better than hed like if the truth be told lady helen said but he promises to behave himself dont you simon darling no poison in the porridge no duelling at dawn no brawls on the drawingroom floor just utter civility for seventytwo hours what perfect teethgritting bliss ill treasure each moment st james replied lady asherton laughed of course you will what houseparty could possibly be complete without skeletons swinging out of every cupboard and tempers on the boil it makes me feel quite a young girl again she took cotters arm and led the way into the house let me show you something im absurdly proud of joseph they could hear her saying as she pointed to the elaborate tessellated entry this was put in just after our great fire of by some local workmen now dont you believe this for an instant but legend has it the fire her voice drifted out of their hearing in a moment cotters laughter rang out in response at that the churning in deborahs stomach lessened relief shot through her muscles like a spring releasing tension and told her how nervous she had really been about this first meeting of their parents it could have been disastrous it would have been disastrous had tommys mother been any other sort of woman save the kind who swept away the diffidence of strangers with a few amiable words shes wonderful deborah felt the need to say it aloud to someone and without thinking she turned to st james all the signs of approval were on his face the lines round his eyes crinkled more deeply briefly he smiled welcome to howenstow deb darling lynley put his arm round her shoulders and led her into the house where a high ceiling and a mosaic floor made the air cool and moist a refreshing change from the heat outside they found lady asherton and cotter in the great hall to the right of the entry it was an elongated room dominated by a fireplace whose chimneypiece of unadorned granite was surmounted by the head of a wild gazelle pendant plasterwork decorated the ceiling and dropmoulded panelling covered the walls upon these hung lifesized portraits of the lords and ladies of asherton representatives from each generation who gazed upon their descendants in every kind of pose and every kind of dress deborah paused before an eighteenthcentury portrait of a man in cream breeches and red coat leaning against a halfbroken urn with a riding crop in his hand and a spaniel at his feet tommy good heavens he looks exactly like you hes certainly what tommy would look like if we could only talk him into wearing those delicious trousers lady helen remarked deborah felt lynleys arm tighten round her shoulders she thought at first it was in response to the laughter that greeted lady helens comment but she saw that a door had opened at the north end of the hall and a tall young man wearing threadbare blue jeans was padding in his bare feet across the parquet floor a hollowcheeked girl followed him she too was shoeless this would be peter deborah decided aside from his emaciated appearance he possessed the same blond hair the same brown eyes and the same fine cheekbones nose and jaw of many of the portraits that lined the walls unlike his ancestors on canvas however peter lynley wore an earring through one pierced ear it was a swastika dangling from a slender gold chain and it grazed the top of his shoulder peter youre not in oxford lynley asked the question smoothly enough a demonstration of good breeding before the weekend guests but deborah felt the tension in his body peter flashed a smile shrugged his shoulders and said we came down for some sun only to discover you had the same idea all we need is judy here for a sibling reunion right fingering the clasp that held earring to earlobe he nodded at st james and lady helen and drew his companion forward in a gesture that duplicated lynleys own he put his arm round her shoulders this is sasha her arm encircled his waist her fingers slid beneath his grimy tshirt and into his blue jeans sasha nifford without waiting for his brother to make a similar introduction peter nodded at deborah and this is your bridetobe i take it youve always had excellent taste in women but weve seen that demonstrated well enough through the years lady asherton came forward she looked from one son to the other and extended her hand as if she would join them together in some way i was so surprised when hodge told me peter and sasha had arrived and then i thought what a lovely idea it was to have peter here for your engagement weekend lynley replied evenly my thought exactly will you show our guests to their rooms mother id like a few minutes with peter to catch up weve lunch planned in just an hour the days so fine that we thought wed have it outdoors good in an hour if youll see to everyone it was far more an order than a request hearing his cool tone deborah looked at the others to gauge their reactions but saw in their faces only a determination to ignore the unmistakable current of hostility that crackled through the air lady helen was examining a silverframed photograph of the prince of wales st james was admiring the lid of an oriental teacase cotter was standing in a bay window gazing out at the garden darling lynley was saying to her if youll excuse me for a bit tommy if youll excuse me deb its just this way my dear lady asherton touched her lightly deborah didnt want to move lady helen spoke tell me youve given me that darling green room overlooking the west courtyard daze you know the one above the gun room ive been longing to spend a night there for years sleeping with that thrilling fear that someone might accidentally blast away at the ceiling below with a shotgun she took lady ashertons arm they headed for the door there was nothing left to do but to follow deborah did so but as she reached the inner hall she looked back at lynley and his brother they faced each other warily squaring off poised to fight and whatever warmth the weekend had earlier promised iced over into nothing at the sight of them and at the sudden recognition of the great gaps in her knowledge of tommys relationship with his family lynley closed the music room door and watched peter walk with a step that was much too careful and precise to the window he sat down on the windowseat curving his lengthy frame into a comfortable position on the green brocade cushion the walls in the room were papered in a print of yellow chrysanthemums on a field of green and that combination of colours in conjunction with the high sunlight of noon served to make peter look even more haggard than he had in the great hall tracing a pattern against a distortion in the glass he was doing his best to ignore lynley altogether what are you doing in cornwall youre supposed to be in oxford wed made arrangements for a tutor for the summer wed agreed youd stay there lynley knew that his voice was both cold and unfriendly but he could do nothing to modulate it the sight of his brother had shaken him peter was skeletally thin his eyes looked yellow the skin round his nostrils was excoriated and scabbed peter shrugged looking sullen its just a visit for gods sake im not here to stay im going back all right what are you doing here and dont give me that business about the weekend sun because im not going to buy it i dont care what you buy but just think how fortuitous my arrival is tommy if i hadnt shown up unexpectedly this morning id have missed the festivities altogether or was that your intention did you want to keep me away another nasty family secret kept under wraps so that your little redhead doesnt learn too many of them all at once lynley strode across the room and whipped his brother out of the windowseat ill ask you again what youre doing here peter peter shook him off ive chucked it all right is that what you want to hear ive dropped out ok have you gone completely mad where are you living ive digs of my own in london and dont worry ive no intention of asking you for money ive plenty of my own he shouldered his way past lynley and went to the old broadwood piano he fingered its keys in a light staccato tapping dissonant and irritating this is nonsense lynley tried to speak reasonably but he felt disheartened as he read the meaning behind peters words and who is that girl where did she come from how did you meet her peter shes not even clean she looks like peter spun around shut up about her shes the best thing thats ever happened in my life and dont you forget it shes the only decent thing thats happened to me in years that strained credibility it also revealed the worst lynley crossed the room youre on drugs again i thought you were clean i thought wed straightened you out in that programme last january but youre back to it you havent chucked oxford at all have you theyve chucked you thats it isnt it isnt it peter peter didnt answer lynley grasped his brothers chin with thumb and index finger and turned peters head so that it was inches away from his own what is it now are we trying heroin yet or are we still wrapped up in our devotion to cocaine have you tried mixing them what about smoking them or that religious experience of mainlining the whole mess peter said nothing lynley pushed him for an answer youre still after that ultimate high arent you after all drugs are what lifes all about and what about sasha are you two developing a fine meaningful relationship cocaine must be a great foundation for love you can really bond to an addict cant you still peter refused to respond lynley pulled his brother to a mirror that hung on a wall behind the harp and shoved him towards it so that he would have to look at his unshaven face it was pasty his lips were cracked his nose was running onto his upper lip pretty sight arent you lynley demanded what are you telling mother that youre not using any longer that you just have a cold released peter rubbed his face where his brothers fingers had dug in and bruised the unhealthy flesh you can even talk about mother he whispered you can even talk god tommy i wish youd just die neither peter nor sasha showed up for lunch and as if an appropriate response to this had been agreed upon in advance noone mentioned the fact instead everyone concentrated on passing round platters of prawn salad cold chicken asparagus and artichokes gribiche while completely overlooking the two empty chairs that faced one another at the far end of the table lynley welcomed his brothers absence he wanted distractions one presented itself less than five minutes into the meal when lynleys estate manager came round the south wing of the house and strode directly towards the oak tree his attention however did not seem given to the party gathered beneath it instead his gaze was fixed on the distant stables where a young man jumped nimbly over the drystone wall and came across the park at a jog the sun wove streaks of colour against him as he passed in and out of the shade of the trees from the table sidney st james called out happily what a fine horseman your son is air penellin he took us out for a ride this morning but justin and i could hardly keep him in sight john penellin flicked her a cursory nod of acknowledgement but his dark celtic features were rigid lynley had known penellin long enough to recognize when he was hard put keeping a tight rein on fury and justin generally rides quite well dont you darling but mark dazzled us both brooke said only hes good all right and went back to his chicken faint beads of perspiration stood out on his swarthy skin mark penellin came under the oak in time to hear the last two comments ive just had lots of practice he said generously you both did great he ran the back of his hand across his damp forehead a smudge of dirt discoloured his cheek he was a softer lighter version of his father penellins greystreaked black hair was brown in mark his craggy features unscored in marks youth the father was sapped by age and anxiety the boy looked energetic healthy alive peters not here he asked looking the length of the table thats odd he phoned me at the lodge just a bit ago said i was to come up to join us for lunch no doubt lady asherton said how very good of peter we were in such a rush this morning that i didnt think to phone you myself im so sorry mark sometimes i think my mind is splintering away altogether do join us mark john please she indicated the places that had been intended for sasha and peter it was obvious that john penellin did not intend to brush off what was bothering him by sitting down to lunch with his employers and their weekend guests this was a workday for him like any other and he had not come out of the house in order to signal his displeasure at being excluded from a luncheon to which he had no desire to be invited in the first place plainly he had come to intercept his son fast childhood friends mark and peter were of an age they had spent long years in each others company sharing games and toys and adventures along the cornish coast they had played together swum together sailed together grown up together only their schooling had been different with peter attending eton as had every male in the family before him and mark attending a day school in nanrunnel and from there a secondary school in penzance but the separation of their schooldays had not been enough to divide them they had maintained their old friendship over time and distance but obviously not any longer if penellin could prevent it lynley felt the regret of a loss even before john penellin spoke yet it was only reasonable to expect the man to protect his only son seeking any way possible to keep him from becoming influenced by the changes that had come over peter nancys wanting you at the lodge penellin said to mark youve no need of peter at the moment but he phoned and ive no interest in who phoned get back to the lodge surely a quick lunch john lady asherton began thank you my lady weve no need of it he looked at his son black eyes unreadable in an inflexible mask but his arms bared because he wore the sleeves of his workshirt rolled up showed veins like cords come with me boy and then to lynley with a nod to the other sorry john penellin turned on his heel and walked back towards the house after casting a look round the table part supplication and part apology his son followed him they left behind that sort of uneasy reserve in which members of a party must decide whether to discuss what has just occurred or to ignore it altogether they held true to their previously unspoken agreement to overlook anything which held the promise of blighting a weekend of bliss lady helen led the way have you any idea she said as she speared a fat prawn what a compliment it is to be enthroned theres simply no other word for it deborah in greatgrandmamma ashertons bedroom for your engagement weekend considering the manner in which everyones tiptoed reverentially by it when ive been here in the past ive always got the distinct impression theyve been saving that room for the queen should she ever pop in for a visit thats the room with the terrifying bed sidney put in draperies and gewgaws ghoulies and banshees carved right into the headboard like a grinling gibbons nightmare this must be the test of true love deb like the princess and the pea lady helen said did you ever have to sleep there daze greatgrandmamma was alive when i first came here for a visit so instead of sleeping in the bed one had to spend several hours sitting next to it reading from the bible she was quite a devotee of some of the more lurid passages in the old testament as i recall extensive explorations into sodom and gomorrah sexual misbehaviour lust and salacity she wasnt very interested in how god punished the sinners however leave em to the lord shed say and wave a hand at me get on with it girl did you get on with it sidney asked of course i was only sixteen i dont think id ever read anything so delicious in my life she laughed engagingly i count the bible as largely responsible for the sinful life her eyes suddenly dropped her quick smile faded then reappeared in a determined fashion do you remember your greatgrandmother tommy lynley was concentrating on his wineglass on his inability to define colour in a liquid that existed somewhere between green and amber he made no reply deborahs hand touched his a contact so fleeting it might not have happened at all when i saw that bed i wondered how gauche it would be if i slept on the floor she said one does somehow expect the entire affair to come creeping to life directly after nightfall lady helen said but i long to sleep there anyway i always have why have i never been allowed to spend the night in that terrifying bed it wouldnt be too horrible if one didnt have to sleep there alone sidney raised an eyebrow at justin brooke a second body to comfort one a warm body that is even more preferably a live one if greatgrandmamma ashertons taken to wandering the halls id prefer she not drop in to keep me warm thank you but as for any of the rest of you just knock twice some more welcome than others i hope justin brooke said only if they behave themselves sidney replied st james looked from his sister to her lover saying nothing he reached for a roll broke it neatly in half this is obviously what comes of discussing the old testament over lunch lady helen said a mere mention of genesis and we become a group of reprobates the companys answering laughter got them through the moment lynley watched them walk off in separate directions sidney and deborah went towards the house where the former learning that deborah had brought her cameras had announced she would change into something seductive to inspire deborah to new photographic heights st james and lady helen sauntered towards the gatehouse and the open park beyond it lady asherton and cotter headed off together towards the northeast side of the house where sheltered by a grove of beech and lime trees the little chapel of st petroc housed lynleys father and the rest of the asherton dead and justin brooke murmured vaguely about finding a tree under which to doze a statement that sidney poohpoohed with a wave of her hand within moments lynley was alone a fresh breeze caught the edge of the tablecloth he fingered the linen moved a plate to one side and regarded the ruins of the meal he had an obligation to see john penellin after such a long absence the estate manager would expect it of him he would no doubt be waiting for him in the office ready to go over the books and examine the accounts lynley dreaded their meeting the dread had nothing to do with the possibility that penellin might bring up peters condition and lynleys own responsibility to do something about it nor did the dread reflect a lack of interest in the life of the estate the true difficulty lay in what both concern and interest implied a return however brief to howenstow lynleys absence this time had been inordinately long nearly six months he was honest enough with himself to know what it was that he was avoiding by coming to howenstow so seldom it was exacdy what he had been avoiding for so many years either by not coming at all or by bringing with him a troop of friends as if life in cornwall were a s gardenparty with himself at the centre laughing and talking and pouring champagne this engagement weekend was no different in design from any trip he had made to cornwall in the last fifteen years he had merely used the excuse of surrounding deborah and her father with familiar faces so that he himself would not have to meet alone the one face in his own life that he couldnt bear to see he hated that thought at the very same time as he knew that his stormy relationship with his mother somehow had to be laid to rest during this weekend he didnt know how to do it every word she said no matter how innocuous she intended it to be merely served as a dredge uprooting emotions he did not want to feel producing memories he wanted to avoid demanding actions he did not possess the humility or the courage to take pride was at issue between them along with anger and guilt and the need to blame intellectually he knew that his father would have died anyway but he had never been able to accept that simple maxim far easier to believe that a person and not a disease had killed him for one could blame a person and he needed to blame sighing he pushed himself to his feet from where he was on the lawn he could see that the blinds in the estate office had been drawn against the afternoon sun but he had no doubt john penellin was waiting behind them expecting him to act out the role of eighth asherton earl no matter how little it was to his liking he walked towards the house the estate office had been placed with an eye to its purpose situated on the ground floor across from the smokingroom and abutting the billiard room its location made it accessible to members of the household as well as to tenants come to pay their rent in no way did the room suggest ostentation greenedged hemp matting rather than carpet did duty as surface upon the floor paint not panelling or paper covered the walls upon which hung old estate photographs and maps from a plain ceiling iron chains supported two whiteshaded lightfixtures beneath them simple pine shelves held decades of recordbooks a few atlases half a dozen journals the filing cabinets in the corner were oak battered from generations of use as were the desk and the swivel chair behind it in this chair at the moment however sat not john penellin who conducted much of his business from the estate office instead a thin figure occupied his accustomed place huddling as if cold her cheek resting upon her palm as lynley reached the open door he saw that it was nancy cambrey in her fathers chair she was playing restlessly with a container of pencils and although her presence instead of her fathers gave lynley the excuse he needed to be on his way and to put off his meeting with penellin indefinitely he found that he hesitated at the sight of the mans daughter nancy was very much changed her hair once a brown streaked with gold that shimmered in the light had lost most of its shine and all of its beauty it hung drearily round her face without style grazing the tops of her shoulders her skin once blushing and smooth with a cast of freckles making an endearing bandits mask across nose and on cheeks had become quite pallid it looked thicker somehow the way skin in a portrait looks if an artist adds an unnecessary layer of varnish and in doing so destroys the effect of youth and beauty he was trying to create everything about nancy cambrey suggested just that sort of destruction she looked faded used up overwashed overworn this extended to her clothes a shapeless housedress replaced the trendy skirts jerseys and boots she once had worn but even the dress was several sizes too large and it hung upon her loosely much like a smock but without a smocks style it was too old to be a piece of modern fashion and together with nancys appearance the dress made lynley hesitate made him frown although he was seven years her senior hed known nancy cambrey all of her life liked her as well the change was troubling shed been pregnant he knew that there had been a forced marriage with mick cambrey from nanrunnel but that was the end of it or so his mothers letter had informed him and then a few months later he received the birth announcement from nancy herself he responded with a duty gift and thought nothing more about her until now when he wondered if having a baby could have brought about such a change another wish granted he thought wryly another distraction he entered die office she was looking th rough a crack in the blinds that covered the bank of office windows as she did so she chewed on the knuckles of her right hand something she obviously did habitually for they were red and raw too raw to have arrived at that condition through housework lynley said her name she jumped to her feet hands thrust behind her back youve come to see dad she said i thought you might after lunch i thought hoped to catch you ahead of him my lord lynley felt his customary rush of embarrassment at her final two words it sometimes seemed that he had spent most of the last ten years of his life avoiding every situation in which he might have to hear someone say them youve been waiting to see me not your father i have yes she moved from behind the desk and went to a ladderback chair that stood beneath a wallmap of the estate here she sat her hands curled into tight balls in her lap at the end of the corridor the outer door banged against the wall as someone shoved it open too recklessly footsteps sounded against the tiled floor nancy braced herself against the back of the chair as if in the hope of hiding from whoever had come into the house instead of approaching the estate office however the footsteps turned left at the stillroom and faded on their way nancy exhaled in a nearly imperceptible sigh lynley went to sit in her fathers chair its good to see you im glad you came by she moved her large grey eyes to the windows speaking to them rather than to him i need to ask you something its difficult for me how to begin have you been ill youve got awfully thin nancy the baby has it he was mortified to realize that he had no idea of the babys sex no mollys fine still she would not look at him but im eaten by worry what is it its why ive come but tears rose to her eyes without spilling over humiliation mottled her skin dad mustnt know he cant then its between us whatever we say lynley fished out his handkerchief and passed it across the desk she pressed it between her hands but did not use it controlling the tears instead are you at odds with your father not i mick thingsve never been right between them because of the baby and me and how we married but its worse now than before is there some way i can help because if you dont want me to intercede with your father im not sure what else he let his voice drift off waiting for her to complete the sentence he saw her draw her body in as if she were garnering courage before a wild leap into the abyss you can help yes with money she flinched involuntarily as she said the words but then went bravely on with the rest im still doing my bookkeeping in penzance and nanrunnel and im working nights at the anchor and rose but its not been enough the costs what sort of costs the newspaper you see micks dad had heart surgery a year ago last winter did you know and micks been running the paper for him ever since but he wants to update he wants equipment he couldnt see how hed be spending the rest of his life in nanrunnel on a weekly paper with brokendown presses and manual typewriters he has plans good plans but its money he spends it theres never enough id no idea mick was running the spokesman its not what he wanted he only meant to be here a few months last winter just till his dad got back on his feet but his dad didnt recover as quick as they thought and then i lynley could see the picture well enough what had probably begun as a diversion for mick cambrey a way to make the time at his fathers newspaper in nanrunnel less boring and onerous had evolved into a lifelong commitment to a wife and child in whom he no doubt had little more than a passing interest were in the worst possible state nancy was continuing hes bought word processors two different printers equipment for home equipment for work all sorts of things but theres not enough money weve taken gull cottage and now the rents been raised we cant pay it weve missed the last two months as it is and if we lose the cottage she faltered but again drew herself together i dont know what well do gull cottage it was the last thing he had expected her to say are you talking about roderick trenarrows old place in nanrunnel she smoothed the handkerchief out along the length of her leg plucking at a loose thread on the a embroidered at one corner mick and dad never got on did they and we needed to move once the baby came so mick made arrangements with dr trenarrow for us to take gull cottage and you find yourselves overextended were to pay each month but these last two months mick hasnt paid dr trenarrows phoned him but mick isnt bothered a bit he says moneys tight and theyll talk about it when he gets back from london london a story hes been working on there the one hes been waiting for he says to set him up as a journalist the kind he wants to be he thinks he can sell it as a freelance piece the way he used to maybe even get a television documentary made and then therell be money but for now theres nothing im so afraid well end up on the streets or living in the newspaper office that tiny room in the back with a single cot we cant come back here dad wouldnt have it i take it your father knows nothing about all this oh no if he knew she raised a hand to her mouth moneys not a problem nancy lynley said he was relieved in fact that it was only money she wanted from him and not an understanding little chat with her landlord ill lend you what you want take whatever time you need to pay me back but i dont understand why your father mustnt know micks expenditures seem reasonable if hes trying to modernize the paper any bank would shell not tell you everything john penellin said grimly from the doorway shame alone will stop her from telling it all shame pure and simple the best shes got from mick cambrey with a cry nancy jumped to her feet body arched for flight lynley rose to intervene dad she reached out towards him voice and gesture both offered placation tell him the rest her father said he advanced into the room but he shut the door behind him to prevent nancys escape since youve aired half your dirty linen for his lordship tell him the rest youve asked for money havent you then tell him the rest so he understands what kind of mans on the receiving end of his investment its not what you think isnt it penellin looked at lynley mick cambrey spends money on that newspaper all right theres truth in that but the rest he spends on his lady friends and its nancys own money isnt it girl earned at her jobs how many jobs nance all the bookkeeping jobs in penzance and nanrunnel and then every night at the anchor and rose with little molly in a basket on the floor of the pub kitchen because her father cant be bothered away from his writing to see to her while nancy works to support them all only its not his writing hes taken up with is it its his women how many are there now nance it isnt true nancy said thats all in the past its the newspaper costs dad nothing else dont make your shame worse by colouring it with a lie mick cambreys no good never was never will be oh perhaps good enough to get the clothes off an inexperienced girl and plant his baby inside her but not good enough to do a thing about it without being forced and look at yourself nance a shining example of the mans affection for you look at your clothes look at your face its not his fault see what hes helped you become he doesnt know im here hed never let me ask but hell take the money wont he and never question how you came by it just as long as it meets his needs and what are his needs this time nancy has he another lady perhaps two or three no nancy looked desperately at lynley i just i she shook her head her face dissolving into misery penellin moved heavily to the wallmap of the estate his skin was grey look at what hes done to you he said dully and then to lynley see what mick cambreys done to my girl simon and helen shall come with us as well sidney announced only moments before she had pulled a coralcoloured dress from the jumble of clothing scattered across her room the colour should have been all wrong on her but in this case fashion triumphed over hue she was swirls of crepe from shoulder to midcalf like a cloud at sunset she and deborah were heading through the garden towards the park where st james and lady helen walked together beneath the trees sidney shouted at them come and watch deb snap away at me at the cove half in and half out of a ruined dinghy a seductive mermaid will you come neither responded until deborah and sidney reached them then st james said considering the volume of your invitation no doubt you can expect quite a crowd with everyone ready to see just the sort of mermaid you have in mind sidney laughed thats right mermaids dont wear clothes do they oh well pooh youre just jealous that im to be debs subject for once and not you however she admitted twirling in the breeze i did have to make her swear shed take no snaps of you not that she needs any more if you ask me she must have a thousand in her collection already a veritable history of simononthestairs simoninthegarden simoninthelab i dont recall being given much choice about posing sidney tossed her head and set off across the park with the others in her wake poor excuse that youve had your chance for immortality simon so dont you dare step in front of the camera today and take away mine i think i can restrain myself st james replied drily tm afraid i cant promise the same thing darlings lady helen said i plan to compete ruthlessly with sidney to be in the foreground of every picture deborah takes surely ive a future as a mannequin just waiting to be discovered on the howenstow lawn ahead of them sidney laughed and marched southeast in the direction of the sea under the enormous park trees where the air was rich with the fertile smell of humus she found myriad sources of inspiration perched on a massive branch struck down by the winter storm she was an impish ariel freed from captivity holding a cluster of larkspur she became persephone newly delivered from hades against the trunk of a tree with a crown of leaves in her hair she was rosalind dreaming of orlandos love after she had explored all the permutations of antic posturing for deborahs camera sidney ran on reaching the edge of the park and disappearing through an old gate in the rough stone wall in a moment the breeze brought her cry of pleasure back to the others shes reached the mill lady helen said ill see that she doesnt fall into the water without waiting for a response without giving the other two a passing glance she hurried off in a moment she too was through the gate and out of the park deborah welcomed the opportunity to be alone with simon there was much to say she hadnt seen him since the day of their quarrel and once tommy had informed her that he would be part of their weekend party she had known she would have to say or do something to serve as apology and to make amends but now that a chance for conversation had presented itself deborah found that anything other than the most impersonal comment was unthinkable she knew quite well that she had severed the final ties to simon in paddington and there was no way she could unsay the words that had effected the surgical cut between them they continued in the direction that lady helen had taken their slow pace dictated by st james gait in the silence that grew broken only by the ceaseless calling of the gulls the sound of his footsteps seemed an amplified deformity deborah finally spoke in the need to drive that sound from her ears reaching aimlessly back into the past for a memory they shared when my mother died you opened the house in chelsea st james looked at her curiously that was a long time ago you didnt have to do it i didnt know that then it all seemed so reasonable to my sevenyearold mind but you didnt have to do it i dont know why i never realized till today he brushed a tangle of dutch clover from his trouser leg theres no real easing a loss like that is there i did what i could your father needed a place to forget or if not forget at least to go on but you didnt have to do it we could have gone to one of your brothers they were both in southampton they were so much older it would have been reasonable you were were you really only eighteen what on earth were you thinking about saddling yourself with a household when you were just eighteen why did you do it why on earth did your parents agree to let you do it she felt each question increase in intensity it was right why your father needed something to take the place of the loss he needed to heal your mother had only been dead two months he was devastated we were afraid for him deborah none of us had ever seen him like that if he did something to harm himself youd already lost your mother we none of us wanted you to lose your father as well of course youd have had us to take care of you theres no question of that but its not the same as a real parent is it but your brothers southampton if hed gone to southampton hed just have been a spare wheel in an established household at a loose end and feeling everyones pity but in chelsea the old house gave him something to do st james shot her a smile youve forgotten what a condition the house was in havent you it took all his energy mine as well to make the place habitable he didnt have time to keep agonizing over your mother the way he had been he had to start letting the worst part of the sorrow go he had to get on with his life with yours and mine as well deborah played with the shoulderstrap of her camera it was stiff and new not like the comfortably frayed strap on the old dented nikon she had used for so many years before she had gone to america thats why you came this weekend isnt it she said for dad st james didnt reply a gull swept across the park so close to them that deborah could feel the wild rush of its wings beat the air she went on i saw that this morning how thoughtful you are simon ive been wanting to tell you that ever since we arrived st james thrust his hands into his trouser pockets a gesture that momentarily emphasized the distortion which his brace brought to his left leg it has nothing to do with thoughtfulness deborah why not it just doesnt they walked on passing through the heavy birch gate and entering the woodland of a combe that fell down to the sea sidney shouted unintelligibly up ahead her words bubbling with laughter deborah spoke again youve always hated the thought that someone might see you as a fine man havent you as if sensitivity were a sort of leprosy if it isnt thoughtfulness that brought you with dad what is it then loyalty she gaped at him to a servant his eyes became dark how funny that she had completely forgotten the sudden changes their colour could take on when an emotion struck him to a cripple he replied his words defeated her bringing them full circle to a beginning and an end that would never alter from her perch on a rock above the river lady helen saw st james coming slowly through the trees shed been watching for him since deborah had come hurrying down the path a few minutes before as he walked he flung to one side a heavyleafed stalk that hed broken from one of the tropical plants that grew in profusion in the woodland below her sidney gambolled in the water her shoes hanging from one hand and the hem of her dress dangling disregarded in the river nearby with camera poised deborah examined the disused millwheel that stood motionless beneath a growth of ivy and lilies she clambered among the rocks on the riverbank camera in one hand the other outstretched to maintain her balance although the photographic qualities of the old stone structure were apparent even to lady helens untutored eye there was an unnecessary intensity to deborahs study of the building as if she had made a deliberate decision to devote all her energy to the task of determining appropriate camera angles and depth of field she was obviously angry when st james joined her on the rock lady helen observed him curiously shadowed by the trees his face betrayed nothing but his eyes followed deborah along the bank of the river and every movement he made was abrupt of course lady helen thought and not for the first time she wondered what inner resources of fine breeding they would have to call upon to get them through the interminable weekend their walk finally ended at an irregularly shaped clearing which rose to a promontory perhaps fifty feet below gained by a steep path that wound through scrub foliage and boulders the howenstow cove glittered in the steamy sun the perfect destination on a summer afternoon fine sand cast up visible waves of heat on the narrow beach limestone and granite at the waters edge held tidepools animated by tiny crustaceans the water itself was so perfectly crystalline that had not the waves declared it otherwise a sheet of glass might have been placed on its surface it was a place not safe enough for boating with its rocky bottom and its distant reefguarded outlet to the sea but it was a fine location for sunbathing three people below them were using it for this purpose sasha nifford peter lynley and justin brooke sat on a crescent band of rocks at the waters edge brooke was shirtless the other two were nude peter was skin stretched over a ribcage with neither sinews nor fat as buffer between them sasha consisted of a bit more mass but it hung upon her with neither tone nor definition particularly her breasts which dangled pendulously when she moved of course its a lovely day for a lie in the sun lady helen said hesitantly st james looked at his sister perhaps wed wait sidney said as they watched brooke handed peter lynley a small container from which peter tapped powder on to the flat of his hand he bent to it hovered over it with such a passion to possess that even from the clifftop the others could see his chest heave with the effort to ingest every particle he licked his hand sucked it and at the last raised his face to the sky as if in thanksgiving to an unseen god he handed the container back to brooke at that sidney exploded you promised damn you to hell you promised sid st james grabbed his sisters arm he felt the tensility of her insubstantial muscles as adrenalin shot through her body sidney dont no sidney tore herself away from him she kicked off her shoes and began to descend the cliff sliding in the dust catching her frock against a rock and all the time cursing brooke foully with one imprecation after another oh god deborah murmured sidney at the cliffbottom sidney hurtled across the narrow strip of sand to the rock where the three sunbathers were watching her in dazed surprise she threw herself on brooke her momentum dragged him down off the rocks and onto the sand she fell upon him punching his face you told me you wouldnt you liar you bleeding rotten filthy little liar give it to me justin give it to me now she grappled with him her fingers gouging at his eyes brooke put up his arms to fend her off and thus exposed the cocaine she bit his wrist and ripped the container from his hand brooke shouted as she rose to her feet he grabbed her legs and toppled her to the ground but not before she had staggered to the water uncapped the container and thrown it with a tomboys sure strength into the sea theres your drug she shrieked go after it kill yourself drown above them on the rock peter and sasha laughed idly as justin surged to his feet pulled sidney to hers and began to drag her into the water she clawed at his face and neck her nails drew a vicious fourpronged trail of blood on his skin ill tell them she screamed brooke struggled to hold on to her he caught her arms and pinned them savagely behind her she cried out he smiled and forced her to her knees he shoved her forward putting one foot on her shoulder he plunged her head beneath the water when she fought for air he shoved her back down st james felt rather than saw lady helen turn to him his entire body had gone icy simon never had his own name sounded so dreadful below them brooke dragged sidney to her feet but her arms now released she fell upon him undaunted kill you she was sobbing for breath she aimed an ineffective blow at his face attempted to smash her knee into his groin he filled his hand with her short wet hair hauled her head back sharply and punched her the blow and those that followed it resounded hollowly against the cliff in defence she lashed out at him succeeded in getting her hands round his throat her fingers dug into his knotted veins and twisted he ripped her hands away catching her arms once again but she was too quick for him this time she turned her head and sank her teeth into the side of his neck jesus brooke released her stumbled back up on to the beach and sank into the sand he held his hand to the spot where sidney had bitten him when he brought his hand away it showed red with blood freed sidney struggled out of the water her dress hung on her body like a sodden second skin she was coughing wiping at her cheeks and her eyes her strength was spent it was then that brooke moved with a ragged curse he leaped to his feet grabbed her and threw her to the ground he straddled her body he filled his fist with sand and ground it into her hair and across her face on the rock above peter and sasha watched curiously sidney squirmed beneath him coughing crying trying ineffectually to push him away you want physical he grunted pressing one arm down against her neck you really want physical lets have it hm he fumbled with his trousers he began to tear at her clothes simon deborah cried she turned to st james she said nothing else st james understood why he was incapable of movement enraged unafraid but most of all crippled its the cliff he said helen for the love of god i cant manage the cliff lady helen cast only one look at st james before she reached for deborahs arm hurry deborah didnt move she stood with her eyes fixed powerlessly on st james face when he began to turn from them both she put out her hand as if she would touch him deborah lady helen grabbed deborahs camera dropped it to the ground theres no time hurry but now the panicked words sprung deborah to action she ran with lady helen for the path they began the steep descent to the cove mindless of the dirt and the dust that rose round them like smoke beneath them on the sand sidney fought off justin brooke with the kind of renewed strength that is born of terror but he was getting the better of her and his previous fury was fast developing into sexual arousal and sadistic pleasure clearly in his mind sidney was about to get what she had wanted all along lady helen and deborah reached him simultaneously he was a goodsized man but no match for the two of them especially since lady helen was driven by a fair amount of rage herself they threw themselves upon him and their confrontation was over in less than a minute leaving brooke splayed out on the ground panting for breath and groaning from several furious kicks to his kidneys sidney weeping dragged herself away from him she cursed and pulled at her shredded dress whoa oh wow peter lynley murmured he took a new position with his head pillowed on sashas stomach some rescue huh sash just when things were getting good lady helen flung her head up she was out of breath she was streaked with dirt her entire body was trembling so badly she wasnt sure if she would be able to walk whats the matter with you peter she whispered hoarsely whats happened to you this is sidney sidney peter laughed sasha smiled they settled themselves more comfortably to enjoy the sun lady helen listened at the heavy panels of st james bedroom door hearing nothing she wasnt quite certain what she had expected from him anything beyond brooding solitude would have been out of character and st james was not a man who generally acted out of character he wasnt doing so now the stillness behind the door was so complete that had she not seen him to this very room two hours before lady helen would have sworn it was unoccupied but she knew he was in there damning himself to isolation well she thought hes had enough time to flagellate himself time to rout him out she raised her hand to knock but before she could do so cotter opened the door saw her and stepped into the corridor he gave a quick backward glance into the room lady helen could see that the curtains had been drawn and shut the door behind him he folded his arms across his chest had she been given to mythological allusions lady helen would have dubbed cotter cerberus then and there since this was not her bent she merely squared her shoulders and promised herself that st james would not avoid her by posting cotter to guard the gates hes up by now isnt he she spoke casually an enquiry from a friend deliberately overlooking the fact that the rooms darkness indicated st james was not up at all and had no intention of getting up any time soon tommy has a nanrunnel adventure planned for us tonight simon wont want to miss it cotter tightened his arms he asked me to make is excuses bit of pain this afternoon the eadaches you know what its like no cotter blinked taking his arm lady helen pulled him away from the door across the corridor to a line of quarry windows which overlooked the pantry court cotter please dont let him do this lady helen we got to cotter paused his patient manner of address indicated that he wished to reason with her lady helen wanted none of that you know what happened dont you cotter avoided answering by taking a handkerchief from his pocket blowing his nose and then studying the cobblestones and fountain in the courtyard below cotter lady helen insisted you do know what happened i do from deb then you know he cant be allowed to brood any longer but is orders were damn his orders to hell a thousand and one times youve ignored them and done exactly as you please if its for his own good and you know this is for his own good now lady helen paused to consider a plan hed accept so youre wanted in the drawing room everyones meeting there for sherry you havent seen me the entire afternoon so you werent here to stop me from barging in on air st james and taking charge of him after my own fashion all right although no smile touched cotters lips his nod signalled approval right lady helen watched him walk off in the direction of the main body of the house before she returned to the door and entered the room she could see st james form on the bed but he stirred when she closed the door so she knew he wasnt asleep simon darling she announced if youll pardon the ghastly use of alliteration were to have our collective cultural consciousness raised with a nanrunnel adventure tonight god knows well have to fortify ourselves with seven or eight stiff sherries can a sherry be stiff if were going to survive i think tommy and deborah are well ahead of us in their drinking so youll have to be quick if were even to catch up what will you wear she walked across the room as she was speaking going to the windows to pull back the curtains she arranged them neatly more to stall for time than to see to their proper hanging and when she could find no reason to continue fussing with them she turned to the bed to find st james observing her he looked amused youre so obvious helen she sighed in relief pitying himself had never really been the question of course hating himself was more likely but she saw even that may have spent itself after their moments alone on the cliff when deborah had taken sidney back to the house would brooke have killed her or just raped her st james had demanded while i watched from up here like a useless voyeur quite safe uninvolved no risk incurred right it sounds like my whole life there had been no anger contained in his words only humiliation which was infinitely worse she had shouted at him noone cares about it noone ever has but you she spoke only the truth but that truth did nothing to mitigate the fact that his own caring about it so unforgivingly was a permanent scar on the fragile surface of his selfesteem what is it he was asking her now a darts tournament at the anchor and rose no something better a suretobedreadful performance of much ado about nothing put on by the village players in the grounds of the primary school in fact its a special performance tonight in honour of tommys engagement or so according to daze the rector said when he came to call today complimentary tickets in hand isnt that the same group who did the importance of being earnest two summers ago darling simon yes the very same lord how could this current production match nanrunnels gallant bow to oscar wilde the reverend mr sweeney waxing eloquent as algernon with cucumber sandwiches sticking to the roof of his mouth not to mention the muffins then what do you say to mr sweeney as benedick only a fool would pass that up st james reached for his crutches swung himself to his feet balanced and adjusted his long dressinggown lady helen averted her eyes as he did so using as an excuse the need to pick up three rose petals which had fallen from an arrangement that sat on the shelf of a cheveret to one side of the window they felt like small pieces of downcovered satin against her palm she looked for a rubbishbasket and thus circumvented an open acknowledgement of st james primary vanity a need to hide his bad leg in an attempt to appear as normal as possible has anyone seen tommy lady helen read the meaning underlying st james question he doesnt know what happened weve managed to avoid him deborahs managed as well shes been with sidney she saw to her bath got her to lie down took her some tea she gave a brief humourless laugh the tea was my profound contribution im not sure what effect it was supposed to have what about brooke can we be so lucky as to hope hes taken himself back to london i doubt it dont you rather yes st james was standing next to the bed lady helen knew she should leave the room to give him privacy to dress but something in his manner a meticulous control too brittle to be believed compelled her to stay too much remained unsaid she knew st james well better than she had known any other man she had spent the last decade becoming acquainted with his blind devotion to forensic science and his determination to stoke out ground upon which he could build a reputation as an expert she had come to terms with his relentless introspection as well as with his desire for perfection and his selfcastigation if he fell short of a goal they talked about all of this over lunch and dinner in his study while the rain beat against the windows on their way to the old bailey on the stairs in the lab but what they did not talk about was his disability it had always represented a polar region of his psyche that brooked noones intrusion until today on the clifftop even then when he had finally given her the opening she had long awaited her words had been inadequate what then could she say to him now she didnt know not for the first time did she wonder what sort of bond might have developed between them had she not left his hospital room eight years ago simply because he asked her to do so and to obey him then had been so much easier than taking the chance of walking into the unknown still she couldnt leave him now without attempting to say something that gave him even in small measure back to himself simon my medication is on the counter above the washbasin helen st james said will you fetch me two tablets medication lady helen felt a quick surge of concern she didnt think she had misread his reasons for locking himself away in his room for the afternoon he hadnt been acting as if he was having any pain at all despite cotters admonition to her earlier its just a precaution above the washbasin he smiled a flicker that passed across his face and was gone in an instant i take it that way sometimes before instead of during it works just as well and if im to put up with mr sweeney as a thespian for an evening i ought to be prepared she laughed and went to get it for him calling back into the bedroom actually this isnt a bad idea if tonights production is anything like the other we saw well all be popping painkillers before the evenings through perhaps we should take the bottle along with us she brought the tablets back into the bedroom he had gone to the window where he was leaning forward on his crutches looking out at the southern view of the grounds but she could tell from his profile that his eyes registered nothing the sight of him like this negated his words his polite cooperation and the lightness of his tone she realized that even his smile had been a device to cut her off completely while all along he existed as he always had done alone she would not accept it you might have fallen she said please simon darling the path was too steep you might have been killed indeed he answered the cavernous howenstow drawing room did not possess the sort of qualities that made one feel at home wandering through it the size of an overlarge tennis court its furniture an aggregation of antiques positioned in conversational groupings was scattered across a fine chenille carpet walled with constables and turners and displaying an array of fine porcelains it was the sort of room that made one afraid of moving precipitately in any direction alone deborah carefully picked her way down its length to the grand piano intent upon examining the photographs that stood on top of it they comprised a pictorial history of the lynleys tenure as the earls of asherton the stiffbacked fifth countess stared at her with that unfriendly expression so predominant in the photographs of the nineteenth century the sixth earl sat astride a large bay and looked down at an unruly pack of hounds the present lady was robed and gowned for the queens coronation tommy and his siblings frolicked through a youth of wealth and privilege only tommys father the seventh earl was missing as she noticed this deborah realized that she had seen his likeness nowhere in the house in either photograph or portrait a circumstance she found decidedly odd for she had seen several pictures of the man in the townhouse tommy occupied in london when youre photographed to join them you must promise me youll smile lady asherton came to meet her a glass of sherry in her hand she looked cool and lovely in a cloudy white dress i wanted to smile but tommys father insisted that it wasnt done and im afraid i caved in quite spinelessly i was like that in my youth most appallingly malleable she smiled at deborah sipping her sherry and moving from the piano to sit in the embrasure of a window behind it ive so enjoyed my afternoon with your father deborah i talked incessantly but he was quite gracious about it acting as if everything i said was the height of wit and sense she turned her glass upon her palm and seemed to be watching how the light struck the design cut into the crystal youre very close to your father yes she answered thats sometimes the way when a child loses one parent isnt it its the mixed blessing of a death of course i was very young when my mother died deborah said in an attempt to explain away the distance she had not been able to ignore between tommy and his mother so i suppose it was natural that i would develop a deeper relationship with dad he was doing double duty after all father and mother to a sevenyearold and i had no brothers or sisters well simon was there but he was more like im not sure an uncle a cousin most of my upbringing fell to dad and you became a unit as a result the two of you how lucky you are deborah wouldnt have called her relationship with her father the product of luck rather it was the outcome of time paternal patience and willing communication saddled with a child whose impetuous personality was nothing like his own cotter had managed to adjust his own thinking in a constant attempt to understand hers if devotion existed between them now it was only due to years in which the seeds of a future relationship had been planted and cultivated youre estranged from tommy arent you deborah said impulsively lady asherton smiled but she looked very tired for a moment deborah thought that exhaustion might wear at her guard and prompt her to say something about what was at the root of the trouble between herself and her son but instead she said has tommy mentioned the play tonight shakespeare under the stars in nanrunnel voices drifted to them from the corridor ill let him tell you about it shall i that said she gave her attention to the window behind her where a light breeze carried into the room the salty fragrance of the cornish sea if we fortify ourselves enough we should be able to survive this with some semblance of sanity lynley was saying as he entered the room he went directly to a cabinet and began pouring three sherries from one of the decanters that stood in a semicircle upon it he gave one to lady helen another to st james and tossed back his own drink before catching sight of deborah and his mother at the far end of the room he said have you told deborah about our theseus and hippolyta roles this evening lady asherton raised her hand fractionally from her lap like her smile the movement seemed weighted by fatigue i thought that was best left to you lynley poured himself a second drink right yes well this to deborah with a smile weve a duty play darling id like to tell you that well go late and bow out at the interval but the reverend mr sweeney is an old family friend hed be crushed if we werent there for the entire production dreadful though the production will certainly be lady helen added shall i take photographs while were there deborah offered after the play i mean if mr sweeneys an especial friend perhaps hed like that tommy with the cast lady helen said mr sweeney will burst what a wonderful idea ive always said you belong on the stage havent i tommy lynley laughed made a response lady helen chatted on as she did so st james took his drink and wandered towards two large chinese vases that stood at either side of the doorway into the long elizabethan gallery that opened off the east end of the drawing room he ran his fingers over the smooth porcelain surface of one of them tracing a particularly intricate pattern made by the glaze deborah noted that although twice he lifted his glass of sherry to his lips he drank neither time he seemed intent upon looking at noone deborah hardly expected anything else after the afternoon in fact if not acknowledging anyones presence helped him to forget about it all she felt quite as if she would like to indulge in the same behaviour even though she knew that for herself forgetting would not occur any time soon it was bad enough tearing brooke away from sidney knowing his behaviour was the product of neither love nor lust but violence and a need to hammer her into submission it was even worse helping sidney climb the cliff hearing her hysterical weeping catching hold of her so that she wouldnt fall her face was bleeding and beginning to swell the words she sobbed out were incoherent three times she stopped wouldnt move merely wept all that had been a living nightmare but then at the top there was simon standing against a tree watching for them his face was halfhidden his right hand dug into the trees bark so hard that the bones stood out deborah had wanted to go to him for what reason to what possible end she could not have said her only rational thought at the moment was that she couldnt leave him alone but helen stopped her when she took a step in his direction pushing her with sidney towards the path to the house that stumbling trip back had been the second nightmare each part stood out vividly in her mind coming upon mark penellin in the woods making inarticulate excuses for sidneys appearance and her distraught condition approaching the house with an ever rising sense of trepidation that someone might see them slipping by the gun room and the old servants hall to look for the northwest stairway that helen had insisted was near the pantry taking a wrong turn at the top of those stairs and ending up in the disused west wing of the house and all the time terrified that tommy would come upon them and begin asking questions through it all sidney had gone from hysteria to rage to despair and finally to silence but this last was dazed and it frightened deborah more than sidneys earlier unrestrained agitation the entire experience had far exceeded dreadful and when justin brooke walked into the drawing room dressed casually for the evening as if he had not tried to rape a woman in front of five witnesses that afternoon it was all deborah could do to look at the man without screaming and flying into the attack good god what happened to you lynley sounded so surprised that st james turned from his perusal of the kang hsi porcelain to see justin brooke taking the proffered glass of sherry with complete nonchalance christ st james thought brooke was actually going to join them smugly confident that they were all too selfservingly well bred to say anything about the afternoon while lynley and his mother were in the room took a fall in the woods brooke looked around as he spoke making eye contact with each of them challenging one person after another to expose him as a liar at this st james felt his jaw clench automatically to bite back what he wanted to say with an atavistic satisfaction which he did not deny himself he noted the considerable damage that his sister had managed to do to brookes face claw marks scored his cheeks a bruise rose on his jaw his lower lip was swollen a fall lynleys attention was on the inflamed teethmarks on brookes neck barely obscured by the collar of his shirt he looked at the others sharply wheres sidney he asked noone replied a glass clinked against the top of a table someone coughed outside at some distance from the house an engine roared to life footsteps sounded in the hall and cotter entered the drawing room he stopped barely two feet inside the door as if hed taken a quick reading of the ambience and was having second thoughts about exposing himself to it he looked at st james a reflex reaction that sought direction and found it in the other mans detachment from the scene he made no other move wheres sidney lynley repeated at her end of the room lady asherton rose to her feet has something deborah spoke quickly i saw her half an hour ago tommy her face flushed its colour did battle with the fire of her hair she spent too much time in the sun this afternoon and thought well shes asked for a rest yes she said she needed a bit of a rest she did send her apologies and you know sidney she goes at such a pace doesnt she she wears herself out as if nothing at all its no wonder to me shes exhausted her fingers wandered to her throat as she spoke as if her hand wanted to cover her mouth to prevent the lie from becoming even more obvious in spite of himself st james smiled he looked at deborahs father who shook his head weakly in affectionate recognition of a fact they both knew only too well helen might have been able to carry it off casual prevarication to smooth over troubled waters was more in her line but deborah was hopeless at this particular form of conversational legerdemain the rest of the party was saved from having to embellish upon deborahs story by the entrance of peter lynley his feet bare and a clean gauze shirt his only bow to dressing for dinner he was trailed by sasha whose glaucoushued dress made her complexion seem more sallow than ever as if she would speak to them or attempt to intercede in what she saw as a coming conflict lady asherton started to walk in their direction peter gave no indication that he saw his mother or anyone else he merely wiped his nose on the back of his hand and went to the drinks tray he poured himself a whisky which he gulped down quickly then poured himself another and sasha some of the same they stood an isolated little unit apart from the others with the spirit decanters within easy reach as she took a sip of her drink sasha slipped her hand under peters loose shirt and pulled him towards her nice stuff sash peter murmured and kissed her lynley set his glass down lady asherton spoke quickly i saw nancy cambrey in the grounds this afternoon tommy im rather concerned about her shes lost a great deal of weight did you happen to see her i saw her lynley watched his brother and sasha his face was unreadable she seems terribly worried about something i think its to do with mick hes working on a story thats taken him away from home so much these last few months did she talk to you about it we talked and did she mention a story tommy because she mentioned it yes lady helen attacked the issue of diversion from a new angle what a lovely dress that is sasha i envy your ability to wear those wonderful indian prints i look like a cross between jemima puddleduck and a charwoman whenever i try them did mark penellin find the two of you simon and i saw him in the woods seeking you out mark penellin peter reached out to caress a length of sashas thin hair no we never saw him in some confusion lady helen looked towards st james but we saw him he didnt find you in the cove this afternoon peter smiled a lazy satisfied smile we werent in the cove this afternoon you werent i mean i suppose we were but we werent so if he wanted to find us he would have seen us but not seen us or maybe it was after we went in the water and then he wouldnt have seen us at all not where we were and i dont think id have wanted him to what about you sasha he chuckled and traced the bridge of sashas nose he ran his fingers across her mouth catlike she licked them wonderful st james thought its only friday nanrunnel was a successful combination of two disparate environments a centuriesold fishing village and a modern tourist haunt built in a semicircular fashion round a natural harbour its structures twisted up a hillside dotted with cedar cypress and pine their exteriors hewn from rocks quarried in the district some whitewashed and others left a natural weatherstreaked mixture of grey and brown streets were narrow wide enough to allow only the passage of a single car and they followed a strangely convoluted pattern which met the demands of the hills rather than the requirements of automobiles fishing boats filled the harbour itself bobbing rhythmically on the incoming tide and protected by two long crescentshaped quays curiously shaped buildings perched on the harbours edge cottages shops inns and restaurants and an uneven cobbled walkway running along the embankment gave their inhabitants access to the water below above hundreds of seabirds cried from chimneys and slate roofs while hundreds more took to the air circled the harbour and flew from there into the bay where in the distance st michaels mount rose in the failing evening light a considerable crowd had gathered in the primary school grounds in the lower part of paul lane there a humble openair theatre had been created by the reverend mr sweeney and his wife it consisted of only three elements a sturdily crafted platform served as stage accommodation for the audience comprised folding wooden chairs of prewar vintage and at the far side of the grounds next to the street a refreshment booth was already doing a respectable business with libations supplied by the villages largest pub the anchor and rose nancy cambrey lynley saw was working the taps the rector himself met lynleys party at the entrance to the school grounds his portly face beaming with a rapturous smile of welcome he wore a heavy layer of theatrical makeup through which he was perspiring heavily in costume already he was an incongruous sight in doublet and stockings his bald head aglow under the strands of lights which crisscrossed the school yard i shall wear a wig for benedick of course mr sweeney mocked himself gently he greeted st james and lady helen with the fondness of an old friend and then presented himself eagerly to be introduced to deborah a social nicety which he brushed aside almost as soon as he adopted it by bursting out with my dear we are so pleased to have you here tonight both of you its grand before lynley could say a word he might well have gone on to bow with a flourish had not the precarious position of his codpiece precluded any sudden movement weve put you right in front so you wont miss a thing come its just this way missing a thing missing several things missing the entire play would have been too much blessing to hope for since the nanrunnel players had long been known for the stentorian nature of their performances rather than for their histrionic flare however led by mr sweeney with his wife as a short plump beatrice who managed to display a remarkably heaving bosom during speeches far more impassioned than required by the role the drama proceeded with fiery enthusiasm to the interval at this point the audience rose to its feet as one and headed towards the refreshment booth to make the most of a respite filled with lager and ale the sole advantage to being the guests of honour showed itself in the quick progress lynley and his party made to the booth the crowd which moments before had been surging forward towards the blessed salvation of watneys and bass parted in a cooperative fashion giving lynley and the others quick access to relief the only other person to take advantage of this break in the mass of pushing and shoving humanity was a tall middleaged man who had managed to reach the refreshment booth first he turned with a tray of glasses in his hands and presented it to lynley have these tommy he said incredulously lynley stared at roderick trenarrow and at the tray of glasses he held his intention was both unmistakable and unavoidable a public meeting a display of good cheer as always trenarrow had chosen his moment like a master roderick lynley said how very good of you trenarrow smiled i have the advantage of a seat near the booth strange i hardly thought shakespeare would be in your line other than hamlet you mean trenarrow asked pleasantly he directed his attention to lynleys party clearly expecting to be introduced lynley did so mustering the good grace to appear unaffected by this unexpected encounter trenarrow pushed his goldrimmed spectacles up the bridge of his nose and directed his words to lynleys friends im afraid mrs sweeney caught me on the bus from penzance and before i knew it id purchased a ticket to tonights performance and sworn id attend but theres mercy involved since im near the drinks booth if the production gets any more appalling i can swozzle down six or seven more lagers and pickle myself properly our very thought lady helen said one gets more experienced with the nanrunnel productions every summer trenarrow went on i expect the rest of the audience will try sitting with me at the back next year eventually noone will be willing to fill up the front seats and mrs sweeney will be forced to put on her play from inside the refreshment booth just to hold our attention the others laughed lynley did not instead he found himself annoyed at their willingness to succumb to trenarrow and he scrutinized the other man as if an analysis of his physical properties would somehow reveal the source of his charm as always lynley noticed not the whole but the details rich brown hair finally showing the signs of his age weaving fine strands of silver back from his brow a linen suit that was old but well tailored spotlessly clean and fined to his figure a jawline sharp and hard carrying no spare flesh in spite of the fact that he was nearing fifty warm laughter bursting out of him unrestrained the webbing of flesh at his eyes and the eyes themselves which were dark and quick to assess and understand lynley catalogued all this with no system for observation just a series of fleeting impressions there was no way to avoid them not with trenarrow so close standing as he always had so much larger than life i see nancy cambreys gone to work at the anchor and rose in addition to her other jobs lynley said to trenarrow the other man looked over his shoulder to the refreshment booth it looks that way im surprised shed take it on with the baby and all it cant be easy for her itll do something to ease their money troubles though wont it lynley took a gulp of his lager it was too warm for his liking and he would have preferred to dump it out on to the base of a palm nearby but trenarrow would have read animosity in that action so he continued sipping the drink look roderick he said brusquely im going to make good whatever money they owe you both the statement and the manner of saying it put an end to conversation among the others lynley became aware of lady helens hand coming to rest on st james arm of deborahs uneasy stirring at his own side of trenarrows look of perplexity as if he hadnt an idea in the world what lynley was referring to make good the money trenarrow repeated im not about to let nancy go begging they cant afford a rise in rent at the moment and rent lynley found his gentle repetitions aggravating trenarrow was manoeuvring him into the bullys role shes afraid of losing gull cottage i told her id make good the money now im telling you the cottage i see trenarrow lifted his drink slowly and observed lynley over the rim of the glass he gazed reflectively at the drinks booth nancy doesnt need to worry about the cottage mick and i shall work it out she neednt have bothered you for the money how absolutely like the man lynley thought how insufferably noble he was how farsighted as well he knew what he was doing the entire conversation was the sort of parry and thrust that they had engaged in innumerable times over the years filled with doubleedged words and hidden meanings i said id take care of it and i will lynley attempted to alter the tone if not the intention behind his words theres absolutely no need for you to suffer trenarrow regarded lynley evenly for a moment before he offered a cool smile he finished the rest of his drink how very kind of you if youll excuse me now i seem to have been dominating your time long enough there appear to be others here whod like to be introduced he nodded and left them lynley watched him go recognizing as always trenarrows skill at seizing the moment hed done it again leaving lynley feeling like nothing more than a roughedged lout he was seventeen again over and over in trenarrows presence he would always be seventeen lady helens animated words filled the void created by trenarrows departure good heavens what a gorgeous man he is tommy did you say hes a doctor every woman in the village must line up at his surgery on a daily basis hes not that kind of doctor lynley replied automatically he poured out the rest of his lager along the trunk of a palm and watched the liquid pool onto the dry unyielding earth he does medical research in penzance which is why hed come to howenstow in the first place a man only thirty years old called upon as an act of desperation to see to the dying earl it was hopeless hed explained in that earnest fashion of his that there was nothing more to be done besides adhering to the current chemotherapy there was no cure in spite of what they read and wanted to believe in the tabloids he said there were dozens of different kinds of cancer it was a catchall term the body was dying of its own inability to call a halt to the production of cells and scientists didnt know enough they were working and striving but it would be years decades he spoke with quiet apologies with profound understanding and compassion and so the earl had lingered and dwindled and suffered and died the family had mourned him the region had mourned him everyone save roderick trenarrow nancy cambrey packed the last of the pint glasses into a carton for the short trip down the hill to the anchor and rose she was extremely weary in order to be at the school in time to do the settingup that evening shed gone without her dinner so she was feeling lightheaded as well she crisscrossed the carton flaps and secured the package relieved that the evenings labour was done nearby her employer the formidable mrs swarm fingered through the nights taking with her usual passion for things pecuniary her lips moved soundlessly as she counted the coins and notes jotting figures into her dogeared red ledger she nodded in satisfaction the booth had done well im off then nancy said with some hesitation she never knew exactly what kind of reaction to expect from mrs swann who was notorious for her moodswings no barmaid had ever lasted more than seven months in her employ nancy was determined to be the first moneys the point she whispered inwardly whenever she found herself on the receiving end of one of mrs swarms violent outbursts you can bear anything so long as youre paid fine nancy mrs swann muttered with a wave of her hand off with you then sorry about the call box the woman snorted and poked at her scalp with the stub of a pencil from now on phone your dad in your own time girl not in the pubs time and not in mine yes i will ill remember placation was paramount nancy held tightly to the booth in order to manage unruffling mrs swanns feathers while betraying nothing of the aversion she actually felt for her employer i learn quick mrs swann youll see people never do have to tell me anything twice mrs swann looked up sharply her rats eyes glittered in evaluation learning things quick enough from that man of yours girl all sorts of new things i expect that right nancy rubbed at a smudge on her faded pink blouse im off she said in answer and ducked under the booth although the lights were still on the yard was empty of everyone save lynleys party and the nanrunnel players nancy watched them at the front of the theatre while st james and lady helen waited among the empty seats lynley posed with the cast as his fiancee took their picture each flash lit one delighted face after another catching their antic posturing on film lynley bore it all with his usual good grace chatting away with the rector and his wife laughing at cheerful remarks made by lady helen clyde life comes so easily to him nancy thought its no different my dear being one of them it only looks that way nancy started at the words at their stabbing acuity she whirled to see dr trenarrow sitting in the shadows against a wall of the school yard nancy had avoided him for the entire evening always keeping out of his reach or his line of vision when he came to the booth for a drink now however she could not avoid the contact for he got to his feet and walked into the light youre worried about the cottage he said dont i shant be putting you on the street well work things out mick and i she felt sweat break out on the back of her neck in spite of his gentle declaration it was the nightmare she feared coming face to face with him having to discuss the situation having to create excuses worse just ten feet away mrs swann had raised her head from the moneybox her interest no doubt piqued by the mention of micks name ill have the money she stammered ill get it i will youre not to worry nancy trenarrow said more insistently and youve no need at all to go begging lord asherton for help you should have spoken to me no you see she couldnt explain without giving offence he would not understand why she could go hat in hand to lynley but not to him he wouldnt realize that a loan from lynley carried no burden of unwelcome charity because he gave without judgement in friendship and concern and nowhere else in nancys life could she expect that sort of help without a companion assessment of the failure of her marriage even now she could feel the manner in which dr trenarrow was evaluating her situation even now she could sense his pity because a rise in the rent isnt please with a small cry she brushed past him hurrying out of the school yard and into the street she heard dr trenarrow call her name once but she kept going rubbing arms that were sore from heaving pint glasses and working the taps all night she scurried down paul lane towards the mouth of ivy street which led into the twisting collection of alleys and passageways that comprised the heart of the village these were narrow inclines cobbled and tortuous little streets too cramped for cars during the day summer holiday makers came here to photograph the picturesque old buildings with their colourful front gardens and crooked slate roofs at night however the entire area was illuminated only by oblongs of light from cottage windows darkly shadowed and inhabited by generations of cats who bred in the hillside above the village and fed by night in rubbishbins it was not a place for lingering gull cottage was some distance into the maze of streets it sat on the corner of virgin place looking like a whitewashed matchbox with bright blue trim on its windows and a lavishly blooming fuchsia growing next to its front door bloodred flowers blown from this plant covered the ground nearby as nancy approached the cottage her steps faltered she could hear the noise from three houses away molly was crying screaming in fact she looked at her watch it was nearly midnight molly should have been fed should have been fast asleep by now why on earth was mick not seeing to the child exasperated that her husband could be so selfishly deaf to his own daughters cries nancy ran the remaining distance to the cottage threw open the garden gate and hurried to the door mick she called above her in the only bedroom she could hear mollys screaming she felt an edge of panic picturing the babys face red with rage feeling her small body tense with fright she shoved open the door molly inside she ran for the stairs took them two at a time it was insufferably hot mollygirl pet she flew to the babys cot and picked her daughter up to find that she was wet to the skin reeking of urine her body was feverish tendrils of auburn hair curled limply on her skull love lovely girl whats happened to you she murmured as she sponged her off and changed her and then cried out michael mick with molly against her shoulder nancy went back down the stairs her feet striking the bare wood noisily as she headed for the kitchen at the rear of the cottage feeding the baby was foremost on her mind still she allowed herself to give vent to a small eruption of anger i want to speak with you she snapped at the closed sitting room door michael dyou hear i want a word now as she spoke she saw that the door was neither latched nor locked she pushed it open with her foot michael you can damn well answer me when she felt the hairs bristling along the length of her arms he was lying on the floor or someone was lying there for she could just see a leg only one not two which was curious unless he was sleeping with one leg drawn up and the other splayed out in complete abandon except how could he be asleep it was hot so hot and the noise which molly had been making mick are you playing some pawky joke on me there was no reply mollys crying had faded to an exhausted whimper so nancy took a step into the room thats you isnt it mick nothing but she could see it was mick she recognized his shoe a frivolous hightopped red plimsoll with a strip of metallic silver round the ankle it was a new purchase of his something that he didnt need it costs too much money shed say to him it bleeds off the chequebook it takes away from the baby yes it was mick on the floor and she knew what he was up to at the moment pretending to be asleep so that she couldnt rant at him for ignoring the baby still it didnt seem like him not to hop to his feet laughing at his ability to frighten her with another one of his practical jokes and she was frightened because something wasnt right papers blanketed the floor far more than represented micks usual mess the desk drawers were open the curtains were drawn a cat yowled outside but in the cottage there was no sound and the heavy hot air was foul with the smell of faeces and sweat mickey her hands her armpits the back of her knees the inside of her elbows she was sticky and wet molly stirred in her arms nancy forced herself forward an inch then another then an entire foot six inches after that and then she saw why her husband had not heard mollys cries although he lay motionless on the floor he was not pretending to be asleep at all his eyes were open but they were glazed and fixed and as nancy watched a fly walked across the surface of one blue iris before her his image seemed to swim in the heat animated by a force external to his body he should move she thought how can he be that still is it some sort of trick cant he feel that fly then she saw the other flies six or eight no more they usually kept residence in the kitchen and pestered her while she cooked their meals but now they buzzed and circled round her husbands hips where micks trousers were torn where they were open at the waist where they were jerked down brutally to give someone access to allow someone to carve she was running with no sense of direction and no clear purpose her only thought was to get away she flung herself out of the cottage through the gate and into virgin place the baby once again wailing in her arms her foot caught on a cobblestone and she nearly fell but she staggered three steps crashed against a rubbishbin and righted herself by grabbing on to a cottage rainspout the darkness was complete moonlight struck the roofs and the sides of buildings but these cast long shadows into the street creating yawning ebony pools into which she dashed heedless of the uneven pavement of the small scurrying rodents who foraged in the night the mouth of ivy street was up ahead and she lunged for it and for the safety of paul lane which lay just beyond it please her mouth formed the word she couldnt hear herself say it and then breaking through the rasping noise of her lungs came voices and laughter joking on paul lane all right i believe you so find cassiopeia a mans pleasant voice said then he added oh for gods sake at least you can manage the big dipper helen really tommy im only trying to get my bearings youve all the patience of a twoyearold i can blessing she reached them crashed into them fell to her knees nancy someone took her arm helped her back to her feet molly was howling what is it whats wrong it was lynleys voice lynleys arm round her shoulders he seemed like salvation mick she cried and pulled violently on the front of lynleys jacket having said at last what needed to be said she began to scream its mick its mick lights went on in the cottages round them st james and lynley entered together leaving the three women standing just inside the garden gate mick cambreys body was on the sitting room floor not more than twenty feet from the front door the two men went to it and stood staring down frozen momentarily into inaction by horror good god st james murmured he had seen many grisly sights during his time on the scenesofcrime team at new scodand yard but the mutilation of cambreys body struck him forcefully the sort of maiming that lay at the heart of every mans fear averting his eyes he saw that someone had thoroughly searched the sitting room for all the drawers had been pulled from the desk correspondence and envelopes and stationery and countless other papers had been tossed round the room broken picture frames had their backings torn off and near a worn blue sofa a tattered fivepound note lay on the floor it was an automatic reaction born of his brief career with the police fostered by his devotion to forensic science later he would wonder why he even gave it sway considering the disunity it provoked among them were going to need deborah he said lynley was squatting by the body he jumped to his feet and intercepted st james at the front door are you out of your mind you cant be thinking of asking her thats madness we need the police you know that as well as i do st james pulled open the door deborah would you stay where you are deborah lynley interposed he turned back to his friend i wont have it i mean that st james what is it tommy deborah took a single step nothing st james regarded the other man curiously trying and failing to understand the nature of his admonition to deborah itll take only a moment tommy he explained i think its best who knows what the local cid are like they may ask for your help anyway so lets get some pictures in advance then you can phone he called over his shoulder will you bring your camera deborah she began to come forward of course here deborah stay there his explanation had seemed rational enough to st james own ears but rife with urgency lynleys response to it did not but the camera deborah asked i said stay there they were at an impasse deborah raised a querying hand looked from lynley to st james tommy is there something touching her arm lightly lady helen stopped her and came to join the two men whats happened she asked st james replied helen get me deborahs camera mick cambreys been murdered and i want to photograph the room before we telephone the police he said nothing more until he held the camera in his hands even then he looked it over thoroughly studying its mechanism in a silence that he knew was growing more tense with every moment he allowed it to continue he told himself that lynleys main concern was that deborah not be allowed to see the body or do the photographing herself indeed he was sure that had been his friends original intention when he insisted that she stay outside he had misunderstood st james asking for deborah he had thought st james wanted her to take the pictures herself but that misunderstanding had dissolved into dispute and no matter that much of the dispute remained unspoken the fact that it had occurred at all charged the atmosphere with elements bleak and nasty perhaps you might wait out here until im done st james said to his friend he walked back into the house st james took the photographs from every angle working his way carefully round the body stopping only when he had run out of film then he left the sitting room pulled the door partially closed behind him and returned to the others outside they had been joined by a small crowd of neighbours who stood in a hushed group a short distance from the garden gate heads bent together voices murmuring in speculation bring nancy inside st james said lady helen led her across the front garden and into the cottage where she hesitated only a moment before directing nancy towards the kitchen an oblong room with an odd sloping ceiling and a grey linoleum floor sporting great black patches of wear she sat her down on a chair that stood at one side of a stained pine table kneeling by her side she looked closely at her face reached for her arm and held her thin wrist between her own fingers she frowned touching the back of her hand to nancys cheek tommy lady helen said with a remarkable degree of calm ring dr trenarrow i think shes going into shock he can deal with that cant he she prised the baby from nancys grasp and handed her to deborah there must be baby milk in the refrigerator will you see to warming some molly nancy whispered hungry i feed yes lady helen said gently were seeing to her dear in the other room lynley was speaking into the telephone he placed a second call and spoke even more briefly but the altered formal sound of his voice was enough to tell the others that he was speaking to the penzance police after a few minutes he returned to the kitchen with a blanket which he wrapped round nancy in spite of the heat can you hear me he asked her nancys eyelids fluttered showing nothing but white molly feed ive got her right here deborah said she was crooning to the baby in a far corner of the kitchen the milks warming i expect she likes it warm doesnt she shes a pretty baby nancy i cant imagine a prettier one it was the right thing to say nancy relaxed in her chair st james nodded gratefully to deborah and went back to the sitting room door he pushed it open and stood on the threshold he spent several minutes studying thinking evaluating what he saw lady helen finally joined him even from the doorway they could see the nature of the material that lay in disorder across the floor upon the desk against the legs of furniture notebooks documents pages of manuscript photographs at the back of his mind st james heard lady ashertons words about mick cambrey but the nature of the crime did not support the conclusion he otherwise might have naturally drawn from a consideration of those words what do you think lady helen asked him he was a journalist hes dead somehow those two facts ought to hang together but the body says no a thousand times why hes been castrated helen heavens is that how he died no then how a knock at the door precluded reply lynley came from the kitchen to admit roderick trenarrow the doctor entered wordlessly he looked from lynley to st james and lady helen and then beyond them to the sittingroom floor where even from where he stood mick cambreys body was partially visible for a moment it appeared that he might step forward and attempt to save a man who was beyond all rescue he said to the others are you certain quite st james replied wheres nancy without waiting for an answer he went on to the kitchen where the lights shone brightly and deborah chatted about babies as if in the hope that doing so would keep nancy anchored in the here and now trenarrow tilted nancys head and looked at her eyes he said help me get her upstairs quickly has anyone telephoned her father lynley moved to do so lady helen helped nancy to her feet and urged her out of the kitchen as dr trenarrow led the way still carrying the baby deborah followed them in a moment trenarrows voice began asking gentle questions in the bedroom upstairs these were followed by nancys querulous replies bedsprings creaked a window was opened the dry wood of the sash grated and shrieked theres no answer at the lodge lynley said from the telephone ill ring on to howenstow perhaps hes gone there but after a conversation with lady asherton john penellin was still unaccounted for lynley frowned at his watch its halfpast twelve where can he possibly be at this time of night he wasnt at the play was he john no i cant say the nanrunnel players hold any charms for him above them nancy cried out as if in response to this single demonstration of anguish another knock thudded against the front door lynley opened it to admit the local police represented in the person of a plump curlyhaired constable in a uniform that took its distinction from large crescents of sweat beneath the arms and a coffee stain on the trousers he looked about twentythree years old he didnt bother with any immediate introductions or with any of the formalities inherent to a murder investigation it was obvious within seconds that in the presence of a corpse he was in over his head and delighted to be there gotcherself a murder he asked conversationally as if murders were a daily affair in nanrunnel perhaps to give credence to nonchalance he unwrapped a piece of chewing gum and folded it into his mouth wheres the victim who are you lynley demanded you arent cid the constable grinned tj parker he announced thomas jefferson mum liked the yanks he elbowed his way into the sitting room are you cid lynley asked as the constable kicked a notebook to one side christ almighty man leave the scene alone dont getcher knickers in a twist the constable replied inspector boscowan sent me ahead to secure the scene hell be along soons hes dressed not to worry now what dwe have he took his first look at the corpse and chewed more rapidly upon his gum someone had it in for this bloke all right that said he began to saunter round the room gloveless he fingered several items on cambreys desk for gods sake lynley said hody dont touch anything leave it for your crime team robbery parker announced as if lynley had not spoken caught in the act id say a fight some fun afterwards with the secateurs listen damn you you cant parker cocked a finger at him this is police work mister ill thank you to step back into the hall have you your warrant card st james asked lynley quietly hes liable to make a mess of that room if you dont do something to stop him i cant st james i have no jurisdiction as they were speaking dr trenarrow came back down the stairs inside the sitting room parker turned to the door caught a glimpse of trenarrows medical bag and smiled we got quite a mess here doc he announced ever seen anything like it have a look if you like constable lynleys voice attempted reason and patience trenarrow seemed to realize how inappropriate the constables suggestion was he said softly to lynley perhaps i can do something to fend off disaster and walked to the body kneeling he examined it quickly feeling for pulse gauging for temperature moving an arm to check the extent of rigor he changed his position to the other side and bent to study the extensive wounds butchered he muttered looked up and asked have you found any weapon he looked round the room feeling among the papers and debris that were nearest to the body st james shuddered at the disruption of the crime scene lynley cursed the constable did nothing trenarrow nodded towards a poker that lay on its side by the fireplace could that be your weapon he asked constable parker grinned his chewing gum popped he chuckled as trenarrow got to his feet to do that business he asked i dont think its near sharp enough do you trenarrow didnt look amused i meant as a murder weapon he said cambrey didnt die from the castration constable any fool can see that parker seemed unoffended by trenarrows implied rebuke didnt kill him right just put an end to things wouldnt you say trenarrow looked as if he were biting off an angry retort how longs he been gone in your opinion the constable asked genially two or three hours id guess but surely youve someone coming to tell you that oh aye when she gets here the constable said with the rest of cid he rocked back on his heels popped his gum once more and studied his watch two or three hours you say that takes us to halfnine or halften well he sighed and rubbed his hands together with obvious pleasure its a starting place in it and youve got to start somewhere in police work part four investigation from the moment they pulled up in front of the howenstow lodge at a quarter past two in the morning events began to tumble one upon the other not that events had not already been accumulating into an aggregate of experience too complicated to be readily assimilated inspector edward boscowan had seen to that only moments after his arrival at gull cottage with the scenesofcrime team from penzance cid hed taken one look at constable parker who was lounging in an armchair not four feet from mick cambreys body hed taken a second look at st james trenarrow and lynley in the small entry foyer at deborah in the kitchen at lady helen and nancy cambrey upstairs at the baby in the cot his face went from white to crimson then he finally spoke but only to the constable with such studied control that no other demonstration of his fury was even necessary a teaparty constable despite what you may think you are not the mad hatter or has noone yet informed you of that the constable grinned uneasily in response he shoved himself to his feet and scratched one armpit nodding as if in agreement this is a murder scene boscowan snapped what in hells name are all these people doing here they as inside when i got here parker said were they boscowan asked with a thin smile when parker returned it momentarily relieved by what he mistakenly perceived as bonhomie in his superior boscowan snarled well get them out now which is bloody well what you should have done in the first place lynley was aware of that fact himself he knew that st james was aware of it as well yet in the confusion engendered by nancys hysteria the chaos of the sitting room and the sight of cambreys body both of them had disregarded or forgotten or developed an uncharacteristic indifference to that most basic tenet of police work they had not sealed the crime scene while they had not touched anything they had been in the room trenarrow had been in the room not to mention helen and deborah and nancy in the kitchen and then upstairs with all of them leaving fibres and hairs and fingerprints everywhere what a nightmare for the forensic team and he himselfa policeman had been responsible for creating it or at least for doing nothing productive to stop it his behaviour had been unforgivably incompetent and he could not excuse it by telling himself that he hadnt been thinking straight owing to his being acquainted with the principals involved in the crime itself for hed known the principals involved in crimes before and had always kept his head but not this time hed lost his grip the moment st james involved deborah boscowan had said nothing more in condemnation of anyone he had merely taken their fingerprints and sent them to stand in the kitchen while he and a sergeant went upstairs to talk to nancy and the crime scene team began their work in the sitting room he spent nearly an hour with nancy patiently taking her back and forth over the facts having gleaned from her what little he could he sent her home with lynley home to her father now lynley looked up at the lodge the front door was closed the windows were shut the curtains drawn darkness enfolded it and the trellised red roses that walled in the porch and encircled the windows on the ground floor looked like featheredged smudges of ink in the shadows ill come in with you lynley said just in case your fathers not yet home nancy stirred in the rear seat where between lady helen and st james she held her sleeping baby dr trenarrow had given her a mild sedative and for the time being the drug shielded her from shock dads only sleeping she murmured resting her cheek on mollys head i spoke with him on the phone after the interval at the play hes gone to bed he wasnt home when i phoned at halfpast twelve lynley said so he may not be home now if he isnt id rather you and molly came on to the house with us and not stay here alone we can leave him a note hes only sleeping the phones in the sitting room his bedrooms upstairs he mightnt have heard it wouldnt mark have heard it then mark nancy hesitated obviously she hadnt yet considered her brother no mark sleeps heavy doesnt he plays his music sometimes as well hed not have heard but theyre both upstairs asleep for certain she moved on the seat preparatory to getting out st james opened the door ill just go on in i do thank you i cant think what wouldve happened if i hadnt found you in paul lane her words were growing progressively drowsier lynley got out and with st james he helped her from the car despite nancys declaration that both father and brother were sleeping soundly in the lodge lynley had no intention of leaving her without making sure that this was the case beneath her words he had heard the unmistakable note of urgency which generally accompanies a lie it was not inconceivable that she had spoken to her father by telephone during the evening but he had not been at home when lynley had phoned from gull cottage just ninety minutes ago and nancys protestations that he as well as her brother would sleep through the noise of the telephone were not only improbable but also indicative of a need to conceal taking nancys arm he led her up the uneven flagstone path and onto the porch where the climbing roses cast a sweet fragrance on the warm night air once inside the house a quick look in the rooms affirmed his suspicions the lodge was empty as nancy drifted into the sitting room and sat in a canebacked rocking chair where she sang tonelessly to her daughter he went back to the front door noones here he said to the others but i think id rather wait for john than take nancy up to the house do you want to go on yourselves st james made the decision for them all well come in they joined nancy in the sitting room taking places among and upon the overstuffed furniture noone spoke instead they each attended to the penellin personal effects which crammed the walls the table tops and the floor attesting to the lives and personalities of the family who had occupied the lodge for twentyfive years spanish porcelains the passion of nancys mother collected dust upon a spinet piano mounted butterflies in a dozen frames hung on one wall and these along with a quantity of ageing tennis trophies spoke of the wide swings which mark penellins interests took a broad bay window displayed a mass of nancys poorly executed petitpoint pillows faded and looking in their serried line as if theyd been placed there to get them out of the way in one corner a television set held the rooms only photograph one taken of nancy mark and their mother at christmastime shortly before the railway disaster that ended mrs penellins life after a few minutes of listening to the sounds of crickets and a nightingale drifting in the window which lynley had opened nancy cambrey stood she said mollys dropped off ill just pop her upstairs and left them when they heard her movement on the floor above it was lady helen who put into words what had been playing in the back of lynleys mind she spoke in her usual forthright manner tommy where do you suppose john penellin is do you think nancy really spoke to him during the play because it seems to me that theres something decidedly odd in the way she insisted that shed talked to him lynley was sitting on the piano bench and he pushed softly against three of the keys producing a barely audible discordance i dont know he replied but even if he could ignore helens intuitive remark he could not forget his conversation with nancy that afternoon or the aversion with which her father had spoken of nancys husband the clock struck the halfhour nancy returned to them i cant think where dad is she said youve no need to stay ill be fine now well stay lynley said she pushed her hair behind her ears and rubbed her hands down the sides of her dress he mustve just gone out a bit ago he does that sometimes when he cant sleep he walks in the grounds often he does that before he goes to bed at night in the grounds im sure thats where hes gone noone mentioned the wild improbability of john penellins taking a walk in the grounds at halfpast two in the morning noone even had to for events conspired to prove nancy a liar even as she made her final declaration a cars lights swept across the sittingroom windows an engine coughed once a door opened and shut footsteps rang against the flagstones and a moment later in the porch she hurried to the door penellins voice came to the others clearly nancy whatre you doing here its not mark is it nancy wheres mark she reached out a hand to him as he came in the door he took it dad nancys voice wavered at this penellin suddenly saw the others gathered in the sitting room alarm shot across his face whats happened he demanded by god you tell me what that bastards done to you now hes dead nancy said someone she faltered at the rest of it as if those few words reminded her of the horror that the sedative had allowed her to escape for a short time penellin stared he brushed past his daughter and took a step towards the stairway nancy wheres your brother nancy said nothing in the sitting room lynley slowly got to his feet penellin spoke again tell me what happened nancy found micks body in the cottage after the play lynley said the sitting room looked as if it had been searched mick may well have surprised someone in the act of going through his papers or in the act of robbery although he added that latter seems unlikely nancy grasped this idea it was robbery she said thats what it was and no mistake mick was doing the pay envelopes for the newspaper staff when i left him this evening she tossed a look back over her shoulder at lynley was the money still there i saw only a fivepound note on the floor st james answered but surely mick didnt pay the staff in cash lynley said he did nancy said it was always done that way on the newspaper more convenient theres no bank in nanrunnel but if it was robbery it was nancy said lady helen spoke gently bringing up the single point that obviated robbery as a motive but nancy his body the body penellin asked hed been castrated lynley said good god the front doorbell rang shrilly all of them jumped a testimony to the state of their nerves still in the hallway penellin answered the door inspector boscowan stood in the porch beyond him a dusty car was parked behind the estate rover that lynley had earlier driven to and from nanrunnel john boscowan said by way of greeting penellin the use of penellins given name reminded lynley all at once that not only were boscowan and penellin of an age but like so many others who lived in this remote area of cornwall they were also former schoolmates and lifelong friends penellin said edward youve heard about mick ive come to talk to you about it nancy gripped the newel post of the stairway to dad why he knows nothing about this ive a few questions john boscowan said i dont understand but penellins tone was an admission that he understood only too well may i come in penellin glanced into the sitting room and boscowan followed his gaze to see the others gathered there still here my lord he asked yes we were lynley hesitated waiting for john to come home asked to be spoken an inadvertent accusation he would not make dad knows nothing nancy repeated dad tell him you know nothing about mick may i come in boscowan asked once more nancy and the baby penellin said theyre both here may we talk in penzance at the station requesting a different location wasnt a suspects right and that john penellin was a suspect was illustrated in boscowans next words have you a solicitor youd like to ring a solicitor nancy shrilled nance girl dont although penellin reached for his daughter she flinched away dad was here boscowan shifted his weight uneasily from one foot to the other im sorry nancy neighbours saw him at your cottage at halfpast nine others heard an argument as well he was here i spoke to him after the interval dad tell him i spoke to you after the interval she grabbed her fathers arm shaking it doggedly her father loosened her fingers let me go lass stay here take care of molly nancy wait for mark boscowan didnt miss the exigent quality of penellins final direction to his daughter marks not here penellin replied i expect hes out with friends in st ives or st just you know how young men are he patted nancys hand im ready then edward lets be off he nodded to the others and left the lodge a moment later boscowans car purred to life the sound amplified briefly as he reversed down the main drive then faded altogether as they headed towards penzance nancy spun towards the sitting room help him she cried to lynley he didnt kill mick youre a policeman you can help you must uselessly she twisted the front of her house dress in her hands even as he went to her side lynley reflected upon how little he could actually do to help he had no jurisdiction in cornwall boscowan seemed a highly capable man one unlikely ever to need assistance from new scotland yard had constable parker been in charge of the case the mets ultimate involvement would not have been long in doubt but parker wasnt in charge and since penzance cid looked perfectly competent the investigation had to remain in their hands however he still wanted to say something even if the only possible result was that form of purgation which comes from reliving the worst part of a nightmare tell me what happened tonight he led her back to the rockingchair deborah rose from her place and covered nancys shoulders with a blanket that lay on the back of the couch nancy stumbled through the story shed gone to do the drinks for the play leaving the baby with mick mick had been working at the sitting room desk getting ready to do the pay envelopes for the newspaper staff shed placed molly in the playpen nearby shed left them at seven oclock when i got back to the cottage i could hear molly crying i was angry that mick would let her go ignored i shouted at him as i opened the door the door was unlocked st james asked it was she told them you didnt notice micks body she shook her head and clutched the blanket closer round her thin shoulders one elbow stuck out it was bony and red the sittingroom door was closed and when you opened it what did you notice at first him mick lying she gulped for a breath then all round him the papers and notebooks and such as if the room had been searched st james said did mick ever work on stories at home nancy rubbed her hand along the nap of the blanket and nodded a bit too eagerly often yes at the computer he wouldnt want to go back to the office after dinner so hed work a bit at home he kept lots of notes for his stories at the cottage sort through this lot mickey id tell him we must throw some things away but he didnt like to because he never knew when hed need to look up some little detail in a notebook or a journal or his diary cant toss it out nance hed tell me the first thing i throw away will be exactly what i need so there were always papers scraps of this and that notes on paper napkins and on matchbook covers it was his way lots of notes someone must have wanted or the money the money we mustnt forget that it was a difficult recital to listen to although the facts seemed relevant the presence of material on the floor the evidence of a hasty search it did not appear that their connection to mick cambreys profession was foremost on his wifes mind no matter her attempt to make it seem so rather she appeared to be concerned with an entirely different matter connected to the search she verified this by concluding with you know i did talk to dad after the interval perhaps at halfpast ten from a call box noone replied despite the rooms warmth nancys legs shook causing the blanket that covered them to tremble i telephoned i spoke to dad he was here lots of people mustve seen me make the call ask mrs swann she knows i spoke to dad he was here he said hed not been out all evening but nancy lynley said your father was out he wasnt here when i phoned he only just walked in a few minutes after we did why are you lying are you afraid of something ask mrs swann she saw me in the call box she can tell you a blast of rockandroll music shattered the mild night noises outside the house nancy leapt to her feet the front door opened and mark penellin entered a large portable stereo rode upon his shoulder blaring out my generation nighttime nostalgia with a vengeance mark was singing along but he stopped in midphrase when he saw the group in the sitting room he fumbled incompetently with the knobs roger daltrey roared even louder for an instant before mark mastered the volume and switched the stereo off sorry he placed the unit on the floor it had left an indentation in the soft calfskin jacket he wore and as if he knew this without looking he brushed his fingers against the material to rejuvenate it whats going on whatre you doing here nance wheres dad in conjunction with everything that had gone before both her brothers sudden appearance at the lodge and his questions seemed to destroy the inadequate defences which nancy had raised to avoid the reality of her fathers behaviour that night she fell back into the rockingchair its your fault she cried the police have come for dad theyve taken him and hell say nothing because of you she began to cry reaching for her handbag which lay on the floor whatre you going to do to him next mark whatll it be tell me she opened her handbag and began fumbling through it pulling out a crumpled tissue as she sobbed mickey oh mick still at the doorway to the sitting room mark penellin swallowed looking at each of them in turn before returning his gaze to his sister has something happened to mick nancy continued to weep mark brushed back his hair he ran his knuckles down his jawline he brought their worst fears to light nancy had dad done something to mick she was out of the chair her handbag flying its contents spraying across the floor dont you say that dont you dare youre at the bottom of this we know it dad and i mark backed into the stairway his head struck a banister me whatre you talking about this is crazy youre crazy what the hells happened micks been murdered lynley said blood flooded marks face he spun from lynley to his sister and you think i did it is that what you think that i killed your husband he gave a wild shriek of laughter why would i bother with dad looking for a way to put him under for a year dont you say that dont you dare it was you right believe what you want what i know what dad knows dad knows everything all right lucky for him to be so bloody wise he grabbed his stereo and flung himself up five stairs lynleys words stopped him mark we need to talk no and then as he finished the climb ill save what i have to say for the flaming police as soon as my sister turns me in a door crashed shut molly began to wail how much do you really know about mark penellin st james asked looking up from the paper on which he had been jotting their collective thoughts for the last quarter of an hour he and lynley were alone in the small alcove that opened off the howenstow drawing room directly over the front entry to the house two lamps were lit one on the undersized mahogany desk where st james sat and the other on a marquetry side table beneath the windows where it cast a golden glow against the darknessbacked panes lynley handed st james a glass of brandy and cupped his own in the palm of his hand meditatively swirling the liquid he sank into a wing chair next to the desk stretched out his legs and loosened his tie he drank before answering not much in any detail hes peters age from what littles been said about him in the past few years i gather hes been a disappointment to his family to his father mostly in what way the usual way young men disappoint their fathers john wanted mark to go to university mark did one term at reading but then dropped out rusticated not interested he went from reading to a job as a barman in maidenhead then exeter as i recall i think he was playing drums with a band that didnt pan out as he would have liked no fame no fortune and most particularly no lucrative contract with a recording studio and hes been working here on the estate ever since at least for the last eighteen months im not quite sure why estate management never seemed to interest mark in the past but perhaps now hes thinking along the lines of taking oer as howenstow land manager when his father retires is that a possibility its possible but not without marks developing some background and a great deal more expertise than would come from the sort of work hes been doing round here does penellin expect his son to succeed him i shouldnt think so johns university educated himself when he retires which is a good time away in the future he wouldnt expect me to give his job to someone whose sole experience at howenstow has been mucking out the stables and thats been the extent of marks experience oh hes done some time in one or two of the dairies out on several of the farms as well but theres more to managing an estate than that is he paid well lynley twirled the stem of his brandy glass between his fingers no not particularly but thats johns decision ive got the impression from him in the past that mark doesnt work well enough to be paid well in fact the whole issue of marks salary has been a sore spot between them ever since mark returned from exeter if he keeps him short of cash wouldnt the money in gull cottage be a lure for him could he have known his brotherinlaws habits well enough to know that tonight hed be doing the pay for the newspaper staff after all it looks as if hes living a bit above his means if his salary here is as low as you indicate above his means how that stereo he was carrying must have set him back a few quid the jacket looked fairly new as well i couldnt see his boots clearly but they looked like snake skin lynley crossed the alcove to one of the windows and opened it the earlymorning air felt damp and cool at last and the stillness of night amplified the distant sound of the sea i cant think that mark would kill his brotherinlaw in order to steal that money st james although its not hard to picture him coming upon micks body seeing the money on the desk helping himself to it murder doesnt sound like mark opportunism does st james looked at his notes for a moment and read his summary of their conversation with nancy cambrey at the lodge so hed go to the cottage for another reason only to discover mick dead and finding him dead hed help himself to the cash perhaps i dont think mark would plan out a robbery surely he knows what that would do to his sister and despite how they acted tonight mark and nancy have always been close yet he probably knew about the pay envelopes tommy everyone else probably knew as well not only the employees of the newspaper but also the villagers nanrunnels not large i doubt its changed much since i was a boy and then believe me there were few enough secrets that the entire population didnt know if thats the case would others have known about the notes mick kept in the cottage i imagine the employees of the newspaper knew micks father no doubt and if he knew why not everyone else the spokesman doesnt employ that many people after all who are they lynley returned to his chair aside from mick i didnt know any of them except julianna vendale if shes still employed there she was the copy and wire service editor something in his voice made st james look up julianna vendale right a nice woman divorced two children about thirtyseven attractive to mick probably but i doubt that mick would have interested julianna shes not thought much of men since her husband left her for another woman some ten years ago noones got very far with her since he looked at st james gave a rueful smile i learned that the hard way one holiday here when i was twentysix and feeling particularly full of myself needless to say julianna wasnt impressed ah and micks father lynley took up his brandy once again harrys a bit of local colour hard drinker hard smoker hard gambler a mouth like a docker according to nancy he had heart surgery last year however so perhaps hes had to change his style close to mick at one time yes i couldnt say now mick started out working on the spokesman before he went off as a freelance writer did you know mick tommy nearly all my life we were of an age i spent a great deal of time in nanrunnel years ago we saw each other on halfterms and holidays friends more or less we drank together sailed together did some fishing scouted women in penzance as teenagers i didnt see much of him once i went up to oxford what was he like lynley smiled a man who liked women controversy and practical jokes just about equally at least he did when he was young i cant think he changed much perhaps weve a motive somewhere in that perhaps lynley explained the allusions to micks extramarital affairs which john penellin had made that afternoon a good explanation for the condition of the body st james said a husband getting back upon the man who cuckolded him but that doesnt explain the mess in the sitting room does it st james picked up his pen to make a note but he put it down again without writing fatigue was getting the better of him he could feel it like dust beneath his eyelids and he knew quite well that he wouldnt be good for any useful thinking for very much longer still a halfformed memory plagued him something said earlier that he knew he ought to recall he stirred restlessly in his seat catching sight of the piano in the drawing room and remembering lady asherton standing near it earlier in the evening tommy didnt your mother say something about a story mick was working on hadnt nancy told her about it she told me as well then its a possibility i got the impression that mick felt it was a significant piece certainly far more significant than the usual feature in the spokesman in fact i dont think he intended it for the spokesman at all is that something that might have irritated his father hardly enough to kill him and certainly not enough to castrate him st james if st james pointed out the killing and the castration were done by the same person we both saw that the castration was done after death tommy lynley shook his head that doesnt work for me first a killer later a butcher st james had to admit that it didnt work for him all that well either why do you suppose nancys lying about that phone call st james didnt wait for lynleys response he mused aloud it doesnt look good for john penellin that he was seen near the cottage john didnt kill mick hes not the type he couldnt have killed him not intentionally not at all there was a fair degree of certainty behind lynleys words st james met it by saying good men have been driven to violence before you know that unintentional violence that sudden blow delivered in rage how many more deaths is a moment of madness rather than premeditation responsible for and john was there tommy that has to mean something lynley got to his feet he stretched in an easy lithe movement ill talk to john in the morning well sort it out st james turned to him but did not rise what if the police decide theyve found their man what if the forensic evidence supports an arrest penellins hair on the corpse his fingerprints in the room a drop of micks blood on the cuff of his trousers or the sleeve of his coat if he was in the room tonight theres going to be evidence to support it far beyond the testimony of neighbours who saw him and other neighbours who heard a row what will you do then does boscowan know youre cid its nothing i broadcast will he ask the yard for assistance lynley answered with obvious reluctance putting into words st james own thoughts not if he thinks hes got his man in john penellin why should he he sighed its damned awkward for all nancys request that i help her father well have to be careful st james we cant afford to step on official toes and if we do therell be the devil to pay in london he nodded a good night and left the room st james went back to his notes from the desk he took out a second sheet of paper and spent several minutes creating columns and categories into which he put what little information they had john penellin harry cambrey mark penellin unknown husbands newspaper employees potential motives for the crime the weapon the time of death he wrote and listed and read and stared the words began to swim before him he pressed his fingers to his closed eyes somewhere a casement window creaked in the breeze at the same moment the drawing room door opened and shut his head jerked up at the sound deborah stood in the shadows she wore a dressing gown whose ivory colour and insubstantial material made her look like a spectre her hair hung loosely round her face and shoulders st james shoved his chair back pushed himself to his feet his weight was offbalance because of the awkward position of his leg and he could feel the accompanying stress as it pulled at the muscles of his waist deborah looked down the length of the drawing room and then into the alcove tommys not with you hes gone to bed she frowned i thought id heard he was here earlier oh she said right st james waited for her to leave but instead she came into the alcove and joined him next to the desk a lock of her hair caught against his sleeve and he could smell the fragrance of lilies on her skin he fixed his eyes on his notes and felt her do likewise after a moment she spoke are you going to get involved in this he bent forward and jotted a few deliberately illegible words in the margin of the paper a reference to notebooks on the cottage floor the location of the call box a question for mrs swann anything it didnt matter ill help if i can he answered although this sort of investigation isnt in my line at all so i dont know how much good ill do i was just going through what tommy and i were talking about nancy her family the newspaper that sort of thing by writing it down yes i remember your lists you always had dozens of them didnt you everywhere all over the lab graphs and charts as well i recall i never had to feel contrite about the jumble of photographs i shed all over the house while you were in the lab throwing darts at your own jumble in sheer frustration it was a scalpel actually st james said they laughed together but it was only an instant of shared amusement from which silence grew first on his part then on hers in it the sound of a clocks ticking seemed inordinately loud as did the distant breaking of the sea id no idea helens been working with you in the lab deborah said dad never mentioned it in any of his letters isnt that odd sidney told me this afternoon shes so good at everything isnt she even at the cottage there i was standing like an idiot while nancy fell apart and the poor baby screamed with helen all the time knowing just what to do yes st james said shes very helpful deborah said nothing else he willed her to leave he added more notations to the paper on the desk he frowned at it read it pretended to study it and then when it could no longer be avoided when to do so would openly declare him the craven he pretended not to be he finally looked up it was the diffusion of light in the alcove that defeated him in it her eyes became darker and more luminescent her skin looked softer her lips fuller she was far too close to him and he knew in an instant that his choices were plain he could leave the room or take her into his arms there was no middle ground there never would be and it was sheer delusion to believe a time might come when he would ever be safe from what he felt when he was with her he gathered up his papers murmured a conventional good night and started to leave he was halfway across the drawing room when she spoke simon ive seen that man he turned perplexed she went on that man tonight mick cambrey ive seen him thats what id come to tell tommy he walked back to her placed his papers on the desk where im not entirely sure if he isthe same man theres a wedding picture of him and nancy in their bedroom i saw it when i took the baby up and im almost certain hes the same man i saw coming out of the flat next to mine this morning i suppose yesterday morning now in london i didnt want to say anything earlier because of nancy deborah fingered her hair well i waited to say something because the flat next to mine belongs to a woman tina cogin and she seems to be of course i couldnt say for certain but from the way she talks and dresses and makes allusions to her experiences with men the impression i got shes a prostitute deborah told the story quickly how tina cogin had overheard their row in london how she had appeared with a drink for deborah one that she herself claimed to use after her sexual encounters with men but i didnt have a chance to talk to her much because sidney arrived and tina left what about cambrey it was the glass i still had tinas glass and i hadnt thought about returning it till this morning shed seen cambrey as she approached tinas door deborah explained he came out of the flat and realizing that she was actually in the presence of one of tinas clients deborah hesitated unsure whether to give the glass over to the man and ask him to return it to tina whether to walk on by and pretend she didnt notice him whether to return to her own flat without a word he had made the decision for her by saying good morning he wasnt embarrassed at all deborah said ingenuously st james reflected upon the fact that men are rarely embarrassed about their part in a sexual liaison but he didnt comment did you talk to him i just asked him to give the glass to tina and to tell her i was off to cornwall he asked should he fetch her but i said no i didnt actually want to see her with him it did seem so awkward simon i wondered whether he would put his arm round her or kiss her goodbye would they shake hands deborah shot him a fleeting smile i dont handle that sort of thing well do i anyway he went back into the flat was the door unlocked deborah glanced away her expression thoughtful no he had a key had you seen him before or just that once just then and a moment later he went into the flat and spoke to tina she flushed i heard him say something about redheaded competition in the hallway so he must have thought well he really couldnt have he was probably only joking but she must have led him to believe that i was on the game because when he came out he said that tina wanted me to know shed take care of my gendemen callers while i was gone and then he laughed and he looked me over simon at first i thought hed taken tina seriously but he winked and grinned and it just seemed his way deborah appeared to go back through what she had said for her face brightened as she drew a conclusion from the facts then shes probably not a prostitute is she if mick had a key to her flat prostitutes dont generally give out keys do they i mean spose one man stops by while another she gestured futilely it would create an awkward situation so perhaps she isnt a prostitute could he be keeping her simon or even hiding her protecting her from someone are you sure it was mick you saw i think it was if i got another look at a photograph i could be certain but i remember his hair because it was dark auburn just exactly the shade i always wished mine might be i remember thinking how unfair that such a colour should be wasted on a man who probably didnt treasure it nearly as much as i would have done st james tapped his fingers against the desk he thought aloud im sure we can manage to get a photograph of mick if not the one from the cottage then surely another his father would probably have one he considered the next logical step could you go to london and talk to tina deborah good lord what am i thinking of you cant dash off to london in the middle of your weekend here of course i can theres a dinner planned here for tomorrow night but weve nothing after that tommy can fly me back sunday morning or i can take the train you need only find out whether she recognizes his picture if she does dont tell her hes dead tommy and i will see to that st james folded his papers slipped them into his jacket pocket and continued speaking pensively if micks linked to her sexually she may be able to tell us something which clarifies his murder something which mick might have told her inadvertently men relax after intercourse they feel more important they let down their guard they become more honest he suddenly became aware of the nature of his words and stopped them shifting in another direction without looking her way helen can go with you ill do some questioning here tommy want to be part of that then well join you when damn the photographs i left the film from the cottage in your camera if we can develop it no doubt well im afraid i used it all up she smiled he knew why he was starting to sound exactly like her ill get it for you shall i its just in my room she left him he walked to the alcove window and looked out over the nightshrouded garden shapes alone defined the bushes there pathways were muted streaks of grey st james considered the disjointed pieces of mick cambreys life and death that had emerged that night he wondered how they fitted together mick had been gone a great deal lady asherton had said hed been working on a story in london a big story st james thought about this and the possible connections a story might have to tina cogin one assumption was that she was micks lover a woman being kept in london for his clandestine pleasure yet deborah nobodys fool when it came to judgement had concluded from a first impression a conversation and a runin with mick that tina was a prostitute if this was the case the resultant tie to a story was both logical and ineluctable for mick might be keeping the woman in london not for his pleasure but for her own protection as a source for a story that had the potential to make banner headlines and put micks name in the forefront of journalism it certainly would not be the first time if a prostitute became involved in critically important news nor would it be the first time if heads were to roll and careers were to fall because of a prostitute and now with mick dead and his sitting room ransacked perhaps in the hope of finding tina cogins address in london no amalgamation of these details sounded outrageous simon deborah flew back into the room he swung round from the window to find her trembling arms wrapped round herself tightly as if she were cold what is it sidney someones with sidney i heard a mans voice i heard her cry i thought that justin might be st james didnt wait for her to finish the sentence he hurried from the room and rushed down the main corridor towards the northwest wing with each step his anxiety grew as did his anger every image from the afternoon manifested itself before him once again sidney in the water sidney on the sand brooke straddling her punching her tearing at her clothes but there was no cliff to separate him from justin brooke now he blessed that fact only years of dealing with his sister caused st james to pause at her door rather than throw himself into her room deborah came up next to him as he listened against the wood he heard sidney cry out he heard brookes voice he heard sidneys moan damn and blast he thought he took deborahs arm guiding her away from the door and down the long corridor that led to her own room in the south corner of the house simon she whispered he didnt reply until they were in her room with the door shut behind them its nothing he said dont worry but i heard her deborah shes all right believe me but sudden comprehension swept across deborahs face she turned away with a gulp i only thought she said but gave up the effort and concluded with why am i such a fool he wanted to reply to assuage her embarrassment but he knew that any comment only held the promise of making things worse frustrated angry at the changes in their lives that seemed to bind him to inaction he looked aimlessly round her room as if it could formulate an answer for him he took in the black oak panelling upon the walls the formal asherton armorial display in the plaster overmantel of the fireplace the lofty barrel ceiling that soared into the darkness an immense fourposter bed dominated the floorspace its headboard carved with grotesques that writhed their way through flowers and fruit it was a horrible place to be alone it felt just like a tomb sidneys always been a bit hard to understand st james settled upon saying bear with her deborah you couldnt have known what that was all about its all right really to his surprise she turned to him hotly it isnt all right it isnt and you know it how can she make love with him after what he did to her today i dont understand it is she mad is he that was the question and the answer all at once for it was a true madness white hot and indecent obliterating everything that stood in its way shes in love with him deborah he finally replied arent people all just a little bit mad when they love her response was a stare he could see her swallow the film let me get it she said the anchor and rose benefited from having the most propitious location in all nanrunnel it not only displayed from its broad bay windows a fine unobstructed view of the harbour guaranteed to please the most discerning seeker of cornish atmosphere but it also sat directly across from nanrunnels single bus stop and was as a result the first structure a thirsty visitors eyes fell upon when disembarking from penzance and regions beyond the interior of the pub was engaged in the gentle process of deterioration once creamy walls had taken their place on the evolutionary path towards grey an effect produced by exposure to generations of smoke from fireplace cigars pipes and cigarettes an elaborate mahogany bar pitted and stained curved from the lounge into the public bar with a brass footrail heavily distressed through years of use similarly worn tables and chairs spread across a welltrodden floor and the ceiling above them was so convex that architectural disaster seemed imminent when st james and lady helen entered shortly after the pubs morning opening they found themselves alone with a large tabby cat that lounged in the bay window and a woman who stood behind the bar drying innumerable pint and halfpint glasses she nodded at them and went on with her work her eyes following lady helen to the window where she stooped to pet the cat careful with um the woman said watch he doesnt scratch hes a mean un when he wants to be as if with the intention of proving her a liar the cat yawned stretched and presented a corpulent stomach for lady helen to attend to watching the woman snorted and stacked glasses on a tray st james joined her at the bar reflecting upon the fact that if this was mrs swann she was trapped somewhere in the cygnet stage for there was nothing the least bit swanlike about her she was stout and solid with minuscule eyes and a frizz of grey hair a living contradiction to her name dressed in a dirndl skirt and a peasant blouse what cn i get you she asked and went on with her drying its a bit early for me st james replied weve come to talk to you actually if youre mrs swann who wants to know st james introduced himself and lady helen who had taken a seat next to the cat im sure youve heard mick cambreys been murdered whole village knows about that and the chopup as well she smiled looks like mick got what was coming at last separated proper from his favourite toy wasnt he no doubt therell be a regular pissup here when the local husbands come round to celebrate tonight mick was involved with some local women mrs swann drove her towelcovered fist into a glass and polished it vigorously mick cambreys involved in anyone willing to give him a poke that said she turned to the empty shelves behind her and began placing glasses upside down on the mats the implicit message was unavoidable she had nothing more to tell lady helen spoke actually mrs swann nancy cambreys our concern weve come to see you mostly because of her mrs swarms shoulders lost some of their stiffness although she didnt turn around when she said dim girl nance married to that sod her tight little curls shook with disgust indeed lady helen went on smoothly and shes in the worst sort of situation at the moment isnt she not only to have her husband murdered but then to have her father questioned by the police that reengaged mrs swarms interest quickly enough she faced them fists on hips her mouth opened and shut then opened again john penellin quite nancy tried to tell the police that she talked to her father on the phone last night so he couldnt have been in nanrunnel killing mick but they and she did mrs swann asserted that she did she did borrowed ten pence from me to make the call not a coin in her bag thanks to mick she began to wax warmly to this secondary topic always took her money he did hers and his fathers and anyone elses he could get his hands on he was always after cash he wanted to be a swell are you sure nancy spoke to her father st james asked not to someone else mrs swann took umbrage at st james doubts she pointed her finger for emphasis course it was her father didnt i get so tired of waiting for her she must have been a good ten or fifteen minutes that i went to the call box and yanked her out where is this call box outside the school yard right in paul lane did you see her make the call could you see the call box itself mrs swann put the questions together and reached a quick conclusion you cant be thinking nancy killed mick that she slipped off to her cottage chopped him up then came back nice as nice to serve up the lager mrs swann can you see the call box from the school grounds no what of it i yanked the lass out myself she was crying said her dad was dead angry that shed borrowed some money and she was trying to set it to rights with him mrs swann pressed her lips together as if she had said all that she would but then a bubble of anger seemed to grow and burst within her for she went on her voice growing fierce and i dont blame nancys dad for that do i everyone knew where any money would go that nance gave to mick hed pass it right on to his ladies wouldnt he so full of himself little worm got too big in his head when he went to university bigger still with his fancy writing started thinking he could live by his own rules didnt he right there in the newspaper office he got what he deserved in the newspaper office st james queried he met with women in the newspaper office she flipped her head in a vicious nod towards the ceiling right above stairs it is has a nice little room at the back of it with a cot and everything perfect little lovenest and he flaunted his doings proud of them all he even kept trophies trophies mrs swann leaned forward resting her enormous breasts on the bar she gusted hot breath in st james face what dyou say to ladies panties my lad two different pairs right there in his desk harry found them his dad not six months out of hospital poor man and he comes on those sitting there real as real in micks top drawer and they werent even clean oh the screaming and shouting that went on then nancy found out harry was screaming not nance youve a babe on the way he says and the paper our family is it all for nothing so you can please your own fancy and he hits mick so hard i thought he was dead from the sound he made when he hit the floor sliced his head on the edge of a cabinet as well but in a minute or two he comes storming down the stairs with his father just raving behind him when was this st james asked mrs swann shrugged her outrage seemed spent harry can tell you hes right above stairs john penellin rolled up the ordnance survey map put an elastic band round it and placed it with half a dozen others in the old umbrellastand in his office the latemorning sunlight streamed in the windows heating the room to an uncomfortable degree and he opened the casement and adjusted the blinds as he spoke so its been a fairly good year all way round and if we let that north acreage lie fallow for another season the land can only benefit from it thats my suggestion at any rate he resumed his seat behind the desk and as if he had an inflexible agenda to which he was determined to adhere he went on immediately with may we speak of wheal maen it had not been lynleys intention to go through the account books or to engage in a detailed discussion of penellins management of the estate something he had been doing with great facility and against growing odds for a quarter of a century nonetheless he cooperated knowing that patience was more likely to encourage a confidence from penellin than was a direct enquiry the entire appearance of the man suggested that an unburdening of his heart was more than in order he looked wheyfaced he was still wearing last nights clothes but they gave no evidence of having been slept in thus acting as testimony to the fact that penellin had probably never been to bed part of what had kept him from sleep was depicted on his body his fingers were still lightly stained with ink from having his prints taken by penzance cid evaluating all this lynley ignored the real purpose of his visit for a moment and followed penellins lead still a believer john he said mining in cornwall is well over one hundred years dead you know that better than i its not reopening wheal maen i want to speak of penellin said the mine needs to be sealed the enginehouse is a ruin the main shafts flooded its far too dangerous to be left as it is he swivelled his chair and nodded towards the large estate map on the office wall the mine can be seen from the sennen road its only a quick walk across a bit of moor to get to it i think its time we tore the enginehouse down completely and sealed the shaft over before someone decides to go exploring and gets hurt or worse the road isnt heavily trafficked at any time of year its true that few visitors go down that way penellin said but local folks use the road all the time its the children i worry about you know how they are with their playing i dont want any of us having to face the horror of a child falling into wheal maen lynley left his seat to study the map it was true that the mine was less than one hundred yards from the road separated from it only by a drystone wall certainly an insufficient barrier to keep the public off the land in an area where countless footpaths led across private property through open moors and into combes joining one village to another of course youre right he said and added reflectively more to himself than to the other man how father would have hated to see a mine sealed times change penellin said your father wasnt a man to hold on to the past he went to the filing cabinet and removed three more folders which he carried back to his desk lynley rejoined him hows nancy this morning he asked coping what time did the police return you halfpast four thereabouts is that it then with the police for now outside two of the gardeners were talking to each other as they worked among the plants the clean sharp snap of their secateurs acting as interjections between their words penellin watched them through the blinds for a moment lynley hesitated caught between his promise to nancy and his knowledge that penellin wished to say no more he was a private man he did not want help that much was clear yet lynley felt that beneath penellins natural taciturnity an undercurrent of inexplicable anxiety was flowing and he sought to find the source of the other mans worry in order to alleviate it as best he could after so many years of relying on penellins strength and loyalty he could not turn away from offering reciprocal strength and loyalty now nancy told me she spoke to you on the phone last night lynley said yes but someone saw you in the village according to the police penellin made no response look john if theres some sort of trouble no trouble my lord penellin pulled the files across the desk and opened the top one it was a gesture of dismissal the furthest he would ever go in asking lynley to leave the office its as nancy said we spoke on the phone if someone thinks i was in the village it cant be helped can it the neighbourhood is dark it could have been anyone its as nancy said i was at the lodge damn it all we were standing right there when you walked in after two in the morning you were in the village werent you you saw mick neither you nor nancy is telling the truth john are you trying to protect her or is it mark because he wasnt home either and you knew that didnt you were you looking for mark was he at odds with mick penellin lifted a document from within the file ive started the initial paperwork on closing wheal maen he said lynley made a final effort youve been here twentyfive years i should like to think youd come to me in a time of trouble theres no trouble penellin said firmly he picked up another sheet of paper and although he did not look at it the single gesture was eloquent in its plea for solitude lynley terminated the interview and left the office with the door closed behind him he paused in the hall where the old tile floor made the air quite cool at the end of the corridor the southwest door of the house was open and the sun beat down on the courtyard outside there was movement on the cobblestones the pleasant sound of running water he walked towards it outside he found jasper sometime chauffeur sometime gardener sometime stableman and fulltime gossip washing down the landrover theyd driven last night his trousers were rolled up his knobbly feet bare his white shirt open on a gaunt chest of grizzled hair he nodded at lynley got it from un did you he asked directing the spray on the rovers windscreen got what from whom lynley asked jasper snorted ad it all this morning we did he said murder n police n john getting hisself carted off by cid he spat on to the cobblestones and rubbed a rag against the rovers bonnet with john in nanrunnel n nance lyin like a pig in the rain bout everything she can ood think to see the like nancys lying lynley asked you know that jasper course i know it he said werent i down to the lodge at halften didnt i go bout the mill wasnt nobody home course she be lyin about the mill the mill in the woods has the mill something to do with mick cambreys death jaspers face shuttered at this frontal approach too late lynley remembered the old mans fondness for hanging a tale on the thread of innuendo in reply to the question jasper whimsically chose his own conversational path n john never tol you bout them clothes as nance cut up did e no he said nothing about clothes lynley replied and as bait he offered they cant have been important i suppose or he would have mentioned them jasper shook his head darkly at the folly of dismissing such a piece of information slicin urn to shreds she were he said right back of their cottage came pon her me and john caught her out and she cried like an ol sick cow when she saw us she did thas important enough i say but she didnt talk to you said nothin all them fancy clothes and nance cuttin and slicin john went near mad en he saw her started into the cottage after mick e did nance stopped im ung on to is arm till john run outer steam so they were another womans clothes lynley mused jasper does anyone know who micks woman was woman jasper scoffed more like women dozens from what harry cambrey do say comes into the anchor and rose does harry sits and asks everybody ood listen whats to do bout micks catting round she don give urn near enough harry likes to tell it whas a man to do when is womans not like to give him enough jasper laughed derisively stepped back from the rover and sprayed the front tyre water splashed on his legs freckling them with bits of mud the way harry do tell it nance been keeping her arms and legs crossed since the babe were born with mick just suffering byond endurance swelled up like to burst with nowhere to stick it whas a man to do harry do ask and mrs swann she do tell him but jasper suddenly seemed to realize with whom he was having this confidential little chat his humour faded he straightened his back pulled off his cap and ran his hand through his hair anybodyd see the problem easy mick dint want the bother o settling down he spat again to punctuate the discussions end st james and lady helen heard harry cambrey before they saw him as they climbed the narrow stairway ducking their heads to avoid capriciously placed beams in the ceiling the sound of furniture being shoved on a bare wooden floor was followed by a drawer being viciously slammed home and that was followed by a raw curse when they knocked on the door a hush fell inside the room then footsteps approached the door jerked open cambrey looked them over they did the same of him seeing him st james was reminded of the fact that hed undergone heart surgery the previous year he looked all the worse for the experience thin with a prominent adams apple and a skeletal collarbone meeting in two knobby points beneath it his yellow skin suggested a dysfunctioning liver and at the corners of his mouth red sores cracked his lips and spotted them with dried blood his face was unshaven and the fringe of grey hair at the crown of his head crinkled out from his scalp as if hed been brought hastily awake and hadnt taken the time to comb it when cambrey stepped back to let them pass into the office st james saw that it was one large room with several smaller cubicles opening along one wall and four narrow windows above the street that ran up the hill towards the upper reaches of the village aside from harry cambrey noone else was there an odd circumstance for a place of business particularly a newspaper but at least one of the reasons for the absence of employees lay upon worktops upon desks upon chairs notebooks and files had been taken from storage and strewn here and there harry cambrey was engaged in a search hed obviously been working at it for some hours and with no particular method considering the state of the room a series of militarygreen filing cabinets had drawers which gaped open halfempty a stack of computer disks sat next to a word processor which was switched on across a layout table the current edition of the newspaper had been shoved aside to make way for three stacks of photographs and the drawers of each one of the five desks in the room had been removed the air was musty with the smell of old paper and since the overhead lights had not been switched on the room possessed a dickensian gloom what do you want harry cambrey was smoking a cigarette which he removed from his mouth only to cough or to light another if he were concerned about the effect of his habit upon his heart he did not show it noones here but yourself st james asked as he and lady helen picked their way through the debris i gave them the day off cambrey eyed lady helen from head to toe as he made his reply and your business weve been asked by nancy to look into whats at the root of micks murder youre to help the two of you he made no attempt to hide his inspection of them taking in st james legbrace with the same effrontery he used to examine lady helens summer frock the pursuit of news is a dangerous profession isnt it mr cambrey lady helen said from the windows which was as far as shed got in her circuit of the room if your sons been murdered because of a story what difference does it make who brings his killer to justice so long as its done at this cambreys factitious bravado disappeared its a story he said his arms hung limp and lifeless at his sides i know it i feel it ive been here since i heard trying to find the lads notes youve come up with nothing st james asked theres little enough to go on just trying to remember what he said and what he did its not a nanrunnel story it cant be but thats the limit of what i know youre sure of that it doesnt fit with how hes been these last months that hed be working on a nanrunnel story he was off here and there all the time tracking down a lead doing research interviewing this person locating that one it wasnt a village story couldnt have been he shook his head it would have been the making of this paper once we got it in print i know it where did he go london but with no notes left behind isnt that curious therere notes all right here what you see cambrey flung his arm out to encompass the offices disarray but nothing i figure would cause the lads death reporters dont lose their lives over interviews with army men with the local mp with bedridden invalids with dairy farmers in the north journalists die because they have information worth dying over micks not got that here nothing unusual among all this material cambrey dropped his cigarette to the floor and crushed it out he massaged the muscles of his left arm and as he did so his eyes slid towards one of the desks st james read his answer in the latter action youve found something i dont know you may as well have a look i can make nothing from it cambrey went to the desk from beneath the telephone he took a piece of paper which he handed to st james tucked to the back of the drawer he said the paper was greasesplodged originally a wrapper for a sandwich from the talisman cafe the writing was faint the dull light in the room and the points at which the pen had skipped through grease made it difficult to read but st james could see that it consisted mostly of numbers k g ea m procuretransport m finance st james looked up is this micks writing cambrey nodded if theres a story anywhere thats it but i dont know what its about or what that lot means but there must be notes somewhere that use the same numbers and references lady helen said m and m surely he means the motorways if therere notes here using the same set of numbers ive not found them cambrey said so theyre missing pinched cambrey lit another cigarette inhaled coughed i heard the cottaged been searched has there been any indication of a breakin here st james asked cambrey looked from them to the room itself he shook his head boscowan sent a man to tell me about mick round fourfifteen this morning i went to the cottage but theyd already taken the body away and they wouldnt let me in so i came here ive been here ever since thered been no breakin no sign of a search perhaps by one of the other employees nothing he said his nostrils pinched i want to find the bastard that did this to mickey and i wont stop the story nothingll stop it we have a free press my boy lived for that died for that as well but it wont be in vain if he died for a story in the first place st james said quiedy cambreys face grew dark what else is there micks women cambrey removed the cigarette from his mouth in a movement that was slow studied like an actors his head gave a tiny nod of approbation theyre talking like that about mickey are they well now why should i doubt it men were jealous of his easy way and women were the same if he didnt choose them the cigarette went back to his mouth it created a haze through which cambrey squinted he was a man was mick a real man and a man has his needs that tight wife of his had ice between her legs what she denied him he found somewhere else if theres faulty its nancys turn away from a man and hell seek another woman theres no crime in that he was young he had needs was there anyone special he saw more than one woman had he taken up with anyone new couldnt say it wasnt mickeys way to boast about it when he did a new woman did married women sleep with him lady helen asked women from the village lots of women slept with him cambrey pushed aside papers on the desktop lifted the glass that covered it and removed a photograph which he passed to her see for yourself is this the kind of man youd say no to if he asked you to spread your legs missy lady helen drew in a quick breath to respond but in an admirable demonstration of selfcontrol she didnt do so nor did she look at the picture which she handed to st james in it a shirtless young man stood on the deck of a yacht one hand on a spar as he adjusted the rigging he was squarejawed and nicelooking but slender like his father not possessed of the rugged body or features that naturally came to mind when one hears the words a real man st james turned over the photograph cambrey prepares for americas cup the lads on his way had been written facetiously across it it was written in the same hand as was the note from the desk he had a sense of humour st james noted he had everything may i keep the photograph this note as well do what you like theyre nothing to me without mick cambrey examined the office defeat was in the set of his shoulders it lined a weary path across his face we were on our way the spokesman was going to be the biggest paper in south cornwall not just a weekly any longer i wanted it mick wanted it we were on our way all of us mick got on well with the staff no troubles there they loved him hed made good on his own come back to the village he was a hero to them what they wanted to be cambrey sharpened his voice you cant think that someone on the staff would kill him noone from this office would have laid a hand on my son they had no reason he was changing the paper he was making improvements he was getting ready to give someone the sack bloody hell who st james looked at the desk closest to the window a framed photograph of two young children sat on it what was his relationship with your copyeditor is it julianna vendale julianna cambrey removed his cigarette licked his lips was she one of his women a former lover or the female half of an office seduction about to be given the sack for not cooperating in micks quest to have his needs met cambrey barked a laugh refusing to react to the manner in which st james had used his own words about his son to arrive at a morethanlogical and lessthansavoury motive for murder no noble journalist going to his death over information or the protection of a source but a squalid little episode of sexual harassment ending in a very sexual crime mick didnt need julianna vendale cambrey said he didnt have to go begging for what was spread out before him hot wet and willing everywhere he turned in the street once more they headed in the direction of the harbour carpark where lady helen had left the estate austin st james glanced at her as they walked during the final minutes in the newspaper office shed said nothing although the tension in her body and the fixed expression on her face articulated her reaction to mick cambreys life and his death not to mention his father better than any words the moment they left the building however she gave vent to disgust she marched towards the carpark st james could barely manage the pace he only caught snatches of her diatribe some sort of sexual athlete more like his scorekeeper than his father time to put a newspaper out since they were so busy getting their needs met every woman in cornwall no wonder to me absolutely no wonder at all that someone cut id even consider doing it myself she was quite out of breath when she reached the car so was he they leaned against it directing their faces into a breeze that was pungent with the odours of kelp and fish in the harbour just beneath them hundreds of gulls circled above a small skiff its morning catch flickering silver in the sun is that what you thought of me lady helen asked abruptly st james couldnt have been more surprised by the question helen for gods sake is it she demanded tell me i want to know because if it is you can walk all the way back to howenstow then how can i answer ill say of course not youll say im just saying that so i dont have to walk back to howenstow its a nowin situation for me helen i may as well start hobbling on my way right now oh get in she sighed he did so before she could change her mind she joined him but didnt start the car at once instead she gazed through the dirty windscreen to the crusty walls of the harbour quay a family walked together upon it mother guiding an infant in a faded blue pushchair father holding a toddler by the hand they looked inordinately young to be parents i kept telling myself to consider the source lady helen finally said i kept saying hes mourning he cant know what hes saying he cant hear what it sounds like but im afraid i lost myself entirely when he asked me if id have spread my legs for mick i always wondered what that expression seeing red meant now i know i wanted to throw myself at him and tear out his hair he didnt have much that broke the tension she laughed in resignation and started the car what do you make of that note st james removed the paper from his shirt pocket and turned it to the formal printing stamped diagonally across the front talisman cafe i wonder where that is not far from the anchor and rose just up paul lane a bit why because he couldnt have written this in the newspaper office it hardly makes sense to use a sandwich paper with so much blank paper lying about so he must have written it somewhere else in the cafe or elsewhere if hed taken the sandwich out actually i was hoping the talisman cafe was in paddington he told her about tina cogin lady helen nodded her head at the note do you think this has to do with her shes involved somehow if deborahs correct in her assumption that it was mick cambrey she saw in the hall outside that flat but if the talisman cafe is here in nanrunnel mick must have worked this up locally with a local source a local killer as well possibly but not necessarily he was in and out of london everyone agrees to that i cant think it would be that difficult to trace him back to cornwall especially if he did his travelling by train if he did have a local source of information whoever it is could be in danger as well if the story is the motive for his murder st james returned the paper to his jacket pocket id say its more likely the other payment for seducing another mans wife lady helen pulled out on to the lamorna road it rose in a gentle slope past tourist flats and cottages veering east to display the bright sea its more workable as a motive considering what we know about mick because how would a man feel coming upon evidence that he cannot deny evidence that tells him the woman he loves is giving herself to another man st james turned away he looked at the water a fishing boat was chugging towards nanrunnel and even at this distance he could see the lobsterbaskets hanging from its sides hed feel like killing i expect he replied he felt lady helen look towards him and knew she realized how he had taken her words she would want to speak in order to ease the moment he preferred to let it go and indicated that by saying to her as to the other helen what you asked about us about how i felt when you and i were lovers of course not you know that i hope you always have ive not been down here in several years lynley said as he and st james went through the gate in the howenstow wall and began their descent into the woodland who knows what condition well find the place in if its not a ruin altogether you know how it is a few seasons abandoned and roofs cave in beams rot floors disintegrate i was surprised to hear it was still standing at all he was making conversation and he knew it in the hope that by doing so he could vanquish the legion of memories that were waiting on the plain of his consciousness ready to assault him memories that were intimately associated with the mill and tied to a portion of his life from which he had walked away making an obstinate vow never to think of it again even now as they approached the building and saw the tiles of its roofline emerge through the trees he could feel the first tentative foray of a recollection just an image of his mother striding through the woods but he knew that she was merely an illusion trying her luck against his protective armour he fought her off by pausing on the path taking his time and lighting a cigarette we came this way yesterday st james was answering he walked on ahead for a few paces stopping when he glanced back and saw that lynley had fallen behind the wheels overgrown did you know im not surprised that was always a problem as i recall lynley smoked pensively liking the concrete feel of the cigarette between his fingers he savoured the sharp taste of the tobacco and the fact that the cigarette in his hand gave him something to which he might attend with more concentration than was necessary and jasper thinks someones using the mill for what dossing he wouldnt say st james nodded looked thoughtful walked on no longer able to avoid it through idle conversation or cigarettesmoking or any other form of temporizing lynley followed oddly enough he found that the mill wasnt very much changed since he had last been there as if someone had been caring for it the exterior needed paint patches of whitewash had worn completely through to the stone and much of its woodwork was splintered but the roof was all of one piece and aside from a pane of glass that was missing from the single window on the upper floor the building looked sturdy enough to stand for another hundred years the two men climbed the old stone steps their feet sliding into shallow grooves which spoke of the thousands of entries and exits made during the time that the mill was in operation its paint long ago faded and stormwashed to nothing the door hung partially open its wood was swollen from seasons of rain so the door no longer fit neatly into position it gave way with a shriek at lynleys push they entered paused took stock of what they saw the bottom floor was nearly empty illuminated by streaky shafts of sunlight that gained access through gaps in the shuttered windows against a far wall some sacking lay in a disintegrating heap next to a stack of wooden crates beneath one of the windows a stone mortar and pestle were cobwebbed over while nearby a coil of rope hung from a peg looking as if it hadnt been touched in half a century a small stack of old newspapers stood in one corner of the room and lynley watched as st james went to inspect them the spokesman he said picking one up with some notations in the text corrections deletions a new design for the masthead he tossed the paper down did mick cambrey know about this place tommy we came here as boys i expect he hadnt forgotten it but those papers look old he cant have been here recently hm yes theyre from a year ago april but someones been here more recently than that st james indicated several sets of footprints on the dusty floor they led to a wall ladder that gave access to the mill loft and the gears and shafts which drove its great grindstone st james examined the ladderrungs pulled on three of them to test their safety and began an awkward ascent lynley watched him make his slow way to the top knowing quite well that st james would expect him to follow he could not avoid doing so nor could he any longer avoid the force of reminiscence that the mill and more so the loft above him provoked for after ages of searching shed found him up there where he had hidden from her and from the knowledge that he had come upon unexpectedly dashing up through the garden from the sea hed only had a glimpse of the man passing before a firstfloor window a glance that gave him the impression of height and stature a glance in which he saw only his fathers paisley dressinggown a glance in which he hadnt bothered to think how impossible it was that his father so ill would even be out of bed let alone sauntering round his mothers bedroom he didnt think of that only felt instead a sunshot bolt of joy as the words cured cured cured sang out in his mind and he ran up the stairs pounded up the stairs calling to them both and burst into his mothers room or at least tried to but the door was locked and as he called out his fathers nurse hurried up the stairs carrying a tray admonishing him telling him he would awaken the invalid and he got only as far as saying but fathers before he understood and then he called out to her in such a savage rage that she opened the door and he saw it all trenarrow wearing his fathers dressinggown the covers on her bed in disarray the clothing discarded hastily on the floor the air was heavy with the pungent odour of intercourse and only a dressing room and bath separated them from the room in which his father lay dying hed flung himself mindlessly at trenarrow but he was only a slender boy of seventeen no match for a man of thirtyone trenarrow hit him once a slap on the face with his open palm the sort of blow one uses to calm a hysterical woman his mother had cried roddy no and it was over she had found him in the mill from the one small window in the loft he watched her coming through the woodland tall and elegant just fortyone years old and so very beautiful he should have been able to maintain his poise the eldest son of an earl after all he should have possessed the strength of will and the dignity to tell her that hed have to return to school and prepare for exams it wouldnt matter whether she believed him the only object was to be off at once but he watched her approach and thought instead of how his father loved her how he shouted for her daze darling daze whenever he walked into the house his life had revolved round making her happy and now he lay in his bedroom and waited for the cancer to eat away the rest of his body while she and trenarrow kissed and clung and touched and he broke she climbed the ladder calling his name he was more than ready for her whore he screamed are you crazy or just so itchy that anyone will do even someone with nothing more on his mind than sucking you a good one and laughing about it with his mates in the pub when hes done are you proud of that whore are you fucking proud when she hit him the blow came completely by surprise because she had stood there immobile and accepted his abuse but with his last question she struck him so hard with the back of her hand that he staggered against the wall his lip split open by her diamond ring her face never changed it was blank carved in stone youll be sorry he screamed as she climbed down the ladder ill make you sorry ill make both of you sorry i will and he had done so over and over again how he had done so tommy lynley looked up to find st james watching him over the edge of the loft you might want to see whats up here yes of course he climbed the ladder it had only taken a moment for st james to evaluate what he found in the loft the mill shaft its tremendous gears and its grindstone took up much of the space but what was left gave mute evidence of the use to which the mill had been put most recently in the centre of the room stood a rusting cardtable and one folding chair this latter held a discarded tshirt long ago metamorphosed from white to grey while on the surface of the former an antique postage scale measured the weight of a tarnished spoon and two dirty razor blades next to this was an open carton of small plastic bags st james watched as lynley joined him and inspected these items his features becoming more settled as he reached his own inescapable conclusion micks been here more recently than last april tommy st james said and i dare say his visits had nothing to do with the spokesman he touched the postage scale lightly watched the movement of the arrow that indicated weight perhaps we have a better idea why he died lynley shook his head his voice was dark this isnt mick he said at halfpast seven that evening st james knocked on deborahs bedroom door and entered to find her stepping back from the dressing table her forehead wrinkled as she studied her appearance well she said doubtfully i dont know she touched the necklace at her throat a double strand of pearls and her hand fell to the neckline of her dress where she fingered the material experimentally it appeared to be silk and its colour was an odd combination of grey and green like the ocean on an overcast day her hair and skin were a contrast to this and the result was more striking than she appeared to realize a success st james said she smiled at his reflection in the mirror lord im nervous i keep telling myself that its only a small dinner party with tommys family and a few of their friends i keep telling myself that it doesnt matter in the least but then i have visions of fumbling round with all this silverware simon why on earth does it always come down to silverware the worst nightmare of a genteel society which fork do i use when i eat the shrimp the rest of lifes problems seem inconsequential by comparison what shall i say to these people tommy did tell me thered be a dinner tonight but at the time i didnt think much about it if i were only like helen i could chat amusingly about a thousand and one different topics i could talk to anyone it wouldnt even matter but im not like helen oh i wish i were just for tonight perhaps she can pretend to be me and i can fade into the woodwork hardly a plan to please tommy ive managed to convince myself that ill trip on the stairs or spill a glass of wine down the front of my dress or get caught on the tablecloth and pull off half the dishes when i get out of my chair last night i had a nightmare that my face had broken out in blisters and hives and people were saying thisis the fiancee in funereal tones all round me st james laughed at that and joined her at the dressing table where he peered into the mirror and studied her face not a blister anywhere not a hive in sight as to those freckles however she laughed as well such a pure sound such a pleasure it shot him back through time to memory he stepped away ive managed he reached in his jacket pocket for the photograph of mick cambrey which he handed to her if youll have a look at him she did so carrying the picture to the light it was a moment before she answered its the same man are you certain fairly may i take this with me and show it to tina he thought about this last night it had seemed an innocent plan to have deborah verify mick cambreys presence in london through the simple expedient of having tina cogin identify his photograph but after todays conversation with harry cambrey after seeing the cryptographic paper from the talisman cafe after considering the potential motives behind the crime and how tina cogin fitted into any or all of them he was not so sure about the role deborah could play or any role he wanted her to play in investigating the crime and contacting those most closely caught up in it deborah seemed to sense his hesitation and presented him with a fait accompli ive spoken to tommy about it she said to helen as well we thought wed take the train up in the morning helen and i and go directly to the flat so we should know something more about mick cambrey by the afternoon surely that shall be of help he couldnt deny this and she seemed to read agreement in his face she said right good and put the photograph in the drawer of the bedside table with a thats that movement as she did so the bedroom door opened and sidney wandered in reaching with one hand over her shoulder to fiddle with the zip on her dress while with the other she aimlessly attempted to rearrange her tousled hair these blasted howenstow maids she was muttering they flutter through my room god knows they mean well and i cant find a thing simon will you good lord you look wonderful in that suit is it new here i cant seem to manage this blasted thing on my own she presented her back to her brother and as he finished what she had begun with the zip she looked at deborah and you look stunning deb simon doesnt she look stunning oh never mind why on earth would i ask you when the only thing youve found stunning in years is a patch of blood through a microscope or perhaps a bit of skin from beneath the fingernail of a corpse she laughed turned and patted her brothers cheek before going to the dressing table where she studied herself in the mirror and picked up a bottle of deborahs perfume so the maids have straightened everything up she continued with her original thought and of course i cant find a thing my perfume is utterly gone may i borrow a splash of yours deb and just try to find my shoes why i almost had to borrow a pair from helen until i found them tucked in the very back of my wardrobe as if id no intention in the world of ever wearing them again an odd place for shoes st james pointed out sardonically in the wardrobe hes laughing at me deborah sidney said but if he didnt have your father keeping him together theres no doubt in my mind what the result would be chaos complete utter infinite she bent and brought her face closer to the glass the swellings gone thank god although the scratches are stunning not to mention the bruise beneath my eye i look just like a street brawler dyou think anyone will mention it or shall we all just concentrate on keeping our upper lips stiff and our manners impeccable you know the sort of thing eyes forward and no groping at anyones thighs beneath the tablecloth groping at thighs deborah asked simon you never told me and ive been worrying about the silver the silver sidney looked round from the mirror oh you mean all the forks and knives pooh unless people start throwing them dont give it a thought unbidden she fluffed up deborahs hair stepped back frowned played with it again wheres justin dyou know ive not seen him for ages today hes probably worried i shall bite him again i cant think why he reacted the way he did yesterday ive bitten him before although now i think the circumstances were a bit different she laughed lightheartedly well if the two of us get into another row tonight lets hope its at the dinnertable with all those knives and forks well have plenty of weapons lynley found peter in the smoking room on the ground floor of the house cigarette in hand he was standing by the fireplace his attention fixed upon a red fox that was mounted in a glass case above it a compassionate taxidermist had thoughtfully poised the animal in the act of flight just inches from a burrow that would have saved him other vulpine trophies had not been so fortunately enshrined however their heads hung from plaques fastened intermittently between photographs on the rooms panelled walls since the only light came from an arabesque brass chandelier these latter foxes cast long shadows accusatory wedges of darkness like reverse spotlights that emphasized a devotion to blood sports which noone in the family had actually felt since before the first world war seeing his brothers reflection in the glass case peter spoke without turning around why do you suppose noones ever taken this awful thing down from the mantel i think it was grandfathers first successful hunt why blood him when you can give him the poor creature as a prize that sort of thing lynley noted that his brother had removed the swastika from his ear replacing it with a single gold stud he wore grey trousers a white shirt a loosely knotted tie and although the clothes were overlarge at least they were clean and he had put on shoes if not socks this seemed cause enough for fleeting gratification and lynley briefly considered the value and the wisdom of confronting his brother as he knew he had to be confronted eventually at a moment when peters appearance suggested concession compromise and the promise of change peter tossed his cigarette into the fireplace and opened the drinks cabinet that was a hidden feature of the mantel beneath the fox this was one of my little adolescent secrets he chuckled as he poured himself a tumbler of whisky jasper showed it to me when i turned seventeen he showed me as well a rite of passage i suppose dyou think mother knew i imagine so what a disappointment to think ones clever and to find out just the opposite he turned from the fireplace for the first time and held his glass up in a rakish salute the best tommy werent you lucky to have found her at that lynley noticed his brothers eyes they were unnaturally bright he felt a twinge of apprehension stifling it he merely said thank you and watched as peter wandered to the desk that abutted the wide bay window there he began to play with the items arranged on the leatheredged blotter spinning the letter opener on its ivory handle lifting the top of an empty silver inkstand joggling a rack of cherrywood pipes still sipping his whisky he picked up a photograph of their grandparents and yawned as he idly studied their faces seeing this and knowing it for what it was an attempt to construct a barrier of indifference lynley realized there was no point in temporizing id like to ask you about the mill peter replaced the photograph and picked at a worn spot on the back of the armchair that sat before the desk what about the mill youve been using it havent you i havent been there in ages ive been by it of course to get down to the cove but ive not been inside why you know the answer to that peters face remained blank as lynley spoke but a muscle spasm pulled at the corner of his mouth he made his way to a row of university photographs that decorated one of the walls he began gliding from one to the next as if he were seeing them for the very first time every lynley for one hundred years he remarked crewing at oxford what a black sheep ive been he came to a blank spot on the wall and touched the palm of his hand to the panel even father had his day didnt he tommy but of course we cant have his picture here it wouldnt do if father were able to look down from the walls and observe our wicked ways lynley refused to allow the honeyed words to provoke him id like to talk about the mill peter threw back the rest of his whisky put his glass on a lowboy and continued his perusal he stopped before the most recent photograph and flicked his index finger against his brothers picture his nail snapped sharply upon the glass like a slap in miniature even you tommy youve fitted the mould a lynley to be proud of youre a regular swell lynley felt his chest tighten ive no control over the kind of life youve chosen to lead in london he said hoping to sound reasonable and knowing how poor a job he made of it youve chucked oxford fine youve your own digs fine youve taken up with this with sasha fine but not here peter i wont have this business at howenstow is that clear peter turned from the wall cocking his head slightly you wont have it you drop into our lives once or twice a year to announce what you will and wont have is that it and this is just one of those momentous occasions how often im here makes no difference to anything im responsible for howenstow for every person in the grounds and ive no intention of putting up with the sort of filth oh i see some local drug actions going on at the mill and youve placed me at the centre in your best di fashion well nice job have you dusted for prints found a lock of my hair did i leave behind spittle for you to analyse peter shook his head in eloquent disgust youre a fool if i want to use i sure as hell wont go all the way down to the mill ive nothing to hide from you or from anyone theres more than using going on and you know it youre in over your head whats that supposed to mean the disingenuous question rubbed lynley raw youre bringing it onto the estate thats what it means youre cutting it in the mill thats what it means youre taking it to london to use to sell have i painted the picture well enough for you god in heaven peter if mother knew it would kill her and wouldnt that be convenient for you no more worrying about whether shes going to disgrace you by running off with roderick no more wondering how much time hes been spending in her bed if shed only have the good grace to drop dead because of me you might even celebrate by bringing fathers photographs back but thatd be a tough one wouldnt it tommy because youd have to stop acting like such a bleeding little prig and how on earth could you ever manage it dont try to avoid the issue by bringing up all that oh no avoidance what a heinous crime another sin ive committed another black mark on my soul peter took the university picture from the wall tossing it in his brothers direction it landed with a clatter against the legs of a chair youre completely unsullied arent you tommy why cant i just follow your faultless example i dont want a row with you peter its delicious drugs adultery and fornication all in one family who knows what else wed have to work with if only judy were here as well but then shes dabbled a bit in adultery herself hasnt she tommy like mother like daughter thats what i say and what about you too noble to have it off with some blokes wife if she strikes your fancy too moral too ethical i cant believe that this is getting us nowhere what a blight we must be to you living handinglove with the seven deadly sins and enjoying every one of them where do we do the worse damage to your bloody title or your precious career youd say anything if you believed it had the power to hurt me wouldnt you peter laughed but he was gripping the back of the armchair tightly to hurt you is that what you actually think i cant believe it as far as i know the world still revolves round the sun not round you or hadnt you noticed there are actually people who lead their lives without the slightest worry about how their behaviour affects the eighth earl of asherton and im one of them tommy i dont dance to your tune i never have i never will his features contorted with an angry bitterness what i really love about this whole sodding conversation is the implication that you care about anything beyond yourself about howenstow about mother about me what difference would it make to you if this place burned to the ground what difference would it make if both of us died in the flames youd be free of us then youd never have to worry about playing the role dutiful son loving brother you make me sick peter fumbled in his pocket bringing out a packet of cigarettes but his hands were shaking so badly that he dropped them to the floor where they spilled out on to the carpet peter lynley said peter let me help you you cant go on this way you know that you must and if i die what of it then youll only have mother and roderick to contend with shes invited him tonight you know what an insult to the earl i think shes actually decided to declare independence they dont matter you know that let me help you please help you peter bent and retrieved his cigarettes it took him four tries with a match before he was able to light one youd sully your pretty reputation to salvage mine what a laugh that is whats it to you what happens to me as long as your own name stays pure youre my brother peter drew in on his cigarette deeply before mashing it out in an ashtray to hell with your brotherhood he started for the door lynley grabbed his arm as he passed thats easy for you isnt it to hell with brotherhood to hell with everyone because a commitment to people takes you away from dope and you cant bear that you talk to me of commitments you filthy hypocrite when did you ever commit to anyone besides yourself seeing the mill was a revelation today you ought to be proud of what youve become a smuggler a dealer an addict what a nice little footnote in the family history what a blackguard what a fiend peters voice spiralled he pulled himself from his brothers grasp so have me arrested or better yet arrest me yourself haul me into the met turning in your own brother should make your career here he extended his hands wrists together shackle me up take me away tonight and have your promotion tomorrow lynley watched the play of emotion on his brothers face he tried to tell himself that this confrontation had its roots in peters addiction but he knew quite well that his own past behaviour his obstinate pride and his need to punish had led inevitably to this ugly outburst still he struggled against the desire to lash out in return listen to yourself look at what its doing to you look at what youve become ive become nothing its where i began its what i always was in your own eyes perhaps but in noone elses in everyones eyes ive spent a lifetime trying to measure up and ive chucked it do you hear ive chucked it all and im glad of it so leave me alone will you go back to your nice little townhouse and your nice little life make yourself a nice little marriage with a nice little wife have some nice little babies to carry on your name and leave me alone just leave me alone his face was empurpled his body shook yes i can see thats best lynley stepped past his brother only to see that their mother whitefaced had come to the doorway how long she had been standing there he couldnt have said my dear my dear it was simply divine mrs sweeney divided the final word into two with a dramatic pause between the syllables as if in the hope of building anticipation in her audience over how her sentence would end be it with approbation or censure plorable her tone implied was as likely a conclusion as vine she was seated directly across from st james midway down the length of the linencovered dining table at which were gathered a party of eighteen they constituted an interesting assortment of lynley relations cornish notables and community members who had known the family for years the reverend mr sweeney and his wife belonged to this latter group mrs sweeney leaned forward candlelight glimmered across the astounding wide field of her chest which was amply revealed by a remarkable decolletage st james wondered idly what excuse mrs sweeney had concocted for wearing such a gown this evening its cut was certainly not what one generally expected from a ministers wife and she wasnt in the role of beatrice now then he noticed the damp longing and agitated glances which mr sweeney three seats away and attempting to converse politely with the wife of the plymouth mp was casting in his wifes direction he put the question to rest fork raised a bit of salmon pastry caught on its tines mrs sweeney continued my dear the entire cast was simply thrilled with your photographs dare we hope to make it a yearly event she was speaking to deborah who sat on lynleys right at the head of the table just think of it an annual collection of photographs with our own lord asherton in a different costume every time she trilled a little laugh the actors i mean of course not lord asherton but why not tommy in costume as well lady helen said i think its high time he joined the nanrunnel players and stopped hiding his talent under a bushel oh we could hardly dare to hope or to think mr sweeney tore his attention from his wifes cleavage long enough to take up this thought i can just see it sidney laughed tommy as petruchio ive told him time and again it was a mistake to read history at oxford lady helen said hes always had a flair for the stage havent you tommy darling might we really mr sweeney faltered caught between the obvious teasing of lynleys friends and his own unspoken hope that there might be a margin of reality behind lady helens words he said as if it were a possible inducement to lynleys becoming one of the local thespians we have so often asked dr trenarrow to join us under the lights a pleasure i must avoid trenarrow said and those you dont avoid peter lynley asked the question winking round the table in a manner that suggested skeletons were about to leap out of the cupboards while the dead came springing back to life he poured more of the white burgundy into his wineglass and did the same for sasha both of them drank sasha smiled down at her plate as if enjoying a secret joke neither of them had touched their salmon a brief hiatus came upon the conversation trenarrow broke it high blood pressure keeps me from many pleasures im afraid such are the failings of middle age you dont have the look of a man who has failings justin brooke said he and sidney had twined their hands on the table top st james wondered how either of them was managing to eat we all have failings trenarrow replied some of us are fortunate in that we manage to keep them better hidden than others but we all of us have them its the way of the world hodge assisted by two of the dailies who had been induced to stay into the evening emerged from the warming room as dr trenarrow spoke the introduction of a second course arrested attention if peter lynley had sought the embarrassment of others with his sly question food proved to be eminently more interesting to the assembled group youre not sealing wheal maen the exclamation rose like a wail emitted from lady augusta lynleys maiden aunt his fathers sister had always maintained a proprietary interest and watchful eye over howenstow as she spoke she cast a look of outrage upon john penellin on her right who remained detached from the conversation st james had been surprised to see penellin among the guests surely a death in the family would have been excuse enough to allow him to beg off a dinner party in which he appeared to have little interest the estate manager had spoken less than ten words during drinks in the hall spending most of the time standing at the window and gazing gravely in the direction of the lodge however from what he had seen and heard last night st james knew that penellin had no love for his soninlaw so perhaps it was his indifference to mick cambrey which prompted him to take part in the gathering or perhaps it was an act of loyalty to the lynleys or a behaviour he wished to be seen as such lady augusta was continuing she was a woman well skilled in the art of dinnertable dialogue devoting half her time to the right the other to the left and throwing a remark right down the centre whenever she deemed it appropriate its bad enough that wheal maen must be closed but cows were actually grazing in the park when i arrived good heavens i couldnt believe my eyes my father must be spinning in his grave i dont understand the reason mr penellin penellin looked up from his wineglass the mines too close to the road the main shafts flooded its safer to seal it piffle lady augusta proclaimed those mines are individual works of art you know as well as i that at least two of our mines have beamengines that are perfectly intact people want to see that sort of thing you know people pay to see it guided tours aunt lynley asked just the thing with everyone wearing those wonderful cyclops hats with little torches attached to their foreheads lady helen said yes of course lady augusta rapped the table sharply with her fork we dont want the trust here sniffing round for another lanhydrock putting everyone out of house and home do we do we she gave a quick nod accepting no response as agreement quite we dont but what other way do we have of avoiding those little beasts than by dealing with the tourist trade ourselves my dears we must make repairs we must open the mines we must allow tours children love tours theyll be wild to go down theyll give their parents no peace until theyve had a look its an interesting idea lynley said but ill only consider it on one condition whats that tommy dear that you run the tea shop that i her mouth closed abrupdy in a white cap lynley went on dressed as a milkmaid lady augusta pressed against the back of her chair and laughed with the heartiness of a woman who knew shed been bested if only for the moment you naughty boy she said and dipped into her soup conversation ebbed and flowed through the remainder of the meal st james caught only snatches here and there lady asherton and cotter talking about a large brass charger caparisoned and prancing that hung on the rooms east wall lady helen relating to dr trenarrow an amusing tale of mistaken identity at a longago houseparty attended by her father justin brooke and sidney laughing together over a remark lady augusta made about lynleys childhood the plymouth mp and mrs sweeney wandering in a maze of confusion in which he discussed the need for economic development and she responded with a dreamy reverie about bringing the film industry to cornwall apparently in order to feature herself in a starring role mr sweeney when his eyes were not feasting upon his spouse murmuring vague responses to the mps wife who was speaking about each of her grandchildren in turn only peter and sasha kept their voices low their heads together their attention on each other thus the company moved smoothly towards the end of the meal this was heralded by the presentation of the pudding a flaming concoction that looked as if its intended purpose was to conclude the dinner by means of a conflagration when it had been duly served and devoured lynley got to his feet he brushed back his hair in a boyish gesture you know this already he said but id like to make it official tonight by saying that deborah and i shall marry in december he touched her bright hair lighdy as a murmur of congratulations rose and fell what you dont know however because we only decided late this afternoon is that well be coming home permanently to cornwall then to make our life here have our children grow up here with you it was an announcement which considering the reaction noone had been prepared to hear least of all had st james expected it he had an impression only of a general cry of surprise and then a series of images played quickly before him lady asherton saying her sons name and nothing more trenarrow turning abruptly to lynleys mother deborah pressing her cheek to lynleys hand in a movement so quick it might have gone unnoticed and then cotter studying st james with an expression whose meaning was unmistakable hes expected this all along st james thought there was no time to dwell upon what it would mean how it would feel to have deborah nearly three hundred miles away from the home shed known all her life for champagne glasses had been distributed and mr sweeney was enthusiastically seizing the moment he got to his feet eager to be the first to embrace such welcome news only the second coming could have given him more pleasure then i must say clumsily he reached for his glass do let me toast you both to have you with us again to have you home to have youhe relinquished the attempt to find an appropriate sentiment and merely raised his glass and burbled simply wonderful before he sat down other congratulations followed and with them were voiced the inevitable questions about engagement and wedding and future life the meal could have disintegrated at that point into one large display of bonhomie but peter lynley put an end to the promise of that happening he stood holding his champagne glass at arms length towards his brother he waved it unevenly only the shape of the glass prevented the wine from sloshing out then a toast he said drawing out the last word he leaned one hand on sashas shoulder for support she glanced furtively at lynley and then said something in a low voice which peter disregarded to the perfect brother he announced who has managed somehow after searching the world over not to mention doing a fair degree of sampling the goods as he went right tommy to find the perfect woman with whom he can now have the perfect life what a damned lucky fellow lord asherton is he gulped his drink noisily and fell back into his chair that cuts it st james thought he looked to see how lynley would handle the matter but his eyes came to rest upon deborah instead face pinched she ducked her head no matter that her humiliation was both unwarranted and unnecessary considering its source the fact of it alone provided a spur st james pushed his own chair back and rose awkwardly the issue of perfection is always open to debate he said im not eloquent enough to argue it here i drink instead to tommy oldest of my friends and to deborah dearest companion of my exile my own life has been richer indeed for having had both of you part of it a swell of general approbation followed his words on the heel of which the plymouth mp lifted his glass and managed to turn his own toast into a speech cataloguing his accomplishments and his steadfast if highly unlikely belief in the reincarnation of the cornish mining industry a topic upon which lady augusta waxed wildly enthusiastic for several more minutes at the end of this time it seemed clear that whatever damage peter lynley had attempted to do the company seemed intent upon ignoring him altogether a determination fortified by lady asherton who announced with a resolute air of good cheer that coffee port and all the postprandial et ceteras would be in the drawing room unlike the dining room with its silver candelabra and unobtrusive wall sconces the drawing room was brightly lit by its two chandeliers here a serving table had been laid with a coffee service and another with brandy balloon glasses liqueurs with his own coffee in hand st james made his way to a hepplewhite settee which was centrally located in the room he sat and placed his coffee on the sidetable he didnt really want it couldnt think why he had taken one in the first place my dear lady augusta had buttonholed deborah by the grand piano i want to hear about every change youve got planned for howenstow change deborah asked her blankly the nurseries need to be updated like mad youll know that already actually i havent had a chance to think much about it i know you have this charming little hobby of photography daze told me all about it last week but im glad to say you dont look at all the type of woman whos going to put off having children in favour of a career as if seeking affirmation for her statement she stepped back and looked deborah over like a breeder assessing the potential of a mare im a professional photographer deborah told her stressing the adjective politely lady augusta waved that off like a fly you wont let that get in the way of the children dr trenarrow passing by came to deborahs rescue times have changed augusta we no longer live in an age where merit is determined by ones ability to reproduce and thank god for that think of the limitless possibilities presented in eschewing procreation no more thinning of familial gene pools a future without bleeders no saint vitus dance oh rubbish you scientists was lady augustas riposte but she was abashed enough to seek another conversational prey and headed in the direction of john penellin who was standing by the doorway to the elizabethan gallery brandy in hand st james watched her close in on the estate manager her fluttering scarf and ample posterior making her resemble nothing so much as the stern of a ship under sail he heard her call out those mines mr penellin before he turned away to find deborah had come to join him please dont get up she sat beside him she was taking neither coffee nor liqueur youve survived he smiled even with the silver not a single mistake as far as i could tell everyones been more than kind she said well nearly everyone peter was she looked round the room as if in search of lynleys brother and she sighed perhaps feeling relief that he and sasha had left the party altogether did i look petrified when i first came downstairs i must have everyone was treating me like porcelain before dinner not at all st james reached for his coffee but merely turned the cup aimlessly in its saucer he wondered why deborah had joined him like this her place was with lynley who along with justin brooke and sidney was steeped in conversation with the plymouth mp he heard their laughter heard brooke say too right heard one of them comment on the labour party sidney said something about the prime ministers hair there was another burst of laughter next to him deborah stirred but didnt speak it was unlikely that she had joined him for the sake of companionship or a quick postmortem of the evenings events yet this reticence was out of character as well he looked up from his contemplation of her engagement ring a heavy emerald set off with diamonds and found her studying him with an intensity that brought the heat to his face this sudden loss of his habitual detachment was as disconcerting as was her unnatural diffidence were a fine pair he thought why did you call me that simon in the dining room so much for diffidence it seemed the right thing after all its the truth you were there through everything both you and your father i see her hand lay next to his he had noticed this before but had chosen to ignore it making a deliberate effort not to move away from her like a man afraid of the potential for contact his fingers were relaxed he willed them to be so and although a single movement wearing the guise of inadvertence would have been sufficient to cover her hand with his own he took care to maintain between them an appropriately discreet and utterly hypocritical four inches of beautifully upholstered hepplewhite the gesture when it came was hers she touched his hand lightly an innocent contact that broke through his barriers the movement meant nothing it promised even less he knew that quite well but despite this his fingers caught hers and held i do want to know why you said it she repeated there was no point it could only lead nowhere or worse it could lead to an unbridled bout of suffering hed prefer not to face simon how can i answer you what can i possibly say that wont make us both miserable and end up leading to another row i dont want that and i cant think you do he told himself that he would adhere to every resolution he had made regarding deborah she was committed he thought love and honour bound her to another he would have to take solace in the fact that in time they might once again be the friends they had been in the past taking pleasure in each others company and wanting nothing more a dozen different lies rose in his mind about what was right and possible in their situation about duty responsibility commitment and love about the anchors of ethics and morals that held each of them fast and still he wanted to speak because the reality was that anything even anger and the risk of estrangement was better than the void a sudden commotion at the drawing room door precluded the possibility of further conversation hodge was speaking urgently to lady asherton while nancy cambrey pulled upon his arm as if she would drag him back into the corridor lynley went to join them st james did likewise in the hush that descended upon the company nancys voice rose you cant not now what is it lynley asked inspector boscowan my lord hodge replied in a low voice hes down in the hall wanting to speak to john penellin only part of hodges statement proved true for as he spoke boscowan stepped into the drawing room doorway as if he expected some sort of trouble he looked the group over his face apologetic and his eyes came to rest upon john penellin it was clear that a duty which gave him no pleasure had brought him to interrupt the party the room was absolutely still john penellin walked towards them he handed his brandy to dr trenarrow edward he said to boscowan with a nod nancy had faded into the corridor where she slumped against a mule chest and watched the encounter perhaps we can go to the estate office theres no need for that john boscowan said im sorry the implication behind the apology was obvious boscowan would never have come to howenstow in this manner unless he was certain that he had his man are you arresting me penellin asked the question in a manner that sounded at once both resigned and curiously without panic as if hed been preparing himself for this eventuality all along boscowan glanced around every eye was fastened on the little group he said out here please and walked into the corridor penellin st james and lynley followed another plainclothes policeman was waiting at the top of the stairs he was bulky with the physique of a boxer and he watched them warily arms crossed hands balled into fists boscowan faced penellin his back to the other officer in speaking next he crossed the line that divides police and civilian breaking rules and regulations but he didnt seem to be fazed by this his words having their roots in friendship rather than in duty you need a solicitor john weve the first of the forensic reports it doesnt look good and then again in a way that left no doubt as to boscowans sincerity truly im sorry fingerprints fibres hairs what have you lynley asked the lot dads been inside the cottage in the past nancy said boscowan shook his head st james knew what that sign of negation meant penellins fingerprints in the cottage could indeed be argued away by the fact that hed been there before but if boscowan had fibres and hairs in his possession the probability was that theyd come from one source mick cambreys corpse if that was the case the reality was that penellin had indeed lied about his whereabouts the previous night if youll come now boscowan said in a more normal tone of voice this appeared to be the signal for the other policeman he walked to penellins side and took his arm in a moment it was over as their steps faded down the stairs nancy cambrey fainted lynley caught her before she hit the floor get helen he said to st james and when lady helen was with them they took nancy down to lady ashertons day room in the east wing of the house it offered the double benefit of being both private and comfortable a few minutes among its family memorabilia and friendly furniture would no doubt restore nancy to herself lynley decided and he allowed himself a moment of gratitude that his mother would carry on upstairs without him until such a time as she could deal with john penellins arrest privately and face the turmoil that would arrive in its wake st james had possessed the foresight to bring the whisky decanter from the drawing room he pressed a glass upon nancy lady helen steadied her hand shed only taken a tiny sip when a tentative knock sounded on the door it was followed unaccountably by justin brookes voice may i have a word he didnt wait for a response rather he opened the door popped his head inside and said nothing until he fixed upon lynley may i have a word with you a word lynley demanded incredulously wondering what on earth brooke could possibly want what the devil its important brooke said he looked earnestly to the others as if for support and found it in the least likely quarter lady helen spoke ill take nancy back to the lodge tommy it doesnt make sense to keep her here shell need to see to the baby im sure lynley waited until both women were gone before he spoke to brooke who took a balloonbacked chair unbidden straddled it backwards and folded his arms along its top rail lynley leaned against his mothers desk st james stood by the fireplace what is it that you wanted lynley said to brooke he was impatient with the interruption and too preoccupied to care much about hiding it its a private matter concerning your family brooke canted his head towards st james an indication of his desire that this conference be held out of the other mans presence st james made a move to go no its fine lynley said to him finding himself perversely unwilling to allow brooke the degree of control that would be implied by st james departure there was something about the man that he didnt like an ease of manner contravened by a flicker of malice in his expression brooke reached for the decanter of whisky and nancys glass that were standing on a circular table next to his chair he poured himself some saying very well then i could use a drink you he held the decanter first to lynley then to st james there were no other glasses in the room so the invitation was meaningless as brooke no doubt knew he drank appreciatively said good stuff and poured himself more word came back to the drawing room fast enough that penellins been arrested but penellin couldnt have killed mick cambrey it was certainly not the sort of pronouncement which lynley had been expecting if you know something about this affair you need to tell the police its only indirectly my concern brooke said its more direct than you think what are you talking about your brother the clink of decanter upon glass seemed unnaturally grating and loud as brooke took more whisky lynley refused to think the patently unthinkable or to draw the conclusion for which those two simple words asked people in the drawing room just now were saying penellin had an argument with cambrey before his death that was the main cause for suspicion they said someone had heard about it in the village today i dont see what this has to do with my brother everything im afraid mick cambrey didnt have an argument with penellin or if he did it didnt compare with the row he had with peter lynley stared at the man he felt a sudden urge to throw him from the room and recognized how closely the desire was tied to an incipient dread and to the unwanted realization that somehow this piece of information was not a surprise to him what are you talking about how do you know i was with him brooke replied and it was after penellin cambrey said that much lynley reached for a chair the story please he said with marked courtesy right brooke nodded his approval sid and i had a bit of a blowup yesterday she didnt much want to see me last night so i went into the village with peter why for something to do mainly peter was low on cash and he wanted to borrow some he said he knew a bloke whod be dealing with money that night so we went to see him it was cambrey lynleys eyes narrowed what did he need money for brooke tossed a look in st james direction before he replied as if he expected a reaction from that quarter he wanted some coke and he took you with him wasnt that rather shortsighted it was safe enough peter knew he could trust me brooke seemed to feel a more direct revelation was in order look id a stash with me yesterday and id given him some it was gone we wanted more but i didnt have any more money than he did so we were on the look for it we wanted to get high i see youve managed to get to know my brother with remarkable ease this weekend people get to know others when their interests are the same quite yes lynley ignored the need to clench his fist to strike did mick lend him money he wouldnt hear of it thats what started the row peter could see it i could see it right there on his desk in six or ten stacks but he wouldnt part with as much as two quid what happened then brooke grimaced hell i didnt even know this bloke when mick and peter started in i just left the place i would have liked the dope yes but i didnt want to get into a brawl what did you do when you left wandered round a bit till i found the pub had a drink and hitched a ride back later hitched a ride with whom farmer and his wife brooke grinned and added unnecessarily by the smell of them dairy id guess and peter i left him arguing with cambrey where was sasha all this time here she and peterd gone round about a promise hed made in london to get her some dope on his own i think she was waiting for him to make good what time did you leave the cottage st james asked his expression was stony brooke looked at the rooms white cornice fixated upon its egg and dart pattern thinking remembering or playing at both it was ten when i got to the pub i remember that i checked the time and did you see peter again that night didnt see him until this evening again brooke grinned this time it was a justbetweenusboys sort of look one that claimed camaraderie and understanding i came back here made it up with sid and spent the night occupied in her room fairly well occupied as a matter of fact sids that way he pushed himself to his feet and concluded by saying i thought it best to tell you about your brother rather than the police it seemed to me that youd know what to do but if you think i should ring them he let the statement slide all of them knew it was meaningless nodding at them both he left the room when the door closed behind him lynley felt in his pocket for his cigarette case once it was in his grasp however he looked at it curiously saw how it winked in the light and wondered how it had come to find its way into his hand he didnt want to smoke what shall the two words emerged hoarsely he tried again what shall i do st james talk to boscowan what else can you do hes my brother would you have me play cain shall i do it for you then at that lynley looked at his friend he saw how implacable st james features had become he knew that there was no reasonable alternative he saw that even as he searched for one give me till the morning he said deborah checked the room in a cursory fashion to make sure she hadnt forgotten anything she locked her suitcase and pulled it from the bed deciding as she did so that it was just as well they were leaving cornwall the weather had changed during the night and yesterdays dazzling cobalt sky was the colour of slate this morning sharp gusts of wind coughed intermittently against the windows and from one which she had left partially open came the unmistakable smell of rainladen air however other than the occasional rattling of window panes and the creak of the heavy branches of a beech tree a short distance from the house the morning brought no additional sounds for instinctively recognizing the approach of a storm the clamorous gulls and cormorants had vanished seeking shelter inland miss at the doorway stood one of the howenstow maids a young woman with a cloud of dark hair that quite overwhelmed a triangular face her name was caroline deborah recalled and like the other daily help in the house she wore no uniform merely a navy skirt white blouse and flatheeled shoes she was snug and neatlooking and she carried a tray which she used to gesture as she spoke his lordship thought youd want something before you leave for the train caroline said taking the food to a small tripod table that stood near the fireplace he says youve just thirty minutes does lady helen know that is she up up dressing and having her breakfast as well as if in affirmation of this lady helen wandered into the room simultaneously engaged in all three activities she was in her stockinged feet she was munching on a wedge of toast and she was holding up two pairs of shoes at arms length i cant decide she said as she scrutinized them critically the suede are more comfortable but the green are rather sweet arent they ive had them both on and off a dozen times this morning i should recommend the suede caroline said hm lady helen dropped one suede shoe to the floor stepped into it dropped one of the other pair stepped into that look closely caroline are you really quite sure quite caroline replied the suede and if youll give me the other pair ill just pop them into your suitcase lady helen waved her off for a moment she studied her feet in the mirror that hung on the inside of the wardrobe door i can see your point but look at the green surely theres green in my skin as well or if not perhaps theyll provide a hint of contrast because ive the sweetest handbag that goes with these shoes and ive been dying to put them together somehow one hates to admit that an impulsive purchase of shoes and bag has been wildly in vain deborah what do you think the suede deborah said she pushed her suitcase towards the door and went to the dressing table lady helen sighed outvoted i suppose she watched as caroline left the room i wonder if i can steal her from tommy just one look at those shoes and she made up her mind heavens deborah shed save me hours every day no more standing before the wardrobe futilely trying to decide what to wear in the morning id be positively liberated deborah made a vague sort of response and stared perplexed at the empty spot next to the dressing table she went to the wardrobe and peered inside feeling neither panic nor dismay at first but merely confusion lady helen chatted on i victimize myself i hear the word sale in reference to harrods and i simply fall apart shoes hats pullovers dresses i even bought a pair of wellingtons once simply because they fitted so fetching i thought just the thing for mucking around mothers garden she inspected deborahs breakfast tray will you be eating your grapefruit no im not at all hungry deborah went into the bathroom came out again she kneeled on the floor to look under the bed trying to recall where she had left the case certainly it had been in the room all along shed seen it without seeing it last night as well as the night before hadnt she she thought about the question admitted to herself that she couldnt remember yet it was inconceivable that she might have misplaced the case even more inconceivable that it was missing altogether because if it was missing and she hadnt misplaced it herself that could only mean whatever are you doing lady helen asked dipping happily into deborahs grapefruit dread was hitting her as she saw that nothing had been stored beneath the bed or hurriedly shoved there to get it out of the way deborah got to her feet her face felt cold lady helens smile faded what is it whats wrong in a last and utterly useless search deborah returned to the wardrobe and tossed the extra pillows and blankets to the floor my cameras she said helen my cameras theyre gone cameras lady helen asked blankly gone what do you mean gone just what i said gone they were in their case youve seen it i brought it with me this weekend its gone but they cant be gone theyve just been misplaced no doubt someone thought theyre gone deborah said they were in a metal case cameras lenses filters everything lady helen replaced the bowl of grapefruit on deborahs tray she looked round the room are you certain of course im certain dont be so deborah stopped herself and with an effort at calm said they were in a case by the dressing table look its not there let me ask caroline lady helen said or hodge they may have already taken them down to the car or perhaps tommy came in earlier and got them surely thats it because i cant think that anyone would actually her voice refused to say the word steal nonetheless the fact that it was foremost on lady helens mind was obvious in the very omission i havent left the room since last night ive only been in the bath if tommy came for the cameras why wouldnt he have told me let me ask lady helen said again she left the room to do so deborah sank on to the stool in front of the dressing table staring at the floor the pattern of flowers and leaves in the carpet blurred before her as she considered the loss three cameras six lenses dozens of filters all purchased from the proceeds of her first successful show in america stateoftheart equipment that served as the hallmark of who she had managed to become at the end of three years on her own a professional without ties duties or obligations a woman committed to the future every decision she had made during those years in america had taken its legitimacy from the ultimate possession of that equipment she could look back on every conclusion she had reached the convictions she had developed the deeds she had done and feel neither guilt nor regret because she had emerged with a profession at which she was a bona fide success that part of life which might have been his to hold and love and nurture had been mourned in secret made no difference that she had filled her time with distractions to avoid acknowledging the worst of her loss indeed that she had revaluated all losses and defined each one as inconsequential had no impact upon her everything was made acceptable and right and completely justifiable because shed attained her goal she was a success possessing all the requisite signs and symbols of that achievement lady helen came back into the room i spoke to both caroline and hodge she said regret made the statement hesitant she had no need to say more deborah listen tommy will i dont want tommy to replace the cameras deborah cried fiercely a quick flash of surprise passed across lady helens face it vanished in an instant leaving in its place an expression of perfectly impartial repose i was going to say that tommy will want to know at once ill fetch him she was gone only a few moments returning with both lynley and st james the former went to deborah the latter remained by the door damn and blast lynley muttered what next he put his arm round deborahs shoulders and hugged her to him briefly before he kneeled next to the stool and gazed into her face his own she could see was lined by fatigue he looked as if he hadnt slept at all the previous night she knew how worried he must be about john penellin and she felt a twinge of shame that she should be causing him additional distress deb darling he said im sorry so he knew that the cameras had been stolen unlike lady helen he didnt even offer the excuse that the equipment had somehow been misplaced when did you last see them deborah st james asked lynley touched her hair smoothed it back from her face deborah could smell the clean fresh scent of his skin he hadnt smoked yet and she liked the smell of him when he hadnt had his first cigarette if she could concentrate on tommy everything else would go away did you see them last night when you went to bed st james persisted they were here yesterday morning i remember that because i replaced the camera id used at the play everything was here right by the dressing table and you dont remember seeing them after that you didnt use them during the day i didnt use them i wasnt even in the room until it was time to dress for the party i might have noticed them then i ought to have i was in here after all i was right by the dressing table but i didnt notice them last night at all did you simon lynley got to his feet his glance went from deborah to st james in a curious look perplexed but nothing more tm sure they were here st james said it was your old metal case wasnt it when she nodded he said i saw it by the dressing table saw it by the dressing table lynley repeated the comment more to himself than to the others he looked at the spot on the floor he looked at st james he looked at the bed when st james he asked the question easily three simple words but the fact of his saying them and the deliberation of their tone added a new dimension to the conversation lady helen said tommy shouldnt we be off to the train when did you see the camera case st james yesterday the evening some time during the night when were you alone or was deborah tommy lady helen said no let him answer st james didnt reply deborah reached for lynleys arm she looked to lady helen in eloquent entreaty tommy lady helen said this isnt i said let him answer a moment passed a small eternity before st james gave an emotionless recitation of the facts helen and i managed to get a picture of mick cambrey yesterday from his father tommy i brought it to deborah before dinner last night i saw her camera case then lynley stared at him a long breath left his body christ he said tm sorry that was so bloody stupid i cant think what made me say it st james could have smiled he could have brushed off the apology or laughed off the implied insult as an understandable error he did nothing said nothing he looked only at deborah and even then it was a glance of a moment before he looked away as if seeking to relieve the situation lady helen said were they terribly valuable deborah theyre worth hundreds of pounds deborah went to the window where the light would be behind her leaving her face in shadow she could feel the blood pounding in her chest on her neck on her cheeks she wanted absurdly to do nothing more than cry then someone must hope to sell them but not in cornwall i dare say at least not locally where they could be tracked down perhaps in bodmin or exeter or even in london and if thats the case theyd have been taken last night during the party i should guess after john penellin was arrested things did tend to fall apart didnt they people were coming and going from the drawing room all the rest of the evening and not everyone was in the drawing room in the first place deborah said she thought of peter lynley and the cruelty of his toast at dinner what better person to want to hurt her than peter what better way to get at tommy than by hurting her st james looked at his watch you ought to get helen and deborah to the train he told lynley theres no real point to their remaining is there we can deal with the cameras ourselves thats best lady helen agreed i suddenly find myself absolutely longing for the soot and grime of london my dears she walked towards the door briefly grasping st james hand as she passed him when st james started to follow her lynley spoke simon forgive me i have no excuse except your brother and john penellin exhaustion and worry it doesnt matter tommy it does i feel a perfect fool st james shook his head but his face was drawn its nothing please forget it he left the room st james heard rather than saw his sister yawning in the dining room doorway what an evening she said as she padded into the room and joined him at the table she rested her head in one hand reached for his pot of coffee and poured herself a cup which she sugared with an air that combined liberality with general indifference as if she hadnt bothered to look out of the window prior to dressing for the day she wore bright blue shorts profusely decorated with coruscating silver stars and a halter top offensive after dinner toasts visits from the police an arrest on the spot its a wonder we lived to tell the tale she eyed the line of covered serving dishes on the sideboard shrugged them off as possibly too troublesome a venture and instead took a slice of bacon from her brothers plate this she placed on a piece of his toast sid hm she pulled part of the newspaper towards her whatre you reading st james didnt reply hed been going through the spokesman and he wanted a moment to evaluate what hed read it was a village paper its contents comprising mostly village news and no matter the intensity or importance of mick cambreys association with the spokesman st james found that he couldnt reasonably attribute the mans murder to what he was reading in this local journal the news items ran the gamut from a recent wedding held on the quay at lamorna cove to the conviction of a bagsnatcher from penzance to the innovations developed on a dairy farm not far from st buryan there was coverage of the nanrunnel production of much ado about nothing including a profile of the girl who played hero sports news consisted of an article on a local tennis match and whoever covered the crime beat had managed to unearth only a road accident involving a rightofway dispute between a lorry driver and a cow just the editorial page held promise and even here that promise was directed more towards the future of the paper than to a motive for mick cambreys murder the page held two opinion columns and seven letters the first column had been written by cambrey an articulate piece on stemming the tide of weapons being run into northern ireland julianna vendale had composed the second column on national child care the letters which came from both nanrunnel and penzance residents dealt with previous columns on village expansion and on the local secondary schools declining o level results all of this reflected mick cambreys efforts to make the newspaper something more than a village gossipsheet but none of it seemed to have content likely to provoke a murder st james reflected upon the fact that harry cambrey believed his son had been working on a story that would have been the making of the spokesman ostensibly without confiding his intentions to his father mick had planned that this story would reach a wider audience than was available in this remote area of cornwall thus st james wondered if cambrey could have discovered that his son was spending time money and effort away from the spokesman all for something that wouldnt benefit the newspaper at all and if cambrey had discovered that how would he have reacted to the news would he have struck out in anger as he had done once before in the newspaper office every question concerning the murder revolved round a decision between premeditation and passion the fact that there had been an argument suggested passion as did the mutilation of the body but other details the condition of the sitting room the missing money suggested premeditation and even an autopsy would probably not generate a definitive distinction between the two where is everyone this morning sidney got up from the table and took her coffee to one of the windows where she curled onto a velvetcovered bench what a dreary day its going to rain tommys taken deborah and helen to catch the train for london ive not seen anyone else justin and i ought to be off as well i suppose hes got work tomorrow have you seen him not this morning st james was no mourner for that fact he was finding that the less he saw of brooke the better he liked it he could only hope that his sister would come to her senses soon and clear her life of the man perhaps ill rout him from his room sidney said but she made no move to do so and she was still sipping coffee and gazing out of the window when lady asherton joined them the fact that she had not come in for breakfast was evident in her choice of clothing she wore blue jeans rolled above her ankles a mans white cotton shirt and a baseball cap she was carrying a pair of heavy gardening gloves which she slapped into her palm emphatically here you are simon good she said will you come with me a moment its about deborahs cameras have you found them st james asked found them sidney repeated blankly has deb lost her cameras on top of everything else she shook her head darkly and returned to the table where she took up the part of the paper which her brother had been reading in the garden lady asherton said and led st james outside where a salty wind was fast delivering an angrylooking bank of grey clouds from the sea one of the gardeners was waiting for them at the furthest point of the houses south wing he stood opposite a beech tree secateurs in his hand and a worn woollen cap pulled low on his brow he nodded when st james and lady asherton joined him and he directed st james attention to the large yew bush that abutted the house dead pity that the gardener said she be right damaged poor thing deborahs room is just above lady asherton said st james looked at the plant and saw that the portion of the yew nearest the house had been destroyed its growth split broken and torn off completely by an object which had most likely been dropped from above the damage was recent all the breakage fresh the distinct scent of conifer rose from the mangled branches st james stepped back and looked up at the windows deborahs room was directly above the billiard room beneath it both were far removed from the dining and drawing rooms where the party had gathered on the previous evening and as far as he knew noone had played billiards so noone would have been witness to the noise which the camera case must have made as it crashed to the ground lady asherton spoke quietly as the gardener went back to his work clipping off the ruined branches and stowing them in a plastic rubbish sack tucked under his arm theres a margin of relief in all this simon at least we know noone from the house took the cameras why do you say that it hardly makes sense that one of us would take them and drop them outside far easier to hide them in ones room and slip off with them later wouldnt you agree easier yes but not as wise especially if someone inside the house wanted to make it look as if an outsider took the cameras in the first place but even thats not a wise plan because who were the technical outsiders last night mr and mrs sweeney dr trenarrow your sisterinlaw the mp from plymouth john penellin she added the daily help from the village an unlikely lot to be stealing cameras from her expression he could tell that lady asherton had already done some considerable thinking about deborahs cameras about where they might be about who had taken them her words however acted to camouflage this im having difficulty understanding why they were stolen in the first place theyre valuable they can be sold by someone who needs money her face crumpled momentarily then regained composure st james showed mercy by saying the house was open during the party someone could have got in while we were in the dining room it would have been no large matter to slip up to deborahs room and take the cameras then but why take the cameras at all simon if its a matter of money why not take something else something even more valuable what he asked everything else is too easily associated with howenstow the silvers marked the family crest is on everything surely you wouldnt expect someone to cart off one of the paintings and hope it wouldnt be noticed as missing until the next day she turned her head to look out at the park a movement designed merely to avert her face for a moment it cant be a question of money she said twisting her gardening gloves in her hands it cant simon you do know that then perhaps mrs sweeney objected to having her photograph taken after all he suggested she smiled bleakly at that but went along with his effort to divert her could she have slipped out to the loo some time after dinner and trundled through the house looking for deborahs room her question brought them back to the inescapable reality whoever had taken the cameras had also known which room was deborahs has tommy spoken to peter this morning st james asked peters not up yet he vanished after dinner daze i know and do you know where he went where sasha went she shook her head a walk in the grounds down to the cove for a drive perhaps to the lodge to see mark penellin she sighed the effort seemed too much i cant believe hes taken deborahs cameras hes sold most of his own things i know that i pretend not to but i know it still i dont believe hed actually steal things and sell them not peter i wont believe that a shout rose from the park as she finished speaking someone was coming towards the house at a hobbling run a man who alternately clutched his side then his thigh with one hand while with the other he waved a cap in the air all the time he continued to shout jasper mlady the gardener said joining them with his rubbish sack trailing behind him whatever is he up to as he reached the gatehouse lady asherton raised her voice stop shouting like that jasper youre frightening us all to death jasper dashed to her side wheezing and gasping he seemed unable to gather enough breath to put together a coherent sentence tis im he panted down the cove lady asherton looked at st james they shared the same thought lady asherton took a step away to distance herself from information she couldnt bear to hear who st james asked jasper whos at the cove jasper bent double coughed n the cove for heavens sake jasper straightened looked around and pointed an arthritic finger at the front door where sidney stood apparently seeking the source of the disturbance er man he gasped he be dead down the cove when st james finally caught up with her his sister had already reached the cove far in advance of everyone else somewhere in her desperate flight through the park and the woodland she had fallen and blood streaked in a furcate pattern down one arm and along one leg from the clifftop he saw her fling herself at brookes body snatching him up as if by that action she could infuse him with life she was speaking in an incoherent fashion inarticulate words not sentences as she held his body to hers brookes head hung in an impossible position testimony to the manner in which he had died sidney lowered him to the ground she opened his mouth covering it with her own in a useless attempt at resuscitation even from the clifftop st james could hear her small frantic cries as each breath she gave him produced no response she pounded on his chest she pulled open his shirt she threw herself the length of his body and pressed against him as if to arouse him in death as she had done in life it was a mindless grim mimicry of seduction st james grew cold as he watched he said her name then called to her to no avail finally she looked up the face of the cliff and saw him she stretched out one hand as if in supplication and at last she began to cry it was a horrible ululation part despair and part grief a weeping the source of which was as primordial as it was timeless she covered brookes bruised face with kisses before she lowered her head and rested it on his chest and she wept in sorrow in anger in rage she grabbed the body by the shoulders lifted and shook it as she shouted brookes name in reply the lifeless head bobbed ghoulishly on its splintered neck in a danse macabre st james stood motionless forcing himself to keep his eyes on his sister making himself a witness to the worst part of her grief accepting the watching as punishment just and true for the sin of possessing a body so ruined that it would not allow him to go to her aid immobilized and inwardly cursing with a rising ferocity that was fast approaching panic he listened to sidneys keening wail he swung round viciously at the touch of a hand on his arm lady asherton stood there behind her the gardener and half a dozen others from the house get her away from him he barely managed the words but his speaking released the rest of them into action with a final worried look at his face lady asherton began a nimble descent of the cliff the others followed carrying blankets a makeshift stretcher a thermos a coil of rope although they all climbed down quickly it seemed to st james that they moved in slow motion in the manner of mimes three of them reached sidney simultaneously and lady asherton pulled her away from the body which she continued to shake with a wild futility as sidney fought to go back to it beginning to scream lady asherton shouted something over her shoulder which st james could not distinguish in answer one of the men handed her an open vial she pulled sidney to her grabbed her by the hair and thrust the vial under her nose sidneys head flew back her hand went to her mouth she spoke brokenly to lady asherton who in answer pointed up the cliff sidney began to climb the gardener helped her then the others from the house all of them saw that she neither stumbled nor fell and within a few moments st james was pulling her fiercely into his arms he held her pressing his cheek to the top of her head and fighting back an emotional reaction of his own that promised to overwhelm him if he gave it free rein when the worst of her weeping had subsided he began to lead her in the direction of the house both his arms round her somehow afraid that if he released her he would be giving her back to hysteria back to the body of her lover on the beach they passed under the trees of the woodland st james was hardly aware of the progress they made nor was he aware of the rushing sound of the river the rich scent of vegetation the springy feel of the loamy ground beneath their feet if his clothing was caught or snagged by the bushes that encroached upon the narrow path he took no notice the air had grown quite heavy with an approaching storm by the time they reached the howenstow wall and went through the gate the tree leaves susurrated as the swelling wind tossed them and up the trunk of one ash a grey squirrel scampered disappearing into its branches for shelter sidney raised her head from her brothers chest itll rain she said simon hell get wet st james tightened his arms he kissed the top of her head no its all right he attempted to sound more like the older brother she knew the one who had taken care of her nighttime monsters the one who could make bad dreams go away but not this one sid theyll take care of him youll see large heavy drops splattered noisily on the leaves in his arms sidney shivered how mummy shouted at us she whispered shouted when you opened all the nursery windows to see how much rain would come into the room she shouted and shouted she hit you as well her body heaved with a sob i never could bear to see mummy hit you the carpet was ruined no doubt i deserved it but it was my idea and i let you take the punishment she brought her hand to her face blood had streaked between her fingers she began to weep again tm sorry he stroked her hair its all right love id quite forgotten believe me how could i do that to you simon you were my favourite brother i loved you best nanny told me how bad it was to love you more than andrew or david but i couldnt help it i loved you best then i let you take a beating and it was my fault and i never said a word her raised face was wet with tears that st james knew in reality had nothing to do with their childhood disputes let me tell you something sid he confided but you must promise never to say anything to david or andrew you were my favourite as well you still are in fact really absolutely they came to the gatehouse and entered the garden as the wind picked up tearing at the heads of roses sending a shower of petals into their path although the rain began to beat against them aggressively they didnt hurry their pace by the time they reached the doorway they were both quite wet mummy will shout at us now sidney said as st james closed the door behind them shall we hide well be safe enough for now ill not let her beat you i know that sid st james led his sister towards the stairway taking her hand when she hesitated and gazed around clearly confused its just this way he urged her at the top of the stairs he saw cotter coming towards him a small tray in his hands at the sight of him st james gave a moment of thanksgiving over to cotters ability to read his mind saw you comin cotter explained and nodded at the tray its a brandy is she he jerked his head towards sidney his brow furrowing at the sight of her shell be all right in a bit if youll help me cotter her rooms this way unlike deborahs room sidneys was neither cavelike nor sepulchral overlooking a small walled garden at the rear of the house it was painted and papered in a combination of yellow and white with a floral carpet of pastels on the floor st james sat his sister on the bed and went to draw the curtains while cotter poured brandy and held it to her lips a bit o this miss sidney cotter said solicitously itll warm you up nice she drank cooperatively does mummy know she asked cotter glanced warily at st james have a bit more he said st james rooted through a drawer looking for her nightdress he found it under a sidneylike pile of jerseys jewellery and stockings you must get out of those wet things he told her cotter will you find a towel for her hair and something for the cuts cotter nodded eyeing sidney cautiously before he left the room alone with his sister st james undressed her tossing her wet clothes onto the floor he drew her nightdress over her head pulling her arms gently through the thin satin straps she said nothing and didnt seem to realize he was present at all when cotter returned with towel and plaster st james rubbed sidneys hair roughly he saw to her arms and legs and the muddy splatters on her feet swinging her legs up on the bed he pulled the blankets around her she submitted to it all like a child like a doll sid he whispered touching her cheek he wanted to talk about justin brooke he wanted to know if they had been together in the night he wanted to know when brooke had gone to the cliff above all he wanted to know why she didnt respond she stared at the ceiling whatever she knew would have to wait lynley parked the rover at the far end of the courtyard and entered the house through the northwest door between the gun room and the servants hall he had seen the line of vehicles on the drive two police cars an unmarked saloon and an ambulance with its windscreen wipers still running so he was not unprepared to be accosted by hodge as he quickly passed through the domestic wing of the house they met outside the pantry what is it lynley asked the old butler he tried to sound reasonably concerned without revealing his incipient panic upon seeing the cars through the winddriven rain his first thought had run unveeringly towards peter hodge gave the information willingly enough and in a fashion designed to reveal nothing of his own feelings in the matter it was mr brooke he told lynley hes been taken to the old schoolroom if the manner in which hodge had relayed the information had been fleeting cause for hope nothing could be terribly amiss if brooke hadnt been taken directly to hospital hope dissipated when lynley entered the schoolroom in the east wing of the house a few minutes later the body lay shrouded by blankets on a long scarred table at the rooms centre the very same table at which generations of young lynleys had done their childhood lessons before being packed off to school a group of men stood in hushed conversation round it among them inspector boscowan and the plainclothes sergeant who had accompanied him to pick up john penellin on the previous evening boscowan was talking to the group in general issuing some son of instructions to two crimescene men whose trouser legs were muddy and whose jacket shoulders bore large wet patches from the rain the police pathologist was with them identifiable by the medical bag at her feet it was unopened and she didnt look as if she intended to do any preliminary examining of the body nor did the crimescene men seem prepared to do any work at present which led lynley to the only conclusion possible wherever brooke had died it hadnt been in the schoolroom he saw st james standing in one of the window embrasures giving his attention to what could be seen of the garden through the rainstreaked glass jasper found him in the cove st james spoke quietly when lynley joined him he did not turn away from the window his own clothes had had a recent wetting lynley saw and his shirt bore streaks of blood which the rain had elongated like a waterwash of paint it looks like an accident it seems there was slippage at the top of the cliff he lost his footing he looked past lynleys shoulder at the group round the body then back at lynley once again at least thats what boscowans considering for now st james didnt ask the question that lynley heard behind the final guarded statement lynley was grateful for the respite however long his friend intended it to be he said why was the body moved st james who moved it why your mother it had begun to rain sid got to him before the rest of us im afraid none of us was thinking too clearly at that moment least of all myself a yew branch struck by a gust of wind scratched against the window in front of them rain created a sharp tattoo st james moved further into the embrasure and lifted his eyes to the upper floor of the wing opposite the schoolroom to the corner bedroom next to lynleys own wheres peter the respite had been brief indeed lynley felt the sudden need to lie to protect his brother in some way but he couldnt do it nor could he say what drove him to the truth whether it was priggish morality or an unspoken plea for the other mans help and understanding hes gone sasha as well where i dont know st james reaction was a single word sighed more than spoken great then how long was his bed slept in last night was hers no lynley didnt add that hed seen as much at halfpast seven this morning when hed gone to speak to his brother he didnt tell him that hed sent jasper out to search for peter at a quarter to eight nor did he describe the horror hed felt seeing the police cars and ambulance lined up in front of howenstow thinking peter had been found dead and recognizing in his reaction to that thought a small measure of relief behind the dread he saw st james reflectively considering brookes covered body peter had nothing to do with this he said it was an accident you said that yourself i wonder whether peter knew that brooke spoke to us last night st james said would brooke have told him so and if he did why lynley recognized the speculation that drove the questions it was the very same speculation he was facing himself peters not a killer you know that then youd better find him killer or not he has a bit of explaining to do hasnt he jaspers been out looking for him since early this morning i did wonder what hed been doing at the cove he thought peter was there there at the mill hes been looking everywhere off the estate as well are peters things still here i no lynley knew st james well enough to see the reasoning that came upon the heels of his answer if peter had run from howenstow with no time to lose knowing his life was in danger hed be likely to leave his belongings behind if on the other hand he had left after committing a murder that he knew wouldnt be discovered for some hours hed have plenty of time to pack whatever possessions hed brought with him to howenstow that done he could steal off into the night with noone the wiser until brookes body was found if he had killed him if brooke had been murdered at all lynley forced himself to keep in mind the fact that they were calling it an accident and surely the crimescene men knew what they were looking at when they made their observations at the site of an untimely death earlier in the morning the thought of peter having stolen deborahs cameras in order to sell them and purchase cocaine had been repellent a cause for disbelief and denial now it was welcome for how likely was it that his brother had been involved in both the disappearance of the cameras and justin brookes death and if his mind was focused on his bodys need for cocaine why pause in his pursuit of the drug to eliminate brooke he knew the answer of course but that answer tied peter to mick cambreys death a death that noone was calling an accident well be taking the body now the plainclothes sergeant had come to join them in spite of the rain he smelt heavily of sweat and his forehead was oily with perspiration with your permission lynley nodded sharply in acquiescence and longed for liquor to soothe his nerves as if in answer the schoolroom doors opened and his mother entered pushing a drinks trolley on which shed assembled two urns three full decanters of spirits and several plates of biscuits her blue jeans and shoes were stained with mud her white shirt torn her hair dishevelled but as if her appearance were the least of her concerns when she spoke she took command of the situation i dont pretend to know your regulations inspector she told boscowan but it does seem reasonable that you might be allowed something to take the edge off the chill coffee tea brandy whisky whatever youd like please help yourselves boscowan nodded his thanks and having received this much permission his officers occupied themselves at the trolley boscowan strolled over to lynley and st james was he a drinker my lord i didnt know him that well but he was drinking last night we all were drunk he didnt appear to be not when i last saw him and when was that when the party broke up round midnight perhaps a bit later where in the drawing room drinking yes but not drunk he could have been i dont know he wasnt acting drunk lynley recognized the intention behind the questions if brooke had been drunk he fell to his death if he had been sober he was pushed but lynley felt the need to excuse the death as an accident whatever brookes condition last night drunk or sober hed never been here before he wasnt familiar with the lie of the land boscowan nodded but nothing in his manner suggested conviction no doubt the postmortem will tell the tale it was dark the cliffs high dark if the man went out in the night boscowan said he could have done so this morning how was he dressed boscowans shoulders lifted a partial acknowledgement of the accuracy of lynleys question in his evening clothes but noones to say he wasnt up until dawn with one member of the party or another until we have a time of death we can be certain of nothing except the fact that hes dead and were certain of that he nodded and joined his men by the trolley a thousand and one questions hes not asking st james lynley said the other man listed them who saw him last has anyone else gone missing from the estate who was here at the party who else was in the grounds is there any reason why someone might want to harm him why isnt he asking hes waiting for the postmortem i should guess its to his advantage that this be an accident why because hes got his man for cambreys murder and john penellin couldnt have killed brooke youre implying theres a connection there is there must be a blur of movement on the drive outside caught their attention jasper st james noted the old man was trudging through puddles heading towards the west wing of the house lets see what he has to say lynley said they found him just outside the servants hall where he was shaking the rain off a battered souwester he did the same to an antique mackintosh and hung both on a wall peg before he struggled out of dark green gumboots that were caked with mud he nodded curdy at lynley and st james and when he was quite ready followed them back to the smoking room where he accepted a whisky to ward off the cold nowheres to be found he told lynley but r boats gone from lamorna cove its what lynley said jasper are you certain course i be certain taint there lynley stared at the fox on the overmantel and tried to understand but all that came to mind were details they refused to coalesce the familys thirtyfivefoot sloop was docked at lamorna peter had been sailing since he was five years old the weather had been promising a storm all day noone with any sense or experience would have taken a boat out it must have broken loose of its mooring somehow jasper made a sound of derision but his face was blank when lynley swung towards him again where else did you check everplace tween nanrunnel and treen trewoofe st buryan did you go inland aye a bit no need t go far mlord if the lad be on foot someones like to see him but noone makes the claim jasper pulled on his jaw rubbing his fingers through the stubble of his beard way i see either him and the ladys in hiding round here or they got a ride direct soons they left howenstow or they took the boat he wouldnt have done it he knows better than that hes not entirely lynley stopped there was no need for jasper to hear the worst of his fears no doubt the man knew every one of them already thank you jasper make sure you get something to eat the old man nodded and headed straight for the door he paused at the threshold however john penellin got took last night i hear yes he did jaspers mouth worked as if he wished to say more but was hesitant to do so what is it lynley asked he oughtnt take blame for nobody you ask me jasper said and left them what more does jasper know st james asked when they were alone lynley was staring at the carpet lost in thought he roused himself to say nothing i should guess its just what he feels about john yes peter as well if theres guilt to be assessed jasper knows where it should lie lynley had never felt so incapable of either action or decision it seemed as if his life were spinning out of control and all he could do was watch the various pieces fly haphazardly into space all he could say was he wouldnt take the boat not in this weather where would he go and why he heard st james move and looked up to see the compassion on his face perhaps hes still somewhere on the estate tommy perhaps he doesnt even know whats happened and his disappearance is altogether unconnected to justin brooke and to the cameras to those as well lynley looked away to the pictures on the wall all those generations of lynleys who fitted the mould did their crewing at oxford and took their places at howenstow without a single howl of protest i dont believe that st james not for a moment do you his friend sighed frankly no heavens to what depths have we managed to slither lady helen said she dropped her suitcase sighed and let her handbag dangle forlornly from her fingertips lunching at paddington station behaviour so utterly reprehensible that i can hardly believe i allowed myself to engage in it it was your suggestion after all helen deborah set her own luggage on the floor and looked round the bedsitting room with a smile of contentment it felt unaccountably good to be home even if home was only a single room in paddington at least it was her own i plead utter guilt but when one is in the absolute throes of starvation when demise is the probable consequence of even a moments epicurean snobbery what is one to do but rush madly towards the first cafeteria that comes into sight she shuddered as if stricken by the recollection of what shed found heaped upon her luncheon plate can you imagine a more despicable thing to do to a sausage deborah laughed would you like a restorative a cup of tea ive even got a recipe for a health drink you might like tina gave it to me a pickmeup she called it no doubt picked up is just what she needed after an encounter with mick cambrey if his fathers to be believed lady helen said but ill forgo that pleasure for now if i may shall we pop next door with his picture deborah pulled it from her shoulder bag and led the way the corridor was narrow lined with doors on both sides and the floor gave off the sharp scent of a carpet that was relatively new it also served to muffle their footsteps and as if this damper upon their approach encouraged other caution deborah rapped upon tinas door softly tinas well shes a night owl i suppose she explained to lady helen so she may not be up yet that appeared to be the case as deborahs knocking brought no response she tried a second time a bit louder and then a third calling tina in answer the door opposite opened and an elderly woman peered out she wore a large checked handkerchief over her head tied under her chin like a babushka it served to cover her hair which was tightly pinned in what appeared to be an infinitesimal number of grey curls shes not ere the woman clutched to her chest a thin purple dressinggown printed in a design of hideous orange flowers and palmate green leaves that were enough to make one eschew travelling in the tropics for ever been gone two days how distressing lady helen said do you know where shes gone id like to know wouldnt i the woman said shes borrowed my iron and i could do with it back no doubt lady helen said with complete sympathy as if the womans manner of dress in the middle of the afternoon deshabillé with a vengeance had been provoked solely by the loss of her iron shall i see if i can get it for you she turned to deborah who manages the building theres a caretaker on the ground floor deborah said and added in a low voice but helen you cant then ill pop down directly shall i she fluttered her fingers and walked to the lift the old woman watched their exchange suspiciously she eyed deborah from head to toe nervously deborah smiled trying to think of a casual remark about the building the weather or anything else that might keep the woman from wondering why lady helen was so charmingly intent upon fetching an iron for a complete stranger she gave up the effort when nothing came to mind retreating to her own flat where lady helen joined her in less than ten minutes in victorious possession of the key to tinas door deborah was astonished how on earth did you manage it lady helen laughed dont you think i look the smallest bit like tinas only sister come all the way from edinburgh to spend a few days catching up on sororal chitchat you convinced him of that it was such a performance i almost convinced myself shall we they returned to the flat deborah felt a bit weak at the thought of what lady helen clearly proposed to do this cant be legal she said arent we breaking and entering entering perhaps lady helen replied cheerfully as she inserted the key in the lock without the slightest hesitation but hardly breaking after all weve got the key ah here we are and not even a squeak to alert the neighbours i am the neighbours lady helen laughed how convenient the flat was identical in size and shape to deborahs although it contained more furniture each piece an indication of considerable expense no chintzcovered threepiece suite for tina cogin no secondhand tables no cheap prints on the walls instead gleaming hardwoods filled the room oak and mahogany rosewood and birch beneath them lay a handloomed rug while above them a tapestry on the wall had the look of having been crafted by an experienced artisan clearly the rooms occupant had a penchant for luxury well lady helen said as she looked all this over there must be something to be said for her line of work ah theres the iron lets not forget to take that with us when we leave helen arent we leaving now in a moment darling first just a peep here and there to get a feeling of the woman but we cant well want something to tell simon when we phone him deborah as things stand now if tinas not back by evening well have nothing to report but a knock gone unanswered at her door what a waste of everybodys energy that would be what if she walks in on us helen really every moment anticipating tinas return and wondering what on earth they would say to her when she walked in the door and found them making fast and loose with her belongings deborah followed lady helen into the tiny kitchen and watched in an agony of nerves as she blithely opened the cupboards there were only two both containing the barest necessities in the smallest sizes available coffee salt sugar condiments a packet of savoury biscuits a tin of soup another of grapefruit segments another of cereal on one shelf sat two plates two bowls two cups and four glasses on the worktop beneath was a bottle of wine previously opened and twothirds full beyond a small tin coffee pot a dented pan and an enamel kettle the kitchen contained nothing else and even what there was provided little enough information about tina cogin herself lady helen summed it up she doesnt seem to cook her meals here does she of course there are dozens of takeaways in praed street so i suppose she could be bringing food in but if she entertains men thats the question isnt it well theres the bottle of wine perhaps thats all the entertainment she provides before she and her caller get down to business lets see what else we have lady helen crossed to the wardrobe and pulled it open to reveal a row of evening and cocktail dresses half a dozen wraps one of which was fur with an array of highheeled pumps lined beneath them a top shelf held a collection of hatboxes a middle shelf contained a stack of folded negligees the bottom shelf was empty but it had collected no dust giving the impression that something had been kept there regularly lady helen tapped her cheek and gave a quick inspection to the chest of drawers ust her underclothes she told deborah after a cursory glance inside they appear to be silk but i shall draw the line at fingering my way through them she pushed the drawers closed and leaned against the chest arms crossed in front of her frowning at the wardrobe deborah theres something just a moment let me see she went into the bathroom and called out behind her why dont you have a go with the desk the medicine cabinet opened a drawer scraped against wood a catch clicked paper rustled lady helen murmured to herself deborah looked at her watch less than five minutes had passed since theyd entered the flat it felt like an hour she went to the desk nothing was on its top save a telephone an answering machine and a pad of paper which deborah feeling ridiculously like a celluloid detective yet all the time lacking any better idea of what to do with herself held up to the light to check for the indentations that previous writing might have made seeing nothing save the single pressurepoint of a full stop or the dot of an i she went on to the drawers but found two of them empty the third held a savings passbook a manila folder and a solitary index card deborah picked this up odd lady helen said from the bathroom doorway shes been gone two days according to your neighbour but shes left all her makeup behind shes taken none of her evening clothes but every ordinary garment she owns is missing and theres a set of those dreadful fingernail tips in the bathroom the kind one glues on why on earth would she take her fingernails off theyre such hell to put on in the first place perhaps theyre spares deborah said perhaps shes gone to the country she might be somewhere she wont need fancy clothes where artificial fingernails would get in the way the lake district fishing in scotland to see relatives on a farm deborah saw where her trail of ideas was leading lady helen completed it to cornwall she said and nodded at the index card what have you there deborah examined it two telephone numbers perhaps one is mick cambreys shall i copy them do lady helen came to look over her shoulder im beginning to admire her here i am so attached to my appearance that i wouldnt even consider venturing anywhere without at least one vanity case crammed to the brim with cosmetics and there she is the allornothing woman either casual to a fault or dressed to lady helen faltered deborah looked up her mouth felt dry helen she couldnt have killed him yet even as she said it her discomfort grew what after all did she know about tina nothing really beyond a single conversation which had revealed little more than a weakness for men an affinity for nightlife and a concern about ageing still one could certainly sense evil in people no matter their attempts to disguise it one could certainly sense the potential for rage and none of that had been present in tina yet as she considered mick cambreys death and the very fact of his presence in tina cogins life deborah had to admit that she wasnt so sure she reached blindly for the folder as if it contained a verification of tinas lack of guile prospects was printed across the tab inside a clip held together a sheaf of papers what is it lady helen asked names and addresses telephone numbers her client list i shouldnt think so look there are at least a hundred names women as well as men a mailing list i suppose it might be theres a savings book as well deborah slid this out of its plastic folder tell all lady helen said is her lifestyle profitable shall i change my line of work deborah read the list of deposits flipped back to the name she felt a rush of surprise this isnt hers she said it belongs to mick cambrey and whatever he was doing it was wildly profitable mr allcourtst james this isa pleasure dr alice waters rose from her chair and shooed off the lab assistant who had shown st james to her office i thought i recognized you at howenstow this morning hardly the time for introductions however what brings you to my den it was an apt choice of words for the office of penzance cids forensic pathologist was little more than a windowless cubicle on the verge of being overcome by bookshelves an ancient rolltop desk a medicalschool skeleton wearing a second world war gas mask and several stacks of scientific journals all that remained of the floorspace was a trail that led from the doorway to the desk a chair sat next to this curiously out of place and intricately carved in a design of flowers and birds that was more suggestive of a country house dining room than a department of forensic pathology and after offering st james her hand in a cool firm shake she waved him into it take the throne she said circa it was a good period for chairs if one doesnt mind a bit of excessive ornamentation youre a collector takes ones mind off the job she sank into her own chair a piece of wounded leather whose surface was cracked and wrinkled and rooted through the papers on her desk until she found a small carton of chocolates which she presented to him when he had made his selection a process she watched with a good deal of interest she took a chocolate herself biting into it with the satisfaction of a discerning gourmet just read your piece on abo secretors last week she said i hardly thought id be having the pleasure of meeting you as well have you come about this howenstow business the cambrey death actually behind her largeframed spectacles dr waters eyebrows rose she finished her chocolate wiped her fingers on the lapel of her lab coat and took a folder from beneath an african violet that looked as if it hadnt been watered in months not the smallest indication of activity for weeks and suddenly ive two corpses on my hands in less than fortyeight hours she flipped the folder open read for a moment then snapped it shut she reached for a skull which grinned at them from one of the bookshelves and dislodged a paper clip from its eye socket it had obviously been a demonstration piece in many previous explanations for pen marks dotted it liberally and a large red xhad at one time been drawn directly upon the squamosal suture two blows to the head he took the more severe of the two here on the parietal region a fracture resulted have you any idea of the weapon i wouldnt say weapon so much as source he fell against something he couldnt have been struck she took another chocolate shaking her head and pointing to the skull look at where the fracture would be my good man he wasnt overly tall between fiveeight and fivenine but hed have to be sitting for anyone to hit him there with enough force to kill him someone creeping up on him couldnt have happened the blow didnt come from above even if it had to have placed a blow there the killer would have had to stand in such a way that cambrey would have seen him in his peripheral vision he would have made an attempt to block the blow in some way and wed have evidence on the body bruising or abrasions but weve neither the killer may have been too fast for him she turned the skull possibly but that wouldnt explain the second blow another fracture less severe in the right frontal region for your scenario the killer would have hit him in the back of the head asked him kindly to turn round then hit him in the front are we talking about an accident then cambrey stumbling on his own failing and then later someone coming to the cottage finding the body and mutilating it for the sheer enjoyment of castration hardly she replaced the skull and leaned back in her chair the light from the ceiling winked against her spectacles and shone in her hair which was short straight and artificially blueblack heres the scenario as ive worked it out cambreys standing having a conversation with the killer it grows into an argument he takes a tremendous blow on the jaw there was heavy bruising of the submaxilla and that was the only significant bruising on the body which sends him falling back against an object perhaps four and a half feet from the floor st james thought about the sitting room in gull cottage he knew dr waters had been there herself she would have done a preliminary examination of the body there on friday night and no matter ones determination to wait for postmortem results before formulating an opinion she would have begun developing ideas the moment she saw the corpse the mantel she cocked an affirmative finger at him cambreys weight increases the velocity of his fall the result is our first fracture from the mantel then he falls again but slightly to the side this time and he hits the front region of his skull on another object the hearth most likely this second fracture is less severe but it makes no difference he died within moments because of the first intracranial haemorrhage he couldnt have been saved the mutilation was done after death of course st james said reflectively there was virtually no blood a mess nonetheless dr waters commented poetically st james tried to picture the events as dr waters had laid them out the conversation the escalation into argument the evolution of anger to rage the blow itself how long would you estimate the mutilation took if someone were in a frenzy running to the kitchen finding a knife perhaps with a knife already there was no frenzy involved depend upon that at least not when the mutilation occurred he saw that she recognized his confusion she answered as if in anticipation of his questions people in frenzies tend to hack and stab over and over you know the sort of thing sixtyfive wounds we see that all the time but in this case it was just a couple of quick cuts as if the killer had nothing more in mind than making a statement on cambreys body with what sort of weapon she lingered over her box of chocolates again her hand hesitated before pushing them aside with a look that combined both regret and determination anything sharp from a butchers knife to a pair of good scissors but youve found no weapon yet forensic are still working through the cottage imaginative lot they are testing everything from kitchen knives to the safety pins used on the babys nappies theyre tearing apart the village as well looking in dustbins and flower gardens busy earning their salaries its a waste of time why she flipped a thumb back and forth over her shoulder as she answered his question quite as if they were standing in the village and not several miles away in penzance we have the hills behind us we have the sea in front of us we have a coastline honeycombed with thousands of caves we have disused mines we have a harbour filled with fishing boats we have in short an infinite number of places in which one could deposit a knife with noones being the wiser for decades as to how it got there just think of the fishermens fillet knives how many of those must be lying about so the killer might even have gone prepared to do this bit of work might might not weve no way of telling and cambrey hadnt been tied up according to forensic nothing indicates that no fragments of hemp nylon or anything else he was very fit actually as to the other the howenstow business this morning thats appearing to be quite another matter drugs st james asked she looked immediately interested i couldnt say weve only done the preliminaries is there something cocaine she made a note to herself on a pad of paper not surprising that what people put into their bodies in the name of excitement silly fools she gave a moment over to what was apparently a dark consideration of drug use in the country rousing herself she went on weve done a bloodalcohol on him he was drunk capable of functioning impaired but capable enough to get out there and take a tumble four vertebrae were broken spinal cord was severed she removed her spectacles and rubbed the bridge of her nose where they rested upon skin that was red and raw without them she looked curiously defenceless and somehow unmasked had he lived hed have been a quadriplegic so i wonder if we say he was lucky to have died her glance dropped unconsciously to st james bad leg she pulled back fractionally into her chair im terribly sorry too many hours on the job lessthanperfect life versus no life at all it was always the question certainly one that st james had asked himself many times in the years since his accident he brushed off her apology by ignoring it altogether did he fall or was he pushed forensic are combing both the body and the clothing to see if he may have grappled with someone but as far as i can tell at the moment its a straightforward fall he was drunk he was at the top of a dangerous cliff time of death seems to be round one in the morning so it was dark and there was a heavy cloud cover last night as well id say an accidental fall is a safe conclusion how relieved lynley would be to hear that st james thought yet even as dr waters gave her opinion he felt tugged by a reluctance to accept it appearances suggested an accident to be sure but no matter the appearance of the death brookes presence at the clifftop in the middle of the night suggested a clandestine meeting that led to murder outside the dining room what had that morning been a summer storm was growing into a tempest with galeforce winds howling round the house and rain striking the windows in angry flurries the curtains were drawn so the noise was somewhat muted but an occasional blast shook the windows with enough force that they rattled ominously impossible to ignore when this happened st james found his thoughts torn from the death of mick cambrey and justin brooke and refastened upon the disappearance of the daze he knew that lynley had spent the remainder of the day in a futile search for his brother but the coastline was rugged and difficult to reach by land if peter had put the boat into a natural harbour somewhere to escape the worst of the storm lynley had not found him i didnt think to alter the menu lady asherton was saying in reference to the elaborate array of food with which they had been presented so much has been happening ive forgotten how to think straight there were supposed to be at least nine of us here ten if augusta had stayed its a blessing she went home last night had she been here this morning when jasper found the body she toyed with a spear of broccoli as if suddenly aware how disjointed her comments actually sounded candlelight and shadows played against the turquoise dress she wore and softened the lines of worry that with the advancing day had grown more prominent between her eyebrows and from her nose to her chin she hadnt mentioned peter since first being told he was gone people ave to eat daze and thats all there is to it cotter said although hed touched no more of his food than had the others but weve not much heart for it have we lady asherton smiled at cotter but her anxiety was palpable it showed itself in her quick movements in the fleeting glimpses she took of her older son who sat nearby lynley had been home only ten minutes prior to dinner he had spent that time in the estate office making phone calls st james knew he had not spoken to his mother about peter and he did not have the look of a man who intended to speak about peter now as if she realized this lady asherton said to st james hows sidney sleeping now she wants to go back to london in the morning is that wise st james lynley asked she doesnt appear to be willing to have it any other way will you go with her he shook his head fingered the stem of his wineglass and thought about his brief conversation with his sister just an hour ago mostly he thought about her refusal to speak of justin brooke dont ask me dont make me shed said all the time looking ill with her hair in soaked ringlets from a feverish dream icant i cant dont make me simon please she says shell do well enough taking the train up alone he said perhaps she wants to speak to his family have the police contacted them i dont know that he has any family i dont know much about him at all beyond the fact he added silently that im glad hes dead his conscience had demanded the admission all day ever since the moment when hed held his sister in his arms on the top of the cliff gazed down on brookes body and known a moment of exultation that had its roots in his need for revenge here was justice hed thought here was retribution perhaps the hand of reprisal had been momentarily stayed after brooke had attacked his sister on the beach but the savagery of his assault upon her had called for an accounting it had been made in full he was glad of it he was relieved that sidney was free of brooke at last and the strength of his relief so utterly foreign to what he had always believed was a civilized response to the death of another human being disquieted him he knew without a doubt that given the opportunity he himself could easily have done away with justin brooke at any rate he said i think its probably wise that she get away noones asked her to stay officially that is he saw that the others understood his meaning the police had not asked to speak with sidney as far as they were concerned brookes death was due to an accidental fall the others mulled over this piece of information as the diningroom door opened and hodge came into the room a telephone call for mr st james my lady hodge had a way of making announcements with an intonation that suggested nothing less than impending doom a phone call from fate hecate on the line its in the estate office lady helen clyde st james rose at once grateful for an excuse to be gone the atmosphere in the dining room was overhung with too many unspoken questions and scores of issues asking to be discussed but everyone seemed determined to avoid discussion preferring the growing tension to the risk of facing a potentially painful truth he followed the butler to the west wing of the house down the long corridor that led to the estate office a single light burned upon the desk creating a bright oval of illumination in the centre of which lay the telephone receiver he picked it up shes disappeared lady helen said when she heard his voice it looks as if shes taken herself off on a casual holiday because her ordinary clothes are gone but none of her dressy clothes and theres no suitcase in the flat you got inside sheer audacious fasttalking and the key was mine youve missed your calling helen darling i know conman extraordinaire it comes from spending my youth in finishing schools instead of university modern languages decorative arts dissembling and prevaricating i was certain it would all be useful some day no idea where shes gone shes left behind her makeup and her fingernails so her fingernails helen what sort of business is this she laughed and explained the artificial nails to him theyre not what one would wear to do a bit of hiking you see or mucking about or rock climbing sailing fishing that sort of thing so we think shes off in the country somewhere here in cornwall that was our first thought as well and weve come up with fairly solid evidence we think she has mick cambreys savings book with some rather hefty deposits made to his account by the way and weve found two telephone numbers ones for a london exchange we phoned it and got a recording for a place called islington ltd giving their business hours ill check into that in the morning and the other number its cornwall simon weve tried it twice and got no answer we thought it might be mick cambreys st james pulled an envelope from the side drawer of the desk did you try directory enquiries to compare it to cambreys number hes exdirectory im afraid let me give you the number perhaps you can do something more with it he jotted it down on the envelope shoved it into his pocket sids coming back to london tomorrow he told lady helen about justin brooke she listened in silence asking no questions and making no comment until he had completed the tale he left nothing out concluding with and now peters gone missing as well oh no she said dimly in the background st james could hear music playing softly a flute concerto it made him wish he were sitting in her drawing room in onslow square talking idly about nothing with nothing more on his mind than blood or fibre or hair analyses associated with people he did not know and would never meet she said poor tommy poor daze how are they holding up theyre coping and sid shes taken it badly will you see to her helen tomorrow night when shes back of course dont worry dont give it a thought she hesitated momentarily again the music came over the line delicate and elusive like a fragrance in the air then she said simon wishing didnt make it happen you know how well she knew him when i saw him on the beach when i knew that he was dead dont be so hard on yourself i could have killed him helen god knows i wanted to which of us can say weve never felt the same towards someone at some time it means nothing my dear you need some rest we all do its been a dreadful time he smiled at her tone mother sister loving friend he accepted the ephemeral absolution which she offered youre right of course so go to bed surely we can depend upon nothing else happening before morning lets hope so he replaced the receiver and stood for a moment watching the storm rain lashed the windows wind tore at the trees somewhere a door banged open and shut he left the office he considered climbing the southwest stairway to spend the rest of the evening in his room he felt drained of energy incapable of thought and unwilling to face the task of making polite conversation that deliberately avoided the topics foremost on everyones mind peter lynley sasha nifford where they were what they had done still he knew that lynley would be waiting to hear about lady helens call so he headed back towards the dining room voices drifting down the northwest corridor arrested his attention as he approached the kitchen near the servants hall jasper stood conversing with a ruggedlooking man who dripped water from a brimming souwester on to the floor seeing st james jasper motioned him over bobs found r boat he said broke up on cribba head its the daze all right the other man put in no mistakin er is anyone there dont appear to be anyone with er dont see how tis possible not in the shape she be in st james and lynley followed the fishermans rusty austin in the estate landrover their headlamps illuminated the havoc created by the continuing storm newly dismembered rhododendrons lined the drive round them a thick carpet of purple flowers which the vehicles crushed beneath their tyres a large sycamore branch sheered from a tree nearly bisected the road leaves and twigs hurtled in every direction while tremendous gusts of wind lashed pebbles from the drive and fired them like bullets against the cars at the lodge shutters banged angrily against the stone walls water streamed down eaves and gushed from rainpipes climbing roses ripped from their trellis lay in sodden heaps on the flagstones and the ground lynley braked the rover and mark penellin dashed out to join them framed in the doorway nancy cambrey watched a shawl clutched to her throat and the wind whipping her dress round her legs she shouted something that was lost in the gale lynley lowered his window a few inches as mark climbed into the cars rear seat any word of peter nancy caught the front door as the wind drove it against the wall over the sound of her voice came the babys thin faint wail shall i do something stay by the phone he shouted back i may need you to go on to the house to mother she nodded gave a wave and slammed the door home lynley shifted gears they lurched on to the drive through a pool of water and a bank of mud shes at cribba head mark penellin asked his hair was slicked back drenched from the rain according to what we know right now lynley replied whats happened to you mark tentatively touched his fingers to a fresh plaster above his right eyebrow abrasions covered his knuckles and the back of his hand he shook his head selfeffacingly i was trying to fix the shutters so the babyd stop crying nearly knocked myself out in the process he turned up the collar of his oilskin and buttoned it at the throat youre sure its the daze it seems to be and no word of peter none bloody fool mark took out a packet of cigarettes offering it to both lynley and st james when they refused he lit one for himself but only smoked for a minute before crushing it out youve not seen peter lynley asked not since friday afternoon at the cove st james glanced at the boy over his shoulder peter said he didnt see you then mark raised a brow winced touched the plaster there he saw me he replied and with a cautious look at lynley added maybe he forgot following the austin the rover crawled along the narrow lane aside from their vehicles lights and the occasional glimmer from a cottage or a farmhouse window the darkness was complete and the gloom in conjunction with the storm made the going slow water filmed the road hedgerows bent perilously towards the car their headlamps glared upon the torrential rain stopping twice to clear the road of debris they took fifty minutes to make what should have been a quarter of an hours drive outside treen they jolted over the uneven track to cribba head pulling the cars to a halt some twenty yards from the path that led down to penberth cove from the rear seat mark penellin handed lynley a fishermans oilskin which he pulled on over his worn grey guernsey youd best wait here st james even in the closed confines of the car lynley had to raise his voice to be heard over the wind and the roar of surf which pounded the shore below them the rover rocked ominously like a lightweight toy its a rough walk ill come as far as i can lynley nodded shoving open his door the three of them climbed out into the storm st james found that he had to use the entire weight of his body to shut his own door once mark penellin hopped out jesus the boy shouted some blow this he joined lynley in pulling ropes lifejackets and liferings out of the cars boot ahead of them the fisherman had left his headlamps burning and they illuminated the distance to the cliff sheets of rain drove through the arc of light angled by the bellowing wind the fisherman began to trudge through weeds which clung to his trousers he carried a coil of rope she be down in the cove he shouted over his shoulder as they approached some fifty yard from shore bow to stern northeast on the rocks most o the mast and yards s gone i fear bent into the wind which was not only fierce but also icy cold as if it took its inspiration from an arctic storm they struggled towards the cliffs edge there made slick and dangerous by water a narrow path led steeply down to penberth cove where lights glimmered from small granite cottages at the waters edge torches bobbed and glittered near the surf where locals brave enough to contend with the storm were watching the broken sloop disintegrate there was no way they could get to the boat even if a small skiff could have managed the surf the reef that was destroying the daze would have done as much for any other vessel beyond that stormdriven waves impeded them crashing upon a natural spur of granite sending plumes of spray towering into the air i cant manage it tommy st james shouted when he saw the path ill have to wait here lynley lifted a hand nodded and began the descent the others followed picking their way among the boulders finding handholds and footholds in outcroppings of rock st james watched them disappear into a patch of heavy shadow before he turned fighting the wind and the rain to get back to the car he felt weighted down by the mud on his shoes and the snarl of weeds that tangled in the heelpiece of his brace when he reached the rover he was out of breath he pulled open the door and threw himself inside out of the storm he stripped off his hlfitting oilskin and sodden guernsey he shook the rain out of his hair he shivered in the cold wished for dry clothes and thought about what the fisherman had said at first it seemed to st james that he hadnt heard him correctly northeast bow to stern on the rocks there had to be a mistake except that a cornish fisherman would know his directions and the brief glimpse st james had had of the sloop acted as confirmation of the fact so there was no mistake that being the case either the boat wasnt the daze at all or they needed to take a new look at their theories it was nearly thirty minutes before lynley returned with mark at his heels the fisherman a short distance behind them hunched against the rain they stood at the austin talking for a moment the fisherman gesturing with hands and arms lynley nodded once squinted towards the southwest and with a final shouted comment he tramped through the mud and weeds to the rover mark penellin followed they stowed their gear in the boot once again and fell rather than climbed inside the car they were soaking shes destroyed lynley was gasping like a runner another hour and therell be nothing left its the daze without a doubt ahead of them the austin roared it reversed made the turn and left them on the clifftop lynley stared into the darkness which the austin left behind rain pelted the windscreen could they tell you anything little enough they saw the boat coming in towards dusk apparently the fool was attempting to run through the rocks into the cove to be winched out of high water as the other boats are someone saw it hit five men were working round the capstan winch on the slip when they saw what was happening they gathered a crew and went to see what could be done theyre fishing people after all theyd be unlikely to let anyone run aground without trying to help in some way but when they finally got a clear sight of the boat noone was on deck how is that possible st james regretted the impulsive question the moment he asked it there were two explanations and he saw them himself before lynley and mark put them into words people get swept overboard in this kind of weather mark said if youre not careful if you dont wear a safety line if you dont know what youre doing peter knows what hes doing lynley interrupted people panic tommy st james said lynley didnt respond at once as if he were evaluating this idea he looked across st james to the passengers window in the direction of the sodden path that led to the cove water from his hair trickled crookedly down his brow he wiped it away he could have gone below he could still be below they both could be there this wasnt an immediately untenable assumption st james thought and it fitted rather nicely with the position in which the daze had gone aground if peter had been using when hed made the decision to take the boat out in the first place as was clearly indicated by the fact that he had done so in the face of a coming storm his reasoning would have been clouded by the drug indeed the effects of cocaine would probably have prompted him to see himself as invincible superior to the elements in full command the storm itself would have been not so much a clear and present danger as a source of excitement the ultimate high on the other hand taking the boat might have been a final act of desperation if peter needed to run away in order to avoid answering questions about mick cambrey and justin brooke he may have decided the sea was his best means of escape on land he would have been noticed by someone he had no transport he would need to thumb a lift and with sasha with him whoever picked them up would be quite likely to remember them both when and if the police came calling peter was wise enough to know that yet everything about the position and the destruction of the boat suggested something other than flight lynley switched on the ignition the car rumbled to life ill get up a party tomorrow he said were going to have a look for any signs of them his mother met them in the northwest corridor where they were hanging their dripping oilskins and guernseys on the wall pegs she didnt speak at first rather she held one hand palm outwards between her breasts as if in some way this would allow her to ward off a coming blow with the other hand she clasped a wrap shed thrown on a paisley stole of red and black that did battle with her colouring and the shade of her dress she appeared to be using it more for security than for warmth for the material was thin and perhaps with the cold or with trepidation her body quivered beneath it she was very pale and lynley thought that for the first time in his recollection his mother looked every one of her fiftysix years ive coffee for you in the day room she said lynley saw st james look from him to his mother he knew his friend well enough to recognize his decision it was time he told his mother the worst about peter he had to prepare her for whatever she would have to face in the coming days and he couldnt do that with st james present no matter how he longed to have his friend at his side id like to check on sidney st james said ill be down later the northwest staircase was nearby round the corner from the gun room and st james disappeared in that direction alone with his mother lynley didnt know what to say like a cooperative guest he settled on a polite i could do with a coffee thank you his mother led the way he noticed how she walked her head upright her shoulders back he read the underlying meaning beneath her posture should someone see her hodge the cook or one of the dailies she would give them no sign of any personal turmoil her estate manager had been arrested for murder one of her house guests had died in the night her youngest child was missing and her middle child was a man with whom she hadnt spoken intimately in more than fifteen years but if any of this bothered her noone would see it if gossip flourished behind the green baize door its subject would not be the myriad ways in which gods punishment had fallen upon the dowager countess of asherton at last they walked along the corridor that ran the length of the body of the house at its eastern end the dayroom door was closed and when lady asherton opened it the rooms sole occupant got to his feet crushing out his cigarette in an ashtray have you found anything roderick trenarrow asked lynley hesitated in the doorway he was all at once aware of the fact that his clothes were wet great oblongs of damp caused the wool of his trousers to adhere scratchily to his legs his shirt clung to both his chest and his shoulders and its collar pressed damply to the back of his neck even his socks were soaked for although hed worn gumboots down to penberth cove hed removed them in the car and hed stepped directly into a substantial puddle of rainwater when hed parked in the courtyard upon their return so he wanted to leave he wanted to change his clothes but instead he forced himself forward and went to the bentwood cart next to his mothers desk a coffee pot sat on it tommy his mother said she had sat upon the least comfortable chair in the room lynley took his cup of coffee to the sofa trenarrow remained where he was by the fireplace a coal fire burned there but its warmth did not cut through the clammy weight of lynleys clothes he glanced at trenarrow nodding in acknowledgement of the question hed asked but saying nothing he wanted the other man to depart he couldnt imagine having a conversation about peter in front of him yet he knew that any request on his part for some privacy with his mother would be misinterpreted by both of them clearly as on the previous evening trenarrow was there at her behest this was no social call which he had designed to lead to seduction and the concern on trenarrows face when he looked at lady asherton gave evidence of that it appeared that he would have no choice in the matter he rubbed his forehead brushed back his damp hair noone was with the boat he said at least we couldnt see anyone they might have been below has anyone been called the lifeboat you mean he shook his head shes breaking up too fast by the time they got there shed be gone do you think he was swept overboard they were speaking of her child but they might have been discussing the replanting of the garden that would have to be done after the storm he marvelled at her calm she maintained it only until he replied however theres no way of knowing whether he was below with sasha whether they were both swept overboard we wont know anything until we find the bodies and even then if theyve sustained enough damage we might only be left with inferences and not a lot more at that she lowered her head and covered her eyes lynley waited for trenarrow to cross the room to her he could feel the other mans need to do so it was like a current that snapped in the air but he made no move dont torture yourself trenarrow said we dont know a thing we dont even know yet if it was peter who took the boat dorothy please listen to me lynley remembered with a pain that rushed and receded trenarrow had always been the only person who used his mothers real name you know he took the boat she said we all know why but ive ignored every sign havent i hes been in clinics having treatment four clinics now and i wanted to believe that he was over it but hes not i knew that the moment i saw him on friday morning but i couldnt bear to face another round of addiction so i simply ignored it ive actually begun praying that hell find his way on his own because i dont know how to help him any longer ive never known oh roddy if she hadnt said his name trenarrow probably would have maintained his distance but as it was he went to her touched her face her hair said her name again her arms went round him lynley looked away his muscles ached his bones felt leaden i dont understand it lady asherton was saying no matter what he intended by taking the boat he would have seen what the weather was like he would have known the danger he cant have been as desperate as that and then gendy pushing herself away from trenarrow tommy i dont know lynley said he kept his tone guarded his mother got to her feet came to the sofa theres something else isnt there something youve not told me no roddy this as trenarrow made a move towards her tm all right tell me what it is tommy tell me what youve not wanted me to know you argued with him last night i heard you you know that but theres more isnt there tell me lynley looked up at her her face had become remarkably calm again as if she had managed to find and draw upon a new source of strength he dropped his eyes to the coffee cup that warmed the palm of his hand peter was at mick cambreys cottage after john penellins visit on friday night later mick died justin told me about that after johns arrest last night and then he looked back at her justin died her lips parted as he spoke but otherwise her expression remained impassive you cant think your own brother i dont know what to think his throat felt raw for gods sake tell me what to think if you will micks dead justins dead peters disappeared so what would you have me think of it all trenarrow took a step as if with the intention of deflecting the strength of lynleys words but as he moved lady asherton did likewise she joined her son on the sofa put her arm round his shoulders she pressed her cheek against his and brushed her lips against his damp hair dearest tommy she murmured my dear my dear why on earth do you believe you must bear it all it was the first time she had touched him in more than a decade the morning sky a cerulean arc under which a froth of cumulus clouds drifted inland acted as a contradiction to the previous days storm as did the seabirds who once again filled the air with their raw importunate cries the ground below them however was a testament to foul weather and from his bedroom window a cup of tea in his hand st james surveyed the consequences of those hours of rain and bluster slate tiles from the roof lay shattered on the drive which entered the south courtyard over which his room looked a twisted weathervane had fallen among them no doubt blown there from the roof of one of the outbuildings that formed part of the courtyard wall crushed flowers created occasional mats of bright colour purple canterbury bells pink begonias entire spikes of larkspur and everywhere the petals of ruined roses bits of broken glass made a jewellike glitter on the cobblestones and one small curiously unbroken window pane covered a puddle of water like newly formed ice already the gardeners and groundsmen were taking steps to repair the damage and st james could hear their voices from the park drowned out by the intermittent roar of a power saw a sharp double rap on the door brought cotter into the room got what you need he said bit of a surprise that as well he crossed the room and handed st james the envelope which hed removed from the estate office desk during his telephone conversation with lady helen clyde its dr trenarrows number is it st james placed his tea cup on the cheveret he took the envelope and moughtfully turned it in his hands didnt even need to ring it mr st james cotter said hodge knew whose it was the moment i showed it to him seems es rung it enough times over the years did you phone the number anyway to be certain i did its dr trenarrows all right and e knows were coming any word from tommy daze said e phoned from pendeen cotter shook his head hes got nothing st james frowned wondering about the efficacy of lynleys plan one which stubbornly avoided the participation of either coastguard or police he had headed out before dawn with six men from the surrounding farms to check the coastline from st ives to penzance they were operating two launches one setting sail from penzance harbour and the other across the peninsula at st ives bay the boats were small enough to give them fairly good visual access to the shore and fast enough to complete at least a cursory search in relatively few hours but if that gleaned them nothing a second search would have to be conducted by land that would take days and whether lynley liked it or not it could not be orchestrated without the inclusion of the local police i feel done in by this whole flipping weekend cotter commented as he replaced st james tea cup on the tray that sat on the table next to the bed im that glad debs gone back to london get er out o this mess is what i say he sounded as if he hoped st james would make a response that would encourage furdier conversation along these lines st james had no intention of doing so cotter shook out st james dressing gown and hung it in the wardrobe he spent a moment straightening the neat row of his shoes he banged a set of wooden coat hangers together and snapped the locks on the suitcase which sat on the top shelf then he burst out with whats to become of the girl theres no closeness mong them not a bit an you know it its not like with you is it its not like your family oh theyre rich bloody rich but debs not drawn to money you know that well as i do you know what draws the girl beauty contemplation the colours of the sky a sudden new idea the sight of a swan he knew had always known and he needed to forget his bedroom door opened promising escape sidney entered but with the wardrobe door obstructing his vision cotter didnt seem to notice that he and st james were no longer alone you cant say you feel nothing cotter asserted vigorously i cn see it all over you i have done for ages no matter what you say am i interrupting something sidney asked cotter swung the wardrobe door home he looked from st james to his sister then back to st james ill see to the car he said abruptly excused himself and left them alone what was that about sidney asked nothing it didnt sound like nothing it was i see she remained by the door the knob beneath her hand st james felt a stirring of concern at the sight of her she looked caught somewhere between numb and ill with blueblack crescents beneath her eyes providing the only colour on her face and her eyes themselves holding no expression reflecting rather than absorbing the light she wore a faded denim skirt and an oversized pullover her hair looked uncombed im off she said dazes taking me to the station what had seemed reasonable only last night seemed out of the question when he saw his sister in the light of day why dont you stay sid i can take you home myself later on this is best i really want to go its better this way but the station will be ill take a cab home ill be all right she turned the knob of the door as if experimentally i understand peters missing she said yes st james told her what had happened since hed taken her to her room the previous morning she listened without looking at him as he spoke he could sense her increasing tension and he knew that it took its definition from an anger growing out of her comment about peter lynley after the docility which shock had produced in her yesterday he wasnt prepared for the change even though he knew that her anger was natural a need to strike out and wound so that someone somehow would feel some of her pain the worst part of a death was always that moment of knowing beyond a doubt that no matter how many people share it be they family friends or even an entire nation no two people can ever feel it the same way so it always seems as if one experiences it alone how much worse for sidney who was experiencing it alone who was the sole mourner for justin brooke how convenient she said when hed completed his story what do you mean i mean he told me told you justin told me simon everything about peters being at mick cambreys cottage about the row mick and peter had he told me he told me all right am i being clear she didnt move beyond the door had she done so had she flung herself into the room had she begun to tear at curtains and bedclothes had she dashed the single vase of flowers to the floor st james would have felt less disturbed all of those behaviours were decidedly sidney this was not only her voice gave testimony to the state of her spirit and even that was only a fraction away from being perfectly controlled i told him that he had to tell you or tommy she went on once john penellin was arrested i told him he had to say something he couldnt keep quiet it was his duty i said he had to tell the truth but he didnt want to get involved he knew hed be making things bad for peter but i insisted i said if someone saw john penellin at gull cottage then someone probably saw you and peter as well better come forward with the story i told him rather than let the police drag it out of some neighbour sid but he was worried because hed left peter with mick he was worried because peter was getting wild about the cocaine he was worried because he didnt know what had happened after he left them but i convinced him that he had to speak to tommy so he did now hes dead and how perfectly convenient that peters disappeared just at a moment when we all have so many questions wed like to put to him st james crossed the room to her and shut the door cid think justins death was an accident sid theyve nothing at all to suggest it was murder i dont believe that why not i just dont was he with you saturday night of course he was with me she flung her head back and stated it like a fine point of honour we made love he wanted to he came to me i didnt ask him he came to me what excuse did he give for leaving you afterwards her nostrils flared he loved me simon he wanted me we were good together but you cant accept that can you sid i dont want to argue about can you can you somewhere in the corridor two women were talking having a mild argument over who would vacuum and who would clean the baths their voices grew louder for a moment then faded away as they descended the stairs what time did he leave you i dont know i didnt notice did he say anything he was restless he said he couldnt sleep hes like that sometimes hes been like that before we make love and he gets all wound up sometimes he wants to do it again right away but not saturday night he said he thought he could sleep better in his own room did he dress did he yes he dressed she drew the conclusion herself so he was meeting peter because why would he have dressed when his own room was right across the hail and he did dress simon his shoes and socks his trousers and shirt everything but his tie she clenched at the material of her skirt peters bed wasnt slept in i heard that this morning justin didnt fall you know he didnt fall st james didnt argue with her he reflected upon the possibilities suggested by the simple act of donning clothes if peter lynley had wanted to have an innocent conversation with brooke it would have been more sensible for them to have had it somewhere in the house if on the other hand he had wanted to be rid of brooke far wiser to do it in a location where it would look like an accident but if that were the case why on earth would justin agree to meet peter anywhere alone sid it doesnt make sense justin wasnt a fool why would he agree to meet peter at the cliff and in the middle of the night after his conversation with tommy for all he knew peter was out for his blood then he thought about friday afternoons scene on the beach unless of course peter got him down there on false pretences with some sort of bait what sasha thats absurd then cocaine theyd gone to nanrunnel looking for it perhaps that was the carrot peter used it wouldnt have worked justin wasnt going to use any longer not after what happened between us on the beach he apologized for that he said he was off it he wouldnt use again st james could not keep the scepticism from his face he saw the hard edge of his sisters features begin to disintegrate as she read his reaction he promised simon you didnt know him as i did you wouldnt understand but if he promised when we were making love especially when there were certain things he liked me to do my god sidney she began to cry of course my god sidney what else can you say why should you of all people even begin to understand youve never been close to feeling anything for anyone why on earth should you after all youve got science you dont have to feel passion you can feel busy instead with projects and conferences and lectures and the guidance of all those future pathologists who come to worship at your knee here was the need to wound that hed recognized before still it came out of nowhere he hadnt expected it and whether the attack was accurate or not he found that he could not summon a response sidney drew a hand across her eyes im leaving just tell little peter when you find him that i have lots to discuss with him believe me i can hardly wait for the opportunity trenarrows house was easy enough to find for it sat just off the upper reaches of paul lane on the outskirts of the village the largest structure within view by the standards of howenstow it was a humble enough dwelling but in comparison to the cottages that stacked one upon the other on the hillside beneath it the villa was very grand with broad bay windows overlooking the harbour and a stand of poplar trees acting like a backdrop against which the houses ashlar walls and white woodwork were displayed to some considerable effect with cotter at the wheel of the estate austin st james saw the villa at once as they came over the last rise of the coastal road and began their descent into nanrunnel they wound past the harbour the village shops the tourist flats at the anchor and rose they made the turn into paul lane here debris from yesterdays storm littered the pitted asphalt rubbish from cottage dustbins assorted food wrappers and tins a wrecked sign that once had advertised cream teas the road twisted on itself and climbed above the village where it was strewn with broken foliage from hedges and shrubs pools of rainwater reflected the sky a narrow drive branching north off paul lane was discreedy marked the villa fuchsias lined it drooping heavily over a drystone wall behind this a terraced garden covered much of the hillside where a carefully plotted meandering path led upwards to the house through beds of phlox and nemesia bellflowers and cyclamen the drive ended in a curve round a hawthorn tree and cotter parked beneath it a few yards from the front door a doriccolumned portico sheltered this with two urns of vermilion pelargoniums standing on either side st james studied the front of the house does he live here alone he asked fars i know cotter replied but a woman answered the phone when i rang a woman st james thought of tina cogin and trenarrows telephone number in her flat lets see what the doctor can tell us their knock was not answered by trenarrow rather a young west indian woman opened the door and from the expression on cotters face when she first spoke st james knew he could dismiss tina cogin as the woman who had answered the phone the mystery of her whereabouts it seemed would not be solved through the expediency of her clandestine presence at trenarrows house doctor see nobodies here the woman said looking from cotter to st james the words sounded rehearsed perhaps frequently and not always patiendy said dr trenarrow knows were coming to see him st james said its not a medical call ah she smiled showing large white teeth which protruded like ivory against her coffee skin she held wide the door then in with you man hes looking at his flowers every morning in the garden before he goes off to work same thing ill fetch him for you she showed them to the study where with a meaningful look at st james cotter said i could do with a walk round the garden myself and followed the woman from the room cotter would st james knew find out what he could about who she was and why she was there alone he turned to look at the room it was the sort of study he particularly liked with air faintly scented by the smell of the old leather chairs bookcases filled to absolute capacity a fireplace with coals newly laid and ready to be lit a desk sat in the large bay window overlooking the harbour but as if the view would be a distraction from work it faced into the room rather than outwards an open magazine lay upon it with a pen left in the centre crease as if the reader had been interrupted in the middle of an article curious st james went to examine it flipping it closed for a moment cancer research an american journal with a photograph of a whitecoated scientist on its cover she leaned against a working area on which sat an immense electron microscope scripps clinic la jolla was printed beneath the photograph along with the phrase testing the limits of bioresearch st james went back to the article a technical treatise on an extracellular matrix protein called proteoglycans despite his own extensive background in science it made little sense to him not quite what one would call light reading is it st james looked up dr trenarrow stood in the doorway he was wearing a welltailored threepiece suit hed pinned a small rosebud to its lapel its certainly beyond me st james replied any word of peter nothing yet im afraid trenarrow shut the door and gestured st james into one of the rooms wingback chairs coffee he asked ive been discovering its one of doras few specialities thank you no shes your housekeeper using the term in the loosest possible fashion he smiled briefly without humour the remark seemed largely an effort to be lighthearted an effort he dismissed with his very next words tommy told us last night about peter seeing mick cambrey the night he died about brooke as well i dont know where you stand in all this but ive known that boy since he was six years old and hes not a killer hes incapable of violence most especially the sort that was done to mick cambrey did you know mick well not as well as others in the village just as his landlord i let him gull cottage how long ago was that trenarrow began an automatic answer but then his brow furrowed as if hed suddenly wondered about the nature of the question about nine months who lived there before him i did trenarrow made a quick movement in his chair an adjustment in position that betrayed irritation you cant have come here on a social call at this time of the morning mr st james did tommy send you tommy no doubt you know the facts weve years of bad blood between us youre asking about cambrey youre asking about the cottage are these questions his idea or yours mine but he knows ive come to see you about mick actually no tina cogins disappeared we think she may have come to cornwall who tina cogin shrewsbury court apartments in paddington your telephone number was among her things i havent the slightest tina cogin you say shes not a patient of yours or a former patient i dont see patients oh perhaps the occasional terminal case who volunteers for an experimental drug but if tina cogin was one of them and shes disappeared excuse me for the levity but theres only one place shed be disappearing to and it wouldnt be cornwall then you may well have seen her in a different light trenarrow looked perplexed sony she may be a prostitute the doctors goldrimmed spectacles slid fractionally down his nose he knuckled them back into place and said and she had my name no just your number my address not even that trenarrow pushed himself out of his chair he walked over to the window behind the desk he spent a long moment studying the view before he turned back to st james ive not set foot in london in a year perhaps more but i suppose that makes little enough difference if shes come to cornwall perhaps shes making house calls he smiled wryly you dont really know me mr st james so you have no way of knowing if im telling you the truth but let me say that its not been my habit to pay a woman for sex some men do it without flinching i realize but ive always preferred lovemaking to grow out of a passion other than avarice this other the negotiating first the exchange of cash later thats not my style was it micks micks he was seen leaving her flat on friday morning in london he may well have given her your number in fact perhaps for some sort of consultation trenarrows fingers went to the rosebud on his lapel touching its tightly furled petals thats a possibility he said thoughtfully although referrals generally come from physicians it is a possibility if shes seriously ill mick knew cancer research is my line of work hed done an interview with me shortly after he took over the spokesman its not inconceivable that he might have given her my name but cambrey and a prostitute thats going to put a wrench in his reputation his fathers been fanning the fires of micks sexual profligacy for the last year at least and believe me nothing hes said has ever alluded to mick having to pay for a womans favours according to harry so many women were throwing themselves at the poor lad that he barely had time to pull his trousers up before someone was moaning to have them back down if involvement with a prostitute led to micks murder itll be sad times for harry he seems to be hoping it was from a row with a dozen or two jealous husbands or one jealous wife nancy trenarrow said incredulously i cant see her hurting anyone can you and even if she had somehow been driven beyond endurance it was no secret after all that mick saw other women when could she have done it she couldnt have been in two places at once she was gone from the refreshment booth for a good ten minutes or more time to run home murder her husband and reappear as if everything were well the thoughts a bit absurd considering the girl someone else might have managed it with aplomb but nancys no actress if shed killed her husband during the evening i doubt she could have hidden it from a soul there was certainly a weight of evidence to support trenarrows declaration from start to finish nancys reactions had borne the unmistakable stamp of authenticity her shock her numb grief her rising anxiety none of them had seemed in the least bit factitious it hardly seemed likely that shed run home killed her husband and feigned horror later that being the case st james considered the problem of suspects john penellin had been in the area that night as had peter lynley and justin brooke perhaps harry cambrey had paid a visit to the cottage as well and mark penellins whereabouts were still unaccounted for yet a motive for the crime was not clearly emerging each one they considered was nebulous at best and more than anything a motive needed clear definition if anyone was to understand the full circumstances of mick cambreys death st james noticed harry cambrey almost immediately as cotter pulled the car back into paul lane he was climbing towards them he waved energetically as they approached the cigarette between his fingers left a tiny plume of smoke in the air whos this cotter slowed the car mick cambreys father lets see what he wants cotter pulled to the side of the road and harry cambrey came to st james window he leaned into the car bringing with him the mixed odours of tobacco smoke and beer his appearance had undergone some improvement since st james and lady helen had seen him on saturday morning his clothes were fresh his hair was combed and although a few overlooked whiskers sprouted here and there like grey bristles on his cheeks his face was largely shaven as well he was panting and he winced as if the words hurt him when he spoke howenstow folks said youd be here come down to the office something to show you youve found notes st james asked cambrey shook his head worked it all out though when st james opened the car door cambrey clambered inside he nodded at the introduction to cotter its those numbers i found the ones from his desk ive been playing with them since saturday i know what they mean cotter remained in the pub with mrs swann chatting amiably over a pint of ale he was saying i wouldnt say no to one o them scotch eggs as st james followed harry cambrey up to the newspaper office unlike his former visit to the spokesman on this morning the staff was at work all the lights were on creating an entirely different atmosphere from the previous gloom and in three of the four cubicles newspaper employees either pecked at typewriters or talked on the phone a longhaired boy examined a set of photographs on a display board while next to him a compositor engaged in the process of laying out another edition of the newspaper on an angled green table he held an unlit pipe between his teeth and tapped a pencil in staccato against a plastic holder of paper clips at the word processor on the table next to mick cambreys desk a woman sat typing she had soft dark hair drawn back from her face and when she looked up intelligent eyes she was very attractive julianna vendale st james decided he wondered how and if her responsibilities at the newspaper had altered with mick cambreys death harry cambrey led the way to one of the cubicles it was sparsely furnished hung with wall decorations which suggested that not only was the office his own but also nothing had been done to change it during his convalescence after heart surgery everything spoke of the fact that no matter harry cambreys desire his son had not intended to assume either his office or his job framed newspaper clippings gone yellow with age appeared to represent the older mans proudest stories a piece on a disastrous sea rescue attempt in which twenty of the wouldbe rescuers had drowned an accident which dismembered a local fisherman the rescue of a child from a mine shaft a brawl during a fete in penzance these were accompanied by newspaper photographs as well the originals of those which had been printed with the stories on the top of an ancient desk the most recent edition of the spokesman lay open to the editorial page micks contribution had been heavily circled in red on the wall opposite a map of great britain hung cambrey directed st james to this i kept thinking about those numbers he said mick was systematic about things like that he wouldnt have kept that paper if it wasnt important he felt in the breast pocket of his shirt for a packet of cigarettes he shook one out and lit it before going on im still working on part of it but im on my way st james saw that next to the map cambrey had taped a small piece of paper on it he had printed part of the cryptic message which hed found beneath his sons desk m procuretransport and beneath that m finance on the map itself two motorways had been traced in red markingpen the ml heading north from london and the m heading northwest below leicester towards the irish sea look at it cambrey said ml and m run together south of leicester the ml only goes as far as leeds but the m continues it ends in carlisle at solway firth st james considered this he made no reply cambrey sounded agitated when he continued look at the map man just look at it square m gives access to liverpool doesnt it it takes you to preston to morecambe bay and they every bloody one of them give access to ireland st james concluded thinking of the editorial hed read only the morning before cambrey went for the paper he folded it back his cigarette bobbed between his lips as he talked he knew someone was running guns for the ira how could he have stumbled on to a story like that stumbled cambrey removed his cigarette picked tobacco from his tongue and shook the newspaper to make his point my lad didnt stumble he was a journalist not a fool he listened he talked he learned to follow leads cambrey returned to the map and used the folded newspaper as a pointer guns must be coming into cornwall in the first place or if not into cornwall then through a south harbour shipped from sympathizers maybe in north africa or spain or even france they come in anywhere along the south coast plymouth bournemouth southampton portsmouth theyre shipped disassembled trucked to london and put together then from there up the ml to the m and then to liverpool or preston or morecambe bay why not ship them directly to ireland in the first place st james asked but he knew the answer even as he asked it a foreign ship docking at belfast would be more likely to arouse suspicion than would an english ship it would undergo a thorough customs check but an english ship would be largely accepted for why would the english be sending arms to assist an uprising against themselves there was more on the paper than ml and m st james pointed out those additional numbers have to mean something cambrey nodded likely to be some sort of registration numbers i think references to the ship theyd be using numbers on the type of weapons theyd be supplying its some sort of code but make no mistake about it mick was on his way to breaking it yet youve found no other notes what ive founds enough i know my lad i know what he was about st james reflected upon the map he thought about the numbers mick had jotted on the paper he noted the fact that the editorial about northern ireland had appeared on sunday more than thirty hours after micks death if the two were connected somehow then the killer had known about the editorial in advance of the papers appearance on sunday morning he wondered how likely a possibility that was do you keep your back issues of the newspaper here he asked this isnt a backissue problem cambrey said nonetheless do you have them some out here cambrey led him from his office to a storage cabinet that sat to the left of the casement windows he pulled open the doors to reveal stacks of newspapers upon the shelves st james glanced at them pulled the first set off the shelf and looked at cambrey can you get me micks keys he asked cambrey looked puzzled ive a spare cottage key here no i mean all his keys he has a set doesnt he car cottage office can you get them i expect boscowan has them now so youll need to come up with an excuse and ill want them for a few days why does the name tina cogin mean anything to you st james asked in answer cogin yes a woman from london mick knew her apparently i think he may have had the key to her flat mick had the key to half a dozen flats if i know him cambrey pulled out a cigarette and left him to his papers an hours search through the past six months gleaned him nothing save hands that were stained with newsprint as far as he could tell harry cambreys conjecture about gunrunning was as likely a motive for his sons death as was anything else the paper had to offer he shut the cupboard doors when he turned it was to find julianna vendale watching him a coffee cup raised to her lips shed left the word processor coming to stand near a coffee maker that was bubbling noisily in the corner of the room nothing she put her cup down on the table and pushed a lock of long hair back from her shoulder everyone seems to think he was working on a story st james said mick was always working on something did most of his projects get into print she drew her eyebrows together a faint crease appeared between them otherwise her face was completely unlined st james knew from his previous conversation with lynley that julianna vendale was in her middle thirties perhaps a bit older but her face denied her age i dont know she answered i wasnt always aware of what his projects were but it wouldnt surprise me to find out hed begun something and then let it die hed shoot out of here often enough convinced he was hot on the trail of a feature he could sell in london then hed never complete it st james had seen that himself in his perusal of the newspapers dr trenarrow had said mick interviewed him for a story but nowhere in the back issues of the paper was there a feature that in any way related to a conversation the two of them might have had st james related this to julianna vendale she poured herself another cup of coffee and spoke over her shoulder that doesnt surprise me mick probably thought he was going to get a mother teresa piece out of it cornish scientist dedicates his life to saving others only to discover that dr trenarrows no more on the path to heaven than the rest of us are or st james thought the potential story was a ploy to get an interview with trenairow in the first place in order to gather information and pass it along with trenarrows phone number to a needy friend julianna was continuing that was largely his way ever since he came back to the spokesman i think he was looking for a story as a means of escape he didnt want to be here it was a step backwards for him hed been a freelance journalist hed been doing quite well then his father fell ill and he had to chuck it all and come back to hold the family business together you couldnt have done that i could have done of course but harry wanted mick to take over the paper more than that i should guess he wanted him back in nanrunnel permanently st james thought he saw the direction harry cambrey had intended things to move once mick returned to nanrunnel nonetheless he asked how did you fit into the plans harry made certain we worked together as much as possible then i suppose he just hoped for the best he had great faith in micks charm and you she was holding her coffee cup between her hands as if to keep them warm her fingers were long she wore no rings he didnt appeal to me when harry saw that he started having nancy penellin come to do the books during our regular office hours instead of at weekends and as to developing the newspapers stature she indicated the word processor mick made the attempt at first he started with new equipment he wanted to update but then he seemed to lose interest when just about the time he made nancy pregnant she lifted her shoulders in a graceful shrug after they married he was gone a great deal pursuing a story she smiled pursuing they strolled across the narrow street to the harbour the tide was out five sunbathers lay on the narrow strand near them a group of small children dabbled their hands and feet in the water shrieking with excitement as it lapped at their legs get what you need cotter asked pieces thats all nothing seems to fit together i cant make a connection between mick and tina cogin between tina cogin and trenarrow its nothing more than conjecture praps deb was wrong praps she didnt see mick in london no she saw him everything indicates that he knew tina cogin but as to how and why i dont know seems ow and whys the easiest part cording to missus swann shes not an admirer of micks is she she hated im and theres the truth cotter watched the children playing for a moment he smiled as one of them a little girl of three or four fell on to her bottom splashing water on the others but if theres truth to her talk about mick cambrey and women then fars i can see looks to me that john penellin did it why its is daughter involved mr st james a mans not likely to let another man hurt is daughter not if it can be stopped in some way a man does what e can st james recognized the bait and acknowledged the fact that their mornings discussion was not yet concluded in cotters eyes but he had no need to ask the question which cotters comment called for and what would you do he knew the answer instead he said did you learn anything from the housekeeper dora a bit cotter leaned against the harbour railing resting his elbows on the top metal bar great admirer of the doctor is dora works is fingers to the bone gives is life to research and when es not doing that es visiting folks at a convalescent ome outside st just thats the extent of it seems to be st james sighed not for the first time did he admit to the fact that his field was science crimescene investigation the analysis of evidence the interpretation of data the preparation of reports he had no expertise in an arena that demanded insightful communication and intuitive deduction more he didnt have the taste or the talent for either and the further he waded into the growing mire of conjecture the more frustrated he felt from his jacket pocket he pulled out the piece of paper which harry cambrey had given him on saturday morning it seemed as reasonable a direction to head in as any when youre lost he thought mordantly you may as well head somewhere cotter joined him in studying it mp he said then member of parliament st james looked up what did you say them letters mp mp no as he spoke st james held the paper to the sunlight and he saw what the gloom of the newspaper office and his own preconceived notions had prevented him from realizing before the pen which had skipped in the grease on other spots on the paper had done as much again next to the words procure and transport the result was an imperfectly formed loop for the letter p not the number at all and the if the thought followed logically had to be instead a hastily scrawled c good god he frowned examining the accompanying numbers dismissing gunrunning and ireland and every other side issue from his mind it wasnt long before he saw the obvious the last was the multiple of the previous two and then he recognized the first connection of the circumstances surrounding mick cambreys death the position of the daze had told him bow to stern northeast on the rocks he should have clung to that thought it had been pointing to the truth he thought about the coastline of cornwall he knew without a doubt that lynleys party of men could scour every cove from st ives to penzance but it would be as limitedly useful an activity for them as it had been for the excise officers who had patrolled the same area for two hundred years the coast was honeycombed with caves it was scalloped by coves st james knew that he did not need to clamber among the rocks and slither down the faces of cliffs to see what he knew quite well was already there a haven for smugglers if they knew how to pilot a boat among the reefs it could have come from anywhere he thought from porthgwarra to sennen cove even from the scillies but there was only one way to know for sure what next cotter asked st james folded the paper we need to find tommy why to call off the search after nearly two hours they found him on the quay at lamorna cove he was squatting on the edge talking to a fisherman who had just docked his boat and was trudging up the harbour steps three coils of greasylooking rope dangling from his shoulder he paused halfway listening to lynley above him he shook his head covered his eyes to examine the other boats in the harbour and with a wave towards the scattering of buildings set back from the quay he continued his climb up above on the road that dipped into the cove st james got out of the car go back to howenstow he told cotter ill ride with tommy any message for daze st james considered the question any message for lynleys mother seemed a tossup between relieving her mind about one set of circumstances only to fire her worries about another nothing yet he waited as cotter turned the car around and headed back the way they had come then he began the descent into lamorna with the wind whipping round him and the sun warming his face below him the crystalline water reflected the colour of the sky and the small beach glistened with newly washed sand the houses on the hillside built by cornish craftsmen who had been testing the strength of the southwestern weather for generations had sustained no damage from the storm here that which had been the ruin of the daze might not even have occurred st james watched as lynley walked along the quay his head bent forward his hands deep in trouser pockets the posture said everything about the condition of his spirit and the fact that he was alone suggested either that he had disbanded the search altogether or that the others had gone on without him because theyd been at it for hours already st james guessed the former he called lynleys name his friend looked up raised a hand in greeting but said nothing until he and st james met at the land end of the quay his expression was bleak nothing he lifted his head and the wind tossed his hair weve completed the circuit ive been talking to everyone here as a lastditch effort i thought someone might have seen them getting the boat ready to sail or walking on the quay or stocking supplies but noone in any of the houses saw a blasted thing only the woman who runs the cafe even noticed the daze yesterday when was that just after six in the morning she was getting ready to open the cafe adjusting the front blinds so she cant have been mistaken she saw them sailing out of the harbour and it was yesterday not the day before she remembers it was yesterday because she couldnt understand why someone was taking the boat out when rain had been forecast but it was in the morning that she saw them lynley glanced his way flashed a tired but grateful smile i know what youre thinking peter left howenstow the night before and because of that its less likely hes the one who took the boat thats good of you st james dont think i havent considered it myself but the reality is that he and sasha could have come to lamorna during the night slept on the boat then taken her out at dawn did this woman see anyone on deck just a figure at the helm only one i cant think sasha knows how to sail st james she was probably below she was probably still asleep lynley looked back at the cove weve done the whole coastline but so far nothing not a sighting not a garment not a sign of them he took out his cigarette case and flipped it open im going to have to come up with something to tell mother but god only knows what itll be st james had been placing most of the facts together as lynley spoke his thoughts elsewhere hed heard not so much the words as the desolation behind them he sought to bring that to an immediate end peter didnt take the daze he said im sure of it lynleys head turned to him slowly it looked like the sort of movement one makes in a dream what are you saying we need to go to penzance detective inspector boscowan took them to the officers canteen the yellow submarine hed called it and the name was very apt yellow walls yellow linoleum yellow formicatopped tables yellow plastic chairs only the crockery was a different colour but as this colour was carmine the overall effect was one which did not encourage the thought of lingering over a meal with ones mates nor did it suggest the possibility of consuming ones food without developing a ferocious headache in the process they took a pot of tea to a table overlooking a small courtyard in which a dispirited ash tree attempted to flourish in a circle of dirt the colour of granite designed and decorated by madmen was boscowans only comment as he hooked his foot round the leg of an extra chair and dragged it to their table supposed to take ones mind off ones work it does that st james remarked boscowan poured the tea while lynley ripped open three packages of digestive biscuits and shook them on to an extra plate they fell upon it with a sound like small artillery fire baked fresh daily boscowan smiled sardonically took a biscuit dunked it in his tea and held it there johns spoken to a solicitor this morning i had a devil of a time getting him to do it ive always known the mans stubborn but hes never been like this are you going to charge him lynley asked boscowan examined his biscuit dunked it again ive no choice in the matter he was there he admits it the evidence supports it witnesses saw him witnesses heard the row boscowan took a bite of his biscuit after which he appreciatively held it at eye level and nodded his head he wiped his fingers on a paper napkin and urged the plate upon the other two men not half bad just put your faith in the tea he waited until they had each taken one before he went on had john only been there it would be a different matter had there not also been that flaming row which half the neighbourhood appear to have heard st james looked at lynley he was adding a second cube of sugar to his tea his index finger played along the handle of the cup but he said nothing st james said as to penellins motive an argument over nancy i dare say cambrey was trapped into the marriage and he made no bones about hating every minute of it theres not one person ive talked to who hasnt said that then why marry her in the first place why not simply refuse why not insist on an abortion according to john the girl wouldnt hear of abortion and harry cambrey wouldnt hear of micks refusing to marry her but mick was a grown man after all with a dad sick and likely to die after his surgery boscowan drained his cup of tea harry cambrey recognized a string when he saw one dont think he didnt pull it to keep mick in nanrunnel so the lad got trapped here he started stepping out on his wife everyone knows it including john penellin lynley said but you cant truly believe that john boscowan raised a hand quickly i know the facts theyre all we have to work with nothing else can matter and you damn well know it what difference does it make that john penellins my friend his soninlaws dead and that has to be seen to whether its convenient in my life or not having said this boscowan looked abashed as if his brief outburst had come as a surprise to him he went on more quietly ive offered to let him go home pending arraignment but hes refused its as if he wants to be here as if he wants to be tried he reached for another biscuit but rather than eat it he broke it in his hands its as if he did it may we see him lynley asked boscowan hesitated he looked from lynley to st james then out the window its irregular you know that lynley pulled out his warrant card boscowan waved it off i know youre scotland yard but this isnt a yard case and ive my own chief constables sensibilities to consider no visitors save family and solicitor when its a homicide thats standard procedure in penzance regardless of what you allow at the met a woman friend of mick cambreys has gone missing from london lynley said perhaps john penellin can help us with that a case youre working on lynley didnt reply at the next table a girl in a stained white uniform began stacking plates onto a metal tray crockery crashed and scraped a mound of mashed potatoes fell to the floor boscowan watched her work he tapped a hard biscuit on the table top oh hell he murmured come on with you both ill arrange it somehow he left them in an interrogation room in another wing of the building a single table and five chairs were the only furnishings besides a mirror on one wall and a ceiling lightfixture from which a spider was industriously constructing a web do you think hell admit to it lynley asked as they waited he doesnt really have a choice and youre sure st james its the only reasonable explanation a uniformed constable escorted john penellin into the room when he saw who his visitors were he took a single step backwards as if he would leave the door was already closed behind him however it had a small window set at eye level and although penellin glanced at this as if considering whether to signal the constable to take him back to his cell he made no move to do so instead he joined them the table wobbled on uneven legs as he leaned against it when he sat whats happened he asked warily justin brooke took a fall at howenstow early sunday morning lynley said the police think it was an accident it may well have been but if it wasnt theres either a second killer on the loose locally or you yourself are innocent and theres only one killer which do you think is more likely john penellin twisted a button on the cuff of his shirt his expression did not change although a muscle contracted as quickly as a reflex beneath his right eye st james spoke the daze was taken from lamoma early yesterday morning she was wrecked at penberth cove last night the button penellin was twisting fell onto the table he picked it up used his thumb to flip it onto its other side st james went on i think its a threetiered operation with a main supplier and perhaps half a dozen dealers they seem to be running the cocaine in two possible ways either the dealers pick it up from the supplier perhaps on the scillies and then sail back to the mainland or the supplier arranges to meet the dealers in any number of coves along the coast porthgwarra comes to mind at once the shores accessible the village is too far off for anyone to notice clandestine comings and goings in the cove the cliff is riddled with caves and caches in which an exchange could take place if it seems too risky to try it on the open sea but no matter how he gets it from his supplier once the dealer has it either from the scillies or from one of the coves he sails back to lamorna in the daze and then takes the cocaine to the mill at howenstow where he packages it with noone the wiser penellin said only you know then who is it that youve been trying to protect st james asked mark or the lynleys penellin reached into his pocket and brought out a packet of dunhills lynley reached across the table with the lighter penellin looked at him over the flame its a bit of both i should guess lynley said the longer you keep silent the longer you protect mark from arrest but keeping him from arrest makes him available to peter unless you do what you can to keep them apart marks dragging peter down penellin said hell kill him eventually if i dont stop him justin brooke told us that peter intended to make a buy here in cornwall st james said mark was his source wasnt he that was why you were trying to keep them from seeing each other on friday at howenstow i thought mark might try to sell to peter and the girl ive suspected him of dealing in drugs for some time and i thought if i could just find where he was bringing the stuff in where he was packaging it penellin rolled his cigarette restlessly between his fingers there was no ashtray on the table so he knocked the growing cylinder of ash onto the floor and smashed it with his foot i thought i could stop him ive been watching him for weeks following him when i could id no idea he was doing it right on the estate it was a solid plan st james said both parts of it using the daze as a means of getting the cocaine using the mill to cut and package it everything was associated with howenstow in some way and since peter was and is the known howenstow user he stood to take the fall if things didnt work out hed protest his innocence wildly of course hed blame mark when it came down to it but whod believe him even yesterday we immediately assumed hed taken the boat noone even gave a thought to mark it was clever of them penellins head lifted slowly at st james final word you know that part as well mark didnt have the capital to orchestrate this alone st james said he needed an investor and i should guess it was mick nancy knew that didnt she you both knew it suspected suspected is all is that why you went to see him on friday night penellin gave his attention back to the cigarette i was looking for answers and nancy must have known youd be going there so when mick was killed she feared the worst cambreyd taken out a bank loan to update the newspaper penellin said but little enough got spent on that then he started going all the time to london and he started talking money to nance how there wasnt enough how they were close to bankrupt rent money baby money they were going to sink according to mick but none of it made sense he had money hed managed to get the loan which he was investing rather copiously in cocaine she didnt want to believe he was involved she said he didnt take drugs and she wouldnt see that one doesnt have to take them in order to sell them she wanted proof thats what you were after friday night when you went to the cottage id forgotten that it was one of the fridays when he did the pay envelopes id thought hed not be home and id be able to have a thorough search but he was there we had a row st james took the talisman sandwich wrapper from his pocket i think this is what you wanted he said and handed it to penellin it was in the newspaper office harry found it in micks desk penellin looked the paper over handed it back i dont know what i wanted he said and gave a low selfderisive laugh i think i was looking for a typed confession this is more design than confession st james admitted what does it mean only mark could verify it but i think it represents the original deal the two of them struck together k would signify the cost of the original purchase of cocaine a kilo for theyd split that between them to sell which is what the second line tells us grams for each of them at per gram their profit each and next to their profit the particular talent each of them would bring to the plan mp mark would provide the transport in order to procure the drug hed take the daze and meet the dealer mc mick would provide the initial financing from the bank loan hed secured in order to purchase new equipment for the newspaper and mick covered himself by beginning those initial equipment purchases so noones suspicions would be aroused then it fell apart penellin said perhaps it could be that the cocaine didnt sell as well as they thought it would and he lost money on the deal perhaps things didnt work out between the partners or there may have been a doublecross somewhere down the line or the other penellin said go ahead with the other thats why youre in here john isnt it lynley asked thats why youre saying nothing thats why youre taking the blame he must have discovered how easy it was penellin said he didnt need mick once hed made the initial purchase did he why bother with an added person whod expect part of the profits john you cant take the blame for cambreys death marks only twentytwo that doesnt matter you didnt penellin cut lynley short by speaking to st james how did you know it was mark the daze we thought peter had taken her to get away from howenstow but the boat was northeast on the rocks at penberth cove so she had to be returning to howenstow not leaving and shed been there for several hours when we arrived so there was plenty of time for mark to abandon her to make his way back to howenstow and be ready somewhat banged up admittedly to help us search for peter hed have needed to abandon her penellin said numbly the cocaine gave him good enough reason to do so if anyone at penberth phoned the coastguard hed be in serious trouble better risk his life by jumping ship near the shore than risk a gaol sentence by getting caught with a kilogram of cocaine on the boat john lynley said insistently youve got to tell boscowan the truth about all of this about friday night levelly penellin looked at him and what of mark he asked lynley didnt reply penellins features became a wash of anguish i cant do what you ask of me hes my son nancy was working in front of the lodge while molly cooed in a pram nearby gurgling over a string of bright plastic ducks which her mother had suspended above her when lynley pulled the car to a halt on the drive nancy looked up she was raking up the foliage flowers loose pebbles and debris that the wind had blown up against the house no word of peter she asked walking towards them as they got out of the car is mark here nancy she faltered the fact that lynley had not answered her question seemed to disconcert her at the same time as it acted as presage of an unpleasantness to come she drew the rake to her side holding it upright did mark fix the shutters for you last night lynley asked the shutters her two simple words were verification enough is he in the house st james asked i think hes just gone out he said he was planning to a sudden blast of rockandroll music negated her words she brought a fist to her lips weve spoken to your father lynley told her youve no need to protect mark any longer its time he told the truth leaving her in the garden they went into the house following the sound of drums and guitars in the direction of the kitchen where mark sat at the table making adjustments to his portable stereo as he had done in the early hours of saturday morning following mick cambreys death st james noted the details about the boy then they had suggested the possibility of his taking money from gull cottage upon discovering his brotherinlaws death now they acted in concert to corroborate his part in the cocaine partnership a heavy gold chain round his right wrist a new watch round his left designer blue jeans and shirt snakeskin boots the stereo itself not one of them was the sort of possession one would purchase on the salary his father paid him to work round the estate on the table sat a halfeaten ham sandwich a bottle of beer a bag of vinegar crisps this latter provided the air with a pungent smell mark dipped into it for a handful looked up and saw the other two men in the doorway he turned down the volume on the stereo and got to his feet dropping the crisps onto his plate whats wrong he asked is it peter is he all right he ran the heel of his hand against his temple as if to straighten his hair it was neatly combed as usual weve not come about my brother said lynley mark frowned i havent heard a thing nance phoned your mother she said there was no word have you is there something he held out a hand a gesture of camaraderie st james wondered how lynley would get past the boys posturing he had his answer when his friend swept the stereo from the table so forcefully that it crashed against the kitchen cupboards and gouged the wood hey as mark began to move lynley came round the table he pushed the boy into his chair marks head snapped back against the wall what the hell you can talk to me or penzance cid make up your mind quick comprehension darted across the boys face he rubbed his collarbone nevertheless he merely said youre daft lynley tossed the talisman sandwich wrapper onto the table whats it to be make up your mind marks expression was unchanging as he glanced at the paper at the numbers the notations at his own initials he snorted a laugh youre in heavy shit over brookes death arent you youd do anything to keep the police from looking into that youre trying to keep the coppers off peter were not here about peter no i dare say lets not talk about peter or you might hear the truth well you cant have me arrested for anything you dont have a shred of evidence you took the daze from lamorna you abandoned her off penberth my guess is that the reason why is sitting right here in this house or perhaps in the mill how does felony theft sound what about smuggling possession of narcotics we can start with any one of them ill put my money on boscowans willingness to listen to just about anything to get your father out of the nick i rather doubt hes as sentimental about you so shall i give him a ring or shall we talk mark looked away on the floor his stereo was giving off bursts of static what do you want to know the question was sullen whos dealing the cocaine me mick youve been using the mill it was micks idea hed spent most of last spring boffing nancy in the loft he knew noone ever went there and the daze free transport no overheads nothing to cut into the profits what profits nancy claims they have no money we turned the take around from the first go last march and reinvested in another buy a bigger one this time a smile pulled at his mouth he didnt bother to conceal it thank god the stuff was wrapped in oilskins otherwise itd be sitting in penberth cove at the moment making the fish as happy as hell to be there as it is he dumped more crisps on his plate mickll miss out on the profits convenient for you that hes dead mark was unimpressed am i supposed to blanch with fear at the implication oops the poor berks just given himself a motive for murder he took a bite from his sandwich chewed it deliberately and washed it down with a swallow of beer lets avoid the drama i was in st ives friday night no doubt with someone whod be only too happy to step forward and confirm that fact mark maintained his bravado sure no problem honour among drugdealers a man needs to know his friends peter was one once mark studied his fingernails the stereo squawked st james switched it off did you sell to my brother when he had the money when did you last see him ive told you before theres no change in the story friday afternoon at the cove he phoned the lodge earlier and said he wanted to see me i had to hunt the bloody ass down as it was jesus i dont even know why i bothered what did he want what he always wanted dope on credit did he know how you were using the mill lynley asked mark gave a sardonic laugh in response dyou think id tell him that and have him slobbering down my neck for free samples every time i was working there we may be old mates but i like to think i know where to draw the line where is he lynley asked mark was silent lynley crashed his fist on to the table top where is he wheres my brother mark pushed his arm away i dont know all right i bloody dont know dead with a needle in his arm most likely tommy st james admonition came too late lynley dragged the boy to his feet he threw him against the wall pressed his arm against his larynx and held him there you piece of filth he said god damn you ill be back he dropped him abruptly and left the room mark stood for a moment rubbing his throat he brushed at the collar of his shirt as if to remove any trace of lynleys quick assault stooping he picked up his stereo put it back on the table and began to play with its knobs st james left him he found lynley in the car his hands gripping the wheel nancy and her baby were gone were their victims lynley stared at the drive that wound towards the great house shadows dappled it a breeze danced sycamore leaves across the lane were all of us their victims i as much as anyone st james no more than anyone because im supposed to be a professional st james saw the conflicts that confronted his friend the ties of blood the call of duty responsibility to family betrayal of self he waited for lynley always at heart an honest man to put his struggle into words i should have told boscowan that peter was at gull cottage on friday night i should have told him that mick was alive after john left him i should have told him about the row about brooke about everything but god help me i couldnt st james whats happening to me youre trying to deal with peter with nancy with john with mark with everyone tommy the walls are crashing in well sort it out lynley looked at him then his dark eyes seemed filmed over by a mist do you believe that he asked ive got to believe something actually islingtonlondon is its formal name lady helen said islingtonlondon ltd its a pharmaceutical company st james attention was on the section of the garden that he could still see in the growing darkness he stood in the small alcove of the drawing room while behind him lady asherton lynley and cotter drank their evening coffee deborah and i went there this morning lady helen continued in the background st james heard deborahs voice followed by her laughter light and engaging yes all right darling lady helen said to her and then to st james deborahs most unforgiving about the fact that i wore my fox fur well perhaps i was just a bit overdressed for the occasion but the ensemble did make a statement i think and besides as far as im concerned if ones going to do anything incognita one ought to do it well dont you agree decidedly and it was a success the receptionist even asked me if id come about a job senior director of project testing sounds absolutely divine have i a future in it st james smiled into the telephone i suppose it depends upon what projects being tested what about tina whats the connection there doesnt seem to be one at all we described her to the receptionist and what a blessing to have deborah there because her eye for detail not to mention her memory is quite remarkable but the girl hadnt a clue she didnt recognize the description at all lady helen paused as deborah interjected a comment in the background she went on to say considering what tina apparently looks like its hard to believe anyone would forget her although the girl did ask if she might be a biochemist that seems a bit farfetched hm it does except that deborah did tell me about a drink shes developed a health drink perhaps tina hoped to sell it to the pharmaceutical company unlikely helen i suppose so shed go to a beverage company with it wouldnt she thats more probable has anyone heard from her has she returned not yet i spent part of the afternoon going to each flat in the building to see if anyone knew anything about where she might be no luck i take it none at all noone seems to know her very well in fact deborah appears to be the only person whos had any close contact with her aside from a peculiar woman across the hall who loaned her an iron several people have seen her about of course shes lived here since september but noones spent any time talking to her besides deborah st james jotted the word september into his notes he underlined it drew a circle round it he topped the circle with a cross the symbol of woman he scribbled over it all what next lady helen was asking see if the building manager has a cornish address for her st james said you might try to find out what she pays for the flat quite i should have thought to ask that earlier although heaven knows why are we getting anywhere st james sighed i dont know have you spoken to sidney thats a problem simon ive been phoning her flat but theres no answer i tried her agency but theyve not heard from her either did she talk about going to see friends no she talked about going home ill keep trying then dont worry she may have gone to cheyne row st james thought this unlikely we need to find her helen tu pop round to her flat she may not be answering the phone having secured this assurance st james rang off he remained in the alcove staring down at the scribbled mess hed made of the word september he wanted it to mean something he knew that it probably did but what that something was he could not have said he turned as lynley came into the alcove anything st james related the bits of information which lady helen had managed to gather that day he saw the change in lynleys expression after hed heard the very first fact islingtonlondon he asked are you sure of that st james helen went there why does it mean something to you warily lynley glanced back into the drawing room his mother and cotter were chatting together quietly as they looked through a family album which lay between them tommy what is it roderick trenarrow he works for islingtonpenzance part five identities then mick must have left both of those telephone numbers in tina cogins flat st james said trenarrows as well as islingtons that explains why trenarrow didnt know who tina was lynley didnt reply until hed made the turn into beaufort street to head in the general direction of paddington they had just dropped cotter at st james cheyne row house where hed greeted the sight of that brick building like a prodigal son scurrying inside with a suitcase in each hand and undisguised wholehearted relief buoying his footsteps it was ten past one in the afternoon their drive into the city from the airfield in surrey had been plagued by a snarl of slowmoving traffic the product of a summer fete near buckland which apparendy was drawing record crowds do you think rodericks involved in this business st james took note not only of the dispassionate tone of lynleys question but also of the fact that hed deliberately phrased it to leave out the word murder at the same time he saw the manner in which his friend attended to the driving as he spoke both hands high on the steering wheel eyes fixed straight ahead he knew only the barest details of lynleys past relationship with trenarrow all of them circling round a general antipathy that had its roots in lady ashertons enduring relationship with the man lynley would need something to compensate for that dislike if trenarrow was even tangentially involved in the deaths in cornwall and it seemed that hed chosen scrupulous impartiality as a means of counterbalancing the animosity that coloured his long association with the man i suppose he could be even if only unconsciously st james told him about his meeting with trenarrow about the interview mick cambrey had done with him but if mick was working on a story that led to his death trenarrow may have merely given him a lead perhaps the name of someone at islingtonlondon with information mick needed but if as you say there were no notes in the newspaper office from any story connected to roderick lynley braked at traffic lights it would have been natural to look at st james he did not do so what does that suggest to you i didnt say there were no notes about him tommy i said there was no story about him or about anything relating to cancer research thats a different matter from an absence of notes there may be hundreds of notes for all we know harry cambrey was the one who looked through micks files i had no chance to do so so the information may still be there with harry unable to recognize its importance quite but the story itself whatever it was if its even connected to micks death may have nothing to do with trenarrow directly he may just be a source lynley looked at him then you didnt want to phone him st james why st james watched a woman push a pram across the street a small child clung to the hem of her dress the traffic lights changed cars and lorries began to move mick may have been on the trail of a story that caused his death you know as well as i that it makes no sense to alert anyone to the fact that we may be on the trail as well so you do think rodericks involved not necessarily probably not at all but he could inadvertently give the word to someone who is why phone him and allow for that chance lynley spoke as if he hadnt heard st james words if he is st james if he is he turned the bentley right into the fulham road they passed the dress shops and antique dealers the bistros and restaurants of trendy london where the streets were peopled by fashionably dressed shoppers and trimlooking matrons on their way to rendezvous we dont have all the facts yet tommy theres no sense in tormenting yourself about it now again st james words seemed to make no difference it would destroy my mother lynley said they drove on to paddington deborah met them in the small lobby of the shrewsbury court apartments where she had apparently been waiting for them pacing back and forth across the black and white tiles she pulled the door open before theyd had a chance to ring the bell dad phoned to tell me you were on your way tommy are you all right dad said theres still been no sign of peter lynleys response was to say her name like a sigh he drew her to him what a mess this weekends been for you im sorry deb if s all right its nothing st james looked past them the sign concierge on a nearby door was done in calligraphy he noted but the hand was inexpert and the dot above the i had blurred and become a part of the second c he examined this considered this each letter each detail keeping his eyes fastened to the sign until deborah spoke helens waiting up above she moved with lynley towards the lift they found lady helen on the telephone in deborahs flat she was saying nothing merely listening and from her look in his direction and the expression on her face when she replaced the receiver st james realized whom she had been trying to reach sidney he asked her i cant find her simon her agency gave me a list of names friends of hers but noones heard a word i just tried her flat again nothing ive phoned your mother as well but theres no answer there shall i keep trying her cold prickling ran its way down st james spine no shell only worry lady helen spoke again ive begun to think about justin brookes death she didnt need to say more st james own thoughts had made that same leap forward the moment she told him that his sister had still not turned up again he cursed himself for allowing sidney to leave cornwall alone if she had walked into danger if she was hurt in any way he felt the fingers of his right hand dig into his palm he forced them to relax has tina cogin returned not yet then perhaps we ought to make certain about the key he looked at lynley have you brought them brought them lady helen asked blankly harry cambreys managed to get us micks set of keys from boscowan lynley explained we wanted to see if one of them might unlock tinas door he kept them in suspense only as long as it took to get to the next flat to insert and turn the proper key in the lock he swung the door open they walked inside all right he had his own key lady helen said but really tommy where does that get us it cant be a surprise we already knew hed been here deborah told us that so all we know beyond that fact is that he was special enough to tina cogin to merit a key to her door it changes the nature of their relationship helen this obviously isnt a call girl and her client prostitutes dont generally give out their keys from his position near the tiny kitchen st james was scrutinizing the room its furnishings were expensive but they told little about the inhabitant and there were no personal objects on display no photographs no mementoes no collection of any kind indeed the entire bedsitting room had the look of having been put together by a decorator for a hotel he walked to the desk the red light of the answering machine was blinking indicating a message he pushed the button a mans voice said colin sage im phoning about the advert and he gave a number for a return call a second message was much the same st james wrote down the numbers and gave them to lady helen an advertisement she asked that cant be how she makes her arrangements you said there was a savings book st james replied deborah came to his side here she said theres this as well from a drawer she took both the savings book and a manila folder he looked at the latter first frowning down at the neatly typed list of names and addresses mostly london the furthest was brighton behind him he heard lynley going through the chest of drawers what is this meditatively st james asked the question of himself but deborah replied we thought of clients at first but of course that cant be there are women on the list and even if there werent any women at all its hard to imagine anyone managing to she hesitated st james looked up her cheeks had coloured service this many men he asked well of course shes indicated on the tab that theyre just prospects hasnt she so at first we thought that she was using the list to before we actually opened up the file and saw i mean how exactly would a prostitute build up a clientele through word of mouth her colour deepened lord is that a dreadful sort of pun he chuckled at the question what did you imagine she was doing with this list sending out brochures deborah gave a rueful laugh im hopeless at this sort of thing a hundred clues shrieking to be noticed and i cant make sense of a single one i thought youd decided she wasnt a prostitute i thought wed all decided that its just something about the way she talked and her appearance perhaps we can let go of whatever her appearance might have suggested lynley said across the room he stood at the wardrobe with lady helen at his side he had taken down the four hatboxes from the top shelf had opened and placed them on the floor in a line he was bending over one of these separating the folds of white tissue paper from the centre of the nest which the paper created he withdrew a wig long black hair wispy fringe he balanced it on his fist deborah gaped at it lady helen sighed wonderful she said the woman actually wears a wig so what little we know of her not to mention deborahs description must be virtually meaningless shes a chimera isnt she false fingernails false hair she glanced at the chest of drawers something seemed to occur to her for she went to them pulled one open and fingered through the undergarments she held up a black brassiere false everything else st james joined them he took the wig from lynley and carried it to the window where he opened the curtains and held it under the natural light the texture told him that the hair was real did you know she wore a wig deb lynley asked no of course not how could i have known its a highquality piece st james said youd have no cause to think it a wig he examined it closely running his fingers across the inner webbing as he did so a hair came loose not one of those which comprised the wig but another shorter hair that had detached itself from the wearer becoming caught up in the webbing st james plucked it completely free held it up to the light and handed the wig back to lynley what is it simon lady helen asked he didnt reply at once instead he stared at the single hair between his fingers realizing what it had to imply and coming to terms with what that implication had to mean there was only one explanation that made any sense only one explanation that accounted for tina cogins disappearance still he took a moment to test his theory have you worn this deborah i no what makes you think that at the desk he took a piece of white paper from the top drawer he placed the hair on this and carried both back to the light the hair he said its red he looked up at deborah and saw her expression change from wonder to realization is it possible he asked her for since she was the only one who had seen them both she was also the only one who could possibly confirm it oh simon im no good at this i dont know i dont know but you saw her you were with her she gave you a drink the drink deborah said she dashed from the room in a moment the others heard her door crash back against the wall of her flat lady helen spoke what is it you cant possibly be thinking deborah has anything to do with all this the womans incognita thats all it is plain and simple shes been in disguise st james placed the piece of paper on the desk he placed the hair on top of it he heard over and over that single word incognita incognita what a monumental joke my god he said she was telling everyone she met tina cogin tina cogin the names a bloody anagram deborah flew into the room in one hand the photograph she had brought with her from cornwall in the other hand a small card she handed both to st james turn them over she said he didnt have to do so he knew already that the handwriting would be identical on each its the card she gave me simon the recipe for her drink and on the back of micks picture lynley joined them taking the card and the photograph from st james god almighty he murmured what on earth is it lady helen asked the reason harry cambreys been building micks reputation as a real mans man i should guess st james said deborah poured boiling water into the teapot and carried it to the small oak table which they had moved into the sitting area of her flat they took places round it deborah and lynley sitting on the day bed lady helen and st james on ladderback chairs st james picked up the savings book which lay among the other items attached to mick cambreys life and his death the manila folder entitled prospects the card upon which hed written the phone number of islingtonlondon the talisman sandwich wrapper his photograph the recipe for the drink which hed given to deborah on the day that hed appeared as tina cogin at her door these ten withdrawals from the account lady helen said pointing to them they match what tina what mick cambrey paid in rent and the time works right with the facts simon september to june long before he and mark began dealing in cocaine lynley said so thats not how he got the money for the flat deborah asked not according to mark lady helen ran her finger down the page which listed the deposits she said but hes put money in every two weeks for a year where on earth did it come from st james flipped to the front of the book scanning the entries obviously he had another source of income the amount of money comprising each deposit st james saw was not consistent sometimes it was significant other times barely so thus he discounted the second possibility that had risen in his mind upon noting the regularity of the payments into micks account they couldnt be the result of blackmail blackmailers generally increase the cost of suppressing a damaging piece of information greed feeds on itself easy money begs for more beyond that lynley said mark told us that theyd reinvested their profits in a second larger buy his taking the daze on sunday confirms that story deborah poured the tea st james scooped up his customary four spoonfuls of sugar before lady helen shuddered and handed the bowl to deborah she picked up the manila folder mick must have been selling his share of the cocaine in london surely if hed been doing so in nanrunnel someone would have discovered it eventually mrs swann for instance i can hardly think she would have let something like that go unnoticed that makes sense lynley agreed he had a reputation as a journalist in cornwall hed hardly have jeopardized it by selling cocaine there when he could just as easily have done so here but ive got the impression he had a reputation here in london as well st james said hed worked here hadnt he before returning to cornwall but not as tina cogin deborah pointed out surely he must have sold the drugs as a woman he became tina in september lady helen said he took this flat in september he began selling the following march plenty of time to amass a list of buyers she tapped her fingers against the folder we were wondering what was meant by prospects werent we perhaps now we know shall we see what sort of prospects these really are if theyre prospective cocaine buyers lynley said theyre hardly going to admit the fact lady helen smiled serenely not to the police tommy darling of course st james knew what that angelic smile meant if anyone could wrangle information from a total stranger it would be lady helen lighthearted chitchat leading down the primrose path to disclosure and cooperation was her special talent she had already proved that with the caretaker of shrewsbury court apartments obtaining the key to micks flat had been childs play for her this list of prospects was merely one step advanced a moderate challenge she would become sister helen from the salvation army or helen the saved from a drug rehabilitation programme or helen the desperate looking for a score but ultimately in some way she would ferret out the truth if mick was selling in london a buyer may have followed him to cornwall st james said but if he was selling as tina how would someone know who he really was deborah asked perhaps he was recognized perhaps a buyer who knew him as mick saw him when he was posing as tina and followed him to cornwall why blackmail what better way to get cocaine if the buyer was having a hard time coming up with the money why not blackmail cambrey for a payment in drugs st james picked up items one by one he studied them fingered them dropped them back on the table but cambrey wouldnt want to risk his reputation in cornwall by giving in to the blackmail so he and the buyer argued he was hit he struck his head and died the buyer took the money that was in the cottage sitting room anyone whos desperate for drugs and whos just killed a man is hardly going to draw the line at taking money lying right in the open lynley got up abruptly he walked to the open window and leaned on the sill looking down at the street too late st james recognized whose portrait he had been painting with his series of conjectures could he have known about mick lynley asked noone answered at first instead they listened to the rising sound of traffic in sussex gardens as afternoon commuters began to make their way towards the edgware road an engine revved brakes screeched in reply lynley repeated the question he did not turn from the window could my brother have known possibly tommy st james said when lynley swung to face him he went on reluctantly he was part of the drug network in london sidney saw him not that long ago in soho at night in an alley he paused thoughtfully remembering the information his sister had given him remembering her fanciful description of the woman peter had been assaulting dressed all in black with flowing black hair he had the impression that lady helen was recalling this information even as he did for she spoke with what seemed a determination to relieve lynleys anxiety by looking for another focus for the crime micks death might revolve round something entirely different weve thought that from the first and i dont think we ought to dismiss it now he was a journalist after all he might have been writing a story he could even have been working on something about transvestites st james shook his head he wasnt writing about transvestites he was a transvestite the expense of the flat tells us that the furniture the womans wardrobe he wouldnt need all that just to gather information for a story and theres the newspaper office to consider as well with harry cambrey finding the underwear in micks desk not to mention the row the two of them had harry knew he seems to have figured it out lady helen fingered the talisman wrapper as if with the resolution of making yet another effort to put lynleys mind at rest yet harry was sure it was a story it might have been a story weve still got the connection to islingtonlondon perhaps mick was investigating a drug of some kind deborah offered a drug that wasnt ready to be marketed yet lady helen took up her thought one with sideeffects one thats already available to doctors with the company poohpoohing the possibility of problems lynley came back to the table they looked at one another struck by the plausibility of this bit of idle conjecture thalidomide thorough testing regulations and restrictions had so far precluded the possibility of another teratogenic nightmare but men were greedy when it came to fast profits men had always been so what if in researching an entirely different subject mick got wind of something suspicious st james proposed he pursued it here he interviewed people here at islingtonlondon and that was the cause of his death in spite of their efforts lynley did not join them but the castration he sank down on to the day bed rubbing his forehead we cant seem to turn in any direction that explains it all as if to underscore the futility behind his words the telephone began to ring deborah went to answer it lynley was back on his feet an instant after she spoke peter where on earth are you what is it i cant understand peter please youve called where wait hes right here lynley lunged for the phone damn you where have you been dont you know that brooke shut up and listen to me for once peter brookes dead as well as mick i dont care what you want any longer what lynley stopped his body was rigid his voice all at once was perfectly calm are you certain listen to me peter you must pull yourself together i understand but you mustnt touch anything do you understand me peter dont touch anything leave her alone now give me your address all right yes ive got it ill be there at once he replaced the phone it seemed that entire minutes passed before he turned back to the others somethings happened to sasha i think hes on something lynley said which would explain st james thought why lynley had insisted that deborah and helen remain behind he wouldnt want either of them to see his brother in that condition especially deborah what happened lynley pulled the car into sussex gardens cursing when a taxi cut him off he headed towards the bayswater road veering through radnor place and half a dozen side streets to avoid the worst of the afternoon crush i dont know he kept screaming that she was on the bed that she wasnt moving that he thought she was dead you didnt want him to phone for an ambulance christ he could be hallucinating st james he sounded like someone going through the dts damn and blast this bloody traffic where is he tommy whitechapel it took them nearly an hour to get there battling their way through a virtual traffic jam of cars lorries buses and taxis lynley knew the city well enough to run through countless side streets and alleys but everytime they emerged on to a main artery their progress was frustrated again midway down new oxford street he spoke im at fault here ive done everything but buy the drugs for him dont be absurd i wanted him to have the best of everything i never asked him to stand on his own what hes become is the result im at fault here st james the real sickness is mine st james gazed out of the window and sought a reply he thought about the energy people expend in seeking to avoid what they most need to face they fill their lives with distraction and denial only to find at an unexpected eleventh hour that there is in reality no absolute escape how long had lynley been engaged in avoidance how long had he himself done the same thing it had become a habit with both of them in scrupulously avoiding what they needed to say to each other they had learned to adopt evasion in every significant area of their lives he said not everything in life is your responsibility tommy my mother said practically the same thing the other night she was right you punish yourself at times when others bear equal responsibility dont do that now lynley shot him a quick look the accident theres that as well isnt there youve tried to take the burden from my shoulders all these years but you never will not completely i drove the car st james no matter what other facts exist to attenuate my guilt the primary fact remains i drove the car that night and when it was over i walked away you didnt ive not blamed you you dont need to do so i blame myself he turned off new oxford street and they began another series of sidestreet and backalley runs edging them closer to the city and to whitechapel which lay just beyond it but at least i must let go of blaming myself for peter if im not to go mad the best step i can take in that direction at the moment is to swear to you that no matter what we find when we get to him it shall be peters responsibility not mine they found the building in a narrow street directly off brick lane where a shouting group of pakistani children were playing football with a cavedin ball they were using four plastic rubbish sacks for goalposts but one sack had split open and its contents lay about smashed and trodden under the childrens feet the sight of the bentley called an abrupt halt to the game and st james and lynley climbed out of the car into a curious circle of faces the air was heavy not only with the apprehension that accompanies the appearance of strangers in a closely knit neighbourhood but also with the smell of old coffee grounds rotting vegetables and fruit gone bad the shoes of the football players contributed largely to this pungent odour they appeared to be caked with organic refuse whas up one of the children murmured dunno another replied some motor that in it a third more enterprising than the others stepped forward with an offer to watch the motor fr you mister keep this lot off it he nodded his head towards the rest of the crew lynley raised his hand slightly a response which the boy seemed to take as affirmation for he posted himself with one hand on the bonnet the other on his hip and one grubby foot on the bumper they had parked directly in front of peters building a narrow structure five floors high originally its bricks had been painted white but time soot and lack of interest had dirtied them to a repellent grey the woodwork of windows and front door appeared to have been untouched for decades where handsome blue paint had once made a pleasing contrast to the white of the bricks mere flecks remained azure spots like freckles on a skin being eaten by age the fact that someone on the third floor had tried to ease the aspect of the building by planting freesias in a splintered window box did nothing to combat the general feeling of poverty and decay they climbed the four front steps to the door it stood open above it the words last few days had been sprayed on to the bricks with red paint they seemed a suitable epigraph he said hes on the first floor lynley said and headed for the stairs once covered with a cheap linoleum they were worn through in the centre to the black backing and the edges that remained were crusted with a combination of old wax and new dirt large greasy discolourations splodged the stairway walls which were pockmarked with bolt holes where once a handrail had been mounted handprints covered them as well as an enormous gravylike stain which oozed down from an upper floor on the landing a dusty pram tilted on three wheels surrounded by several sacks of rubbish two tin pails a broom and a blackened mop a gaunt cat ribs showing and an ulcerated sore in the middle of its forehead slunk by them as they climbed upwards assailed by the odour of garlic and urine in the uncarpeted first floor corridor the building came to life televisions music voices raised in an argument a babys sudden wail the discordant sounds of people going about the daily business of living this was not the case in peters flat however which they found at the far end of the corridor where a grimy window admitted a weak shaft of light from the street the door was shut but neither closed nor latched so when lynley knocked it swung inwards to reveal a single room whose windows closed and covered by bedsheets seemed to entrap the odours of the entire building mingling them with the stronger stench of unwashed bodies and dirty clothes although the room was not altogether much smaller than the bedsit they had just left in paddington the contrast was unnerving there was virtually no furniture instead three large stained pillows lay on the floor among discarded newspapers and open magazines in lieu of either wardrobe or chest of drawers a single chair held a pile of unfolded clothing which spilled down to four cardboard cartons in which more clothing lay upended fruit packing crates served as tables and a shadeless floor lamp provided the room with light lynley said nothing at all as they entered for a moment he didnt move from the threshold as if he were summoning the strength of purpose to shut the door behind them and face the truth he pushed the door closed so that nothing further obstructed their line of vision against the near wall a threadbare sofa had been folded out into a bed on this a partially shrouded figure lay motionless on the floor just beyond the sofa peter lynley was curled into a foetal position his hands curved round his head peter lynley went to him kneeled cried his name again as if roused by the sound peter gasped and made a convulsive movement his eyes focused found his brother she wont move he stuffed part of his tshirt into his mouth for a moment as if in an attempt to prevent himself from crying i came home and she was there and she wont move whats happened lynley asked she wont move tommy i came home and she was there and she wont move st james went to the sofa he removed the sheet which covered most of the figure beneath it sasha lay naked on her side on the filthy linen with one arm stretched out and one hand dangling from the edge of the bed her thin hair fell forward to cover her face and where her neck was exposed its flesh looked grey with dirt he put his fingers to her outstretched arm although even as he did so he knew the exercise was mere rote formality hed once been a member of the mets crimescene team this wasnt the first time hed looked upon a dead body he straightened and shook his head at lynley the other man came to join him st james pushed the fallen hair to one side and moved the arm gently to check for rigor he took a step back however when he saw the hypodermic needle embedded in her flesh overdose lynley said whats she taken peter he went back to his brother st james remained with the body the hypodermic he noticed was empty the plunger down as if shed mainlined a substance that had lolled her in an instant it was hard to believe he looked for some indication of what she had taken to bring about such a death there was nothing on the packing crate next to the bed save an empty glass with a tarnished spoon inside it and a residue of white powder on its rim the bed itself held nothing other than the corpse he stepped back looking on the floor between the bed and the crate and then with a rush of horror he saw it a silver bottle lay on its side almost out of sight it spilled forth a white powder undoubtedly the same substance which clung to the rim of the glass the same substance which ended sasha niffords life unprepared for the sight st james felt his heart begin to pound he felt burned all at once by a sudden heat he refused to believe it the bottle was sidneys get control of yourself peter lynley was saying to his brother he took peters arm pulling him to his feet peter clung to him weeping whats she taken st james stared at the bottle he could hear sidneys voice with utter clarity she might have been standing right there in the room we drove him home she had said squalid little flat in whitechapel and then later more damning and completely undeniable just tell little peter when you find him that i have lots to discuss with him believe me i can hardly wait for the opportunity in the light from the lamp the bottle glinted winking at him and demanding recognition he gave it admitted it without hesitation for from where he stood st james could see part of the engraving that comprised her initials and hed insisted upon the delicacy of that engraving himself because hed given the bottle to his sister four years ago on her twentyfirst birthday you were my favourite brother i loved you best there was no time he did not have the luxury in which to consider his various options and weigh the relative morality of each he could only act or let her face the police he chose to act bending reaching out his hand good youve found it lynley said coming to his side it looks like he suddenly seemed to recognize the significance of st james posture of his outstretched hand certainly st james thought from the chill that had rapidly followed the heat in his body lynley must have seen something in the pallor of his face for directly after his words faded away lynley drew st james back from the bed dont protect him for my sake he said quietly thats finished st james i meant what i said in the car if its heroin i can only help peter by allowing him to face the consequences im going to telephone the met he walked from the room heat returned a wave of it st james felt it on his face and in his joints oblivious of peter who leaned against the wall weeping into his hands he moved woodenly to the window he fumbled behind the bedsheet curtain to open it only to find that some time in the past it had been painted shut the room was stifling less than twentyfour hours he thought the bottle was marked with the silversmiths identification a small fanciful escutcheon worked into its base it wouldnt take long for the police to trace the piece back to jermyn street where hed bought it then it would be a simple matter they would go through the files and look at orders these they would compare to the bottle itself after making some telephone calls to patrons they would follow up with discreet enquiries at those patrons homes the most he could hope for was twentyfour hours dimly he heard lynleys voice speaking into the telephone in the hallway and nearer the sound of peters weeping above that the harsh grating of stertorous breathing rose and fell he recognized it as his own theyre on their way lynley closed the door behind him he crossed the room are you all right st james yes quite to prove this beyond doubt he moved it took an effort of will away from the window lynley had dumped the clothes from the rooms only chair and placed it at the foot of the bed its back towards the body the police are on their way he repeated firmly he led his brother to the chair and sat him down theres a bottle of something over by the sofa thats likely to get you arrested peter weve only a few minutes to talk i didnt see a bottle it isnt mine peter wiped his nose on his arm tell me what happened where have you been since saturday night peter squinted as if the light hurt his eyes ive been nowhere dont play games with me games im telling youre on your own in this are you capable of understanding that youre entirely on your own so you can tell me the truth or talk to the police frankly i dont care one way or the other im telling you the truth weve been nowhere but here how long have you been back since saturday sunday i dont know i dont remember what time did you arrive after dawn what time i dont know the time what difference does it make the difference it makes is that justin brookes dead but youre lucky for the moment because the police seem to believe it was an accident peters mouth twisted and you think i killed him what about mick are you setting me up for that as well tommy his voice broke when he said his brothers name he began to cry again thin body racked by the force of dry sobs he covered his face with his hands his fingernails were bitten crusted with dirt you always think the worst of me dont you st james saw that lynley was preparing for verbal battle he spoke to intervene youre going to be asked a great many questions peter in the long run it might be easier to answer them with tommy so that he can help you rather than with someone you dont even know i cant talk to him peter sobbed he wont listen to me im nothing to him how can you say that lynley demanded hotly because its true and you know it you just buy me off its what youve always done you were there with the chequebook all right because that was easy for you you didnt have to be involved but you were never there never once in my life for anything else he leaned forward in the chair his arms cradling his stomach his head on his knees i was six years old when he got sick tommy i was seven when you left i was twelve when he died do you know what that was like can you even imagine it and all i had all i had damn you was poor old roderick doing what he could to be a father to me whenever he thought he could get away with it but always in secret because you might find out lynley pushed him upright so you turned to drugs and its all my fault dont put that on me dont you dare i put nothing on you his brother spat back i despise you you think i dont know it every second you breathe is a second you live to hurt me you even took deborahs cameras to get back at me didnt you thats really rich tommy get out of here will you leave me to the police st james forced himself to intercede desperate to get the information he needed what did she take peter he asked where did she get it peter scrubbed his face on his tattered tshirt it was ancient faded bearing the figure of a skeleton a cluster of roses and the words grateful dead i dont know i was out where lynley demanded peter shot him a contemptuous look buying bread and eggs he flung his hand towards the string bag that lay on the floor by the wall the two items within it he directed the rest of his answer to st james when i came back she was like that i thought she was asleep at first but then i could tell i could see he faltered lips trembling i rang tommys office but they said he wasnt there i rang his house but denton said he was still in cornwall i rang cornwall but hodge said he was in london i why were you looking for me lynley asked peter dropped his hands he stared at the floor youre my brother he said hollowly lynley looked as if his heart were being torn from his chest why do you do these things peter why god why what does it matter st james heard the sirens they had made good time but then they would have had the advantage of being able to clear away traffic with those shrieking alarms and flashing lights he spoke quickly determined to know the worst theres a silver container by the bed could it be sashas peter gave a short laugh hardly if she owned a piece of silver we would have sold it long ago she never showed it to you you never saw it among her things she never said where she got it never there was time for nothing more the noise of the arriving police swelled to a crescendo then ceased abruptly st james went to the window and pushed back the curtain to see two panda cars two unmarked police cars and one van pulling up behind the bentley they took up most of the street the children had scattered leaving the rubbishsack goalposts behind while a uniformed constable remained at the front of the building tying the police line from the hand rail on the front steps to a nearby lamp post the rest of the group entered from his own years at the yard st james recognized most of them either by name or by function two cid detectives the scenesofcrime team a photographer the forensic pathologist it was unusual for all of them to effect an arrival at the same time so there was no doubt that they knew it was a colleague who had placed the call that would be why lynley had telephoned the met in the first place and not the local station bishopsgate in whose jurisdiction whitechapel lay while he intended peter to face whatever consequences grew from sasha niffords death he did not intend that his brother should face them without his own indirect participation it was one thing to swear off assisting peter if drugs were involved it was quite another to leave him to his fate in a situation that could possibly turn into an investigation of an entirely different nature for if peter had known about the drugs if he had passed them on to sasha if he had even helped her to take them intending to shoot up himself upon his return from the market these were all possibilities of which st james knew that lynley was well aware and they could all be moulded into various degrees of homicide lynley would want the entire investigation handled by a team he could trust so hed called the met st james wondered which officer in victoria street was phoning the bishopsgate station right now with the explanation of why scotland yard were invading a foreign patch the officers pounded up the stairs lynley met them at the door angus he said to the man at the head of the group he was detective inspector angus macpherson a hefty scot who habitually wore old worsted suits that looked as if they doubled at night as his pyjamas he nodded at lynley and walked to the bed the other officer followed him removing a small notebook from her shoulder bag and a ballpoint pen from the breast pocket of her rumpled puce blouse detective sergeant barbara havers macphersons partner st james knew them both what hae we here macpherson murmured he fingered the bed sheet and looked over his shoulder as the rest of the team crowded into the room ye havena moved anything tommy just the sheet she was covered when we got here i covered her peter said i thought she was asleep sergeant havers raised an expressive disbelieving eyebrow she wrote in her notebook she looked from lynley to his brother to the corpse on the bed i went to buy eggs and bread peter said when i got back lynley stepped behind his brother dropping his hand to peters shoulder it was enough to still him havers glanced their way again when you got back she spoke entirely without inflection peter looked at his brother as if for guidance first his tongue then his teeth sought his upper lip she was like that peter said lynleys fingers whitened on his brothers shoulder it was obvious that sergeant havers saw this for she exhaled in a brief knowing snort a woman who possessed no affinity for thomas lynley and no fellowfeeling for his situation she turned back to the bed macpherson began speaking to her in a low quick voice she jotted down notes when macpherson had completed his preliminary inspection he joined peter and lynley he drew them to the far corner of the room as the forensic pathologist took over pulling on surgical gloves the pathologist probed touched poked and examined in a few minutes it was over he murmured something to havers and made way for the scenesofcrime officers st james watched them begin to gather the evidence his every sense alive to the presence of sidneys silver bottle on the floor the water glass on the packing crate was placed in a bag and marked the tarnished spoon likewise a fine residue of powder which st james himself had not seen in his first inspection of the fruit packing crate was carefully brushed from its surface into a container then the crate was inched to one side and the bottle itself was plucked from the floor when it too had been dropped into a bag the twentyfour hours had begun st james signalled to lynley that he was going to leave the other man joined him theyll be taking peter in lynley said ill go with him and then as if he believed that his intention to accompany his brother in some way negated his prior determination to let peter stand on his own he went on to say i must do that much st james thats understandable will you tell deborah for me ive no idea how long ill be of course st james thought how to phrase his next question knowing that lynley upon hearing it would leap to a conclusion which might make him refuse still he had to have the details and he had to have them without lynleys knowing why he led into it cautiously will you get me some information from the yard as soon as they have it what sort of information the postmortem as much as you can as soon as you can you dont think that peter theyre going to rush things through for you tommy its the most they can do all things considered and theyll do it so will you get the information lynley glanced at his brother peter had begun to shake macpherson rooted through the pile of clothing on the floor until he found a striped sweatshirt which he handed over to havers who inspected it with deliberate slowness before passing it on to peter lynley sighed he rubbed the back of his neck all right ill get it in the back of the taxi spinning towards st pancras st james tried to remove every thought of his sister from his mind replacing her image with an unsuccessful attempt to formulate some sort of plan of action but he could come up with nothing other than a host of memories each one more importunate than the last making its own demand that he save her he had stopped briefly in paddington to deliver lynleys message to deborah there he had used her telephone ringing his sisters flat her modelling agency his own home knowing all along that he was duplicating lady helens earlier efforts knowing and not caring not even thinking doing nothing but trying to find her seeing nothing but the silver bottle on the floor and the intricate scrollwork of initials that identified it as sidneys he was aware of deborah standing nearby watching and listening she was alone in the flat helen having gone her way to do what she could with the messages on micks answering machine and the file marked prospects and he could read her concern in the fine tracery of lines that appeared on her brow as he continued to dial continued to ask for his sister continued to meet with no success he found that more than anything he wanted to keep from deborah the true nature of his fear she knew sasha was dead so she assumed his concern revolved only round sidneys immediate safety he was determined to keep it that way no luck deborah asked when he finally turned from the telephone he shook his head and went to the table upon which they had left the material theyd gathered from mick cambreys flat he sorted it stacked it tapped it into a neat pile which he folded and put into his jacket pocket can i do anything she asked anything at all please i feel so useless she looked stricken and afraid i cant believe someone would actually want to hurt sidney shes just gone off somewhere simon hasnt she shes in agony over justin she needs to be alone he heard the penultimate statement and knew it for the truth he had seen his sisters grief in cornwall and had felt the inchoate fury which that grief provoked still she had gone and he had allowed her to do so whatever fell upon sidney now was in large part his responsibility theres nothing you can do he said he started for the door his face was impassive he could feel each feature settle until he wore a perfectly insensate mask he knew that deborah wouldnt understand such a reaction to her offer she would read it as rejection seeing it perhaps as an adolescent retaliation for everything that had passed between them since her return but that couldnt be helped simon please theres nothing more to be done i can help you know i can theres no need deborah let me help you find her just wait here for tommy i dont want she stopped he could see a pulse beating in her throat he waited for more there was nothing deborah took in a slow breath but she didnt look away ill go to cheyne row theres no point to that sidney wont be there i dont care im going he had neither the time nor the wish to argue with her so he left forcing himself back to his original purpose in returning to london he hoped that a visit to islingtonlondon might somehow reveal the truth behind mick cambreys death and that this additional death in whitechapel were somehow tied to the previous two for tying them together would serve as a means of exonerating sidney and tying them together meant a pursuit of the ghost of mick cambrey he was determined to incarnate this spectre from cornwall islingtonlondon seemed to offer the final opportunity of doing so but in the back of the taxi he felt his weary mind lose the battle against images that attacked his calm forcing him back to a time and a place he thought he had left behind for ever there he saw them as they had appeared at the hospital distorted faces emerging out of the fugue created by alternating states of consciousness and by the drug that deadened his most immediate suffering david and andrew in hushed consultation with the doctors his mother and helen riven by sorrow tommy driven by guilt and sidney just seventeen years old with a butcheredup haircut and earrings that looked like communication satellites outrageous sidney reading to him from the most ridiculous of the london dailies laughing uproariously at the worst of their gruesome and titillating stories she was always there never missing a day refusing to allow him to sink into despair and then later in switzerland he remembered the bitterness with which he had looked at the alps from his hospital window loathing his body despising its weakness confronting for the very first time the inescapable reality of never being able to walk with ease in those mountains or any others again but sidney was with him bullying shouting harassing him back to health stubbornly insisting he would live to old age even when he prayed each night that he might die remembering all this he fought against the facts that nagged at his consciousness sidneys presence in soho the nature of her relationship with justin brooke her easy access to drugs from the life she led the people she knew and the work she did and while he tried to convince himself that she did not know could not possibly have known mick cambrey and thus could not be involved in his death in any way he could not dismiss the fact that deborah had told him sidney had seen tina cogin that day in her flat sidney herself had talked about seeing peter assaulting a woman in soho a woman whose description was identical to tinas even though it was tenuous enough to be disregarded as meaningless the connection was there he could not overlook it so he wondered where she was and what she had done while twentyfive years of mutual history cried out that he find her before the police islingtonlondon was an unprepossessing building not far from grays inn road a small gated courtyard set the structure back from the street and it was crammed with half a dozen small cars and a minivan with the letters islington spread across a map of great britain and white stars scattered here and there in all three countries obviously indicating the location of branch offices there were ten in all as far north as inverness as far south as penzance it appeared to be quite an operation inside the lobby the sound from the street was muted by thick walls thick carpet and a muzak track currently playing an allstrings rendition of lucy in the sky with diamonds handsome sofas lined the walls beneath large modern canvases in the style of david hockney across from these a receptionist who couldnt have been more than an erstwhile fifthform student whod decided not to continue at school tapped away at a word processor with impossibly long magentacoloured fingernails her hair was dyed to match out of the corner of her eye she appeared to see st james approach for she did not turn from her word processing screen rather she wiggled her fingers vaguely in the direction of a stack of papers on her desk and popped her chewing gum before saying take an application form ive not come about a job when the girl didnt respond st james noticed that she was wearing the small kind of headset earphones that are usually attached to a tape recorder either giving dictation or blaring out rockandroll music that mercifully noone else has to hear he repeated his statement louder this time she looked up removing the headset hastily sorry one gets used to the automatic response she pulled a ledger towards her have an appointment do people generally have appointments when they come here she chewed her gum more thoughtfully for a moment and looked him over as if searching for hidden meanings generally she said right so noone would come to make a purchase the gum snapped in her mouth the sales force goes out noone comes here theres the odd telephone order isnt there but its not like a chemists shop she watched as st james took the folded materials from his jacket pocket and produced the photograph of mick cambrey he gave it to her his hand making contact with her talon nails which glistening wetly grazed his skin she wore a tiny gold musical note glued on to the nail of her ring finger like a piece of odd jewellery has this man had an appointment to see anyone he asked she smiled when her eyes dropped to the picture hes been here all right lately she tapped her nails on the desk top as she thought hm thats a bit difficult isnt it a few weeks past i think do you know who he saw his name mick michael cambrey let me check she opened the ledger on her desk and scanned several pages an activity which seemed to allow her the opportunity of showing off her fingernails to their best advantage since every time she turned a page she used a new nail to guide her eyes down the column of times and names a visitors log st james asked everybody signs in and out security you know security drugs research you cant be too careful something new comes out and everyone in the west ends hot to try it with drinks that night ah here it is hes signed into project testing department twentyfive she flipped back through several more pages here he is again same department same time just before lunch she slipped back several months quite a regular he was always the same department looks that way may i speak to the department head she closed the ledger and looked regretful thats a bit rough no appointment you see and poor mr malverds balancing two departments at once why dont you leave your name she shrugged noncommittally st james wasnt about to be put off this man mick cambrey was murdered on friday night the receptionists face sharpened with immediate interest youre police she asked and then sounding hopeful scotland yard st james gave a moments thought to how easily it could all have been managed had lynley only come with him as it was he removed his own card and handed it over this is a private endeavour he told her she glanced at the card moved her lips as she read it and then turned it over as if more information might be printed on the back a murder she breathed just let me see if i can reach mr malverd for you she punched three buttons on the switchboard and pocketed his card just in case i need you myself she said with a wink ten minutes later a man came into the reception area swinging shut a heavy panelled door behind him he introduced himself as stephen malverd offered his hand in an abbreviated greeting and pulled on his earlobe he was wearing a white lab coat which hung below his knees directing attention to what he wore upon his feet sandals rather than shoes and heavy argyle socks he was very busy he said he could spare only a few minutes if mr st james would come this way he strode briskly back into the heart of the building as he walked his hair which sprang up round his head wild and unruly like a pad of steel wool fluttered and bounced and his lab coat blew open like a cape he slowed his pace only when he noticed st james gait but even then he looked at the offending leg accusingly as if it too robbed him of precious moments away from his job they rang for the lift at the end of a corridor given over to administrative offices malverd said nothing until they were on their way to the buildings third floor its been chaos round here for the last few days he said but im glad youve come i thought there was more involved than i heard at first then you remember michael cambrey malverds face was a sudden blank michael cambrey but she told me he gestured aimlessly in an indication of the reception area and frowned whats this about a man named michael cambrey visited project testing department twentyfive several times over the past few months he was murdered last friday im not sure how i can help you malverd sounded perplexed twentyfive isnt my regular patch ive only stepped in briefly what is it that you want anything you or anyone else can tell me about why cambrey was here the lift doors opened malverd didnt exit at once he appeared to be trying to decide whether he wanted to talk to st james or merely to dismiss him and get back to his own work this death has something to do with islington with an islington product that certainly was a possibility st james realized although not in the manner that malverd obviously thought im not sure st james said thats why ive come police he took out another card forensic science malverd looked moderately interested at this piece of information at least his expression indicated he was talking to a fellow lets see what we can do he said its just this way he led st james down a linoleumtiled corridor a far cry from the reception and administration offices below laboratories opened to either side peopled by technicians who sat on tall stools at work areas that time the movement of heavy equipment and the exposure to chemicals had bleached from blacktopped to grey malverd nodded at colleagues as they walked but he said nothing once he removed a schedule from his pocket studied it glanced at his watch and cursed he picked up speed dodged past a tea cart round which a group of technicians gathered for an afternoon break and in a second corridor he opened a door this is twentyfive he said the room they entered was a large rectangular laboratory brightly illuminated by long ceiling tubes of fluorescent lights at least six incubators sat at intervals on a worktop that ran along one wall interspersed among them centrifuges squatted some open some closed some humming at work dozens of ph meters lay among microscopes and everywhere glassfronted cabinets held chemicals beakers flasks test tubes pipettes among all these accoutrements of science two technicians copied the orange digital numbers which flickered on one of the incubators another worked at a hood from which a glass cover had been pulled down to protect cultures from contamination four others peered into microscopes while another prepared a set of specimens on slides several of them looked up as malverd led st james towards a closed door at the far end of the lab but none of them spoke when malverd rapped once sharply upon that door and entered without waiting for a reply the few who had given him their attention lost interest a secretary who appeared as harried as malverd turned from a filing cabinet as they entered a desk a chair a computer and a laser printer hemmed her in on all sides for you mr malverd she reached for a pile of telephone messages which were joined together by a paper clip i dont know what to tell people malverd picked them up flipped through them dropped them on to her desk put them off he said put everyone off ive no time to answer phone calls but do you people keep engagement diaries up here mrs courtney have you evolved that far or would that be too much to expect her lips whitened even as she smiled and made a polite effort to take his questions as a joke something which malverds tone made difficult she pushed her way past him and went behind her desk where she took out a leather volume and handed it over we always keep records mr malverd i think youll find everything in perfect order i hope so he said itll be the first thing that is i could do with some tea you this to st james who demurred see about it will you was malverds final comment to mrs courtney who fired a look of nuclear quality in his direction before she went to do his bidding malverd opened a second door which led to a second room this one larger than the first but hardly less crowded it was obviously the office of the project director and it looked the part old metal bookshelves held volumes dedicated to biomedicinal chemistry to pharmacokinetics to pharmacology to genetics bound collections of scientific journals vied with these for space as did a pressure reader an antique microscope and a set of scales at least thirty leather notebooks occupied the shelves nearest the reach of the desk and these st james assumed would contain the reported results of experiments which the technicians in the outer lab carried out on the wall above the desk a long graph charted the progress of something using green and red lines below this in four framed cases hung a collection of scorpions splayed out as if in demonstration of mans dominion over lesser creatures malverd frowned at these latter objects as he took a seat behind the desk he gave another meaningful glance at his watch how can i help you st james removed a stack of typescript from the only other chair in the room he sat down gave a cursory look at the graph and said mick cambrey evidently came to this department a number of times in the last few months he was a journalist he was murdered you said and you think theres some connection between his death and islington several people feel he might have been working on a story there could be a connection between that and his death we dont know yet but youve indicated youre not from the police thats right st james waited for malverd to use this as an excuse to end their conversation he had every right to do so but it seemed that their previously acknowledged mutual interest in science would be enough to carry the interview forward for the moment since malverd nodded thoughtfully and flipped open the engagement diary in what appeared to be an arbitrary selection of date he said well cambrey lets see he began to read running his finger down one page and then another much as had the receptionist a few minutes before smythethomas hallington schweinbeck barry what did he see him for taversly powers ah here it is cambrey halfpast eleven he squinted at the date two weeks ago last friday the receptionist indicated hed been here before is his name in the diary other than that friday cooperatively malverd flipped through the book he reached for a scrap of paper and made a note of the dates which he handed to st james when he had completed his survey of the diary quite a regular visitor he said every other friday how far back does the book go just to january is last years diary available let me check that when malverd had left the office to do so st james took a closer look at the graph above the desk the ordinate he saw was labelled tumour growth while the abscissa was called time post injection two lines marked the progress of two substances one falling rapidly and bearing the identification drug and the other marked saline rising steadily malverd returned cup of tea in one hand and engagement diary in the other he tapped the door shut with his foot he was here last year as well malverd said again he copied the dates as he found them pausing occasionally to slurp a bit of tea both the lab and the office were almost inhumanly quiet the only sound was the scratching of majverds pencil on paper at last he looked up nothing before last june he said june the second more than a year st james noted but nothing to tell us why he was here nothing ive no idea at all malverd tapped the tips of his fingers together and frowned at the graph unless it may have been oncozyme oncozyme its a drug department twentyfives been testing for perhaps eighteen months or more what sort of drug cancer cambreys interview with dr trenarrow rose instantiy in st james mind the connection between that meeting and cambreys trips to london was finally neither conjectural nor tenuous a form of chemotherapy what exactiy does it do inhibits protein synthesis in cancer cells malverd said our hope is that itll prevent replication of oncogenes the genes that cause cancer in the first place he nodded at the graph and pointed to the red line that descended it steeply a sharp diagonal that indicated the percentage of inhibited rumour growth versus the time after the drug had been administered as you can see it looks like a promising treatment the results in mice have been quite extraordinary so its not been used on human subjects were years away from that the toxicology studies have only just begun you know the sort of thing what amount constitutes a safe dosage what are its biological effects side effects certainly wed be looking closely for those if there are no side effects if theres nothing to prove oncozyme a danger what happens then then we market the drug at some considerable profit i should guess st james noted for a fortune malverd replied its a breakthrough drug no doubt about it in fact i should guess that oncozymes the story this cambrey was writing but as to its being a potential case for his murder he paused meaningfully i dont see how st james thought he did it would have taken the form of a random piece of knowledge a source of concern or an idea passed on by someone with access to inside information he asked whats the relationship between islingtonlondon and islingtonpenzance penzance is one of our research facilities we have them scattered round the country their purpose more testing malverd shook his head the drugs are created at the research labs in the first place he leaned back in his chair each lab generally works in a separate area of disease control weve one on parkinsons another on huntingtons a new one dealing with aids weve even a lab working on the common cold believe it or not he smiled and penzance one of our three cancer locations did penzance produce oncozyme by any chance malverd looked meditatively at the graph again no our bury lab in suffolk was responsible for oncozyme and youve said they dont test the drugs at these facilities not the sort of extensive testing we do here the initial testing of course they do that otherwise theyd hardly know what theyve developed would they would it be safe to assume that someone at one of these associate labs would have access to results not only that local labs results but londons results as well of course and he or she might recognize an inconsistency perhaps some detail glossed over in the rush to market a new product malverds benign expression altered he thrust out his chin and pulled it back as if adjusting his spinal cord thats hardly likely mr st james this is a place of medicine not a science fiction novel he got to his feet i must get back to my own lab now until weve a new man to take over twentyfive im in a bit of a frazzle im sure you understand st james followed him out of the office malverd handed the secretary both of the engagement diaries and said they were in order mrs courtney i do congratulate you on that she responded coldly as she took the diaries from him mr brooke kept everything in order mr malverd st james heard the name with a rush of surprise mr brooke he asked it couldnt be possible malverd proved that it was he led him back into the lab justin brooke he said senior biochemist in charge of this lot bloody fool was killed last weekend in an accident in cornwall i thought at first thats why youd come before he nodded at the constable to unlock the interrogation rooms door lynley looked through the small thickglassed window a plastic tray of tea and sandwiches in his hand head bowed his brother was sitting at the table he still wore the striped sweatshirt that macpherson had given him in whitechapel but whatever protection it had afforded him earlier was no longer adequate peter shook arms legs head and shoulders lynley had no doubt that every internal muscle was quivering as well when they had left him in the room thirty minutes before alone save for a guard outside to make sure he did nothing to harm himself peter had asked no question he had made neither statement nor request he merely stood hands on the back of one of the chairs glancing over the impersonal room one table four chairs a dull beige linoleum floor two ceiling lights only one of which worked a red dented tin ashtray on the table all he had done before taking a seat was to look at lynley and open his mouth as if to speak his face limned entreaty upon every feature but he said nothing it was as if peter were finally seeing how irreparable was the damage he had done to his relationship with his brother if he believed that blood tied them inextricably to each other that he could call upon that blood to save himself in some way he apparently did not intend to mention the fact now lynley nodded at the constable who unlocked the door and relocked it once lynley had entered always a sound of grim finality lynley found that the key grating upon metal was even more so now that it was being turned against the freedom of his own brother he hadnt expected to feel this way he hadnt expected to feel the desire to rescue or the exigent need to protect for some delusional reason he had actually believed that he would feel a closure had been reached once peter finally faced the criminal implications of the lifestyle hed chosen these past few years but now that the justice system had caught peter up lynley found himself feeling not at all righteously vindicated at having been the brother who had chosen the clean the moral the ethical life the life guaranteed to make him societys darling rather he felt himself the hypocrite and knew beyond a doubt that if punishment were to be meted out to the greater sinner the man who had been given the most and had therefore thrown the most away he would be its rightful recipient peter looked up saw him looked away the expression on his face was not sullen however it was dazed by both confusion and fear we both need something to eat lynley said he sat opposite his brother and placed the tray on the table between them when peter made no move towards it lynley unwrapped a sandwich fumbling with the seal the crinkling of the paper made that curious sound like fire eating wood it was unusually loud the yard foods unspeakable either sawdust or institutional mush i had these brought in from a restaurant down the street try the pastrami its my favourite peter didnt move lynley reached for the tea i cant recall how much sugar you take ive brought a few packets theres a carton of milk as well he stirred his own tea unwrapped his sandwich and tried to avoid considering the inherent idiocy of his behaviour he knew he was acting like a hovering mother as if he believed that food was going to take the illness away peter raised his head not hungry his lips lynley saw were cracked raw from having been bitten during the halfhour in which hed been left alone in one spot they had begun to bleed although already the blood was drying in a ragged dark blot other blood in the form of small crusty scabs ringed the inside of his nose while dry skin caked his eyelids embedding itself between his lashes the appetite goes first peter said then everything else you dont realize whats happening you think youre fine the best youve ever been but you dont eat you dont sleep you work less and less and finally not at all you dont do anything but coke sex sometimes you do sex but in the end you dont even do that cokes so much better lynley carefully placed his sandwich untouched on the paper in which it had been wrapped he was suddenly unhungry and wanting to be nothing more than unfeeling as well he reached for his tea and circled his hands around it a dull but comforting warmth emanated from the cup will you let me help you peters right hand gripped his left he made no reply i cant change the kind of brother i was when you needed me lynley said i can only offer you what i am right now however little that may be peter seemed to withdraw at this or perhaps it was that the cold within and without was causing him to diminish in size conserving energy garnering whatever small resources he had left when he finally answered his lips scarcely moved lynley had to strain to hear him i wanted to be like you like me why you were perfect you were my standard i wanted to be like you when i found i couldnt i just gave it up if i couldnt be you i didnt want to be anything peters words sounded the sure ring of finality they sounded not only like the end of an interview that had barely begun but also like the end of any possibility to put things right between them lynley sought something words images a common experience that would allow him to reach back through those fifteen years and touch the little boy he had abandoned at howenstow but he could find nothing there was no way to go back and no way to make amends he felt leaden he reached in his jacket pocket brought out his cigarette case and lighter and lay them on the table the case had been his fathers and the elaborately engraved a on the cover had worn through time portions of it had disappeared altogether but the case was familiar to him dear to him nicked and dented with age though it was he wouldnt have considered replacing it with another staring at it small rectangular symbol of everything he had run from all the areas of his life he had chosen to deny the welter of emotions he had refused to face he found the words it was knowing that she was sleeping with roderick while father was alive i couldnt stand that peter it didnt matter to me that theyd fallen in love that they hadnt set out to but that it just happened between them it didnt matter that roderick had every intention of marrying her when she was free it didnt matter that she still loved father and i knew she loved him because i saw how she acted with him even after shed begun the affair with roderick still i didnt understand and i couldnt abide my own blind ignorance how could she love them both how could she be devoted to one take care of him bathe him read to him see to him hour after hour and day after day feed him sit with him all of that and still sleep with the other and how could roderick go into fathers bedroom talk to him about his condition and all the time know that he would be having mother directiy afterwards i couldnt understand it i didnt see how it was possible i wanted life simple and it wasnt theyre savages i thought they have no sense of propriety they dont know how to behave they have to be taught ill teach them ill show them ill punish them lynley took a cigarette and slid the case across the table to his brother my leaving howenstow my coming back so seldom had nothing to do with you peter you just turned out to be the victim of my need to avenge something which father probably never even knew was happening for what its worth god knows its little enough im sorry peter took a cigarette but he held it in his fingers unlit as if to light it would be taking a step further than he wished to go i wanted you to be there but you werent he said noone would tell me when youd be home again i thought it was a secret for some reason then i finally realized that noone would tell me because noone knew so i stopped asking then after a while i stopped caring when you did come home it was easier to hate you so that when you left again as you always did it wouldnt really matter you didnt know about mother and trenarrow not for a long time how did you find out peter lit a cigarette parents day at school both of them came some blokes told me then that chap trenarrows been boffing your mum pete you too daft to know it he shrugged i pretended to be cool i pretended i knew i kept thinking theyd get married but they never did i made certain of that i wanted them to suffer you didnt have that sort of control over them i did i do i knew where mothers loyalties lay i used them to hurt her peter asked for no further explanation he put his cigarette into the ashtray and watched its fragile plume of smoke rise lynley chose his next words carefully feeling his way in a land that should have been old and familiar but was instead quite foreign perhaps we can make our way through this together not try to go back of course thats impossible but try to go on as restitution on your part peter shook his head you dont have to make anything up to me tommy oh i know you think you do but i chose my own path im not your responsibility and then as if he thought this final statement sounded petulant he finished with really none of this has anything to do with responsibility i want to help youre my brother i love you uttered so simply as a declaration of fact the statement might have been a blow to his brother peter recoiled his raw lips trembled he covered his eyes im sorry he finally said and then only tommy lynley said nothing more until his brother lowered his hand he was alone in the interrogation room with peter solely because of inspector macphersons compassion macphersons partner sergeant havers had protested vociferously enough when lynley had asked for these few minutes she had cited regulations procedures judges rules and civil law until macpherson had silenced her with a simple i dae know the law lass gie me credit for that if ye will and sent her to sit by a phone and await the results of the toxicological analysis of the powder they had found in peters whitechapel room after which macpherson himself had lumbered off leaving lynley at the interrogation rooms door and saying twenty minutes tommy over his shoulder so in spite of what needed to be said about the years of suffering he and peter had caused each other there was little enough time for gathering information and none at all for restoring the relationship they had destroyed that would have to wait i need to ask you about mick cambrey lynley said about justin brooke as well you think i killed them it doesnt matter what i think the only thing that matters is what penzance cid think peter you must know i cant let john penellin take the blame for micks death peters eyebrows drew together johns been arrested saturday night youd already left howenstow when they came for him then we left directly after dinner i didnt know he touched a finger to the sandwich in front of him and pushed it aside with a grimace of distaste i need the truth lynley said its the only thing thats going to help anyone and the only way to get john released since he doesnt intend to do anything to help himself is to tell the police what really happened on friday night peter did you see mick cambrey after john went to gull cottage theyll arrest me he mumbled theyll put me on trial youve nothing to fear if youre innocent if you come forward if you tell the truth peter were you there or did brooke lie about that escape was well within peters reach a simple denial would do it an accusation that brooke had lied even a manufactured reason why brooke might have done so since the man himself was dead and couldnt refute it those were the possibilities of response as was a decision to help a man who had been part of their extended family for peters entire life peter licked his dry lips i was there lynley didnt know whether to feel relief or despair he said what happened i think justin didnt trust me to see to things on my own or else he couldnt wait for the coke hed had a stash with him at howenstow briefly peter related the scene that had occurred between sidney and justin brooke on the beach she threw it in the water he concluded so that was that id already phoned mark about getting some more but i didnt have enough money and he wouldnt trust me for it not even for a few days so instead you went to mick a positive answer would be the first fissure in the tale brooke had told but it was not forthcoming not for coke peter said unconsciously corroborating the first part of brookes story for cash i remembered he did the pay envelopes for the newspaper on alternate fridays did you know mick was a crossdresser as well peter smiled wearily there was an element of grudging admiration in it a ghost of the little boy he had been i always thought youd make a decent detective lynley didnt tell him how little of his own talent for inference and deduction had gone into the discovery of mick cambreys second life in london he merely said how long have you known about a month i bought from him occasionally in london when my other sources were dry wed meet in soho theres an alley near the square where deals go down wed meet in a club there id buy a gram half a gram less whatever i could afford that seems damn risky why not meet at your flat at his peter shot him a look i didnt even know he had a flat and i sure as hell didnt want him to see mine how would you get in touch how would you make the arrangements like i said sometimes my other sources went dry so id phone him in cornwall if he was due to come to london wed set up a buy always in soho always the same place at this club thats where i found out about the crossdressing how peters face coloured as he related the story of how he had waited an hour for mick cambrey to appear at kats kradle how a woman approached him when he went to the bar for matches how they had three drinks together how they finally went outside theres a bit of an alcove there peter said its private more or less i was drunk as hell by then i didnt know what i was doing much less care so when she started rubbing against me really feeling me up i was willing all right then when things had gone as far as she wanted them to go she started laughing laughing and laughing like a crazy woman i saw it was mick you couldnt tell before that peter gave a rueful shake of his head mick looked good tommy i dont even know how he did it but he looked damn good sexy he probably could have fooled his own father he sure as hell fooled me and when you saw the woman was mick i wanted to beat the shit out of him but i was too drunk i took a swing we both fell at least i know we ended up on the ground somehow and then of all people sidney st james showed up out of nowhere christ it was like a nightmare she was with brooke he pulled me off mick and mick took off i didnt see him again until friday night in nanrunnel how did you find out mick dealt cocaine in the first place mark told me but you didnt try to get cocaine from him in nanrunnel he wouldnt sell there only in london he wasnt in london all that often was he who were his buyers theres a whole network tommy dealers know the buyers buyers know the dealers everyone knows everyone you get a number you ring it you make arrangements and if your caller turns out to be from the mets drug squad then youre busted but not if youre smart and not if you know how to set up your network mick knew how to do that he was a journalist he knew how to establish good sources he just looked for a different kind of source once he started dealing he had hundreds of connections that was true lynley thought it would have been simple for a man in mick cambreys position what happened between you on friday night the neighbours heard a row i was getting desperate mark picked up on that in the afternoon and obliged me by raising his price i didnt have the cash so i went to see mick to borrow some he said absolutely not i promised id be good for it i swore that id have it back in a week how peter stared at his bitten fingernails lynley saw that he was struggling with his conscience choosing how far to go and costing out the consequences things from howenstow he finally said the silver i thought i could sell a few pieces in london and noone would be the wiser at least not for a while is that why you went to cornwall in the first place lynley waited for the answer and tried to remain indifferent to the idea of his brothers selling what had been part of their family for generations merely to feed his drug addiction i dont know why i went to cornwall i wasnt thinking straight one minute i was going there to make a buy from mark the next it was to pinch a bit of silver to take back to london the next it was to get some money from mick thats what its like you dont even know what youre doing after a while its like being dizzy and when mick refused to lend you the money it was stupid i threatened to let it out in the village what he was up to in london the crossdressing the drugdealing as well i take it that didnt convince him to hand over a few pounds not at all he just laughed he said if i wanted money i should threaten him with death not blackmail people pay a hell of a lot more to stay alive than to have a secret kept he said thats where the real money is and all the time he kept laughing like he was egging me on what was brooke doing trying to get us both to shut up he could tell i was crazy i think he was scared that something weird would happen but you didnt shut up mick kept after me he said that if i wanted to put his dirty linen on the table that hed be willing to spread mine out as well he said you and mother might find my return to drug use of interest but as to that i didnt even care peter bit at his thumbnail anxious little nibbling bites it didnt matter to me if he told you since youd guessed i was using again anyway as for mother nothing mattered to me except getting high you dont know what it feels like to be willing to do anything just to get your hands on some coke it was a damning admission lynley only thanked the luck of the moment that neither macpherson nor havers was there to hear it the former he knew might well take it as a meaningless slip of the tongue the latter however would pounce upon it like a starving mongrel i just exploded at that point peter said it was that or start to beg is that when brooke left he tried to get me to go as well but i said no i said i wanted to finish what id started with the little poof again the damning choice of words lynley felt himself wince inwardly what happened then i called mick every foul name i could think of i raved screamed i was strung out and mad and i needed he picked up his cup of tea swallowed a large mouthful a trickle of the liquid dripped down his chin i ended up begging and snivelling for just fifty quid he threw me out peters cigarette had gone untouched in the ashtray it had burned to nothing creating a perfect cylinder of grey ash he tapped it with the broken nail of his index finger it dissolved into a wispy pile he said the money was still there when i left him tommy youve no cause to believe that but the money was there and mick was alive i believe you lynley tried to make his words ring with the assurance that his personal belief was all that would be necessary to restore peter to the safety of his family but that was nothing more than irresponsible fantasy for as things stood now once peters story was relayed to the penzance police he would surely stand trial and once his extensive drug use was revealed to a jury his position would be perilous at best no matter lynleys earlier avowals of the inherent value of telling the truth peter seemed to take comfort from his brothers words he seemed to feel an encouragement to continue a fragile bond between them that allowed for revelation i didnt take them tommy i wouldnt have done that lynley looked at him blankly peter went on her cameras i didnt take them i didnt i swear it the fact that peter had been willing to sell off the family silver made it hard to believe hed suddenly developed a conscience when it came to deborah lynley avoided a direct reply what time did you leave mick on friday peter considered the question i went to the anchor and rose and had a pint he said it must have been about a quarter to ten not ten oclock not later not when i arrived were you still there at ten when peter nodded lynley asked then why did justin hitchhike back to howenstow alone justin wasnt he there in the pub peter looked at him in some confusion no it was the first exonerating piece of information that his brother had offered and the fact that he had offered it so completely unconscious of its importance told lynley that in this instance his brother was telling the truth it was a detail to be checked upon a blemish on brookes story the vague promise that the case against peter could indeed be broken by a barrister in court what i dont understand lynley said is why you left howenstow so suddenly was it the row we had in the smoking room peter smiled briefly considering how many other rows wed had one more would hardly have made me turn tail would it he looked away at first lynley thought he was fabricating a story but he saw the spots of colour on his brothers face and realized he was embarrassed it was sasha he said she wouldnt let up on me she kept insisting we come back to london id taken a matchbox from the smokingroom the silver piece that usually sits on the desk and once she knew i couldnt get any money from mick or some dope from mark she wanted to bring the box back to london and sell it here she was in a rush she wanted the coke bad she used a lot tommy all the time more than me did you make the buy is that where you got whatever she took this afternoon i couldnt find a buyer everyone knows the boxs hot im surprised i wasnt arrested before now remained unspoken but there was no doubt that the two words were foremost in both of their minds the key turned in the door someone knocked upon it sharply macpherson swung it open hed loosened his tie and removed his jacket his heavyrimmed spectacles rode high on his forehead shoved there out of the way behind him sergeant havers stood she made no effort to hide the smile of gratification on her face lynley got to his feet but motioned his brother to stay where he was macpherson thumbed towards the hallway where lynley followed him shutting the door on his brother has he a solicitor macpherson asked of course weve not phoned but lynley looked at the scot his face in contrast to havers was grave hes said he doesnt recognize that container angus and surely well find any number of witnesses who can verify his story of going out to buy bread and eggs when she took the drug he tried to keep his voice calm and reasonable so they would not wander beyond the death of sasha nifford the idea that macpherson and havers had somehow connected peter to the cornwall deaths was unthinkable but the mention of a solicitor suggested nothing else i spoke to the print men just before coming to see him evidently only sashas are on the needle and none of peters are on that bottle for an overdose of this kind macphersons face had creased with growing worry he lifted a hand to stop lynleys words dropped it heavily when he said ay for an overdose ay laddie ay but we do hae more of a problem than an overdose what do you mean sergeant haversll gie ye the facts it took an effort for lynley to move his eyes from macpherson to the snubbyfaced sergeant she held a paper in her hand havers he said again that slight smile condescending knowing and more than that enjoying the toxicology report indicates its a mixture of quinine and a drug called ergotamine she said mixed together appropriately inspector they not only resemble but also taste exactly like heroin thats what the girl must have thought it was when she injected it what are you saying lynley asked macpherson shuffled his feet ye know as well as i its a murder deborah had been as good as her word when st james returned home cotter told him that she had arrived herself only an hour before with an overnight case he added significantly she talked of aving a load o work ahead printing up some fresh snaps but i think the girl means to stay till theres word of miss sidney as if in the expectation that st james would interfere with her plans upon his own arrival deborah had gone directly up to her darkroom where the red light glowing above the door told him she was not to be disturbed when he knocked and said her name she shouted cheerfully out in a bit and banged about with what sounded like unnecessary vigour he descended to his study and placed a call to cornwall he found dr trenarrow at home he did nothing more than identify himself before trenarrow asked about peter lynley with a forced calm that said he expected the worst but was keeping up the pretence of all being well at the heart of the matter st james guessed lady asherton was with him bearing that in mind he gave trenarrow only the barest information we found him in whitechapel tommys with him at the moment trenarrow said hes all right st james affirmed this in as indirect a fashion as he could leaving out most of the details knowing that their recitation to trenarrow or to anyone else was something that belonged by rights to lynley he went on to explain tina cogins true identity at first trenarrow sounded relieved to hear that his telephone number had been in the possession of mick cambrey all along and not in the possession of an unknown london prostitute but that relief was fleeting and it faded to what seemed to be discomfort and then finally compassion as the full implications of mick cambreys double life dawned on the man of course i didnt know about it he responded to st james question hed have had to keep something like that completely to himself sharing that sort of secret in a village like nanrunnel would have been the death he stopped abruptly st james could imagine the process of trenarrows thoughts they certainly werent out of the realm of possibility weve traced micks activities to islingtonlondon st james said did you know justin brooke worked there for islington no i wondered if micks trip there somehow grew out of the interview you and he had all those months ago over the line he heard the distinct sound of china upon china something being poured into a cup it was a moment before trenarrow answered it may well have he was doing a feature on cancer research i spoke of my work i no doubt mentioned how the islington company operates so the london facility would have come into it would oncozyme have come into it as well oncozyme you know a shuffling of papers the sound of a watch alarm going off it was quickly silenced damn just a moment a swallow of tea it must have come up as i recall we were discussing an entire range of new treatments everything from monoclonal antibodies to advances in chemotherapy oncozyme fits into the latter category i doubt that i would have passed it by so you knew about oncozyme yourself when mick interviewed you everyone at islington knew about oncozyme burys baby we called it the branch lab at bury st edmunds developed it how much can you tell me about it its an antioncogene it prohibits dna replication you know what cancer is all about cells reproducing killing one off with a large dose of the bodys own functions gone completely haywire an antioncogene puts an end to that and the side effects of an antioncogene thats the problem isnt it there always are side effects to chemotherapy hair loss nausea weight loss vomiting fever all of those are standard though arent they standard but none the less inconvenient often dangerous believe me mr st james if someone could develop a drug without side effects the scientific world would be dazzled indeed what if a drug was found to be an effective antioncogene but unfortunately it was also the cause of more serious side effects what sort do you have in mind renal dysfunction organ failure something like that perhaps something worse a teratogen for example every form of chemotherapy is a teratogen under normal circumstances it would never be used on a pregnant woman something else then st james considered the possibilities something that might damage progenitor cells there was an extremely long pause which dr trenarrow finally ended by clearing his throat youre suggesting a drug causing longrange genetic defects in both men and women i dont see how thats possible drugs are too well tested it would have come out somewhere in someones research it couldnt have been hidden suppose it was st james said would mick have been able to stumble upon it perhaps it would have shown up as an irregularity in the lest results but where would he have got test results even if he went to the london office who would have given them to him and why st james thought he knew the answer to both those questions deborah was eating an apple when she entered the study ten minutes later she had cut the piece of fruit into eighths which shed then arranged on a plate with half a dozen unevenly sliced pieces of cheddar cheese because food was involved in her current activity peach and alaska the household dog and cat attended closely at her heels peach kept a vigilant eye hovering between deborahs face and the plate while alaska who found overt begging beneath his feline dignity leaped on to st james desk and strolled through the pens pencils books magazines and correspondence he settled comfortably next to the telephone as if expecting a call finished with your pictures st james asked he was sitting in his leather armchair where he had spent the time following his conversation with trenarrow by brooding into the unlit fireplace deborah sat opposite him crosslegged on the sofa she balanced the plate of cheese and apple on her knees a large chemical stain ran from calf to ankle on her blue jeans and in several places her white shirt bore spots of damp from her work in the darkroom for the moment im taking a break came up rather suddenly your need to print pictures wouldnt you say yes she said placidly indeed i would using them for a show possibly probably deborah what she looked up from her plate brushed hair from her forehead she held a wedge of cheese in her hand nothing ah she pinched off a bit of the cheese offered it with a portion of apple to the dog peach gobbled down both wagged her tail barked for more after you left i broke her of begging like that st james said it took me at least two months in answer deborah gave peach another bit of cheese she patted the dogs head tugged her silky ears and then looked up at him her expression was guileless shes just asking for what she wants theres nothing wrong with that is there he could feel the provocation behind the words he pushed himself out of his chair there were phone calls to make about brooke about oncozyme there was checking to do into his sisters whereabouts there were at least a half a dozen studies unrelated to the cambreybrookenifford deaths awaiting his attention in the lab and a half a dozen other reasons for leaving the room but instead of doing so he stayed would you get that blasted cat off my desk he walked to the window deborah went to the desk scooped up the cat deposited him on st james chair anything else she asked as alaska began enthusiastically kneading the leather st james watched the cat curling up for a lengthy stay he saw deborahs mouth twitch with a smile minx he said brat she responded a car door slammed in the street he turned to the window tommys here he said and deborah went to open the front door st james could see that lynley bore no good news his gait was slow without its natural grace deborah joined him outside and they spoke for a moment she touched his arm he shook his head reached for her st james left the window he went to a bookshelf he chose a volume at random pulling it down and opening it at random as well iwish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul he read inmy degradation i have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father and of this home made such a home by you has stirred old shadows good god he snapped the book shut a tale of two cities great he thought wryly he shoved the book back among the others and considered making another selection far from the madding crowd looked promising a good bout of psychic suffering with gabriel oak spoke to mother afterwards lynley was saying as he and deborah came into the study she didnt take it well st james greeted his friend with a small whisky which lynley accepted gratefully he sank into the sofa deborah perched next to him on the sofas arm her fingertips brushing his shoulder brooke appears to have been telling the truth lynley began peter was in gull cottage after john penellin left he and mick had a row he shared the information which hed gathered from his interview with peter he added the soho story as well i did think that might have been cambrey with peter in the alley st james said when lynley had finished sidney told me about seeing them the description seemed to fit he added answering the unasked question that immediately appeared on lynleys face so if peter recognized cambrey theres a good chance justin brooke did as well brooke lynley queried how he was there with sidney in the alley i know but what difference does that make they knew each other tommy brooke worked for islington st james related his own information about brookes position at islingtonlondon about cambreys visits to department twentyfive about oncozyme and the potential for a story how does roderick trenarrow fit into all this st james hes the prime mover he gave mick cambrey some key information cambrey used it to pursue a story that appears to be the extent of his involvement he knew about oncozyme he mentioned it to mick and then mick died trenarrow was in the vicinity that night he has no motive tommy justin brooke did st james explained his theory the product of those minutes brooding alone in the study was simple enough it involved the promise of cocaine in exchange for key background information from an unnamed source that would evolve into an important story about a potentially dangerous drug a deal between cambrey and brooke that had somehow gone bad coming to a head on the night brooke had gone with peter to gull cottage but that doesnt account for brookes death which the police have said from the first was an accident lynley took his cigarette case from his jacket pocket staring down at it thoughtfully before he spoke he flipped open his lighter but did not use it at once the pub he said peter said brooke wasnt in the anchor and rose on friday night st james after he left gull cottage yes peter went to the pub he was there at a quarter to ten and beyond brooke never showed up so it fits doesnt it deborah spoke did justin brooke know peter was taking him to see mick cambrey did peter name mick before they left for the village or did he just say it was someone in nanrunnel he must not have known in advance st james said hed hardly have gone had he known mick cambrey was the man with the money peter intended to borrow he wouldnt have wanted to run the risk of exposure it seems that mick was in more danger of exposure than justin brooke deborah said the cocaine the crossdressing his second life in london god knows what else youve yet to tumble up lynley lit his cigarette spoke with a sigh that expelled a gust of smoke beyond that theres sasha nifford if brooke killed cambrey and then fell to his death what happened to sasha st james attempted to look noncommittal he made himself ask what did the met have to say about sasha it was ergotamine and quinine lynley took a white envelope from his inner breast pocket he handed it to st james she seems to have thought it was heroin he read the brief report finding it all at once difficult to assimilate technical information that should have been like a natural second language lynley was continuing to speak giving facts which st james had himself possessed for years a massive dose constricts all the arteries blood vessels rupture in the brain death is immediate but we saw that didnt we she still had the needle in her arm the police arent calling it an accident quite they were still questioning peter when i left but if it wasnt an accident deborah said doesnt that mean theres a second killer lynley concluded st james went to his bookshelves once again he was sure his movements jerky and awkward gave him away ergotamine he said im not entirely sure he let his voice drift off hoping for a display of natural curiosity the reaction typical to a man of science but all the time dread and knowledge were seeping through his skin he pulled down a medical volume its a prescription drug lynley was saying st james flipped through the pages his hands were clumsy he was at g and then h before he knew it he aimlessly read without seeing a word whats it for deborah asked migraine headaches mostly really migraine headaches st james felt deborah turn towards him willed her not to ask innocently she did so simon do you take it for your migraines of course of course she had known he took it everyone knew he never counted the tablets and the bottle was large so she had gone to his room shed taken what she needed shed crushed them shed mixed them shed created the poison and shed handed it over intending it for peter but killing sasha instead he had to say something to direct them back to cambrey and brooke he read for another moment nodded as if caught in heavy contemplation then shut the book we need to go back to cornwall he said decisively the newspaper office should give us the definite connection between brooke and cambrey harry was looking for a story right after micks death but he was looking for something sensational gunrunning into northern ireland call girls visiting cabinet ministers that sort of thing something tells me he would have overlooked oncozyme he didnt add the fact that leaving london by tomorrow would buy him time making him unavailable to the police when they came calling to question him about a silver bottle from jermyn street i can manage that lynley said webberlys been good enough to extend my time off and itll clear peters name will you come as well deb st james saw that she was watching him closely yes she said slowly then simon is there he couldnt allow the question if youll both excuse me ive a number of reports to see to in the lab he said ive got to make at least some sort of start on them before tomorrow he hadnt come down for dinner deborah and her father had finally taken their meal alone after nine oclock in the dining room dover sole asparagus new potatoes green salad a glass of wine with the food a cup of coffee afterwards they didnt speak but every few minutes deborah caught her father glancing her way a division had come into their relationship since her return from america where once they had spoken freely to each other with great affection and trust now they were wary entire subjects were taboo she wanted it that way she had been in such a rush to move from the chelsea house in the first place to avoid a sharing of confidences with her father for in the long run he knew her better than anyone and he was the most likely person to push back through the present to examine the past he had after all the most at stake he loved them both she pushed back her chair and began gathering their plates cotter stood as well glad to have you here tonight deb he said old times seems like the three of us the two of us she smiled in what she hoped would be affectionate and dismissive at once simon didnt come to dinner three of us in the house i meant cotter said he handed her the tray from the sideboard she stacked the plates on it works too much does mr st james i worry the manll wear imself down to nothing cleverly hed moved to stand near the door she couldnt escape without making obvious her desire to do so and surely her father would pounce upon that so she cooperated by saying he is thinner dad isnt he i can see that that e is and then adroitly he took the opening these last three years didnt go easy on mr st james deb you think they did dont you but youve got it wrong well of course there were changes in all of our lives werent there i expect he hadnt thought much about my running round the house until i wasnt here to do it any longer but he got used to it in time anyone can see you know luv her father interrupted youve never in your life been one to talk false to yourself im sorry to see you start doing it now talk false dont be ridiculous why would i do that you know the answer way i see it deb you and mr st james both know the answer moren quite well all it takes is one o you to be brave enough to say it and the other brave enough to stop living a lie he put their wineglasses on the tray and took it from her hands she had inherited her mothers height deborah knew but shed forgotten how that only made it easier for her father to look directly into her eyes he did so now the effect was disconcerting it drew a confidence from her when she wanted to avoid giving it i know how you want it to be she said but it cant be that way dad you need to accept it people change they grow up they grow apart distance does things to them time makes their importance to each other fade away sometimes he said this time she saw him blink rapidly at the firmness of her voice she tried to soften the blow i was just a little girl he was like my brother he was that cotter moved to one side to let her pass she felt bereft by his reaction she wanted nothing so much as his understanding but didnt know how to explain the situation in any way that would not destroy the dearest of his dreams dad you must see that its different with tommy im not a little girl to him i never was but to simon ive always been ill always be cotters smile was gentie youve no need to convince me deb no need he straightened his shoulders his tone became brisk at least we need to get some food in the man will you take a tray up hes still in the lab it was the least she could do she followed him down the stairs to the kitchen and watched him put together a tray of cheese cold meats fresh bread and fruit which she carried up to the lab where st james was sitting at one of the work tables gazing at a set of photographed bullets he held a pencil but it lay unused between his fingers hed turned on several lights highintensity lamps scattered here and there throughout the sprawling room they created small pools of illumination within great caverns of shadow in one of these his face was largely screened by the darkness dad wants you to eat something deborah said from the doorway she entered the room and set the tray on the table still working he wasnt she doubted that hed got a single thing done in all these past hours hed spent in the lab there was a report of some sort lying next to one of the photographs but its front page didnt bear even a crease from having been folded back and although a pad of paper lay beneath the pencil he held hed written nothing upon it so all of this was rote behaviour on his part a falling back on his work as an act of avoidance it all involved sidney deborah had seen that much in his face when lady helen told him she hadnt been able to find his sister she had seen it again when he had returned to her flat and placed call after call trying to locate sidney himself everything he had done from that moment his journey to islingtonlondon his discussion with tommy about mick cambreys death his creation of a scenario to fit the facts of the crime his need to get back to work in the lab all of this was diversion and distraction to escape the trouble that had sidney at its core deborah wondered what st james would do what he would allow himself to feel if someone had hurt his sister once again she found herself wanting to help him in some way giving him a peace of mind that appeared to elude him its just a bit of meat and cheese she said some fruit bread all of which was obvious the tray was lying in his line of vision tommys gone he asked ages ago he went back to peter she drew one of the lab stools to the other side of the table and sat facing him ive forgotten to bring you something to drink she said what would you like wine mineral water dad and i had coffee would you like a coffee simon thank you no this is fine but he made no move to eat he straightened on the stool rubbed the muscles of his back the darkness did much to alter his face harsh angles were softened lines disappeared the years drained away taking with them the evidence of their companion pain he was left looking younger and far more vulnerable he seemed all at once so much easier to reach the man to whom deborah had once said anything at all without fear of either derision or rejection secure in the knowledge that he would always understand simon she said and waited until he had looked up from the plate of food which she knew he would not touch tommy told me what you tried to do for peter today that was so kind of you his expression clouded what i tried she reached across the table grasping his hand lighdy he said that you were going to take the container so that it wouldnt be there when the police arrived tommy was so moved by that act of friendship he would have said something this afternoon in the study but you left before he had the chance she saw that his eyes were on tommys ring the emerald shimmered like a translucent liquid in the light his hand beneath hers was very cool but as she waited for him to respond it balled into a fist and then jerked away she pulled her own hand back feeling momentarily struck feeling that any foolhardy lowering of her defences any attempt to reach him in simple friendship condemned her to failure again and again across from her he swung to one side the shadows deepened on the planes of his face god he whispered at the word at his expression she saw that his pulling away had nothing to do with her what is it she asked he leaned into the light every line reappeared with every angle newly honed dominant bones seemed to draw the skin against his skull deborah how can i tell you im not the hero that you think i am i did nothing for tommy i didnt think of tommy i didnt care about peter i dont care about peter but the container belongs to sidney deborah felt herself drawing back at this statement her lips parted but for a moment she did nothing but stare incredulously at his face finally she managed what are you saying she thinks peter killed justin brooke she wanted to even the score but somehow instead of peter ergotamine deborah whispered you do take it dont you he shoved the tray to one side but that was the only reaction he appeared to be willing to allow himself his words if not their connotation were perfectly cool i feel like an idiot i cant even think what to do to help my own sister i cant even find her its pathetic obscene im perfectly useless and this entire day has been nothing more than an illustration of that fact i dont believe it deborah said slowly sidney wouldnt she didnt simon i cant think you believe it yourself helens looked everywhere phoned everywhere so have i nothings any good and theyll trace that container within twentyfour hours how could they even if her fingerprints are on it it has nothing to do with fingerprints shes used her perfume bottle its from jermyn street thats not going to give the police any difficulty theyll be here by four oclock tomorrow afternoon you can bet on that her perfume simon its not sidney quickly deborah pushed off the lab stool going round to join him its not sidney it cant be dont you remember she came to my room the night of the dinner she used my perfume hers was missing she said someone had straightened her room she couldnt find anything dont you remember for a moment he looked stunned his vision was fixed upon her although he didnt appear to be seeing her at all what he whispered and then went on in a voice that was stronger that was saturday evening that was before brooke died someone was planning to kill peter even then or sasha deborah said someones trying to frame sidney he pushed himself off the lab stool walked to the end of the work table swung round walked back he did it a second time more quickly and with growing agitation someone got into her room it could have been anyone peter if sasha was the intended victim or trenarrow or any one of the penellins good god even daze the truth was all of a piece in a moment no deborah said it was justin justin it never made sense to me that he went to her bedroom on friday night not after what happened between them on the beach that afternoon he had a grievance against sidney the cocaine their fight peter and sasha laughing at them both laughing at him so he went to her room st james said slowly made love to her and took the bottle then he must have done damn him to hell and saturday when sid couldnt find him for most of the day remember she told us that he must have got the ergotamine and quinine then he made the mixture and passed it on to sasha a chemist st james said thoughtfully a biochemist who would know drugs better so who was he after peter or sasha it was always peter because of the visit to mick cambrey the room had been searched the computer was on there were notebooks and photographs all over the floor peter must have seen something when he was there with brooke something brooke knew he might remember once cambrey was dead then why give the drugs to sasha when peter died she would have told the police at once where shed got them not at all shed have been dead as well brooke was betting on that he knew she was a user so he gave her the drugs hoping she and peter would use them together and die at howenstow i imagine when it became apparent that the plan wasnt working he tried to be rid of peter in a different way by telling us about their visit to cambrey so that peter would be arrested and out of the way what he couldnt have known is that sasha and peter would leave before peter could be arrested in cornwall and that sashas addiction was worse than peters he especially had no way of knowing that she would hoard the drugs and use them alone nor did he know that peter would go to the anchor and rose and get himself seen by a dozen or more people who could provide him with an alibi for the time of cambreys death so it was justin deborah said everything was justin ive been blinded by the fact that he died before sasha i never considered that he might have given her the drugs first but his own death simon an accident all along why how what was he doing on the cliff in the middle of the night st james glanced over her shoulder shed left the warning light on above the darkroom door it cast an eerie glow of blood red on the ceiling it also gave him the answer your cameras he said thats where he got rid of them why he was wiping out every trace of his connection to cambrey first cambrey himself then peter then my film she said the pictures you took in the cottage whatever peter saw you must have photographed as well which means the state of the sitting room was merely a blind he hadnt searched for anything he hadnt taken anything whatever he wanted was too big to be removed the computer deborah asked even so how could he have known you even took any pictures in the first place he knew we had your camera with us on friday night mrs sweeney made certain of that at dinner on saturday he knew my line of work sidney would have told him he had to have known tommy is with scotland yard he might have risked our coming upon a murder scene and doing nothing save calling the police but why take the risk if there was something in that room something on the film that could tie him to cambrey but the police would have found it eventually wouldnt they theyd made their arrest penellin was as good as confessing to the crime the only thing justin had to fear was that someone other than the local police wouldnt accept the idea of penellin as a killer which is exactly what happened less than twentyfour hours after cambreys death we were nosing about we were asking questions he had to take steps to protect himself she asked a final question but why all my equipment why not just the film he didnt have time it was easier to take the entire case drop it from your window and then trot down to see tommy and me in the day room where he told us all about peter then later on he took the cameras to the cove he went out on the rocks and disposed of them in the water he climbed back up the cliff and thats when he fell she smiled feeling the release that comes with relief he looked as if hed shaken off a terrible burden i wonder if we can prove any of it indeed we can in cornwall first at the cove to find the cameras then at the newspaper office to find whatever mick cambrey was writing about oncozyme tomorrow and the film the pictures icing on the cake shall i develop them for you would you of course then lets be about it at once little bird its time to put justin brooke in his place deborah worked with a lightness of both heart and spirit that she would have thought impossible a mere two hours before she found herself humming occasionally singing a line or two from old songs that popped into her head out of nowhere the beatles buddy holly an ancient cliff richard that she didnt even know she knew in the darkroom she clipped the leader from the roll of exposed film spooling it into the developingtank in an automatic process that was second nature to her she didnt pause to reflect upon the work itself or upon the carefree manner in which she did it nor did she pause to think about how and why time and circumstances had somehow reversed themselves allowing her former childhood affection for st james to blossom renewed while they talked together in the lab she was merely grateful that it had somehow happened she was merely grateful for the promise it held that rancour could at last be put to rest between them how right she had been to follow her instincts and come to chelsea to be with simon tonight how happy she had felt to see his face alter the moment he realized that no blame could be laid at his sisters feet how comfortable she had been to follow him to his bedroom to stand chatting and laughing while he rooted out the roll of film they were comrades again sharing their thoughts listening to each other debating and reflecting joy in communicating had been the hallmark of their relationship prior to her threeyear stay in america and those minutes in the lab in his bedroom afterwards had brought back to her the vivid memory of that joy if not the full intensity of the joy itself she saw what he had once been to her as a series of images playing in the field of her mind these whirled her back through childhood and adolescence vast periods of time that she shared with him he was her history in a thousand different ways listening to her woes softening the blow of disappointments reading to her talking to her watching her grow he had seen the very worst that she was her temper tantrums her stubborn pride her inability to accept defeat the demands for perfection which she placed upon herself the difficulty she faced in forgiving weakness in others he had seen this and more and never had he been anything less than completely accepting he might advise or instruct he might warn or admonish but he always accepted and she had known he always would from the moment when as an eighteenyearold boy he had squatted before her at the side of her mothers grave where she was trying to be brave striving for indifference making a show of the fact that at seven years old she could stand the terror of a devastating loss that she barely understood he had drawn her into his arms with five simple words which effectively freed her to be who and what she really was for the rest of her life its all right to cry he had helped her grow up encouraged her in every way and let her go when it was time for her to leave but it was that final action his obvious willingness to release her into her own adulthood without a word to stop her from leaving him which had undermined their relationship creating a rankling that had gnawed within her and because the very worst she could be was the part of her that rose to the surface when she was first confronted with his intention to subject them both to three years of separation heightened by silence she had let joy wither she had let warmth die she had given herself over to a need to hurt him and she had done so achieving a revenge that was at once initially satisfying pure and simple but now she saw that the attainment of such a goal was at best a pyrrhic victory and any vengeance she had wrought upon simon had merely ricocheted wounding herself only in speaking the truth did there exist any hope to rebuild a friendship with him only in confession expiation and forgiveness did there lie the possibility of retrieving joy and she wanted joy nothing meant more than being comfortable with him again talking to him as she had in her childhood as his little sister his comrade and his friend she wanted nothing more for what had long been at the festering core of her painful separation from simon was the thwarted desire to be taken to his bed so that she might know that he truly wanted her so that she might finally be assured that she hadnt just imagined those longago moments when he had allowed her to see what she had convinced herself was honest desire but the need for that satisfaction and knowledge had long since been consumed by the flames of her love for tommy and it was tommy now who would give her the courage to speak the truth for as she held the films negatives to the light searching for the pictures of the cambrey cottage she saw the pictures of lynley as well cooperatively posing with the nanrunnel players she felt a rush of gratitude and devotion just studying him the way he threw back his head in a burst of laughter the way his hair shone the shape of his mouth she knew that tommy was where the loyalty of her adulthood lay he was the future towards which she was moving but she couldnt reach him with an unfettered heart without laying rest to the past she worked through the process of enlarging the photographs which st james had taken in the cambrey cottage from enlarger to developer to stop bath to fixer all the time her mind was taken up with what she would say to him how she would say it and whether her explanation and apology could possibly suffice to end their estrangement it was nearly midnight when shed completed her work in the darkroom the developing the washing the drying the cleaningup she switched off the lights gathered up the photographs and went in search of st james he heard her movement on the stairs before he saw her across his bed hed spread out every document that pertained to the case and he was studying them all deciding which of them could be used to exonerate not only his sister but peter lynley and john penellin as well a flash at his doorway stirred him from his contemplation of these items it was deborahs white shirt against the shadows in the hall she was holding the photographs he smiled have them finished yes it took a bit longer than i thought i wasnt used to the enlarger because its new and well you know that dont you how silly he thought she might give the photographs to him but she didnt do so instead she came to stand at the foot of his bed one hand held the photographs pressed against her side the other curved round the beds tall fluted post i need to talk to you simon something in her face reminded him instantly of a bottle of ink spilled on a dining room chair and a scuffyshoed tenyearolds quavering confession something in her voice however told him that for deborah a moment of accounting had arrived and as a result he felt that sudden draining of strength that comes with an onslaught of dread what is it whats wrong the photograph i knew that youd see it one day or another and i wanted you to see it it was my dearest wish i wanted you to know that i sleep with tommy i wanted you to know because then i might hurt you and i wanted to hurt you simon i was desperate to punish you i wanted you to think of us making love together i wanted you to be jealous i wanted you to care and i simon i despise myself for having done that to you her words were so unexpected that the very surprise of them buffeted him into a form of shock for one ridiculous moment he talked himself into misunderstanding the direction she was heading in allowing himself to assume that she was speaking of the cambrey pictures and making references to them that he simply couldnt comprehend in that instantaneous way that minds have of working he made a quick decision to direct the conversation along those lines what are you talking about jealous of tommy what photograph deborah i dont understand or better yet laughing it off indifferent just a practical joke that didnt work out but even as he gathered the resources to respond she continued making her meaning quite clear i wanted you so much when i left for america i loved you so much and i was sure you loved me not as a brother or an uncle or a sort of second father but as a man an equal you know what i mean her words were so gentle her voice so quiet he felt compelled to keep watching her face he stood immobilized unable to go to her even as every sinew in his body insisted he do so i dont know if i can even explain what it was like for me simon so confident when i left so sure of what you and i had together and then waiting for you to answer my letters at first not understanding even believing something had happened to the post phoning you after two months and hearing how distant you were your career was making such demands on you you said responsibilities were piling up conferences and seminars and papers to write youd answer my letters when you could and how is school deborah are you getting on are you making friends im sure youll do well youve the talent youve the gift youve nothing but a brilliant future ahead of you he said the only thing he could manage i remember i judged myself her fleeting smile was a fragile thing not pretty enough for you not clever enough not amusing not compassionate not loving not desirable not enough that wasnt the truth that isnt the truth most mornings i woke and despaired of the fact that i was still alive and that became part of my loathing as well i wasnt even enough of a person to take my own life worthless i thought totally without value stupid and ugly and utterly useless each word was more difficult to bear than the last i wanted to die i prayed to die but i didnt i just went on which is what most people do they do go on they heal they forget i understand he hoped those four statements would be enough to stop her but he saw that she was determined to carry their conversation through to an end of her own devising tommy was my forgetting at first when he came to visit we laughed we talked the first time he made an excuse why hed come but not after that and he never pushed me simon he never once made demands i didnt talk about you but i think somehow he knew and was determined to wait until i was ready to open my heart to him so he wrote he phoned he laid a real foundation and when he took me to bed i wanted to be there id finally let you go deborah please its all right i understand he stopped looking at her turning his head was the only movement he seemed capable of making he stared at the items hed placed on the bed youd rejected me i was angry i was hurt i got over you in the end but for some reason i believed that i had to show you how things were now i had to make you see that if you didnt want me someone else did so i put that photograph on the wall in my flat tommy didnt want me to he asked me not to but i pointed out the composition the colour the texture of the curtains and the blankets the shapes of clouds in the sky its just a photograph i said are you embarrassed about what it implies about us for a moment she said nothing more st james thought she was finished and he looked up to see that her hand was at her throat her fingers pressing along her collarbone what a terrible lie to tell tommy i just wanted to hurt you as deeply as i could god knows i deserved it i hurt you as well no theres no excusing a need for retaliation like that its adolescent disgusting it says things about me that make me ill im so sorry truly its nothing really do forget it little bird he couldnt bring himself to say it he couldnt say anything he couldnt bear the thought that through his own cowardice he had driven her to lynley it was more than he could suffer he despised himself as he watched seeking words that he didnt know feeling wrenched by emotions he couldnt bear to possess she placed the photographs on the edge of the bed pressing their corners down to keep them from curling do you love him she had gone to the door but she turned to answer hes everything to me she said loyalty devotion affection warmth hes given me things do you love him the question was shaken this time at least can you say that you love him deborah for a moment he thought she might leave without answering but he saw lynleys power sweep right through her body her chin raised her shoulders straightened her eyes shone with tears he heard the answer before she gave it i love him yes i love him i do and then she was gone he lay in bed and stared at the shifting patterns of black shadow and dim light on the ceiling the night was warm so his bedroom window was open the curtains were undrawn and he could hear occasionally cars rumbling along cheyne walk just a block away the noise of their engines amplified by the open expanse of the river his body should have been tired demanding sleep but instead it ached muscles excruciatingly tense in his neck and shoulders hands and arms feeling strung with external nerves chest sore and constricted as if pressed by a weight his mind was a maelstrom in which were swirling fragments of former conversations halfformed hazy fantasies things needing to be said he tried to think of anything other than deborah a fibre analysis he needed to complete a deposition he was due to give in two weeks a conference at which he was to present a paper a seminar in glasgow he had been asked to teach he tried to be what he had been during her absence the cool scientist meeting commitments and facing responsibilities but instead he saw the man he really was the coward who filled his life with denial and distraction to avoid running the risk of vulnerability his entire life was a lie founded on noble aphorisms in which he knew he did not believe let her go let her find her own way let her have a world of expanding horizons filled with people who could give her riches far beyond the paucity of what he had to offer let her find a kindred soul with whom she could share herself one unburdened by the weaknesses that plagued his own life but even this listing of the specious regulations that had governed his behaviour still left him safe from having to confront the final truth fear dominated him it left him useless any action he chose could be the source of rejection so he chose by not choosing by letting time pass by believing that conflicts difficulties and turmoil would sort themselves out on their own in the long run and indeed they had done so loss was the result too late he saw what he should have seen all along that his life with deborah had been a longforming tapestry in which she had held the thread had created the design and had ultimately become the fabric itself that she should leave him now was a form of dying leaving him not deaths peace of the void but an infinite hellfire of recrimination all of it the product of his contemptible fear that the years had passed and he had not told her how he loved her his heart soared in her presence but he would not say the words now he could only thank god that she and lynley planned to take up a new life in cornwall after their marriage if she was gone from his presence what remained of life here would at least be bearable he turned his head on the pillow and looked at the glowing red numbers of the digital clock it was ten past three the effort to sleep was useless he could at least admit that he switched on the light the stack of photographs still lay on the table next to the bed where he had placed them over two hours ago in what he knew quite well was an act of deliberate avoidance more cowardice for which he would despise himself with the dawn he picked them up as if this action could eradicate deborahs words as if the knowledge of how she had once wanted him were not tearing at his soul he began to examine them a study in detachment with his world in ruins without emotion he looked at the corpse its mutilation its position near the sofa he observed the debris that lay in the room the letters and envelopes the pens and pencils the notebooks and folders the scraps of paper covered with writing the poker and fire irons tumbled to the floor the computer switched on with black floppy disks spread out on the desk and then closer to the corpse the glint of silver perhaps a coin halfhidden under his thigh the fivepound note a small wedge torn from it lying disregarded near his hand on the floor above him the mantel on which he had struck his head to the right the hearth to which he had fallen st james flipped through the photographs again and again looking for something he could not have identified even if he saw it the computer the disks the folders the notebooks the money the mantel he thought only of deborah giving up the game he admitted that there would be neither sleep nor peace nor even the possibility of a moments distraction he could only make the hours till dawn slightly more livable he reached for his crutches and swung out of bed throwing on his dressing gown belting it clumsily he headed for the door there was brandy in the study it would not be the first time he had sought its oblivion he made his way down the stairs the study door was partially closed and it swung inwards noiselessly upon his touch a soft glow dancing between gold and dusky rose came from two candles that should have stood on the overmantel but had been placed side by side and lit upon the hearth hands clasped round her knees deborah sat on the ottoman and watched the candles flames seeing her st james wanted to retreat he thought about doing so he didnt move she looked towards the door looked away again quickly when she saw it was he couldnt sleep she said unnecessarily as if she thought she needed to explain her presence in his study wearing dressing gown and slippers after three in the morning i cant think why i ought to be exhausted i feel exhausted but i couldnt sleep too much excitement these past few days her words were casual enough well chosen and indifferent but there was something hesitant in her voice it tried and failed to ring true hearing this he made his way across the room and lowered himself on to the ottoman next to her it was the sort of gesture hed never made before in the past her place had been on the ottoman while he sat above her in the chair or on the sofa i couldnt sleep either he said laying his crutches on the floor i thought id have a brandy ill get it for you she began to rise he caught her hand stopped her no its all right and when she kept her face averted deborah yes the single word was calm her curly mass of hair hid her face from view she made a quick movement like a lifting of her body and he thought it was prelude to rising and leaving but instead of doing so he heard her take a choked breath and realized with a swift dawning surprise that she was struggling not to cry he touched her hair so tentatively that he knew she couldnt possibly feel that he had done so what is it nothing deborah we were friends she whispered you and i we were mates i wanted that back i thought if i talked to you tonight but i just couldnt find it its gone and i it hurts so much to know that if i talk to you if i see you i still feel torn i dont want that feeling i cant face it again her voice broke without a thought he encircled her shoulders with his arm it didnt matter what he said truth or lie made no difference he had to say something to alleviate her pain well survive all this deborah well find our way back well be what we were dont cry roughly he kissed the side of her head she turned into his arms he held her stroked her hair rocked her said her name and all at once felt flooded by peace it doesnt matter he whispered well always be mates well never lose that i promise at his words he felt her arms slip round him he felt the soft pressure of her breasts against his chest he felt her heart beating felt his own heart pounding and accepted the fact that he had lied to her again they would never be friends friendship was absolutely impossible between them when with so simple a movement her arms slipping round him every part of his body lit on fire for her half a dozen admonitions rang out in his head she was lynleys he had hurt her quite enough already he was betraying the oldest friendship in his life there were boundaries between them that couldnt be crossed his resolve was acceptance we arent meant to be happy life isnt always fair he heard each one of them vowed to leave the room told himself to release her and stayed where he was just to hold her just to have her like this for one moment just to feel her near him just to catch the scent of her skin it was enough he would do nothing else save touch her hair again save brush it back from her face she lifted her head to look at him admonitions intentions boundaries and resolves were shot to oblivion their cost was too high they didnt matter nothing mattered just the moment now with her he touched her cheek her brow traced the outline of her lips she whispered his name a single word that finally obliterated fear he wondered how he had ever been afraid to lose himself in the love of this woman she was himself he saw that now he accepted that truth it was a form of fulfilment he brought his mouth to hers nothing existed save being in his arms nothing mattered save the warmth of his mouth and the taste of his tongue it was as if only this single moment counted allowing her life to be defined by his kiss he murmured her name and a sure current passed between them gathering force from the wellspring of desire it swept away the past and took in its flow every belief every intention every aspect of her life but the knowledge that she wanted him more than loyalty more than love more than the promise of the future she wanted him she told herself that this had nothing to do with the deborah who was tommys who slept in tommys bed who would be tommys wife this had to do only with a settling of accounts one hour in which she would measure her worth my love he whispered without you she drew his mouth back to hers she bit his lips gently and felt them curve in a smile she wanted no words in their place she wanted only sensation his mouth on her neck describing a curve to the hollow of her throat his hands on her breasts teasing and caressing dropping to her waist to the belt of her dressing gown loosening it pushing the gown from her shoulders slipping the thin straps of her nightdress down the length of her arms she stood the nightdress slid to the floor she felt his hand on her thigh deborah she didnt want words she bent to him kissed him felt him drawing her down to him heard her own sigh of pleasure as his mouth found her breast she began to touch him she began to undress him i want you he whispered deborah look at me she couldnt she saw the candles glow the stone surround of the fireplace the bookshelves the glint of a single brass lamp on his desk but not his eyes or his face or the shape of his mouth she accepted his kiss she returned his caress but she did not look at him i love you he whispered three years she waited for the rush of triumph but it didnt come instead one of the candles began to gutter spilling wax in a messy flow on to the hearth with a hiss the flame died the burned wick sent up a wisp of smoke whose smell was sharp and disturbing st james turned to the source deborah watched him do so the single small flame of the remaining candle flickered like wings against his skin his profile his hair the sharp edge of his jaw the curve of his shoulder the sure quick movement of his lovely hands she got to her feet her fingers trembled as she put on her dressing gown and fumbled uselessly with its slippery satin belt she felt shaken to her core no words she thought anything else but no words deborah she couldnt for gods sake deborah what is it whats wrong she made herself look at him his features were washed by a storm of emotion he looked young and so vulnerable he looked ready to be struck i cant she said simon i just cant she turned away from him and left the room she ran up the stairs tommy she thought as if his name were a prayer an invocation that could keep her from feeling both unclean and afraid part six expiation the days fair weather had begun to change by the time lynley touched the plane down on to the tarmac at lands end heavy grey clouds were scuttling in from the southwest and what had been a mild breeze back in london was here gathering force as a rainladen wind this transformation in the weather was lynley thought bleakly a particularly apt metaphor for the alteration that his mood and his circumstances had undergone for he had begun the morning with a spirit uplifted by hope but within mere hours of his having decided that the future held the promise of peace in every corner of his life that hope had been swiftly overshadowed by a sick apprehension which he believed he had put behind him unlike the anxiety of the past few days this current uneasiness had nothing to do with his brother instead from his meetings with peter throughout the night had grown a sense of both renewal and rebirth and although during his lengthy visit to new scotland yard the familys solicitor had depicted peters danger with transparent simplicity unless the death of mick cambrey could be unassailably pinned upon justin brooke lynley and his brother had moved from a discussion of the legal ramifications of his position to a fragile communion in which each of them took the first tentative steps towards understanding the others past behaviour a necessary prelude to forgiving past sins from the hours lynley had spent talking to his brother had come the realization that understanding and forgiveness go handinhand to call upon one is to experience the other and if understanding and forgiveness were to be seen as virtues strengths of character not illustrations of personal weakness surely it was time he accepted the fact that they could bring harmony to the single relationship in his life where harmony was most needed he wasnt certain what he would say to her but he knew he was ready to speak to his mother this intention a resolution which lightened his steps and lifted his shoulders began to disintegrate upon his arrival in chelsea lynley dashed up the front steps rapped on the door and came face to face with his most irrational fear st james answered the door he was pleasant enough with his offer of a coffee before they left and confident enough with his presentation of his theory about justin brookes culpability in sasha niffords death under any other circumstances the information about brooke would have filled lynley with the surge of excitement that always came with the knowledge that he was heading towards the conclusion of a case under these circumstances however he barely heard st james words let alone understood how far they went to explain everything that had happened in cornwall and london over the past five days instead he noted that his friends face was etiolated as if from an illness he saw the deepening of the lines on his brow he heard the tension beneath st james exposition of motive means and opportunity and he felt a chill settle in every vital organ of his body his confidence and his will both flagships of the day lost a quick battle with his growing dismay he knew there could be only one source of the change that had come over st james and she walked down the stairs not three minutes after his arrival adjusting the leather strap of a shoulder bag when she reached the hallway and lynley saw her face he read the truth and was sick at heart he wanted to give sway to the anger and jealousy that he felt in that instant but instead generations of good breeding rose to commandeer his behaviour the demand for an explanation became meaningless social chitchat designed to get them through the moment without so much as a hair of feeling out of place working hard on your photos darling he asked her and added because even good breeding had its limits you look as if you havent had a moments rest were you up all night are you finished with them deborah didnt look at st james who went into the study where he began rooting in his desk nearly she came to lynleys side slipped her arms round him lifted her mouth to kiss him and said in a whisper against his lips good morning darling tommy i missed you last night he kissed her feeling the immediacy of her response to him and wondering if everything else he had seen was merely the product of pathetic insecurity he told himself that this was the case nonetheless he still said if youve more work to do you dont need to go with us i want to go the photographs can wait and with a smile she kissed him again all the time with deborah in his arms lynley was acutely aware of st james during the journey to cornwall he was aware of them both he studied every nuance in their behaviour towards him in their behaviour towards each other he examined each word gesture and remark under the unforgiving microscope of his own suspicion if deborah said st james name it became in his mind a veiled avowal of her love if st james looked in deborahs direction it was an open declaration of commitment and desire by the time lynley taxied the plane to a halt on the lands end airstrip he felt tension coiling like a spring in the back of his neck the resulting pain was only a secondary consideration however it was nothing compared to his selfdisgust his roiling emotions had prevented him from engaging in anything other than the most superficial of conversations during the drive to surrey and the flight that followed it and since not one of them was gifted with lady helens capacity for smoothing over difficult moments with amusing chatter their talk had ground itself down to nothing in very short order so that when they finally arrived in cornwall the atmosphere among them was thick with unspoken words lynley knew he was not the only one to sigh with relief when they stepped out of the plane and saw jasper waiting with the car next to the tarmac the silence during their ride to howenstow was broken only by jasper telling him that lady asherton had arranged to have two of the farm lads waiting at the cove at halfone like you said at you wanted john penellin was still being held in penzance he confided but the happy word had gone out to everyone that mister peter be found her ladyships looking ten yers younger this morning for knowing the lads safe jasper concluded she was whacking her tennis balls at five past eight they said nothing more st james riffled through the papers in his briefcase deborah watched the scenery lynley tried to clear his mind they met neither vehicle nor animal on the narrow lanes and it wasnt until they made the turn into the estate drive that they saw anyone at all nancy cambrey was sitting on the front steps of the lodge in her arms molly sucked eagerly at her bottle stop the car lynley said to jasper and then to the others nancy knew about micks newspaper story from the first perhaps she can fill in the details if we tell her what we know st james looked doubtful a glance at his watch told lynley that he was concerned about getting to the cove and from there to the newspaper office before much more time elapsed but he didnt protest nor did deborah they got out of the car nancy stood when she saw who it was she led them into the house and faced them in the entry hall above her right shoulder an old faded sampler hung on the wall a needlepoint scene of a family picnic with two children their parents a dog and an empty swing hanging from a tree the wording was nearly obscure but it probably had spoken with wellmeaning inaccuracy of the constant rewards of family life marks not here lynley asked hes gone to st ives so your fathers still said nothing to inspector boscowan about him about mick about the cocaine nancy didnt pretend to misunderstand she merely said i dont know ive heard nothing and walked into the sitting room where she placed mollys bottle on top of the television and the baby herself in her pram theres a good girl she said and patted her back theres a good little molly you sleep for a bit they joined her it would have been natural to sit but none of them did so at first instead they took positions like uneasy actors who do not yet know how their play will be blocked nancy with one hand curled round the push bar of the pram st james with his back to the bay window deborah near the piano lynley opposite her by the sittingroom door nancy looked as if she anticipated the worst from this unexpected visit her glance went among them skittishly youve news of mick she said together lynley and st james laid out both facts and conjectures she listened to them without question or comment occasionally she seemed struck by fleeting sorrow but for the most part she seemed deadened to everything it was as if far in advance of their arrival she had anaesthetized herself against the possibility of feeling anything more not only about her husbands death but also about some of the lessthancreditable aspects of his life so he never mentioned islington to you lynley asked when they had concluded their story or oncozyme or a biochemist justin brooke never not once was that typical of him to be so secretive about a story before we married no he talked of everything then when we were lovers before the baby and after the baby he went away more and more always about some story to london yes did you know he kept a flat there st james asked when she shook her head lynley said but when your father spoke about mick keeping other women did you never think he might be keeping one in london that would be a reasonable enough assumption wouldnt it considering how often he was travelling up there no there were the decision she faced evidenced itself in her hesitation it was a choice between loyalty or truth and a question of whether truth in this case really constituted a betrayal she appeared resolved she lifted her head there were no other women dad only thought that i let him believe mickey was having other women it was easier that way easier than letting your father discover that his soninlaw liked to wear womens clothes lynleys question appeared to release the young woman from months of secrecy if anything she looked monumentally relieved noone knew nancy murmured for ever so long noone knew but me she sank into the armchair next to the pram mickey she said oh god poor mickey how did you find out she pulled a crumpled tissue from the pocket of her house dress right before molly was born there were things in his chest of drawers i thought he was having an affair at first and i didnt say anything because i was eight months gone and mick and me couldnt so i thought how reasonable it all was as she haltingly explained it pregnant she couldnt accommodate her husband so if he sought another woman she would have to accept it she had after all entrapped him into marriage she had only herself to blame if he hurt her as a result so she wouldnt confront him with the evidence of betrayal she would put up with it and hope to win him back in the end then i came home one night not long after id started serving behind bar at the anchor and rose i found him he was all dressed in my clothes hed put on makeup hed even got himself a wig i thought it was my fault see i liked to buy things new clothes i wanted to be trendy i wanted to look nice for him i thought it would get him back i thought at first he was making a scene to punish me for spending money but i saw soon enough that he got really it made him excited what did you do after you found him threw away my makeup every bit of it shredded my clothes went after them with a butcher knife in the back garden lynley remembered jaspers account of the scene your father saw you doing it didnt he he thought id found things that someone left behind so he believed mick was having other women on the side i let him believe it how could i tell him the truth besides mick promised me that hed never do it again and i thought he could do it id got rid of all my good clothes so he wouldnt be tempted and he tried to be good he did try but he couldnt stop he started bringing things home id find them id try to talk wed try to talk together but nothing worked he got worse it was like he needed the dressing more and more he even did it once at night in the newspaper office and his father caught him harry went mad so his father knew he beat him silly mick came home he was bleeding and cursing crying as well i thought then hed stop but instead he took up a second life in london i thought he was better she wiped her eyes and blew her nose i thought he was cured i thought we had a chance to be happy like when we were lovers we were happy then and noone else knew about micks crossdressing not mark not someone from the village or from the newspaper office just me and harry thats all she said jesus god wasnt that enough what do you think was it enough st james jasper had gone on ahead they were on the drive walking the final distance to the house above them the sky had given up its last vestiges of blue turning to the colour of ageing pewter deborah walked between them her hand through lynleys arm he looked over the top of her head to st james the killing itself has looked like a crime of passion all along st james said a blow to his jaw that sent him crashing against the overmantel noone premeditates a death like that weve always agreed that some sort of argument took place but weve been trying to tie it into micks profession and who sent us in that direction in the first place st james nodded in rueful acceptance harry cambrey he had opportunity he had motive rage over his sons crossdressing theyd come to violence over it before and harry cambrey had other grievances deborah said wasnt mick supposed to be making improvements on the newspaper hadnt he taken out a bank loan perhaps harry wanted a full accounting of how the money was being spent and when he found out it was being spent on what he hated most micks crossdressing he went over the edge then how do you explain the condition of the sitting room a blind lynley said something he could use to support his contention that mick was murdered because of a story but that leaves the other two deaths unaccounted for st james said it also puts peter into jeopardy again if brooke didnt fall to his death someone pushed him tommy it always comes back to brooke which should tell us how likely it is that hes responsible no matter what other wrinkles we find in micks relationships with anyone else the cove and the newspaper office then i expect thats where well dig up the truth they walked through the tudor gatehouse and crossed the drive in the garden they paused to greet lady ashertons retriever who came running to meet them a tennis ball between his jaws lynley wrested it from him hurled it in the direction of the west courtyard and watched as the dog went yelping joyfully on his way as if in response to her retrievers barking the front door was pulled open and lady asherton came out of the house ive lunch waiting she said by way of greeting and continued to speak this time only to lynley peter phoned the yards released him for now but they want him to stay in london he asked to go to eaton terrace was it all right to say that would be fine with you tommy i wasnt quite sure if youd want him at your house its fine he sounded quite different from the way hes talked in the past i wondered if this time hes prepared for a change for good he is yes i think so and i am as well lynley felt a moments trepidation he looked at st james and deborah if youll give us a few minutes he said and was grateful for their immediate understanding they went into the house what is it tommy lady asherton asked is there something youve not told me is there more about peter im going to tell penzance cid about him today lynley said his mothers face blanched he didnt kill mick you and i know that but he was in the cottage after johns visit there on friday and mick was still alive thats the truth of the matter the police need to know it does peter know she didnt appear to be willing to complete the thought he did it for her that i intend to tell the police yes he knows but st james and i think well be able to clear his name today he trusts us to do that lady asherton forced a smile then i shall trust you to do that as well she turned and began to go into the house mother even now he didnt know how much it might cost him to speak nearly sixteen years of his bitterness had created a minefield between them to attempt to cross it called upon resources of character he wasnt sure he possessed she had hesitated her hand flat on the door to push it open she was waiting for him to speak ive made a mess out of peter out of everything else as well her head cocked a quizzical smile touched her lips youve made a mess of him she said peters my son tommy hes my responsibility dont take the blame when there isnt any need he didnt have a father i could have been more to him i chose not to be i would have had to come home to spend time with peter but i couldnt bear that so i left him to himself he saw that she understood the intention behind his words she dropped her hand from the door and came back to the drive where he was standing he looked above her to the asherton coat of arms that was mounted high on the front wall of the house he had never considered the heraldic device anything more than an amusing anachronism but now he saw it as a declaration of strength the hound and the lion facing off in combat the hound overpowered but showing no fear i knew you loved roderick he said i saw that you loved him i wanted to punish you but i loved you as well what i felt for roddy had nothing to do with you it wasnt a question of thinking you didnt love me it was more an unwillingness to see you and forgive you for being what you were for wanting someone besides your father for giving in to the wanting while father was alive i couldnt deal with that i couldnt stand what it meant she looked beyond him towards the tudor gatehouse i gave in she said yes i did that i wish id had the nobility or the courage or whatever it would have taken to send roddy away when i first realized how much i did love him but i didnt possess whatever strength it would have taken to do that tommy other women probably do but i was weak i was needy i asked myself how evil it could be if roddy and i truly loved each other how great a wrong were we committing if we turned a blind eye to social condemnation and acted on that love i wanted him to have him and still live with myself i made neat compartments out of my life children in one your father in another roddy in a third and i was a different person for each part what i didnt expect was that you would burst out of the section id reserved for you and see the person who wanted roddy i didnt think youd ever see me for what i was what were you really mother nothing more or less than a human being i couldnt accept that its all right i understand i had to make you suffer i knew roderick wanted to marry you i swore it would never happen your primary loyalty was to the family and to howenstow i knew he wouldnt marry you unless youd promise to leave the estate so i kept you here like a prisoner all these years you dont have that power i chose to stay he shook his head you would have left howenstow the moment i married he saw in her face that this was the truth she dropped her eyes i knew that mother i used that knowledge as a weapon if i married you were free so i didnt marry you never met the right woman why on earth wont you let me take the blame i deserve she looked up at that i dont want you in pain darling i didnt want it then i dont want it now nothing could have stirred him to greater remorse no rebuke no recrimination he felt like a swine you seem to think the burden is all on your shoulders his mother said dont you know a hundred thousand times ive wished that you hadnt found us together that i hadnt struck out at you that i had done something said something anything to help you with your grief because it was grief you were feeling tommy your father was dying right here in the house and id just destroyed your mother as well but i was too proud to reach out to you what a supercilious little monster i thought how dare he try to condemn me for something he cant even understand let him simmer in his anger let him weep let him rage what a prig he is hell come round in the end but you never did she touched his cheek lightly with the back of her hand a tentative pressure that he barely felt there was no greater punishment than the distance between us marriage to roddy would have done nothing to change that it would have given you something yes it still can a lightening of her voice an underlying gentleness told him what she had not yet said hes asked you again good im glad of it its more forgiveness than i deserve she took his arm that time is finished tommy which was so much her way at the heart of the matter offering a forgiveness that swept away the anger of half a lifetime that simply he asked darling tommy that simply st james walked some paces behind lynley and deborah he watched their progress making a study of their proximity to each other he memorized the details of lynleys arm round deborahs shoulders hers round his waist the angle of their heads as they talked the contrast in the colour of their hair he saw how they walked in perfect rhythm their strides the same length fluid and smooth he watched them and tried not to think about the previous night about his realization that he could no longer run from her and continue to live with himself about the moment when his stunned awareness had finally absorbed the fact that he would have to do so any man who had known her less well would have labelled her actions on the previous night as a clever manipulation whose endproduct gleaned her the witnessing of a measure of suffering to pay for the suffering hed inflicted upon her a confession of her adolescent love for him an admission of that loves attendant desire an encounter that blended the strongest elements of emotion and arousal an abrupt conclusion when she was certain that he intended no further flight but even if he wanted to evaluate her behaviour as a manipulative womans act of spite he could not do it for she had not known he would leave his bedroom and join her in the study nor could she have anticipated that after years of separation and rejection he would finally let go of the worst of his fears she had not asked him to join her she had not asked him to drop onto the ottoman next to her she had not asked him to take her into his arms he had only himself to blame for having crossed the boundary into betrayal and for having assumed in the white heat of the moment that she would be willing to cross it as well he had forced her hand he had called for a decision she had made it if he was to survive from this time on he knew he would have to do it alone unbearable now he tried to believe that the thought would become more endurable in time propitiable gods held back the rain although the sky was growing rapidly more tenebrous when they reached the cove far out to sea the sun burst through a ragged tear in the clouds casting beams like a golden spotlight on the water below but it was only a momentary break in the weather no sailor or fisherman would have been deceived by its transitory beauty below them on the beach two teenaged boys were idly smoking near the rocks one was tall and bigboned with a shock of bright orange hair the other small and whipthin with great knobs on his knees despite the weather they were dressed for swimming on the ground at their feet lay a stack of towels two face masks two snorkels looking up the orangehaired boy saw lynley and waved the other glanced over his shoulder and tossed his cigarette aside where do you suppose brooke threw the cameras in lynley asked st james he was on the rocks friday afternoon my guess is that hed have edged out as far as he could go and heaved the case into the water whats the bottom like mostly granite and the waters clear if the camera case is there theyll be able to see it lynley nodded and made the descent leaving st james with deborah on the cliff they watched as he crossed the narrow strand and shook both boys hands they grinned one driving his fingers into his hair and scratching his scalp the other shifting from foot to foot they both looked cold not exactly the best weather for a swim deborah remarked st james said nothing the boys pulled on face masks adjusted their snorkels and headed for the water one on either side of the rocks alongside them lynley climbed the granite outcropping and picked his way out to its furthest point the surface of the water was extraordinarily calm since a natural reef protected the cove even from the cliff st james could see the anemones that grew on the outcropping beneath the water their stamen swaying in the gentle current above and around them broadleafed kelp undulated beneath them crabs hid the cove was a combination of reef and tide pools sealife and sand it was not the best location for a swim but it had no match as a site for the disposing of an object one wished to go unrecovered for years within weeks the camera case would be shrouded by barnacles sea urchins and anemones within months it would lose both shape and definition ultimately coming to resemble the rocks themselves if the case was there however the two boys were having difficulty finding it again and again they bobbed to the surface on either side of lynley each time they carried nothing with them each time they shook their heads tell them to go farther out st james shouted when the boys made their sixth return emptyhanded lynley looked up nodded and waved he squatted on the rocks and talked to the boys they dived under the water again both were good swimmers they clearly understood what they were looking for but neither found a thing it looks hopeless deborah seemed to be speaking more to herself than to st james nonetheless he replied youre right im sorry deborah i thought to have recovered at least something for you he glanced her way saw by her expression of misery that shed read the meaning behind his words oh simon please i couldnt when it came down to it i couldnt do it to him can you try to understand the salt water would have ruined them anyway but at least youd have had something to remind you of your success in america besides tommy of course she stiffened he knew he had hurt her and felt a whisper of triumph at his power to do so it was replaced almost immediately by a roar of shame that was unforgivable im sorry he said i deserve it no you dont deserve it he walked away from her giving his attention back to the cove tell them to finish tommy he shouted the cameras arent there below the two boys were surfacing once more this time however one of them clutched an object in his hand long and narrow it glinted in the dull light as he handed it to lynley wooden handle metal blade both bearing no sign of having been in the water more than a few days whats he got deborah asked lynley held it up so that they both could see it from the top of the cliff st james drew a quick breath a kitchen knife he said a lazy rain had begun to fall by the time they reached the harbour car park in nanrunnel it was no precursor of a cornish southwester but rather the herald of a brief summer shower thousands of gulls accompanied it screaming in from the sea to seek havens on chimneytops along the quay and upon the decks of boats secured to the harbour walls on the path that skirted the circumference of the harbour they passed overturned skiffs lopsided piles of fishing nets redolent with the odours of the sea and waterside buildings whose windows reflected the unchanging grey mask of the weather not until they reached the point at which the path inclined between two buildings as it led into the village proper did any of them speak it was then that lynley noticed that the cobbled pavement was already slick with rain he glanced uneasily at st james the other man answered his look i can manage it tommy theyd talked little about the knife just that it was obviously a kitchen utensil so if it had been used on mick cambrey and if nancy could identify it as having come from the cottage it served as further evidence that the crime against her husband had not been planned its presence in the cove did nothing to absolve justin brooke from blame rather the knife merely changed his reason for having gone there in the first place not to rid himself of deborahs cameras but to rid himself of something far more damaging thus the cameras remained a piece still not tucked into position in the jigsaw of the crime they all agreed that it was reasonable to continue to conclude brooke had taken them from deborahs room but where he had disposed of them was once again as elusive a location as it had been two days ago rounding the corner of an antique silver shop on the lamorna road they found the streets of the village deserted this was an unsurprising summertime phenomenon in an area where the vicissitudes of the weather often forced holidaymakers to be flexible in matters concerning how they spent their time where sun would see them strolling the village streets exploring the harbour and taking pictures on the quay rain usually provoked a sudden need to try their luck in a game of chance a sudden hunger for tucking into a fresh crab salad a sudden thirst for real ale an inclement afternoon was a welcome boon to the proprietors of bingo parlours restaurants and pubs this proved to be the case at the anchor and rose the pub teemed with fishermen forced to shore by the weather as well as day visitors seeking shelter from the rain most of them were packed into the public bar the formal lounge beyond it was largely empty in any other circumstances two such diverse groups inhabiting the same wateringhole would hardly be likely to blend into a cohesive unit but the presence of a teenaged mandolinplayer a fisherman conversant with the irish whistle and a palelegged man wearing runningshorts and playing the spoons had broken the barrier of class and experience blending what should have been motley into montage in the wide bay window overlooking the harbour a leatherskinned fisherman backlit by the dull light outside engaged a fashionably clad tot in a game of cats cradle his weathered hands held out the string to the child his broken teeth flashed in a grin go on dickie take it you know how to play mummy coaxed the little boy dickie cooperated approving laughter ensued the fisherman rested his hand on the childs head its a photograph isnt it lynley said to deborah in the doorway where they stood watching she smiled what a wonderful face he has tommy and look how the light just barely strikes the side of it st james was on the stairs climbing up to the newspaper office deborah followed lynley behind her you know she went on pausing briefly on the landing i was worried for a time about the scope for my photographs in cornwall dont ask me why im a creature of habit i suppose and my habit has been to do most of my work in london but i love it here tommy theres a photograph everywhere its grand truly ive thought that from the first at her words lynley felt shamed by his earlier doubts he paused on the steps i love you deb her expression softened and i you tommy st james had already opened the door of the newspaper office inside two telephones were ringing julianna vendale was typing at a word processor a young photographer was cleaning half a dozen camera lenses lined up on a desk and in one of the cubicles three men and a woman leaned into a circle of conversation harry cambrey was among them advertising and circulation was painted in faded black letters on the upper half of the wood and glass door cambrey saw them and left his meeting he was wearing suit trousers a white shirt a black tie as if in the need to explain this he said buried him this morning halfpast eight odd lynley thought that nancy hadnt mentioned it but it explained the acceptance with which she had greeted their presence there was a degree of finality to burial it didnt end sorrow but it did make easier the acknowledgement of loss half a dozen coppers hanging about in the graveyard cambrey continued first thing theyve done besides trying to stick the killing on john penellin and isnt that a thought john killing mick perhaps he had a motive after all st james said he handed mick cambreys set of keys to his father micks dressing would a man be driven to kill another man over that cambreys fist closed over the keys he turned his back on his employees and lowered his voice so who knows about it you covered up well nearly everyone sees mick exacdy as you painted him a real mans man an insatiable womanizer what the hell else could i do cambrey asked god damn he was my son he was a man whose main source of arousal was dressing like a woman i never could break him i did try so this wasnt something recent shoving the keys into his pocket cambrey shook his head hed been doing it all his life off and on id catch him at it whip his arse push him stark naked into the street tie him to a chair and paint his face and make like id plan to cut off his cock but nothing made a difference save his death lynley said cambrey didnt seem to care about the implication behind lynleys words he merely said i protected the lad as best i could i didnt kill him the protection worked st james said people saw him as you wished him to be seen but in the end he didnt need your protection because of the crossdressing but because of a story just as you thought it was the guns wasnt it cambrey asked like i said st james looked at lynley as if wanting direction or perhaps permission to add to the mans mourning an explanation of the notes cambrey had found in micks desk would do it through their real meaning nearly everything could be revealed not only crossdressing but drugdealing as well not only spending money frivolously instead of using it to upgrade the newspaper but filtering much of it off in order to support a double life every delusion lynley thought deserved destruction building anything on the foundation of a lie be it a single relationship or an entire way of life was to rely upon sand to remain unshifting while the illusion of solidity might exist for a while whatever was built would ultimately crumble the only question seemed to be at what point harry cambreys inaccurate vision of his son ought to be laid to rest lynley looked at the old man studying the face that was creased with age and failure jaundiced by ill health he saw the stark bones of his chest pressing against his shirt the ugly nicotine stains on his fingers the arthritic curl of those fingers as he reached for a bottle of beer on a desk let someone else do the telling he decided we know he was working on a story about a drug called oncozyme lynley said st james followed his lead he was spending time in london visiting a company called islington and a biochemist there called justin brooke did mick ever speak of brooke of islington cambrey shook his head a drug you say he still seemed to be adjusting to the fact that his previous idea about gunrunning had led nowhere we need access to his files here and in the cottage if were to prove anything st james said the man who killed mick is dead himself only micks notes can give us his motive and some sort of foundation to build a case against him and if the killer found the notes and destroyed them if they were in the cottage and he pinched them that night too many other things have occurred that neednt have happened had the killer found the notes lynley thought about st james explanation once more how brooke tried to eliminate peter because of something peter must have seen or heard that evening in gull cottage how hed taken deborahs cameras to get at the film this second circumstance alone spoke more loudly than anything else in support of the existence of a piece of hard evidence it had to be somewhere however disguised brooke had known that cambrey spoke he kept files in those cabinets he nodded in their direction and more at the cottage the policere done with it and ive the key when youre ready to go there lets get to work there were three cabinets of four drawers apiece while the business of putting out a newspaper went on round them lynley st james deborah and cambrey began going through the drawers one by one look for anything st james told them that bore any resemblance to a report on oncozyme the name of the drug itself a mention of cancer a study of treatments interviews with doctors researchers or patients the search began through folders notebooks and simple scraps of paper they saw immediately that it would be no easy task there was no logical manner in which mick cambrey had done his filing it bore signs of neither organization nor unity it would take hours perhaps days to go through it all for each piece had to be read separately for the slightest allusion to oncozyme to cancer to biochemical research they had been at it for over an hour when julianna vendale said if youre looking for notes dont forget his computer and opened a drawer in his desk to reveal at least two dozen floppy disks noone groaned although deborah looked dismayed and harry cambrey cursed they continued to wade through the detritus of the dead mans career interrupted by the telephone just after four oclock someone answered it in one of the cubicles then stuck his head out the door and said is mr st james here salvation deborah sighed rubbing the back of her neck perhaps someones phoning to confess lynley stood to stretch he walked to the window outside a gentle rain was continuing to fall it was hours before dark but in two of the buildings across paul lane lamps had been lit in one of the cottages a family sat round a table drinking afternoon tea and eating biscuits from a tin in another a young woman cut a mans hair she was concentrating on the sides standing in front of him to examine her work he sat patiently for a moment then pulled her between his legs and kissed her soundly she cuffed his ears laughed gave herself to his embrace lynley smiled turning back to the office he saw st james watching him from the cubicle in which he spoke on the phone his face looked troubled contemplatively he was pulling at his lip whoever he was speaking to was doing much of the talking only at long intervals did st james say a few words when at last he hung up he spent what seemed like two or three minutes looking down at the phone he picked it up once as if to make a call but then replaced the receiver without having done so at last he came out to rejoin the others deborah can you manage for a bit on your own tommy and i need to see to something she looked from him to lynley of course shall we go on to the cottage when weve finished here if you will without another word he headed for the door lynley followed he said nothing on the way down the stairs near the bottom they skirted two children who were running a collection of small metal lorries along the banister they stepped past the crowded doorway of the anchor and rose stepped into the street they turned up the collars of their coats against the rain what is it lynley asked who was on the phone helen helen why on earth shes found out about the list of cambreys prospects tommy and about the telephone messages on the machine in his flat and it seems they all have one thing in common from the expression on your face its not cocaine i take it not cocaine cancer st james walked towards paul lane his head bent into the rain lynleys eyes went to the harbour to the huddled seabirds in a mass on the quay protected from harm by their very numbers he turned from them and looked at the rainmisted hills above the village where are we going he called to his friend st james paused saying over his shoulder we need to talk to dr trenarrow it hadnt been easy for lady helen to uncover the truth that lay behind the list of prospects st james explained the first dozen names she tried gave her nothing to go on and more importantly no piece of leading information upon which she could hang any inquiry at all the recipient of each one of her phone calls was tightlipped to begin with becoming even more so the moment she mentioned the name michael cambrey considering their reactions that they had heard of mick in some fashion or another was a fact beyond doubt as was their determination to reveal nothing substantial about what their connection to cambrey was had he interviewed them for a story she would ask had he been seeking testimony of some sort had he visited their homes had he written them letters no matter which tack she tried the persona she adopted to try it or the subject matter she attempted to pursue they were always one step ahead of her as if the first person on the list had telephoned the rest and warned them of an impending call not even the mention of cambreys murder was enough to jar an admission from anyone indeed the few times she tried that as an opening gambit posing as a reporter seeking information for a feature story on another journalists death the result had been an even stonier reticence than her previous fabrications had inspired it was not until she reached the fifteenth name that the direction of these fruitless conversations changed for the fifteenth name belonged to richard graham and he was dead as was the sixteenth name catherine henderford and the seventeenth donald highcroft as well as the eighteenth the nineteenth and the twentieth all of them dead of cancer lung ovarian liver intestinal and all of them dead within the last two months i went directly back to the first name on the list lady helen had said of course i couldnt phone him myself so i went to chelsea and had cotter do it for me we invented the name of an organization cancer cooperative something like that checking in to see how the patient was doing cotter said right down the list theyd all had cancer and those that were alive were all in remission simon the two callers who had left their messages on the answering machine in mick cambreys flat had placed their calls about cancer as well the exception being that they were willing even eager to talk to lady helen they had phoned micks number in answer to an advertisement that had run for months in the sunday times you can beat cancer followed by a telephone number its my wife one of the callers had said when lady helen phoned him one gets so desperate weve tried diets meditation prayer group therapy mind over matter every kind of drug when i saw the advert i thought what the hell but noone returned my call because mick never received it because mick was dead what was mick doing simon lady helen had asked at the end of her story the answer was simple hed changed from journalist to a merchant of dreams he was selling hope he was selling the possibility of life he was selling oncozyme hed learned about oncozyme in his interview with trenarrow st james said to lynley as they passed the methodist church on their way up paul lane the wind had picked up the rain was beading his hair he followed the story to islingtonlondon where brooke gave him more details i should imagine the two of them hatched the scheme between them it was simple enough noble if one disregards the fact that they were probably making a fortune from the effort they were providing cancer patients with a miracle drug years before the drug would be legally approved and available for use look at the countless terminally ill people with nothing more to hang on to but the hope that something might work think of what people get involved with in an attempt to put themselves into remission macrobiotic diets laetrile psychic healers mick was taking no risk that thered be a lack of interest nor did he have to worry that people might not be willing to pay whatever price he was asking for the chance of a cure he had only two problems the first would be getting his hands on a steady supply of the drug justin brooke lynley said st james nodded for payments in cash initially in cocaine later on i expect but once mick had the oncozyme he had to find someone who would administer it monitor the dosage assess the results for part of the profits of course noone would take such a risk without some sort of payoff good god roderick trenarrows housekeeper told cotter that he spends a great deal of time visiting a convalescent home in st just i didnt think much of it at the time except trenarrow himself told me that experimental drugs are often used on terminal patients look at how those two pieces of information fit together to explain whats been going on a small clinic in st just where trenarrow sees a select group of patients filtered his way by mick cambrey an illegal clinic posing as a very private convalescent home where people pay a hefty fee to be injected with oncozyme and then the profits get divided three ways cambrey brooke and trenarrow micks bank book in london his share of the pickings then who killed him why brooke something must have gone wrong with the deal perhaps mick got greedy or perhaps he made a slip of the tongue in peters presence that put them all in jeopardy perhaps thats the reason brooke was after peter lynley paused momentarily gripped st james arm peter told me that mick made a remark blast i cant remember it exactly peter threatened to blackmail him about his crossdressing and about cocaine but mick didnt care he advised peter to look for another source he said something about people being willing to pay a hell of a lot more to stay alive than to have a secret kept and justin heard that didnt he he must have known that mick was inches away from telling the tale to peter he wanted to leave the cottage he wanted peter to leave you can see why brooke stood to lose everything if mick started playing fast and loose with their secret his career his reputation as a scientist his job at islington he stood to go to gaol if it all came out he must have returned to the cottage after peter left he and mick must have got into it things escalated between them god knows they were both breaking enough laws to be as tightly strung as the devil and justin took a swing at him that did it and trenarrow lynley paused once again opposite the primary school grounds st james looked past him the stage of the openair theatre was still set up performances of one sort or another would continue through the summer now however the grounds were sodden by rain trenarrow knows about everything id wager hes known since the moment he was introduced to brooke at howenstow on saturday night i should guess hed never actually seen brooke before then why should he have when mick was playing the middleman but the moment he was introduced he must have put together the rest micks death everything but why hold his tongue st james looked not at lynley but at the school grounds as he replied you know the answer to that lynley gazed up the hill from where they stood just the roof of the villa and part of its white cornice showed against the grey sky he faced gaol as well the clinic the drug the payments people made his career his research and most importantly he stood to lose my mother i expect the payments people made for oncozyme allowed him to buy the villa in the first place a home he could be proud to offer to her so he said nothing they continued their climb what do you suppose he intends now with brooke and cambrey dead with brooke dead the source of oncozyme is dried up hell have to close the clinic in st just and make do with what hes managed to save from the profits and our part in all of this st james do we turn him over to the police do we phone his superiors do we take the opportunity to ruin him st james examined his friend broad shoulders wet hair beginning to drip mouth set in a line thats the hell of this isnt it tommy thats the irony to have the foulest wish youve ever possessed granted in spades just at the moment when i expect you no longer wish it are you leaving it up to me weve got brooke and cambrey tied together well enough weve got micks visits to islington weve got peter and justin together at gull cottage weve got justins lie about being in the anchor and rose afterwards weve got justins use of cocaine as far as the police need to know mick was his supplier a deal went bad and justin killed him sasha as well so yes the rest is yours youre the policeman even if it means letting part of the truth go letting roderick go ill not stand in judgement at the bottom of it trenarrow was trying to help people the fact that they paid him for the help makes it ugly but at least he was trying to do something good they made the rest of the climb in silence as they turned up the drive to the villa lights went on on the ground floor as if they were expected visitors below them village lights began to shine through the gloom as well making an occasional nimbus glitter behind glass dora answered the door she was dressed for cooking wrapped round by an enormous red apron that bore smudges of flour on both breasts and along the thighs more flour powdered the creases of her blue turban and an additional dusting had greyed one eyebrow doctors in his study she said when they asked for him come in with you rain dont do a bit good for bodies out in it she led them to the study rapped on the door and opened it when trenarrow answered i bring tea for these good mans she said nodded sharply and left them dr trenarrow got to his feet hed been seated behind his desk in the act of polishing his spectacles he put them back on his nose everythings all right he asked lynley peters at the house in london thank god your mother i think shed probably like to see you tonight behind his spectacles trenarrow blinked once he obviously didnt know what to make of lynleys remark he said youre both soaked he went to the fireplace and lit the fire doing it the oldfashioned way by placing a stubby candle beneath the coals st james waited for lynley to speak he wondered if this final interview between them would better be held without his presence although hed given lipservice to lynleys opportunity to make a free decision he really had no doubt what that decision would be still he knew it would not be easy for his friend to turn a blind eye to trenarrows part in the illegal sale of oncozyme no matter how noble the doctors motives had been it would be easier for lynley to do it alone but st james own need to put every detail to rest kept him where he was listening and noting and prepared to say nothing the burning coal hissed dr trenarrow returned to his desk st james and lynley sat in the wing chairs in front of it rain made a sound like delicate waves against the windows dora returned with the tea which she poured leaving with a gende admonition to mind that you take your medcine when the time come which trenarrow accepted with a dutiful nod when they were alone once again with the fire the tea and the rain lynley spoke we know about oncozyme roderick and the clinic in st just about the newspaper advertisement that brought you the patients about mick and justin and the parts they played mick filtering the applicants to get those best able to pay for the treatment justin supplying the drug from london trenarrow pushed fractionally back from the desk is this an official visit tommy no then what had you met brooke before saturday night at howenstow id only spoken to him on the phone but he came here friday night when he was here when i got back from gull cottage why the obvious reasons he wanted to talk about mick but you didnt report him to the police trenarrows brow furrowed he answered simply no yet you knew hed killed him did he tell you why trenarrows eyes moved between the other two men he licked his lips gripped the handle of his teacup and studied its contents mick wanted to raise the cost of treatment id already opposed him evidently that evening justin had as well they argued about it justin lost his temper and when you joined us at the cottage did you know justin brooke had killed mick id not seen brooke yet id no more idea than you who had done it what about the condition of the room and the missing money i didnt put it together until i saw brooke he was looking for anything that could connect him to cambrey and the money i dont know he may have taken it but he didnt admit to it to the killing however yes to that and the mutilation to misdirect the police his cocaine use did you know about that no and that mick dealt in cocaine on the side good god no st james listened feeling the vague discomfort of uncertainty a tantalizing fact danced on the edge of his consciousness something not quite right that was asking to be noticed the other two men continued talking their voices were low barely much more than a murmur with nothing more at stake than an exchange of information a straighteningout of details and a plan for going on into the conversation a sudden noise was interjected a dim bleeping that came from trenarrows wrist he pressed a tiny button on the side of his watch medicine he said blood pressure he reached into his jacket pocket brought out a flat silver case and opened it it contained a neatly arranged layer of white pills dora would never forgive me if she came in one morning and found me dead of a stroke he popped a pill into his mouth and downed it with tea st james watched him do so feeling fixed to his chair as every piece of the jigsaw finally fell into place how it had been done who had done it and most of all why some in remission lady helen had said but the rest of them dead dr trenarrow lowered his cup replaced it in the saucer as he did so st james cursed himself inwardly he cursed every sign he had overlooked those details he had missed and each piece of information he had disregarded because it could not be assigned a convenient place in the puzzle of the crime once again he cursed the fact that his field was science not interview and investigation he cursed the fact that his interest lay in objects and what they could reveal about the nature of a crime had his interest lain in people surely he would have seen the truth from the first out of the corner of his eye lynley saw st james lean forward and put his hand on trenarrows desk it was an action that effectively broke into their conversation the money he said i beg your pardon tommy who did you tell about the money lynley tried to catch his drift what money nancy said mick was doing the pay envelopes she said there was money in the sitting room that evening you and i discussed it later that night after she told us about it at the lodge who else did you tell who else knew about the money deborah and helen they were there when nancy told us john penellin as well did you tell your mother of course not why on earth would i then how did dr trenarrow know lynley realized at once what the question meant he saw the answer on trenarrows face he fought a battle for professional indifference he lost it saying only jesus god trenarrow said nothing lynley couldnt think beyond a simple no recognizing that what his friend had said earlier was coming to pass his every foul wish of the last fifteen years was about to be granted in absolute spades what are you saying st james he managed to ask although he knew the answer without having to hear it that dr trenarrow killed mick cambrey he didnt intend to they argued he hit him mick fell he began to haemorrhage he was dead within minutes roderick lynley felt desperate for the man to exonerate himself in some way knowing only that trenarrows exoneration was tied intimately into lynleys own future life but st james went on utterly calm only the facts counted he wove them together when he saw cambrey was dead he acted quickly it wasnt a search even if mick had been stupid enough to keep records of the oncozyme transactions in the cottage there was no time to look for them then there was only time to make it look like a search or a possible robbery or a sexual crime but it was none of those things it was a fight about oncozyme dr trenarrows face looked implacable when he spoke his lips moved but the rest of him was immobile and his words seemed nothing more than a futile if expected effort at denial they carried no conviction i was at the play on friday night you know that very well an openair play in a school yard st james said hardly a difficult feat to slip out for a while especially since youd placed yourself at the back i expect you went to him after the interval during the second act its not a long walk three minutes no more you went to see him then you intended only to talk to him about oncozyme but instead you killed him and came back to the play and the weapon trenarrows bravado was weak was i supposed to be carrying it round nanrunnel in my jacket for the fracture of the skull there was no weapon the castration was another matter you took the knife from the cottage to the play scorn this time yet no more successful than the bravado had been i should think you hid it somewhere en route in virgin place perhaps in ivy street in a garden or a dustbin you returned for it later that night and got rid of it on saturday at howenstow which is where i dare say you got rid of brooke as well because once brooke knew that cambrey had been killed he knew who must have done it but he couldnt afford to turn you in to the police without damaging himself the oncozyme scheme bound the two of you together this is all conjecture trenarrow said according to what youve said so far i had more reason to keep mick alive than to kill him if he was supplying me with patients what purpose would his death serve you didnt intend to kill him you struck out in anger your interest was in saving peoples lives but micks was in collecting their money that attitude pushed you right over the edge theres no evidence you know that not for a murder youve forgotten the cameras st james said trenarrow looked at him steadily his expression unchanging you saw the camera at the cottage you assumed id taken pictures of the body during the chaos on saturday when john penellin was arrested you dropped the cameras from deborahs room but if thats so lynley said feeling himself trenarrows advocate for the moment why didnt he take the cameras to the cove if he disposed of the knife there why not the cameras as well and risk being seen hiking across the grounds with the case in his possession i dont know why i didnt realize the stupidity of that idea before he could conceal the knife on his person tommy if someone saw him in the grounds he could have claimed to be taking a walk to clear his head of drink it would have been a believable story people were used to seeing him at howenstow but the cameras no i imagine he took them somewhere else in his car perhaps later that night to a place where he could be relatively certain theyd never be found lynley listened coming to terms with the truth theyd all been at the dinner to hear the conversation theyd all laughed at the absurdity of tourists in the mines he said the name two words that acted as final acceptance of what his heart told him was an incontrovertible fact wheal maen st james looked at him at dinner on saturday night aunt augusta was up in arms about sealing wheal maen this is supposition trenarrow broke in sharply supposition and madness beyond our oncozyme connection youve nothing else to go on besides what youre inventing right here in this room and once our mutual history is out in public tommy whos going to believe this story if indeed you actually want our mutual history to be known it comes down to that in the long run doesnt it lynley asked it always begins and ends with my mother for an instant he allowed himself to see past the call for justice to its attendant scandal he could have ignored trenarrows use of oncozyme his illegal clinic and the exorbitant price that patients no doubt paid for treatment there he could have overlooked all this and allowed his mother to remain in ignorance for the rest of her life but murder was different it demanded retribution he could not ignore that lynley saw how the next few months would play out a court of law his accusations trenarrows denial the sort of case the defence would build with his mother caught in the middle and ultimately named as the reason behind lynleys public denunciation of her longtime lover hes right st james lynley said hollowly this is conjecture even if we got the cameras from the mine the main shafts been flooded for years the films ruined by now no matter what was on it st james shook his head thats the only thing dr trenarrow didnt know the films not in the camera deborah gave it to me lynley heard the swift breath hiss between trenarrows teeth st james went on and the evidence is there isnt it st james asked your silver pillbox under mick cambreys thigh you may be able to explain away everything else you may be able to accuse tommy of attempting to fabricate evidence in order to separate you from his mother but youll never be able to deal with the fact that in the photograph of the body the pillbox is there the very same one you took from your pocket only minutes ago trenarrow looked at the misty view of the harbour it proves nothing when its in our photographs but missing from the police photographs thats hardly the case and you know it rain pattered on windows wind sounded in the chimney a distant foghorn moaned trenarrow moved in his chair turning back towards the room he grasped its arms and said nothing what happened lynley asked him roderick for the love of god what happened for a long time trenarrow didnt answer his dull eyes were fixed upon the space between lynley and st james he reached for the pull of the top drawer of the desk and aimlessly played it between his fingers oncozyme he said brooke couldnt get enough of it he was juggling the london inventory books as it was but we needed more if you could only know how many people phoned still phone how frantic they are for help we couldnt get enough but mick kept funnelling patients my way brooke eventually substituted something for the oncozyme didnt he st james said your first patients went into remission just as islingtons research indicated they would but after a while things started to go wrong hed been sending the drug down from london with mick when it became impossible to get and they saw the clinic would have to close they made a substitution people who should have gone into remission began to die not all at once of course but a pattern emerged i became suspicious i tested the drug it was a saline solution and that was the fight i went to see him on friday night i wanted to close the clinic he stared across the room at the fire its glow was reflected in his spectacles like two points of heat mick wasnt at all concerned these werent people to him they were a source of income look just keep the clinic running until we get more of the stuff he said so we lose a few so what othersll come people pay anything for the chance of a cure what are you so hot about youre bringing the money in hand over fist and dont pretend you arent happy as hell about it trenarrow looked at lynley i tried to talk to him tommy i couldnt make him see i couldnt get him to understand i kept talking he kept brushing it off i finally i just snapped when you saw he was dead you decided to paint it as a sexual crime st james said i thought he was after the village women i thought it would look like someones husband finally got to him and the money in the cottage i took it as well and then made it look like the room had been searched i took my handkerchief from my pocket so i wouldnt leave prints i must have lost the pillbox then i saw it the moment i kneeled by his body later lynley leaned forward as black as it is micks death started out as an accident roderick an assault an accident but what about brooke you were tied together what did you have to fear from him even if he assumed youd killed mick hed have kept quiet about it bringing you down would only have brought himself down as well i had nothing to fear from brooke trenarrow said then why i knew he wanted peter wanted to be rid of him he was here on friday night when i got home from the play wed never actually met of course but he had no trouble finding the villa he said mick had been talking in front of peter he was worried he wanted me to do something to tighten micks tongue which youd already done st james noted trenarrow accepted the grim statement without reaction when he heard about the killing the next morning he panicked he came to see me he thought it was only a matter of time before peter put together some remarks mick had made and either went to the police or started sniffing round for someone to blackmail peter had a habit to support he didnt have money hed already threatened mick brooke wanted him dead i wasnt about to let that happen god oh god lynley felt the sharp blade of regret pierce through him he said there was no risk involved that he could make it look like an overdose of some sort i didnt know what he intended but i thought i could stall him i told him i had a better plan and asked him to meet me on the cliff after the party on saturday night and then you killed him id taken the knife but he was drunk it was easy enough to shove him over the edge and hope it would look like an accident for a moment trenarrow fell silent he studied a few folders a magazine three photographs a pen that were arranged on his desk i didnt regret that not for a moment i still dont but hed already passed the drug on to sasha it was ergotamine and quinine he told her to give it to peter ive been too late every way ive turned what a mess what a blasted horror trenarrow began uselessly to gather a few papers arranging them in a pile tapping them together he fondly looked round the room he said i wanted this for her i couldnt offer her gull cottage what a ludicrous thought but she would have come here and oncozyme made it possible so it seemed a double good can you understand that people who otherwise faced death would live and be cured while your mother and i would finally be together i wanted this for her he held the papers in one hand and with the other slid open the middle drawer of his desk had oncozyme existed then i would have saved him tommy without hesitation without a second thought no matter what i felt for your mother i hope you believe me he placed the papers in the drawer rested his hand on top of them does she know about this lynley thought of his father wasting away he thought of his mother trying to make the best of her life he thought of his brother growing up at howenstow alone he thought of trenarrow it was an effort to speak she doesnt know thank god trenarrows hand slithered in and then out of the drawer a dull glint upon metal he held a revolver thank god he said again and levelled it at st james roderick lynley stared at the gun wild thoughts disconnected darted through his brain a blackmarket purchase a wartime antique the gun room at howenstow of course hed have prepared for this moment theyd been signalling to him that it was coming for days their questions their interviews their telephone calls roderick for gods sake yes trenarrow said i suppose thats right lynley quickly shifted his eyes st james face hadnt changed it didnt show even a shadow of emotion a movement at the edge of his vision and lynley looked back to the gun trenarrows finger was easing towards the trigger and suddenly before him was the possibility again a thematic repetition he could not avoid it was every foul wish in absolute spades there was only a split second to make a decision choose he told himself fiercely and he did so roderick you cant hope lynleys words were cut off by the bellow of the gun deborah pressed her fists against the small of her back to ease her tired muscles the room was warm and in spite of the window that was cracked open against the rain the smoke from harry cambreys cigarettes made the air malodorous eyestinging and stuffy in the office everyone had continued with his work telephones rang intermittendy word processor keys tapped drawers opened and shut footsteps creaked across the floor deborah had explored the contents of one entire filing cabinet achieving nothing more than three paper cuts between her fingers and print stains across the palms of her hands from the sounds harry cambrey was making a groan a sigh a muttered oath it didnt seem that he was having any better luck she stifled a yawn feeling completely drained shed slept only an hour or two after dawn and even then the fractured dreams shed experienced had left her physically depleted and emotionally worn the effort not to think about last night had taken its toll now she only wanted sleep partly as succour but mostly as escape even as she thought about it her eyelids grew heavy the rain on the roof was wonderfully soporific the room was warm the murmur of voices so soothing a howl of sirens in the street below slapped her fully awake first one then a second a moment later a third julianna vendale left her desk and went to the window deborah joined her as harry cambrey pushed himself to his feet an ambulance was just making the turn from the penzance road into paul lane some distance ahead of it where paul lane began the ascent into the hills two police cars sped through the rain simultaneously a telephone began to ring in the newsroom julianna took the call the conversation was mostly onesided her comments were terse consisting only of when where fatal all right yes thanks she hung up and said to cambrey theres been a shooting at trenarrows deborah had time to feel only a frisson of danger saying only trenarrow before harry cambrey moved he bolted for the door grabbing two cameras and a mackintosh on his way he threw open the door and shouted over his shoulder to julianna vendale stay by the phones as he clattered down the stairs into the street another police car shot past oblivious of the rain patrons of the anchor and rose as well as some of the inhabitants of paul lane began to stream out of buildings and take up the chase harry cambrey was caught up in their midst cameras banging against his thighs struggling to make his way through the crush from the window deborah watched she looked for them vainly a blond head and a black one surely they would be among the crowd having heard the name trenarrow they would be heading towards the villa a voice barked out from the street dont know dead we think the words were electrifying hearing them deborah saw simons face she remembered the way hed looked at tommy grim with decision before hed taken him from the office with a rush of horror she thought they went to see trenarrow she dashed from the room and flew down the stairs she shoved her way through the throng of people still gathered in the doorway of the pub and stumbled outside rain pelted her a passing car honked its horn its tyres hit a puddle which sent up a spume of spray but none of this existed she knew only the need to find trenarrows home she felt only the terror of a shooting in the past three years lynley had only alluded to the discord in his life and even then the allusion was made in actions not in words a preference for spending christmas with her rather than with his family a letter from his mother gone unopened for weeks a telephone message never returned but as theyd walked together to the cove this afternoon hed told her that hed put all of it to rest the enmity the discord the bitterness the anger to have something happen now was obscene not dead no the words carried her towards the hillside rainwater shooting from an unguttered roof top struck her cheeks and blinded her momentarily as she headed up the incline she paused and cleared her vision with the crowd surging round her dashing towards the flash of blue lights in the distance the air was alive with speculations on death if there was a body to be seen or blood to be smelt here existed the populace that would do the honours at the first intersection she was pushed into the steamy windows of the talisman cafe by an angry matron who pulled a yowling little boy by the arm watcher goin the woman shouted furiously at deborah she stood in odd roman sandals that were laced to her knees she tugged the child to her side bleeding trippers think you own the village deborah didnt bother to answer she elbowed past her later she would remember her headlong flight through the village and up the hill as an everchanging collage on the door of a shop a rainstreaked sign on which the words clotted cream and chocolate gateau oozed into one another a single sunflower its enormous head bent palm fronds lying in a pool of rainwater munchlike open mouths shouting words at her which she did not hear a bicycle wheel spinning in endless revolutions while the dazed rider sprawled in the street but at the moment she saw nothing but tommy in countiess images each one more vivid than the last each one accusing her of betrayal this would be her punishment for that moment of selfish weakness with simon please she thought if there were bargains and promises she would make them without a second thought without a single regret as she reached the incline above the village proper a final police car tore by her sending up pebbles as well as spray from the street there was no need for the horn to clear the road daunted by the downpour the less hardy thrillseekers had already started becoming discouraged by the climb they had begun to seek refuge some in shops some in doorways others flocking into the methodist church not even the diversion of blood and a corpse seemed worth the potential ruin of fine summer clothes only the most resolutely curious had completed the climb shaking her wet hair back from her face deborah saw them gathered in front of a drive where a police line was set up to keep them at a distance there the group had fallen into a speculative silence one broken by the hot voice of harry cambrey who was arguing with an implacable constable insisting upon entrance behind them on the hill rain assailed trenarrows villa its every window was lit uniformed men swarmed about it lights flashed from the police cars parked on its circular drive shot i heard someone muttered brought anyone out yet nope deborah scanned the front of the villa working through the men looking for a sign he was all right he was fine he had to be among them she couldnt find him she pushed her way through the onlookers to the police line childhood prayers rose to her lips and died unsaid she made bargains with god she asked to be punished in any other way she asked for understanding she admitted her faults she ducked under the line no you dont miss the constable who had been arguing with cambrey barked out the command from ten feet away but its stay back he shouted this isnt a bloody sideshow unmindful deborah started forward the need to know and to be there overshadowed everything else here you the constable moved towards her readying himself to thrust her back into the crowd as he did so harry cambrey darted past him scrambling up the drive damn the constable shouted you cambrey having lost the one he was not about to lose the other and he gripped deborahs arm waving to a panda car that had pulled onto the verge take this one he called to the officers inside the other got past me no deborah struggled to free herself feeling a rising sense of outrage at her own complete impotence she couldnt even break the constables grip the more she fought him the stronger he became miss cotter she swung around no angel could have been more blessed a sight than the reverend mr sweeney garbed in black he stood beneath a tentlike umbrella blinking solemnly at her through the rain tommys at the villa she said mr sweeney please the cleric frowned he squinted up the drive oh dear his right hand flexed open and closed upon the handle of his umbrella as he appeared to consider his options oh dear yes i see this final statement seemed to indicate that an action had been decided upon mr sweeney drew himself up to his fullest height of not quite five and a half feet and spoke to the constable who still held deborah in a determined grip you know lord asherton of course he said authoritatively it was a tone that would have surprised any of his parishioners who had never seen him in blackface among the nanrunnel players ordering cassio and montano to put up their swords this is his fiancee let her by the constable eyed deborahs bedraggled appearance his expression made it perfecdy clear that he could hardly give credence to a relationship between her and any one of the lynleys let her by mr sweeney repeated ill accompany her myself perhaps you ought to be more concerned with the newspaperman than with this young lady the constable gave deborah another sceptical look she waited in torment while he made his decision all right go on stay out of the way deborahs lips formed the words thank you but nothing came out she took a few stumbling steps its all right my dear mr sweeney said lets go up take my arm the drives a bit slippery isnt it she did as he said although only a part of her brain registered his words the rest was caught up in speculation and fear please not tommy she whispered not like this please i could bear anything else now it will be all right mr sweeney murmured in a distracted fashion indeed you shall see they slipped and slid among the crushed corollas of fuchsias as they wound their way up the narrow drive towards the front of the villa the rain was beginning to fall less heavily but deborah was already soaked so the protection of mr sweeneys umbrella meant very little she shivered as she clung to his arm its a dreadful business this mr sweeney said as if in response to her shudder but it shall be all right youll see in a moment deborah heard the words but knew enough to dismiss them there was no chance for all right any longer a mocking form of justice always swept through life when one was least prepared to see justice meted out her time had come in spite of the number of men who were on the grounds it was unnaturally quiet as they approached the villa the crackle of a police radio was the only noise a female dispatcher giving direction to police not far from the scene on the circular drive beneath the hawthorn tree three police cars sat at odd hurried angles as if their drivers had flung themselves out without bothering to worry about where or how they parked in the rear seat of one of them harry cambrey was engaged in a muffled shouting match with an angry constable who appeared to have handcuffed him to the interior of the car when he saw deborah cambrey forced his face to the officers window dead he shouted before the constable pushed him back inside the car the worst was realized deborah saw the ambulance pulled near the front door not as close as the police cars for there was no need of that wordlessly she clutched at mr sweeneys arm but as if he read her fears he pointed to the portico look he urged her deborah forced herself to look towards the front door she saw him her eyes flew wildly over every part of his body looking for wounds but other than the fact that his jacket was wet he was quite intact although terribly pale talking gravely to inspector boscowan thank god she whispered the front door opened even as she spoke lynley and boscowan stepped to one side to allow two men to carry a stretcher into the rain a body upon it sheeting covered it from head to toe strapped down as if to shield it from the rain and to protect it from the stares of the curious only when she saw it only when she heard the front door close with a sound of hollow finality did deborah understand still she looked frantically at the grounds of the villa at the brightly lit windows at the cars at the door again and again as if the action could change an immutable reality she sought him mr sweeney said something but she didnt hear it she only heard her own bargain could bear anything else her childhood her life flashed before her in an instant leaving behind for the very first time neither anger nor pain but instead understanding complete and too late she bit her lip so hard that she could taste the blood but it was not enough to quell her cry of anguish simon she threw herself towards the ambulance where already the body had been loaded inside lynley spun around he saw her plunging blindly through the cars she slipped once on the slick pavement but pulled herself to her feet screaming his name she threw herself on the ambulance pulling on the handle that would open its rear door a policeman tried to restrain her a second did likewise but she fought them off she kicked she scratched and all the time she kept screaming his name high and shrieking it was a twosyllable monody that lynley knew he would hear when he least wanted to hear it for the rest of his life a third policeman joined the attempt to subdue her but she writhed away sick at heart lynley turned from the sight he felt for the villa door st james he said the other man was in the hall with trenarrows housekeeper who was sobbing into the turban shed taken from her head he looked lynleys way and began to speak but hesitated face clouded as deborahs cries grew more profound he touched doras shoulder gently and joined lynley at the door stopping short at the sight of deborah being dragged away from the ambulance and fighting every step that distanced her from it he looked at lynley lynley looked away for christs sake go to her she thinks its you he couldnt face his friend he didnt want to see him he only hoped st james would take matters into his own hands without another word being spoken between them it was not to be no shes only just go damn you go seconds ticked by before st james moved but when he finally walked into the drive lynley found the expiation he had searched for so long he forced himself to watch st james skirted the police cars and approached the group he walked quite slowly he couldnt move fast his gait wouldnt allow it crippled and ugly and halted by pain st james reached the ambulance he shouted deborahs name he grabbed her pulled her towards him she fought back violently weeping and shrieking but only for a moment until she saw who it was then she was caught up in his arms her body shaking with terrible sobs his head bent to hers his hands in her hair its all right deborah lynley heard st james say im sorry you were frightened im all right my love then he murmured needlessly my love my love the rain fell against them the police began to move round them but neither seemed cognizant of anything more than being held in the others arms lynley turned and went into the house a stirring awakened her she opened her eyes they focused on the distant barrel ceiling she gazed up at it confused turning her head she saw the lacecovered dressing table its silver hairbrushes its old cheval mirror greatgrandmamma ashertons bedroom she thought recognition of the room brought almost everything back images of the cove the newspaper office the flight up the hill the sight of the shrouded body all merged in her mind at their centre was tommy another movement came from the other side of the room the curtains were drawn but a cord of daylight struck a chair by the fireplace lynley was sitting there his legs stretched out in front of him on the table next to him sat a tray of food breakfast by the look of it she could see the dim shape of a toast rack at first she didnt speak trying instead to remember the events that followed those horrifying moments at trenarrows villa she remembered a brandy being pressed upon her the sound of voices a telephone ringing then a car somehow shed got from nanrunnel back to howenstow where shed made her way to a bed she wore a blue satin nightdress that she didnt recognize a matching dressing gown lay at the foot of the bed she pushed herself into a sitting position tommy youre awake he went to the windows and pushed the curtains back a bit so that the room had more light the casements were already open a few inches but he opened them further so that the crying of the gulls and cormorants made a background of sound what time is it just after ten ten youve slept since yesterday afternoon you dont remember just bits have you been waiting long a while she saw then that he wore the same clothes hed had on in nanrunnel his face was unshaven and beneath his eyes his skin was dark and puckered youve been with me all night he didnt reply he remained at the window far from the bed beyond his shoulder she could see the sky against it his hair was made gold by the sun i thought id fly you back to london this morning whenever youre ready he indicated the tray this has been sitting here since half past eight shall i see about getting you something else tommy she said would you is there she tried to search his face but he kept it averted and it showed no response so she let her words die he put his hands in his pockets and looked out of the window again theyve brought john penellin home she followed his head what about mark boscowan knows he took the daze as to the cocaine he sighed thats johns decision as far as im concerned i wont make it for him i dont know what hell do he may not be ready to draw the line on mark yet i just dont know you could report him i could but you wont i think it best that it come from john he continued gazing out of the window his head lifted to the sky its a beautiful day a good day for flying what about peter she asked is he cleared now is sidney st james thinks brooke must have got the ergotamine from a chemist in penzance its a prescription drug but it wouldnt be the first time a chemist slipped something to a customer on the sly it would have seemed harmless enough a complaint about a migraine aspirin not working no doctors surgery open on saturday he doesnt think justin took some of his own pills he cant think of a reason brooke would have known he had them i told him it doesnt really matter at this point but he wants to clear sidney thoroughly peter as well hes gone to penzance his voice died off his recitation was finished deborah felt her throat aching there was so much tension in his posture tommy she said i saw you on the porch i knew you were safe but when i saw the body the worst part was mother he cut in having to tell mother watching her face and knowing every word i said was destroying her but she wouldnt cry not in front of me because both of us know im at fault at the heart of this no if theyd married years ago if id allowed them to marry tommy no so she wont grieve in front of me she wont let me help tommy darling it was horrible he ran his fingers along the windows transom for a moment i thought he might actually shoot st james but he put the gun in his mouth he cleared his throat why is it that nothing ever prepares one for a sight like that tommy ive known him all my life hes like my family when i thought he was dead the blood the brain tissue splattered back against the windows i think ill see it for the rest of my life that and everything else like a blasted motion picture playing into eternity against the back of my eyelids whenever i close my eyes oh tommy please she said brokenly please come here at that his brown eyes met hers directly its not enough deb he made the statement so carefully she heard it frightened whats not enough that i love you that i want you i used to think that st james was thirty different ways a fool for not having married helen in all these years i could never understand it i suppose i really knew why all along but i didnt want to face it she ignored his words shall we use the church in the village tommy or is london better what do you think the church for the wedding darling what do you think he shook his head not on sufferance deborah i wont have you that way but i want you she whispered i love you tommy i know you want to believe that god knows i want to believe it myself had you stayed in america had you never come home had i joined you there we might have had a fighting chance but as it is still he stayed across the room she couldnt bear the distance she held out her hand tommy tommy please your whole lifes with simon you know it we both do no i she couldnt finish the sentence she wanted to rail and fight against what he had said but he had pierced through to a truth she had long avoided he watched her face for a moment before speaking again shall i give you an hour until we leave she opened her mouth to pledge to deny but at this final moment she could not do so yes an hour she said part seven afterwards lady helen sighed this moves the definition of tedium beyond my wildest dreams tell me again what its going to prove st james made a third careful fold in the thin pyjama top lining up the last point of the icepicks entry the defendant claims he was assaulted as he slept he had only one wound in his side but weve got three holes each one stained with his blood how do you suppose that happened she bent over the garment it was oddly folded to accommodate the three holes he was a contortionist in his sleep st james chuckled better yet a liar awake he stabbed himself and made the holes later he caught her yawning am i boring you helen not at all late night in the company of a charming man if only that were true im afraid it was the company of my grandparents darling grandfather blissfully snoring away during the triumphal march in aida i should have joined him no doubt hes quite spry this morning an occasional bow to culture is good for the soul i loathe opera if theyd only sing in english is it too much to ask but its always italian or french or german germans the worst and when they run about the stage in those funny helmets with the horns youre a philistine helen card carrying well if youll behave yourself for another half hour ill take you to lunch theres a new brasserie ive found in the brompton road her face came to life darling simon the very thing what shall i do next she looked round the lab as if seeking new employment an intention that st james ignored when the front door slammed and a voice called his name he shoved away from the work table sidney he said and walked to the door as his sister came dashing up the stairs where the hell have you been she came into the lab surrey first then southampton she replied as if they were the most logical destinations in the world she dropped a mink jacket onto a stool theyve got me doing another line of furs if i dont get a different assignment soon i dont know what ill do modelling the skins of dead animals lies somewhere between absolutely unsavoury and thoroughly disgusting and they continue to insist i wear nothing underneath leaning over the table she examined the pyjama top blood again how can you endure it so near to lunchtime i havent missed lunch have i its hardly noon she opened her shoulder bag and began to dig through it now where is it of course i understand why they insist on some naked skin but ive hardly the bosom for it its the suggestion of sensuality they tell me the promise the fantasy what rubbish ah here it is she produced a tattered envelope which she handed to her brother what is it what ive spent nearly ten days getting out of mummy i even had to trail along to davids for a week just so that shed know i was determined to have it youve been with mother st james asked incredulously visiting david in southampton helen did you i phoned surrey that once but there was no reply then you said not to worry her remember worry mummy sidney asked worry mummy about what about you why would mummy worry about me she didnt wait for an answer actually she thought the idea was absurd at first what idea now i know where you get your general poopiness simon but i wore her down over time i knew i should go on open it read it aloud helen shall hear it as well damn it sidney i want to know she grabbed his wrist and shook his arm read he opened the envelope with illconcealed irritation and began to read aloud my dear simon it appears i shall have no rest from sidney until i apologize so let me do so at once not that a simple line of apology would ever satisfy your sister what is this sid she laughed keep reading he went back to his mothers heavily embossed stationery i always did think it was sidneys idea to open the nursery windows simon but when you said nothing upon being accused of having done so i felt obliged to direct all the punishment towards you punishing ones children is the hardest part of being a parent its even worse if one has the nagging little fear that one is punishing the wrong child sidney has cleared all this up as only sidney could do and although she had begun to insist that i beat her soundly for having let you take her punishment all those years ago i do draw the line at paddling a twentyfiveyearold woman so let me apologize to you for placing the blame on your little shoulders were you ten years old ive forgotten and i shall henceforth direct it towards her in an appropriate fashion we have had a rather nice visit sidney and i we spent some time with david and the children as well its made me quite hopeful that i shall soon see you in surrey bring deborah with you if you come cotter telephoned cook with the word about her poor child it would be good of you to take her under your wing until shes back on her feet love to you mother hands on her hips sidney threw back her head and laughed clearly delighted with having brought off a coup isnt she grand what a time i had getting her to write it though had she not already wanted to speak to you about seeing to deborah you know how she is always concerned that well become social heathens and not do the proper thing in these situations i doubt if anything could have made her write it st james felt lady helen watching him he knew what she expected him to ask he didnt ask it for the past ten days he had known something had happened between them cotters behaviour alone would have told him as much even if deborah had not been gone from howenstow when hed returned from penzance on the evening after trenarrows death but other than saying hed flown her back to london lynley said nothing more and cotters grim restraint had not been a thing which st james wanted to disturb so even now he said nothing lady helen however did not have his scruples whats happened to deborah tommy broke their engagement sidney replied cotter hasnt told you simon from the way mummys cook tells it he was practically breathing fire on the phone quite in a rage i halfexpected to hear hed duelled with tommy for satisfaction guns or knives i can hear him shouting speakers corner at dawn tommy hasnt told you either how decidedly odd unless of course he thinks you may demand satisfaction simon she laughed and then sobered thoughtfully you dont think this is a class thing do you considering peters choice of sasha class can hardly be an issue with the lynleys as she spoke st james realized that sidney had no idea of anything that had happened since her bitter departure from howenstow on that sunday morning he opened the bottom drawer beneath his work table and removed her perfume bottle you misplaced this he said she grabbed it delighted where did you find it dont tell me it was in the howenstow wardrobe i can accept that for shoes but for nothing else justin took it from your room sid such a simple statement seven words no more their effect upon his sister was immediate her smile faded she tried to hold on to the edges of it but her lips quivered with the effort liveliness left her the quick end to her insouciance told him how precarious a hold she had on her emotions her present madcap demeanour merely acted as a shield to fend off a mourning she had not begun justin she said why there was no easy way for him to tell her he knew that the knowledge would only add to her sorrow yet telling her seemed to be the only way that she might start the process of burying her dead to frame you for murder he said thats ridiculous he wanted to murder peter lynley he got sasha nifford instead i dont understand she rolled the perfume bottle over and over in her hand she bent her head she brushed at her cheeks it was filled with a drug she mistook for heroin at that she looked up st james saw the expression on her face the use of a drug as a means of murder did indeed make the truth so unavoidable im sorry love but peter justin told me peter was at cambreys he said they had a row and then mick cambrey died he said that peter wanted to kill him i dont understand peter must have known justin told you and tommy about it he knew he did know peter didnt kill justin sid he wasnt even at howenstow when justin died then why peter heard something he wasnt supposed to hear he could have used it against justin eventually especially once mick cambrey was killed justin got nervous he knew peter was desperate about money and cocaine he knew he was unstable he couldnt predict his behaviour so he needed to be rid of him together st james and lady helen told her the story islington oncozyme trenarrow cambrey the clinic and cancer the substitution of a placebo that led to micks death brooke was in jeopardy st james said he took steps to eliminate it what about me she asked its my bottle didnt he know that people would think i was involved still she clutched the bottle her fingers turned white round it the day on the beach sidney lady helen said hed been humiliated rather badly he wanted to punish you st james said sidneys lips barely moved as she said he loved me i know it he loved me st james felt the terrible burden of her words and with it the need to reassure his sister of her intrinsic worth he wanted to say something but couldnt think of the words that might comfort her lady helen spoke what justin brooke was makes no statement about who you are sidney you dont take your definition of self from him or from what he felt or didnt feel for that matter sidney gave a choked sob st james went to her im sorry love he said putting his arm tighdy round her i think id rather you hadnt known but i cant lie to you sidney im not sorry hes dead she coughed and looked up at him she offered a shattered smile lord how hungry i am she whispered shall we have lunch in eaton terrace lady helen slammed the door of her mini she did it more to give herself courage as if the action might attest to the fittingness of her behaviour than to assure herself that the car door was securely locked she looked up at the darkened front of lynleys townhouse then held up her wrist to the light of the streetlamp it was nearly eleven hardly the time for a social call but the very unsuitability of the hour gave her an advantage which she wasnt willing to relinquish she climbed the marbletiled steps to his door for the past two weeks she had been trying to contact him every effort had received a rebuff out on a job working a double shift caught at a meeting testifying in court from a series of unquestionably polite secretaries assistants and junior officers she had heard every permutation of a jobrelated excuse the implicit message was always the same he was unavailable alone and preferring it so it would not be so tonight she rang the bell it sounded somewhere in the back of the house resonating oddly towards the front door as if the building were empty for a fleeting mad moment she actually harboured the thought that he had moved from london ninning away from everything once and for all but then the fanlight above the door showed a sudden illumination in the lower hallway a bolt was drawn the door opened and lynleys valet stood blinking owlishly out at her he was wearing his bedroom slippers lady helen noted and a tartan flannel bathrobe over paisley pyjamas surprise and judgement played spontaneously across his face he wiped them off quickly enough but lady helen read their meaning well brought up daughters of peers were not supposed to go calling on gentlemen late at night no matter which part of the twentieth century this was thank you denton lady helen said decisively she stepped into the hall every bit as if hed asked her in with earnest protestations of welcome please tell lord asherton that i must see him at once she removed her light evening coat and placed it along with her bag on a chair in the foyer still standing by the open door denton looked from her to the street as if trying to recall whether he had actually asked her in he kept his hand on the doorknob and shifted from foot to foot appearing caught between a need to protest the solecism of this visit and the fear of someones wrath should he do so his lordships asked i know lady helen said she felt a brief flicker of guilt to be bullying denton knowing that his determination to protect lynley was motivated by a loyalty that spanned nearly a decade i understand hes asked not to be disturbed not to be interrupted hes not returned one of my calls these last two weeks denton so i quite understand he wishes not to be bothered now that the issue is clear between us please tell him i wish to see him but i shall go directly up to his bedroom if i have to denton signalled his surrender by closing the door hes in the library ill fetch him for you no need i know the way she left denton gaping in the entry and went quickly up the stairs to the first floor of the house down a thickly carpeted corridor past an impressive collection of antique pewter winked at by half a dozen asherton ancestors long since dead she heard lynleys valet not far behind her murmuring my lady lady helen the library door was closed she knocked once heard lynleys voice and entered he was sitting at his desk his head resting in one hand and several folders spread out in front of him lady helens first thought with some considerable surprise as he looked up was that she had no idea hed begun wearing spectacles to read he took them off as he got to his feet he said nothing merely glanced behind her to where denton stood looking monumentally apologetic sorry denton said i tried dont blame him lady helen said i bullied my way in she saw that denton had moved one step into the room with another he would be close enough to put his hand on her arm and escort her back down the stairs and out into the street she couldnt imagine him doing so without lynleys direction but just in case he was considering the idea she headed him off thank you denton leave us please if you will denton gawked at her he looked at lynley who nodded sharply once he left the room why havent you returned my calls tommy lady helen asked the moment they were alone ive telephoned here and the yard repeatedly ive stopped by four times ive been sick with worry about you sorry old duck he said easily theres been a mass of work lately im up to my ears in it will you have a drink he walked to a rosewood table on which were arranged several decanters and a set of glasses thank you no he poured himself a whisky but did not drink it at once please sit down i think not whatever youd like he offered her a lopsided smile and tossed back a large portion of his drink and then perhaps unwilling to keep up the pretence any longer he looked away from her saying tm sorry helen i wanted to return your calls but i couldnt do it sheer cowardice i suppose her anger melted immediately i cant bear to see you like this walled up in your library incommunicado at work i cant bear it tommy for a moment the only response was his breathing she could hear it shallow and unevenly spaced then he said the only time i seem to be able to drive her from my mind is when im working so thats what ive been doing thats all ive been doing and when i havent been on a case ive spent the time telling myself that ill get over this eventually a few more weeks a few months shakily he laughed its a bit difficult to believe i know i understand god yes who on earth could know better than you then why havent you phoned me he moved restlessly across the room to the fireplace no fire demanded his attention there so he gave it instead to a collection of meissen porcelain plates on the overmantel he took one from its stand turning it in his hands lady helen wanted to tell him to have a care the plate might well shatter under the strength with which he gripped it but she said nothing he put the plate back she repeated her question you know ive wanted to talk to you why havent you phoned me i havent been able to it hurts too much helen i cant hide that from you why on earth should you want to i feel like a fool i should be stronger than this none of it should matter i should be able just to slough it off and go on go on she felt all her anger return in a rush her blood heated in the presence of this stiffupperlip attitude which shed always found so contemptible in the men she knew as if schooling and breeding and generations of reserve condemned each of them to a life of feeling nothing do you actually mean to tell me that youve no right to your sorrow because youre a man i dont believe that i wont believe that its nothing at all to do with sorrow ive just been trying to find my way back to the man i was three years ago before deborah if i can reclaim him ill be fine that man was no different from the man you are now three years ago id not have taken this so hard what were women to me then bed partners nothing more and thats what you want to be a man drifting through life in a sexual fugue only thinking about his next performance in bed is that what you want its easier that way of course its easy that kind of life is always easy people fade out of one anothers bed with hardly a word of farewell let alone one of commitment and if by chance they wake up one morning with someone whose name escapes them its all right isnt it its part of the game there was no pain involved in relationships then there was nothing involved never for me that may be what youd like to remember tommy but thats not the way it was because if what you say is true if life was nothing more than collecting and seducing a stableful of women why did you never have me he reflected on the question he went back to the decanters and poured himself a second drink i dont know yes you do tell me why i dont know what a conquest i would have been thrown over by simon my life in a shambles the last thing i wanted was an involvement with anyone how on earth did you resist a challenge like that what a chance it was to prove yourself to yourself what incredible fodder for your selfesteem he placed his glass on the table turned it beneath his fingers she watched his profile and saw how fragile a thing was his veneer of control i expect you were different he said not at all i had the right equipment i was just like the others heat and pleasure breasts and thighs dont be ridiculous a woman after all easily seduced especially by an expert but you never tried with me not even once that sort of sexual reticence doesnt make sense in a man whose sole interest in women revolves round what they have to offer him in bed and i had it to offer didnt i tommy oh i would have resisted at first but i would have slept with you eventually and you knew it but you didnt try he turned to her how could i have done that to you after what youd been through with simon compassion she demanded from the man bent on pleasure what difference did it make whose body provided it werent we all the same he was quiet for so long that she wondered if he would answer she could see the struggle for composure on his face she willed him to speak knowing only that he had to acknowledge his sorrow so that it could live and rage and then die not you he said finally she could tell the phrase cost him dearly not deborah what was different i let things go further further to the heart she crossed the room to him her hand touched his arm dont you see tommy you werent that man bent on pleasure you want to think you were but that wasnt the case not for anyone who bothered to take the time to know you not for me certainly who was never your lover and not for deborah who was i wanted something different with her his eyes were redrimmed roots ties a family i was willing to be something more to have that it was worth it she was worth it yes she was and she was worth grieving over as well shes still worth that oh god he whispered her hand slid down his arm closed over his wrist tommy dear its all right really he shook his head blindly as if by that movement he could shake off his terrible desolation i think i shall die of loneliness helen his voice broke horribly the sound of a man who hadnt allowed himself to experience a single emotion in years i cant bear it he started to turn from her to go back to his desk but she stopped him and closed the remaining space between them she took him into her arms youre not alone tommy she said quite gently he began to cry deborah pushed open the gate just as the streetlamp in lordship place lit for the evening sending delicate sprays of light through the mist that fell on the garden she stood for a moment and gazed at the warm burned sienna bricks of the house at its fresh white plasterwork at its old wrought iron hand rail that forever rusted in spots that forever needed paint in so many ways it would always be home to her no matter how long she managed to stay away three years three decades or like this time a month shed managed avoidance through a string of fabrications which she knew her father didnt believe for a moment setting myself up professionally dad working very hard appointments here and there showing my portfolio around shall we meet somewhere for dinner no i cant come to chelsea hed accepted the excuses rather than quarrel with her again no more than did she her father didnt savour a repetition of their row in paddington a week after her return from cornwall he had wanted her to come home she refused to consider it he didnt understand to him it was simple pack your things close the flat come back to cheyne row in effect as far as he was concerned return to the past she couldnt do so she tried to explain her need for a time that was solely her own his response was a nasty castigation of tommy for changing her destroying her distorting her values and from there the row grew ending with her wresting from him a bitter promise not to speak of her relationship with tommy ever again to her or to anyone else they had parted acrimoniously and had not seen each other since nor had she seen simon nor had she wanted to those few horrifying moments in nanrunnel had exposed her to herself in an unforgiving light that she could no longer ignore and for the month that followed shed had to examine and admit to the lie shed been living for the last two and a half years the lover of one man bound in a thousand different ways to another and yet bound forever to tommy as well in ways she could never allow him to know she didnt know where to begin to undo the damage she had done to herself and to others so she had stayed in paddington working as an apprentice photographer for a mayfair studio spending a long weekend in wales and another in brighton and she had waited for her life to take on a semblance of peace it had not done so so she had come on this visit to chelsea not exactly knowing what she could accomplish only knowing that the longer she stayed away the more difficult a reconciliation with her father would be what she wanted from simon she could not have said through the mist she saw the kitchen lights come on her father passed the window he went to the stove then to the table where he disappeared from her view she followed the flagstone path across the garden and descended the stairs alaska met her at the door as if with that preternatural sensitivity inherent to felines hed known shed be arriving he twitched one ear and began a stately crisscrossing through her legs his tail waving majestically wheres peach she asked the cat as she rubbed his head his back arched appreciatively he began to purr footsteps came out of the kitchen into the foyer deb she straightened hello dad she saw him looking for signs that shed come home a suitcase a carton an easily movable item like a lamp but he said nothing other than had your dinner girl and returned to the kitchen where the rich smell of roasting meat was scenting the air she followed him yes at the flat she saw that he was working at the table that hed lined up four pairs of shoes to be polished she noted the heaviness of their construction necessary so that the crosspiece of his brace could fit through the left heel for some reason the sight effected a blackness in her she looked away hows work cotter asked her fine ive been using my old cameras the nikon and the hasselblad theyre working for me well they make me rely on myself more on knowledge and technique i find i like that cotter nodded applied two fingertips of polish to the top of a shoe he was nobodys fool its forgotten deb he answered all of it girl you do whats best for you she felt a rush of gratitude she looked round the room at the white brick walls the old stove with three covered pots sitting on it the worn worktops the glassfronted cabinets the uneven tile floor a small basket near the stove legs sat empty wheres peach she asked mr st jamess taken er out for walk cotter gave a glance to the wall clock absentminded e is dinners been ready these last fifteen minutes wheres he gone the embankment i expect shall i fetch him his reply was perfectly noncommittal if you fancy a walk if you dont its fine dinnerll keep a bit she said ill see if i can find him she went back to the hallway but turned at the kitchen door her father was giving his complete attention to the shoes ive not come home dad you know that dont you i know what i know was cotters answer as she left the house the mist was encircling each streetlamp with an amber corona and a breeze was beginning to blow off the thames deborah turned up the collar of her coat as she walked inside houses people were sitting down to their evening meals while at the kings head and eight bells at the corner of cheyne row others gathered at the bar for conversation and refreshment deborah smiled fondly when she saw this latter group she knew most of them by name theyd been nightly patrons of the pub for years the sight of them filled her with unaccountable nostalgia which she dismissed as nonsensical and pushed on to cheyne walk traffic was light she crossed quickly to the river and saw him some distance away elbows resting on the embankment wall studying the charming whimsicality of albert bridge in the summers of her childhood they had frequently wandered across it to battersea park she wondered if he remembered that what a gawky little companion shed been to him then how patient and kind his friendship had been in return she stopped for a moment to observe him unnoticed he scanned the bridge a smile played on his lips and all the while at his feet peach sat placidly chewing on her lead as deborah watched the two of them peach caught sight of her and began pulling away from st james she turned a quick circle got tangled in the lead fell in a heap and gave a happy yelp distracted from his admiration of one of londons most capricious structures st james looked down at the little dachshund and then back up as if to locate the cause of her desire for escape when he saw deborah he released his grip on the lead and let the dog run to her which peach did ears flopping wildly rear legs nearly overtaking the rest of her body she was a frenzy of joy she threw herself upon deborah barking ecstatically wagging her tail deborah laughed hugged the dog allowed herself to be licked on the nose she thought about how it was so simple with animals they gave their hearts without question or fear they had no expectations they were so easy to love if people could only be like that noone would ever be hurt she thought noone would ever need to learn how to forgive st james watched her walk towards him in the light of the embankment lamps with peach dancing along at her side she carried no umbrella against the mist that was creating a net of bright beads on her hair her only protection was a lambs wool coat its collar turned up so that it framed her face like an elizabethan ruff she looked lovely like someone out of a sixteenthcentury portrait but there was a change to her face something that hadnt been there six weeks ago something aching and adult your dinners ready she said when she reached him youre out late for a walk arent you she joined him at the wall it felt like a commonplace sort of meeting as if nothing had happened between them as if in the last month she hadnt faded in and out of his life without greeting or farewell i wasnt thinking of the time sidney told me she went with you to wales we had a lovely weekend on the coast he nodded he had been watching a family of swans on the water and would have pointed them out to her their presence at this section of the river was certainly unusual but he did not do so her manner was too distant apparently however she saw the birds herself caught in silhouette in the lights that sparkled from the opposite bank ive never seen swans in this part of the river before she said and at night dyou suppose theyre all right there were five of them two adults and three nearly grown cygnets floating peacefully near the piers of albert bridge theyre all right he said and saw how the birds gave him a small opening to speak i was sorry you broke the swan that day in paddington i cant come home she said in reply i need to make peace with you somehow perhaps take a step towards being friends again some day but i cant come home this was the difference then she was maintaining that kind of careful emotionsparing distance that people develop to protect themselves when things come to an end between them it reminded him of himself three years ago when she had come to say goodbye and he had listened too afraid to speak lest saying one word might cause the floodgates to open and everything he felt to spill forth in a humiliating wave of entreaty that both time and circumstance would have forced her to deny they had come full circle it seemed to goodbye again how simple just to say it and get on with living he looked from her face to her hand resting on the embankment wall it was bare of lynleys ring he lightly touched the finger that had worn it she didnt pull away and it was that absence of movement which prompted him to speak dont leave me again deborah he saw that she hadnt expected a response of that kind shed come without a line of defence he pressed the advantage you were seventeen i was twentyeight can you try to understand what it was like for me then id cut myself off from caring about anyone for years and all of a sudden i was caring for you wanting you yet all the time believing that if we made love she spoke quickly lightly all thats passed isnt it it doesnt matter really its much better forgotten i told myself that i couldnt make love to you deborah i manufactured all sorts of mad reasons why duty to your father a betrayal of his trust the destruction of our friendship yours and mine our souls couldnt bond together if we became lovers and i wanted a soulmate so we couldnt make love i kept repeating your age over and over how could i live with myself if i took a seventeenyearold girl to bed what does it matter now were beyond that after all thats happened what does it matter that we didnt make love three years ago her questions werent so much cold as they were cautious as if whatever careful reasoning shed gone through in her decision to leave him were under attack because if youre going to make this leaving of yours a permanent arrangement then at least youll leave this time knowing the truth i let you go because i wanted peace i wanted you out of the house i reasoned that if you were gone id stop feeling torn id stop wanting you id stop feeling guilty for wanting you id get the whole issue of sex driven out of my mind youd been gone less than a week when i saw the truth of the matter it doesnt he persisted id thought i could exist quite nicely without you and my own hypocrisy slapped me right in the face i wanted you back i wanted you home so i wrote to you as he was speaking shed kept her attention on the river but now she turned to him he didnt wait for her to ask the question i didnt post the letters why and now he had come to it so easy to sit alone in the study and rehearse for a month all the things he had needed to say to her for years but now that he had the opportunity to say them he found himself faltering all over again and he wondered why it had always been so frightening that she should know the truth he drew in air like resolution for the same reason i wouldnt make love to you i was afraid i knew that you could have any man in the world any man all right you could have tommy given that choice how could i expect that you might want me you a cripple so there it is isnt it we end up at cripple no matter where we begin we do because its a fact of who i am and we cant ignore it ive spent the last three years considering all the things i could never do at your side things that any other man tommy could do with ease whats the point of that why keep torturing yourself because i had to work through it it had to stop mattering so much that i couldnt even hold you if i were unattached to this cursed brace it had to stop mattering so much that im crippled and thats what you need to know before you leave me that it doesnt matter any longer crippled or not half a man threequarters it doesnt matter i want you and then he added unfairly but without a regret since there are no rules that govern affairs of the heart once and for life it was done in whatever fashion she would judge them the words had been said three years too late but said all the same and even if she chose to leave him now at least she chose knowing the worst he was and the best he could live with that what do you want of me she asked you know the answer to that peach moved restlessly at their feet someone shouted from the patch of green across cheyne walk deborah watched the river he followed the direction of her gaze to see that the swans had cleared the final piers of the bridge they were floating unchanged as they had done before as they always would do seeking the safety of battersea deborah he said the birds gave her the answer like the swans simon it was more than enough my love like the swans elizabeth george
