brian freemantle kings of many castles the state visit was crucial for the political future of both leaders which made maximum public and media exposure as important as the long ago concluded but unannounced nuclear missile defense treaty that was to be its triumphant reelection assuring climax the apparent negotiations had been conducted with the surgical precision befitting the lifesaving operation both considered it to be to establish the impression of nationprotecting intractability the american secretary of state had very publicly headed the three main delegations to moscow and received the russian foreign minister in washington on a matching number of mediahyped occasions after each of which theyd made dourfaced statements of insurmountable difficulties left behind in the others capital additional negotiators and on their returning flights personally given unattributable diplomatic briefings that success would be a miracle the public event preparations were as perfectly orchestrated the leaked detailseven suggested photographsof what americas fashionicon first lady had chosen were balanced by those of the russian presidents equally fashionconscious and vivacious wife setting up couture competitions at the bolshoi the tchaikovsky conservatory and the moscow arts theatre as well as at the intended official state banquets all of which were featured some way down the list of security considerations that had consumed the american secret service and the russian presidential protection division of the federal security service for as long as but far more actively than the time supposedly spent by treaty negotiators both security groupsinitially separately but soon in single protesting voicewere appalled at the completeness of the intended open exposure their argument that the major part of the arrival ceremony be inthe totallycontrolled inner courtyard of the kremlin and not in the open at the moscow white house was impatiently swept aside because of the kremlins most recent association with communism whose reemerging official political party the kommumisticheskaya partiya rossiiskoi federatsii was seriously threatening the presidents second term reelection the symbolism of the white house against which boris yeltsin sent tanks in to defeat the communistled opposition of the congress of peoples deputies better suited both presidents it took a week of persistent argument finally adjudicated by the chiefs of staff of both leaders to get the arrival of air force one switched from moscows international sheremetyevo airport to a much more easily vetted and securityassured military airfield on the eastern outskirts of the city there was an even more protracted dispute over the joint insistence that the two men and their wives should drive into the city in an opentopped car along a previously publicized route which muscovites would be encouraged to line to cheer and wave preissued national flags it took a claimed terrorist bomb explosion in a car park just off the route staged by the russian security service and blamed on chechen separatists to gain the concession of a bulletproofed glass bubble over the rear of the vehicle which had to be changed from the intended zil to an americanimported cadillac because no such protective fitment existed for a russian limousine to compensate for the reluctant abandonment of open transportation both services acceded to an increase in the number of elevated tv camera positions but were again overruled by the chiefs of staff on their demand that the official cavalcade should drive at the traditional high speed along the governmentreserved center lane of the approach roads a second officially planted bomb literally backfired when the two presidents decided to show their refusal to be cowed by terrorismand gain the predictable headlinesby having their procession restricted to forty mph in the lane closest to the flagwaving crowds once they entered the builtup area a request by three american secret service officers to be released from the moscow detail was rejected with the warning that the protest gesture would be marked on their records twentyfour hours before the american presidents arrival the designated route was however closed to vehicular trafficand all the drains and culverts checked by explosivedetecting sniffer dogs before all manhole covers were welded into place by then all political dissidents and separatist group members with checkable police files had been detained in militia custody a cloudless early summer day guaranteed the crowds maintaining the pretence of remaining treaty difficulties the american leader walter anandale declared at the airport arrival ceremony that a breakthrough in the negotiations to completely abandon his countrys already suspended national missile defense project was only possible at presidenttopresident level his wife was dazzling in pink with a matching cloche hat the russian presidents wife was in powder blue her hair a blond unruffled curtain to her shoulders on the windless day the immediately following car for the journey into moscow carried three american and three russian protection officers in constant telephone and radio contact with others lining the route ahead one of the russians was permanently patched through to the shadowing helicopters overhead they left their car while it was still moving to be in position around the cadillac when it stopped on krasnopresnenskaya naberezhnaya despite the mixed twelveman detail already cordoning the podium from which the russian leader was to respond to the americans arrival speech the ceremony was choreographed as perfectly as everything else the two women left the limousine ahead of their husbands to put them slightly at the rear when the two men turned to face the hedge of microphones and television cameras some on their level and others stilted high above on elevated staging the sound of the first shot was only discernible from the soundamplified replays and several commentators later remarked they were momentarily bewildered by the abrupt red splashes on the pink and blue suits of the first ladies before seeing the russian leader clutch his chest and realizing the redness was the mans blood charlie muffin who was watching the live coverage on americas cnn said shit natalia had only so far been peripherally involved but his immediate awareness was that it would all change now charlie could never have imagined by how much the astonishing footage of the gunmans seizure was to win the cnn cameraman an international award which confirmed the importance of being in the right place at the right time more than professional expertise his elevated position was next in line and only seven meters away from the russian tv gantry from which the shots were fired all he had to do was swivel his camera fortyfive degrees point it and adjust the zoom there were only two wrestling men on the miniscule swaying platform one still clutching the telescopemounted rifle the other the russian cameraman restricted by his equipment harness and the headset link to the control scanner unseen far below the gunman was slim eyes wild and virtually unfocused already dishevelled long blond hair further matted by the fight he wore soiled jeans and a creased denim workshirt against which bounced as they fought a neckchained identity disc that appeared the same as that around the cameramans neck the cameraman was an overweight but muscular man at least ten years older and much shorter despite the tussle his wispy remaining hairs stayed cemented in place over a reddish bald head his face was mottled too by the frenzy and both arms were blackly tattooed they struggled for the weapon torn at like a bone between two dogs each was yelling snarling kicking at the other but the words were lost because the witnessing cnn camera was mute the commentarya pointless even inadequate description of what was obvious on screencoming from the monitors in the groundbased american scanner but the shouting would probably have been inaudible anyway beneath the roar of an escort helicopter which abruptly descended to within two meters of the pod its downdraft threatening to blow both men off their narrow perch it spun the tripodmounted russian camera wildly smashing it once into itsoperator hard enough to teeter him against the edge of the guardrail and almost enabled the gunman to reclaim his rifle the cameraman used his faltering hold to pull himself back to safety but the pummelling rotors tossed them around the platform more than the battle for the gun at last the cameramans hair was dislodged that of the other man was an enclosing mask around his face a safetybelted marksman swung out of the helicopter into a practised crouch on to the port strut his snipers rifle moving smoothly to his shoulder and for the briefest moment the brawling men paused both looking upwards and for the first time the american commentary made a contribution reporting that from the russian helicopter was being amplified an instruction for the two men to separate the cameraman made as if to do so but immediately snatched for the disputed rifle when the berserk man began turning the barrel towards him above the sniper sighted and abandoned the clear shot sighted and lifted his rifle again in armjerking frustration three men were climbing the gantry by now the second two with makarov handguns already out making it difficult for them to pull themselves up the ladder rails both paused trying for the unimpeded shot the sniper couldnt get from above but like the airborne marksman neither was able to distinguish between the lockedtogether fighters it was the first climbing russian who ended it in what was practically an anticlimax when his head became level with the pod floor the russian simply reached up and jerked the younger mans feet from beneath him for a moment he appeared to be supported entirely by his hold on his rifle then he crashed on both knees to the metal floorhis head thrown back mouth wide in an unheard cry of agonyfinally releasing his hold upon the weapon at once the leading security officer caught the back of the crumpled mans shirt and hauled him bodily through the gantry fence for the briefest moment he was suspended grabbing out for the cameraman then snatching to hold on to the platform edge before falling arms and legs flailing the fifteen meters to the ground where he was immediately lost beneath a scrum of other waiting security people aware of the uniqueness of his pictures the cnn director had not switched cameras now he did recapping with instant replayfrom the moment of the first blood splash charlies initial impression was of the american first lady bending to help the collapsed russian leader but she fell away from the man and charlie realized she too had been hit it was impossible to gauge how badly because everyone on the dais was instantly engulfed by security and the cameras were live here so it was possible to hear the screams of fear and disorganized unthinking panic all the rehearsals for just such an eventuality forgotten russians and americans jostling in total confusion the one preparation that did operate smoothly was the instant arrival of the waitinginreadiness ambulances although their paramedics were delayed stretchering the victims into them by the crush of so obviously failed protection the sirenhowling militiaescorted journey to the pirogov hospital on leninskaya prospekt was this time along the centrally reserved carriageways and was recorded virtually throughout by the speciallyinstalled cameras an american reporter outside the hospital brought the coverage up to date although the station kept cutting back to the tv gantry fight few details had so far been made available the reporter said it was known that the russian president lev maksimovich yudkin was the most seriously hurt with two separate wounds to the upper chest he was currently undergoing surgery so was americas first lady ruth anandale her injuries were not believed to be lifethreatening her operation was being conducted by the surgeon and medical staff who routinely travelled with the president on overseas trips although some russian doctors and staff were assisting the reporter understood that two other people had been hurt in the shooting one an american secret service officer charlie stayed until the last minute flicking between local moscow channels and the superior coverage of the american network and its flukeofpositioning scoop knowing precisely how long it would take him to get to the kindergarten to collect sasha to which hed already agreed with natalia before the attempted assassination their daughter greeted him with a model of a cardboard house puffed with cotton wool to represent snow for which shed got a red star that reminded charlie of those that still adorned the kremlin towers sasha said it was a present for her mother but charlie couldshare if he wanted charlie said hed like to he took the backroads to lesnaya sure the more direct main roads would still be blockedmaybe even pointlessly sealed offby militia and federal security service officers frantically pretending to fulfill the role theyd already so badly failed to perform dont be a smart ass he told himself there but for the grace of god and all that professionally able to guess just how much buckpassing and shitshovelling thered be charlie was caught by the mundane comparison of his meandering home on a school run with a chattering five year old beside him there was no answering machine message from natalia when he got to the apartment cnn was still showing their extraordinary footage the only update from the pirogov hospital reporter was that the american president had arrived and was waiting for his wife to emerge from surgery it was difficult to see anything of the ground level of the hospital because of the hedge of secret servicemen it was almost nine oclock sasha long ago bathed and asleep before natalia got to the apartment she was sagged by tiredness and strain the tone in which she said his name halted his automatically moving towards the waiting bottles to make her the reviving drink what he said turning back to her the gunmans name is george bendall she said flatly his father was peter bendall who defected from britain nearly thirty years ago oh fuck said charlie the adrenalinesurged panic was over there were only two other men with the american president in the hurriedlyassigned office which still had the jacket of its normal occupant hanging from the inside door hook the mans discarded salami sandwiches were in the waste bin in the outside corridor the secret servicemen formed a solid shouldertoshoulder wall shes over the first hurdle said wendall north thats good shes come through immediate surgery qualified anandale whod returned from the recovery room minutes before and was still in shirtsleeves after taking off his sterilized gown if it doesnt work shell lose the arm and theres going to be a lot of shock itll work said the chief of staff locked into empty reassurance it sure as hell better said anandale just as emptily he was a big man tall and heavily built the texas accent was very pronounced we need to get her out of here back to america the conditions here are stone age whats max donnington say asked the chief of staff north had expected the white house surgeon a commissioned admiral to come up from the resuscitation room with the president the navy physician had to be concerned about ruth anandales recovery not to have done so he doesnt want her moved not even to the embassy hes bringing in some sterilisation equipment and more staff to clean up the room that shes in liaise with him wendall i want the bestequipped air ambulance brought in ready the moment its possible to move her james scamell decided it was time to move the discussion on to practicalities ive spoken with the foreign ministry people whove arrived boris petrin himself its touch and go whether yudkins going to make it anandale was a consummate politician and it only took him seconds to refocus his mind he nodded at the most obvious inference from the secretary of states remark goodbye to a second term reelection for lev maksimovich theres temporary provision but not a proper successor in waiting said scamell what about the communist party candidate petr tikunov identified scamell a popular deputy in the duma the communists are well organizedbetter than yudkin evenand theres a huge number of people whove come to think that communism wasnt such a bad way of life after all at street level everyone had some sort of job and some sort of income wheres that leave us demanded anandale his reasoning in perfect synch with the circumstances with a need to readjust replied north eager to get back into the discussion he was an intense quicklyblinking man anxious to share the presidents reelection and the rarified atmosphere of being at the epicenter of world events easily possible picked up scamell no treatys been signed cant be now weve still got our star wars preparations which were sure as hell going to need if yudkin dies and is succeeded by the opposition the peacemaker becomes the iron man headlined north he decided to wait until there was a more positive prognosis about ruth anandales recovery before hinting at the huge sympathy vote that could be manipulated there was another silence anandale said we know who the son of a bitch is who did it the two bombs were chechen reminded north uncomfortably thats your job wendall ive got a personal interest in knowing everything about whoever organized it and why i dont give a damn about russian jurisdiction or hurt feelings and i want to know how people who were supposed to be protecting meand my wifelet a guy with a godamned gun within kewpie doll shooting range of us yes sir said north my wife might die said the president in near conversation with himself someones going to pay for that pay for it personally you hear me wendall yes mr president i hear you in washington cia director jack grech personally took the call from fbi director paul smith grech said we got a lot of problems here you going over to head things up personally asked smith i need to speak to people first evaded grech all the secret service precautions were based upon agencyand russianadvice leaving the agency in the clear paul smith decided an fbi director could do himself a lot of political good riding in with the cavalry particularly when the gunman was already in custody smith said i think ill start making plans i guess i should too said grech charlie muffins office in the new british embassy on protocnyj pereulok was in complete contrast to the cobwebbed broom cupboard hed been dismissively allocated in the old legation on morisa toreza actually with an unobstructed view over the smolenskaya embankment to the moskva river and with a separate annex for direct securitycleared telephone email and fascimile links to his london riverside headquarters at millbank he even had his own coffee percolator peter bendalls complete metogether with separately wired photographshad already been faxed through by the time charlie arrived at the nightshrouded complex carrying the video of the gantry struggle hed recorded himself before leaving the lesnaya ulitza apartment he was only threequarters through the archive material when the querulous call came from richard brooking the head of chancellery this had better be justified it is were on the coffee pass the mints and decanter around a second time the man sighed how long fifteen minutes have you told the ambassador there was another sigh i need to be sure theres a crisis first your decision said charlie who hadnt given the diplomat the reason for breaking into his dinner party over an open telephone line from lesnaya dont you forget that my office thirty minutes charlie finished reading in fifteen and spent the remainder of the time studying the fading photographs of one of britains most infamous postwar traitors peter bendall had been a skeletallythin man whose narrow face was dominated by a prow of a nose upon which balanced thicklensed roundframed spectacles every oldbailey trial family and official government picture portrayed a fastidiously although cheaply dressed alooflyfeatured man bearing no similarity whatsoever to the fanatically staring mophaired figure whod now been seen by every television owner in the world struggling in midair for possession of a snipers rifle brooking a fleshy overweight man assured an ambassadorial promotion on his next posting was still wearing his dinner jacket and black tie when charlie got to the mans office suite he triedbut failedto heighten the unspoken rebuke at having his evening interrupted by the contempt with which he regarded charlies shoespread crumpled appearance charlie wondered if the man had told his guests to wait until his return around the man still hung a miasma of cigars so what is it demanded brooking impatiently todays gunman is british the son of a defector announced charlie the theatricality was unnecessaryhe should have warned brooking during their internal telephone conversation earlierbut pompous assholes like brooking had always irritated charlie and he never had been able to resist the deflating pinprick brooking did visibly deflate he shook his head refusing the information and several times said no as if to convince himself hed mishead george bendall insisted charlie son of peter bendall an aldermaston physicist who escaped from wormwood scrubs in after serving only two of a forty year sentence for betraying to the russians over the previous fifteen years every british nuclear development a lot of which was shared with america oh my god moaned brooking charlie hefted what had come from london virtually nothing on george bendall who was only two when his father got caught brought to moscow by his mother three years after his father arrived she skipped sideways through austria from what was purported to be a holiday in france using the same escape route as her husband gave the stiff finger to british counterintelligence who were supposed to be watching her because hubby was rumored to have changed his mind and wanted to come back brookings recovery was as visible as his earlier collapse why didnt you tell me this from the beginning it wasnt a secure line the man frowned has this been officially announced by the russians no then how do you know its my job to know the job i was posted here to fulfill whats your source you know i cant tell you that it was an inviolable rule that official diplomats were always separated from provable intelligence activities and even though charlies function had changed it provided a very important personal protection for him and natalia within moscow and the directorgeneral in london hadnt pressed to learn his contacts observing his own even more inviolable personal rule charlie already had a prepared escape if sir rupert dean or anyone else ever became too curious or demanding it could be wrong its not charlie belatedly realized that this was the very first time hed directly acted uponusedinformation from natalia and her intelligence liaison directorship with the interior ministry she hadnt tried to dissuade him because there was going to be an official announcement the following day but over the last few months hed become increasingly aware how much of a strain their precarious situation was far more upon her than him hed stopped talking about their getting married or of how easily they could live in englandanywhere in europeif their relationship did become known and he was inevitably expelled and she was just as inevitably dismissed her ministry position youve told london sir rupert personally he wants the ambassador informed ahead of the russian announcement yes agreed brooking briskly pass the problem parcel time charlie recognized and lawyers yes complied brooking again still brisk aware of another layer of responsibility avoidance their involvement is obviously essential brookings first telephone call was shorter than the second and charlie wondered if the lawyer had already been in bed in the apartment block that formed part of the new british diplomatic compound charlie was one of a very few still livingbecause he clearly had tooutside the enclave once more using as the reason the necessity to distance himself from official diplomacy although since the postcold war realignment his was much more an fbi than a counterintelligence function which was why during his sleepyvoiced conversation with an awakened sir rupert dean in london the directorgeneral had given the empirepreserving instruction that the embassyattached mi be kept out for as long as possible since that conversation charlie had decided the delay twelve hours at the most would achieve little more than further alienating him from people who were supposed to be colleagues but who viewed him with the distaste that brooking had evidenced minutes before but it was a familiar experience for charlie to find there was shit on every baton he picked up he couldnt ever remember actually being part of a relay team but resisting interembassy association was a matter of professional necessity as much as selfprotecting ostracism charlie never had been nor ever would be a team player it made him reliant upon others and a further charlie muffin rule was never to rely upon anyone except himself an unsettling challenge came at once to mind what about natalia not a contradiction he assured himself he trusted natalia implicitly and absolutely trusted her more than she trusted him with every justifiable reason for her doubt he relied upon her too in equal proportion but that trust and that reliance was personal not professional he would never of course have admitted it to anyonemost certainly not to natalia who would misunderstand it to be a lack of love which it wasntbut because charlie muffin knew himself so completely he acknowledged hed never accept natalias professional judgment in preference to or above his own sir michael parnell entered the room with vaguely hesitant authority he was a thin man although not as thin as peter bendall appeared in the file photographs and any further similarity was smothered beneath the fullness of deeply black hair like brooking the ambassador wore a dinner jacket and black tie and to charliewho did not smoke the cigar aroma smelled the same charlies protocolrouted request through brooking had been to meet parnell immediately and he wondered if the mans initial refusal had been disinterest or the instinctive armslength distancing of a regretted member of embassy staffing probably a combination of both moscow was a prestigious appointment and parnell had only held it for four months and now he was about to confront his worst sleeping or waking nightmare parnell looked undecided between the two men already in the room before settling on charlie do i really need to hear what this is all about the mans voice was unexpectedly high instead of replying directly charlie looked at brooking and said you thought so didnt you you got any second thoughts parnells face stiffened brooking colored the head of chancellery said yes sir you do my directorgeneral thought so too he wasnt going to improve any working relationship with these two men by showing the respect their condescension hadnt earned so fuck them he didnt want to spend any more time with them than they wanted to spend with him what demanded the ambassador the lawyers arrival delayed charlies reply so well had he isolated himself against embassy staff contact that there was the briefest moment of surprise although he was sure he didnt show it she was tall for a woman although not overly so slim and small busted if she were publicly to become known in what was to follow charlie supposed willowy would be the english tabloid description she wore a severe black suit that charlie accepted to be her embassyrecognized uniform and he guessed the deeply auburn hair which now hung loose would during the day be more tightly pinned and controlled she wasnt wearing makeup either apart perhaps from the lightest of lipsticks and charlie decided that she had been in bed and probably asleep when brooking telephoned she politely greeted the two diplomats by title and name and remained looking enquiringly at brooking who hurriedly introduced her to charlie as anne abbott now i wont have to repeat myself a third time greeted charlieher handshake was firm confident and he liked her attitude towards the other two men respectful of their embassy rank but not deferential he put her at about thirtyeight certainly not older what is it demanded parnell again impatiently neither the ambassador nor the woman openly gave the sort of disbelieving reaction brooking had shown when charlie told them although parnell at once asked if charlie were sure and charlie said he was the nationality is the key insisted anne theres no doubt hes still british charlie handed her the london material youll need to go through everything its peter bendalls entire archive if hed taken russian nationality it would have been logged there was a lot of speculation that his refusal to adopt russian citizenship showed an intention to return to england despite the sentence hed still have had to serve he looked to the other two men ive made copies of everything except the seizure video which needs the embassy facilities to duplicate its surely a moot point whether he had or he hadnt taken citizenship challenged parnell objectively george bendall is still who he is the son of a british nuclear defector whos shot a russian president hopefully about to agree to a star warsbanning treaty with america picked up brooking assessing the diplomatic fall out charlie hadnt considered the political symbolism completing it he said an agreement that wont now be reached might never be and whats left is the mess our mess to clear up as best we can said parnell what will the procedure be diplomatically i mean asked the woman practicably in normal circumstances if a british national is arrested for an alleged crime the embassy applies for consular access recited the ambassador formally i dont consider this normal ill want guidance from london what about legal representation anne persisted parnell shrugged thats usually made available are you criminal or civil charlie asked the lawyer criminal recognized under russian law pressed charlie she shook her head id need guidance like the ambassador but i dont think id be accepted in open court as anything more than a qualified observer i could probably get attachment to a russian lawyers briefing team if london wanted it what are your instructions to investigate as much as i can as best i can generalized charlie he went to the ambassador id like to be included in any access thats arranged my directorgeneral will be contacting you tomorrow ill definitely need foreign office guidance for that warned parnell sir rupert expected you would said charlie the thin mans head came up sharply at the suspicion of condescension charlie stared back blandly remaining fixedly upon charlie parnell said it is a mess i dont want it made worse by any mistakes from this embassy i dont want anythinganything at allinitiated or done without prior reference to me is that understood perfectly said charlie bollocks he thought of course said anne accepting her inclusion in the caution as she walked from the head of chancellerys office with charlie leaving the two diplomats composing their alert cable to the foreign office in london she said its illegal under the copyright act to duplicate videos lets not tell anyone were going to do it charlie had never told anyone in advance what he was going to do or hardly ever afterwards it was better that way for their propriety ulcers general state of health and overall peace of mind charlies mind as he emerged into the darkness of a slumbering moscow night was anything but peaceful he hadnt properly started yet and there were already things that worried him one more obviously than the others he didnt even need the warning ache from his talisman feet to tell him all was not right weve got everything to consider to protect ourselves against protested sir michael parnell guiding the discussion i understand what youre saying agreed the abouttobepromoted head of chancellery weve got to be careful absolutely if it gets to consular access itll be you richard i know accepted brooking uncomfortably that intelligence fellows a problem i know hes not officially recognized here as such but thats what he is or was and a confounded nuisance as well from all the stories i heard before i arrived hes caused a lot of problems in the past confirmed brooking i wont allow him to cause any in the future if london wants their own investigation let them send someone from there to do it separate us from that part of it were going to have enough difficulties as it is maybe we shouldnt ask for someone from london for precisely that reason suggested brooking parnell allowed a half smile whats your thinking muffins already got the reputation in london as an uncontrollable troublemaker politically and diplomatically we couldnt be in a more unmapped minefield with whats happened there will be mistakes no matter how hard we try to anticipate mistakes we dont officially want to be associated with parnells smile broadened well have to watch the bloody man very carefully of course we might actually in the final analysis get rid of him altogether its still an experimental posting despite his having tricked his way successfully so far that would be good said parnell enthusiastically there was a pause so what do we tell london that weve inherited another intelligence embarrassment insisted brooking at once lets start from the very beginning preparing the way to distance ourselves the eruption was inevitable the only uncertainty its timing and burt jordan the cia station head and the fbi rezident john kayleyboth of whom felt themselves safely beyond the endangered fallout areafound much to occupy them in the initial file photographs of the shooting while wendall north outlined the situation hed just left at the pirogov hospital they were in the chef du protocols office at the american embassy on the novinskij bulvar section of the inner ring road even his desk surrendered by the local diplomat david barnett barnett considered himself the safest of them all in the aftermath and sat trying to guess when the explosion would occur so thats it concluded north a total disaster completed jeff aston director of the white house secret service detail we all know that tried north the immediate need is to prioritize evaluate and anticipate just how much do we all know to evaluate and anticipate wendall persisted aston who was black six and a half feet tall weighed two hundred and twentyfive pounds and had protected two previous presidents before walter anandale give us an idea of your prioritizing how would you assess the fallout would you put a treaty that isnt going to be signed more or less important than the maiming of the presidents wife and where would you put the likely death of a russian president against the possible resurgence of a communist government and whereabouts in all of it would you put the fact that the shooting was allowed to happen in the first place because thats something that personally and professionally interests me a hell of a lot aston had hassled barnett into including both the cia and fbi determined there should be witnesses theyd already been waiting when the unsuspecting wendall north arrived from the hospital making it impossible for him to exclude them i dont think thats very constructive which is what weve got to be protested north conscious that he had no defense against the secret service chiefs attack right again wendall goaded aston but im still a little curious about things being destructive which its my job to prevent providing that is im not prevented or obstructed from doing it therell be an enquiry said north he was redfaced and visibly sweating despite the airconditioning im sure as hell glad to hear that wendall your office kept all the preparation and planning details for this trip all the way back to when the negotiations first started i dont want you or any of your staff to worry if you havent we have in the secret service every memo notes of every discussion telephone logs of every call and what the outcome was and not just in english russian too ive already cabled washington for it all to be handed over to counsel important to keep everything intact you know how these rumors start after something like this suggestions of things getting lost or tampered with so if youve got any problem finding anything you just let me know because its important that all the facts are established by whoever investigates the worst cockamamy screwup since god knows when ill remember that said north tightly but at the right time which isnt now hed hoped having george bendalls identity which hed learned at the hospital would have deflected this obvious attack dont you worry about remembering wendall ill remind you often enough there are other things to talk about prompted the bespectacled fairhaired diplomat whose office had been taken over and who had decided aston had sufficiently established blame absolutely agreed aston lets try to make sure we get it right this time theres going to be a lot of balls in the air warned the cias burt jordan from what washington has rounded up so far this guys father did a lot of damage to the american nuclear program as well as to the british which was bad enough at the time this is a hell of a lot worse my guess is theyll hunker down throw george bendall to the wolves which the bastard deserves anywayand say hes russias problem by adoption not theirs theres some sound political reasoning in that said north relieved the inquest had moved on not for moscow challenged the locallybased diplomat making them responsible for the man whos probably killed their president and badly wounding our first lady throws detente right out the window thats a fight between london and moscow challenged north in return a fight weve got to stay on the outside of but do everything to make swing in our direction to our presidents benefit therell be a tide of sympathy now and our missile shield planning is still in place whatever happens here there was no reaction to the cynicism kayley said so politically we dont need russia or the treaty anymore not as much as we did qualified north what we do need is to ride shotgun on the british particularly with whatever they do here he looked directly at jeff aston and to make damned sure theres no rebound on us you mean get into bed with the british jordan began and fuck them every which way completed kayley wendall north winced at the coarseness but said yes thats what i mean charlie padded softly into the darkened bedroom letting his clothes lie where they fell he was careful easing himself under the covers to avoid any disturbing contact with natalia who lay with her back to him natalia was fully awake but didnt turn and remained so long after charlie had settled into occasionally snuffled sleep the naming of traitors son george bendall was to bring a very changed worldsome changes predictable some notto charlies door and for the first time in a permanently precarious life charlie could rarely if ever remember the uncertainty he felt sitting in his river view office awaiting the first approach natalias giving him to within thirty minutes the timing of the official announcement ended as far as charlie was concerned the futile pretense of keeping their professional lives entirely separate charlies argument that morning had been that this attempted assassination needed their personal cooperation but natalia had equally insisted there should always be the mitigating defense of their never having colluded which no tribunal would or could ever accept charlies confusion was not being sure where if anywhere it left he and natalia they both recognized the answer to the problem it would quite simply be for one of them to quit their conflicting jobs which wasnt in any way simple to both such a sacrifice was unthinkable there was nothing else charlie could do wanted to do was able to do and he knewas natalia knewthat what was already stretched to near breaking point between them would snap beyond repair within weeks of charlie becoming a househusband in title if not in legal fact which put the onus on natalia upon whom the onus had far too often and far too heavily already been imposed in their uneven relationship a burden charlie readily recognized just as he recognized her reservations after so much forgiveness and so many allowances shed accepted as professional his first deceit convincing her when shed been assigned his kgb debriefer that his phoney operationwrecking defection to moscow was genuine in those first gettingtoknow each other weeks and months shed have turned himover to face trial as a spy if he hadnt managed to do so their problemso much unfairly natalias problemwas in the direct aftermath although hed maneuvered to avoid her being arrested for professional negligence his return to londonessential professionally wrong personallyhad been an abandonment because by then they had been in love natalia had proved that love by being prepared just once to defect herself during an escort assignment to london trusted him more than hed trusted her despite loving her hed watched natalia at their arranged meeting point but been unable to believe she wasnt baitknowing or unknowingin a repayment trap for the damage hed caused moscow so hed held back from the rendezvous and let her go neither of them knowing then that she was pregnant it was a virtual miracle that shed deigned even to acknowledge himlet alone be persuaded there was a second chance of finally being togetherwhen with the old defunct kgb records necessarily selfcleansed to protect herself and their daughter and natalias elevating transfer to the ministry hed been officially accepted back by a totally unaware and unsuspecting russian government too overwhelmed by organized crime to match an american fbi presence in the russian capital there could be no blameno surprise eitherfor natalia insufficiently trusting him hed done nothing to deserve it little indeed to deserve natalia which was a longrealized awareness that did nothing to resolvehelp eventheir escalating problem perhaps nothing could charlies irresolute reflections were broken by the first of the predictable announcementprompted arrivals mi station chief donald morrison flustered jacketless through the door scarlet braces over monogrammed shirt an unevenly tornoff slip of new agency copy in his hand offering it to charlie the man said have you seen this i heard about it last night said charlie the ambassador knows london too morrison stopped abruptly halfway across the room as if hed collided with something solid how contacts in the militia avoided charlie easily a call would have been appreciated complained morrison cautiously he was an enthusiastic eagertoplease man at least fifteen years charlies junior whom charlie guessed to have got the soughtafter posting through family influence his predecessor had been part of an interagency determination to get charlie removed from moscow badly misjudged charlies thumbgouging eyeforaneye survival ability and now occupied a travel movements desk at mis vauxhall cross administration department from the wariness with which morrison had treated him since his arrivaland the immediate reaction nowcharlie suspected morrison knew of the episode charlie said its a criminal investigation more mine that yours under the redefining it would still have been useful to know about in advance if id got a query from london did you morrison shrugged his argument defeated so you havent lost any credibility charlie pointed out you intend running it as a one man show charlie hadnt yet decided how he was going to run anything only that by the end of a long day there were probably going to be more people running about and getting in each others way than in a whorehouse on payday when the fleets in which charlie philosophically accepted initially welcomed in fact despite his directorgenerals eagerness to control whatever involvement was achievable it was even possible londons edict would be for a jointly shared investigation which would provide a sacrificial diversion if one became necessary which wasnt ultimate cynicism it was an essential practical rule of what the inexperienced or ignorant referred to as a game but which was not nor ever had been charlie actually liked the younger man and didnt want to cause him any disadvantage or harm he hoped the need wouldnt arise if morrison was accorded any part in what was to follow ill obviously get a call pressed morrison i dont know anything more than what was on television this morning said charlie which was almost true lev maksimovich yudkin had been described as critical after an operation to removebullets from his abdomen and right lung and ruth anandale was stable after having a bullet removed from her right arm near the shoulder the american president was still at the pirogov hospital where hed slept overnight ben jennings the american secret serviceman who had been hit was on a life support machine with a bullet possibly too close to his heart to risk removing the fifth shot had shattered the leg of a plainclothes moscow militia officer feliks vasilevich ivanov which might possibly need to be amputated the only additional information which natalia had reluctantly provided was that george bendall had not regained consciousness after operations to rebuild and pin his left shoulder and leg both of which had been broken in his fall from the tv gantry its not going to be an easy one suggested morrison very few are agreed charlie it was like a dance to which he knew every stumbling step which with his hammertoed feet wasnt a good analogy were going to have to work together if london orders it said morrison of course said charlie in apparent acceptance he handed the other man a copy of peter bendalls file thats everything my people had might be an idea to see whats in your archives to make a comparison morrison smiled a relieved smile thats a good idea ill do that they both turned at richard brookings arrival the head of chancellery looked between them and said yes of course you obviously need to be together why wondered charlie had the diplomat come to him rather than the other way around with a summons like the previous night surely their separation wasnt going to be as fatuous as worrying about which rooms they met in morrison said thats what i was just saying you heard from london demanded charlie ive been told to seek information said brooking from whom or what asked charlie impatiently the foreign ministry thats our channel of communication whod simply repeat the official announcement guessed charlie what about access brooking shook his head as if he were denying an accusation nothing like that until we get an official reply from the ministry needing to ride pillion with this man officially to get to george bendall was going to be a wearisome pain in the ass charlie decided what about the americans brooking hesitated sir michael is approaching their ambassador personally am i started charlie but stopped are we going to be told whats said it was important to establish groundrule precedents there was another hesitation from the head of chancellery it would constitute a diplomatic exchange charlies directline telephone jarred into the room breaking the conversation what do you know charlie said john kayley not enough replied charlie what about you think we need to get together sounds like a good idea ive got a room with a view i got so much heat im getting blisters maybe i should come to you it would look better for me charlie was glad hed taken the trouble socially to meet kayley at various us diplomatic functions although he was unsure of the mans by now familiar native american boast to be part cherokee it was fortunate too that hed taken so many copies of bendalls file on my way your contact enquired brooking hopefully as charlie replaced the receiver fbi said charlie shortly youll let me know what they say not sure if itll constitute a diplomatic exchange said charlie straight faced there were several other titular generals in the kremlin suite with her although all were male but natalia acknowledged hers wasprobably considered the rank wielding the least influence she wished she hadnt been included at all but not as much she guessed as the general next to her lev andrevich lvov had gained his rank in the spetznaz special forces before his transfer to the white house to head the russian presidents bodyguard detail and still appeared vaguely uncomfortable in civilian clothes it was an attitude reflected too by the man with whom he was drawn slightly apart from the rest of the group around the table general dimitri ivanovich spassky headed the counterintelligence directorate of the fsb the intelligence successor to the kgb i want a complete assessment i need to be fully prepared for the debate in the duma declared the prime minister who under a decree issued by the now stricken russian president assumed the emergency leadership he had before the communist party resurgence been predicted to get by democratic election upon yudkins second term retirement aleksandr mikhailevich okulov was a short sparsebodied man who largely under yudkins patronage had risen to the rank of premier in the ten years since leaving the st petersburg directorate of the kgb his supporters praised him as the eminence grise of the current government his detractors preferred the description of lackluster and uninteresting grey man of russian politics the combined concentration in the room was on chiefofstaff yuri fedorovich trishin a rotund no longer quicklysmiling man its still too soon for any proper prognosis the presidents condition is critical and likely to remain so for days there is considerable trauma heart massage as well as mouthtomouth resuscitation had to be administered in the ambulance on the way to the hospital there was substantial blood loss maybe as much as half his bodys capacity there could be complications with the american presidents wife bad enough to make amputating her arm necessary what about prior to that okulov interrupted how was it allowed to happen the question was addressed to lvov who hadnt broken the fixed stare hed directed at the chief of staff accusingly lvov said there was too much interference in the security arrangements by whom insisted okulov who was still trying to adjust and equate in his mind the full personal possibilities so abruptly thrust upon him by the attempted assassination hed already recognized his previous kgb career could be an embarrassment in view of bendalls family history the americans said trishin quickly the americans made demands and after consultation we complied consultations with whom lev maksimovich said the plump man quickly who was too illmight not even recoverto confirm or deny it natalia accepted realizing she was witnessing a hurriedly conceived survival defense our own president agreed persisted okulov it was vital he didnt make a single mistake with everything insisted trishin was there no professional argument asked the premiercumpresident he was going to have to work with these men decide who he could trust and of whom he had to be careful a considerable amount said lvov some of the tension had gone out of the man there is documentary proof demanded okulov yes said lvov also that the pressure came from washington yes said trishin okulov settled back in his chair visibly relaxing looking between natalia and the fsb counterintelligence director so what do we know about the gunman okulovs kgb background was public knowledgea target sometimes for attackbut in passing natalia wondered if the man knew she had also once been a serving officer in so short a time it was unlikely but it was the sort of preparation automatic for a trained intelligence operative ahead of spassky she said were all aware of the reorganization and department divisions of the komitet gosudarstvenno bezopastosti after the events of that included archives but it would appear that division was incomplete i have she hesitated bringing duplicated files from her briefcase and distributing them around the conference table of okulovs office all that was available from the interior ministry files on the defector peter bendall there is only a twoparagraph reference to the son at the time he was brought here by his mother bendall senior was paid a pension and was responsible to the former kgb until his death you will see that the records are marked some retained unfortunately i have not had the opportunity to discuss with general spassky whatever files still presumably held by the federal security service might contain i hope he can help us with that now she had no alternative natalia assured herself spassky was one of the old schoolproud of his continued membership of the communist partyand would have tried to bulldoze her into the ground if she hadnt put the tank trap in his way first which she might not have donenot been alerted to doif spassky hadnt studiously avoided her four attempts to reach him before this meeting the normally vodkablotched face was redder than normal from what she inferred to be his fury at being anticipated and she decided the tank trap metaphor was appropriate the irongrayhaired bear of a man could very easily have physically crushed her and probably would have liked to have done at that precise moment in front of spassky an ashtray was already halffilled with the butts from which succeeding cigarettes had been lit there was a snatch of what was intended to be a throatclearing cough that took several moments to subside and when he finally spoke spasskys voice was initially threadbare we had insufficient time before this meeting not enough indication from the interior ministry flustered the man the search is being made now okulov intent upon identifying scapegoats at once came back to natalia who was surprised at the obviousness of the intelligence generals confusion the first written advisory memorandum was personally sent by me to the lubyanka at last night within an hour of the gunman being identified and after the fsb duty officer informed me there was no senior officer available to talk to me personally she responded quickly again that was followed by three more attempted telephone calls and two more memoranda timestamped copies of which are attached to what i have already made available i mean we cant locate them corrected spassky not in the time weve had so far are they lost pressured okulov the womans competence made spasskys inadequacy even more marked we will have everything available later today said spassky i personally issued the order to round up all known dissidents extremists and possible terrorists reminded okulov was the name george bendall on any such list not that i am aware of said spassky not that youre aware of echoed the politician dont you know it was not on any list made available to the interior ministry said natalia nor to my service insisted general leonid sergeevich zenin moscows militia commander entering the discussion for the first time i have specifically rechecked before this meeting are you telling me we dont know anything at all about a man whos triedand might even have succeededto kill the president of russia and seriously wounded the wife of the american president demanded okulov incredulously not a question for her natalia decided i have appointed an investigatory team the senior colonel is by bendalls bedside waiting for him to recover from surgery said zenin hurriedly responding his belongings included a workbook in the name of gugin vasili gugin he was employed in the name of gugin by the ntv television channel he was a gofer a messenger who fetched and carried he got the rifle up to the platform in an equipment bag the address in the workbook is hutorskaya ulitza where did we get his real name interrupted trishin from his mother at hutorskaya ulitza she uses the name gugin too but has kept her english given name vera she in custody of course said zenin so far shes denied knowing anything about what her son was doing or where he got the rifle it is an svd snipers weapon its being forensically examined naturally the mother must have said something more about him demanded okulov hes been ill mentally ill but she claims he got better do you believe her its far too early to ask my people that okulov went to the chief of staff what about the british theres been a formal approach through the foreign ministry for information said trishin the americans they want access to bendall full investigative cooperation from everyone involved here which well give them the british too decided okulov he was contemplatively silent for several minutes we have to emerge with unchallengable credibility there will be maximum liaison between each and every investigatory department he smiled across the table and you natalia fedova will coordinate everything natalias first realization was that shed been made the most vulnerable of them all another awareness was that no one had askedwas bothered evenabout the other two victims of the shooting the trial must be totally open a media event declared okulov whod insisted upon the chief of staff remaining after dismissing the rest i mean what i said about openness with the americans and the british of course theres no danger of the americans refuting the security lapses being their fault they wont officially be in court trishin pointed out therell only have observer status well have the stage they wont and there really is a lot of confirming paperwork this was the man with whom initially at least he was going to have to work with more than anyone else the second realization was that okulovs chances of being elected to the presidency was even more uncertain that yudkins had been good accepted the other man warming to the increasing personal possibilities weve got to discover a great deal more aboutthis man bendall or gugin or whatever he calls himself whatever he calls himself isnt important insisted trishin rebuilding his own bunker he isnt russian hes british the son of a spy who was allowed to come here under the protection of an earlier communist government okulov nodded smiling content for the other man to spell out the further personal advantage hed already isolated which he doubtless represents we need to know if hes a supporter of the old ways anxious for their return that could be useful trishin was encouraged by the direction of the conversation i didnt get the impression from any of the hospital doctors that theres a possibility of lev maksimovich making a full and active recovery if he survives at all which will be a tragedy a great tragedy agreed okulov refusing to respond too quickly to the obvious approach bastard thought trishin yours will be the mantle to continue the policies youve been so closely involved in formulating theres a power struggle whether yudkin died or not accepted okulov and hed need allies who knew the keys to every locked hiding place which ill require help to do the strength of the communists makes this a very uncertain time said trishin comfortable with platitudes its important to understand you have my complete trust and loyalty aleksandr mikhailevich thats good to hear said okulov it will be important to have someone like you yuri fedorovich upon whom i can rely completely which you can youre quite sure the security lapses can be shown to be those of the americans as ive just made clear alexandr mikhailevich you can trust me until theres a political reversal okulov added mentally john kayley could very easily have had the native american cherokee indian ancestry he frequentlyand proudlyclaimed he was saturnine with smooth black hair he was also indulgently fat andunconcerned about it his footwear was neither moccasin nor molded into the shapelessness of charlies hush puppies but the bagged unpressed canopy of the buttonstrained suit could have come from a shared reject shop the windowless office at novinskij bulvar was cloyed with the smell of the scented cigars the man smoked and on the table between them was a bottle of single malt already reduced by a third it wasnt islay charlies favored choice but he appreciated the gesture kayley patted the peter bendall dossier with a pudgy hand and said im truly grateful for this like i told you theres a lot of heat but very little to put on the fire thanks for this too said charlie the american had offered unasked the complete list of the failed security precautions as well as the hospital update that the presidents wife could lose her arm which would be permanently impaired even if she didnt charlie liked the fact that the other man wasnt trying to disguise the exchange as anything more than the same givetoreceive shell game he was playing it indicatedhe hopedthat they were treating each other as professionals he was still waiting for kayley to point up the one incongruity that was so far troubling him he wondered if the other professional omission was an oversight kayley said dont envy you the sonofabitch still being british its a bastard agreed charlie he nodded to his glass being topped up hed give the other man a little more time you going to get access not applied for yet i expect it will be were asking for it although im not sure of our legality its russian jurisdiction and prosecution even though its the presidents wife that got hit kayley was professional accepted charlie youll be allowed participation though limiteds my guess hes your national you stand the better chance im prepared to share if you are surely kayley would pick upon on that deal accepted the american at once perhaps kayley was testing him charlie said peter bendall passed over a lot of your stuff to the russians in the late sixties therell be an american dossier on him kayley nodded unembarrassed at being reminded of the obvious i guess it would have been cia not the bureau available to you now though ill check it out a professional like kayley would have done so hours ago if the american was trying to control the exchange hed failed charlie decided it was better to continue in the expectation of getting something but not all which was the level at which he intended to work you getting any political playback this soon there might be a loose ball to play off against brooking and sir michael parnell and at the moment it was scraps he was scrabbling for nothing positive said kayley shaking his head washingtons not comfortable about the bureaus position here if the communists get their man in charlies feet tweaked hows that we were accepted here by yeltsin and the reformers all part of the fight against crime reminded kayley states thinking is that wed be the first to be told to get out if the old regime was reestablished guess that would apply to you too yes agreed charlie i guess it would what the hell sort of spin would that put upon the situation between he and natalia this could even be our last case hows that for a thought unsettling said charlie honestly about far too many things he mentally added senior militia investigator colonel olga ivanova melnik was an attractive even beautiful woman and knew it what she knew even better was how to use it in every way she invariably wore civilian clothes instead of uniform because dresses and skirts and blouses showed off her fullbusted narrowwaisted figure to her best advantage and always allowed distracting cleavage interrogating male suspects she also adjusted her demeanor to every encounter bullying when necessary awkwardly stumbling sometimes to give her interviewees the dangerously misleading impression of their superiorintelligence it was an attitude strictly reserved for interview rooms outside she was a determined supremely confident woman with an iq of that had academically taken her up the promotional ladder in balanced proportion to the occasions shed climbed bedroom stairs with partners carefully selected more for her career advancement than their sexual prowess since attaining her detective seniority by the age of thirtyfive prowess had taken precedence over influence among those invited to follow her up any stairs olga ivanova was politically as well as professionally adept and was more aware than anyone caught up in the immediate twentyfourhour aftermath of the shooting how totally successful she could emerge from the inquiry how could she fail to get a conviction when the crime had been committed in front of a worldwide television jury it remained essential of course for olga to be the handson focus of every facet of the investigation and that initially had obviously been for her to sitfitfully sleeping in her chair when it was no longer possible to remain awakejust one whisperhearing meter from george bendall since his return from the operating theater but there hadnt been a whisper anything except the jagged peaks of the heart monitor and the inout hiss of the ventilator and the silent blood and saline drip and increasingly dark brown filling of the catheter bag while all the boring unproductive time in walking distance away in lefortovo prison vera bendall alias vera gugin had sat for virtually the same period unsuspectingly waiting to be broken olga a strongly featured prominentlylipped woman eased out of the no longer comfortable chair and stretched stiffly around the room as she had several times before shed completed her first circuit and was about to begin her easier crampeased second when the chief physicianadministrator nicholai badim thrust into the room for the first time in many visits uncaring of the noise with him was an equally attentive paleskinned whiteblondhaired psychiatrist guerguen semenovich agayan weve got the brain scans agayan announced look olga did so although she was unsure what she was supposed to be seeing there demanded the surgeon at the base there its a hairline linear fracture and here the finger went to a patch darker than the rest of the illustrated brain we did a spinal tap as part of the initial exploratory surgery theres no blood in the fluid so that darkening is suberachnoid bruising what are you telling me demanded olga that he badly hit his head in the fall in addition to all the other injuries said agayan is he brain damaged i wont know that until he recovers consciousness said the psychiatrist but im going to sedate him more deeply to counteract any possibility of epilepsy said badim at the moment his medical condition is more important whens he likely to recover sufficiently for any sort of interrogation im not going to allow him to open his eyes for at least another twentyfour hours and only then when i see some lessening in the bruising area im sorry dont be said olga thats fine lefortovo is the embodiment of terrorthe terrorthat dominated russia and its once soviet union for most of the twentieth century initiated there before but quickly afterwards becoming the experimental laboratory in which was perfected every art and device of bonecrushing mentally molding state oppression of state opposition the okhrana the intelligence service that so fatally failed to protect the ineffectual czar nicholas ii from impending revolution created it as the prison in which dissent and its advocates were literally snuffed out like flickering candles within its uncleanedbloodsplattered walls the goateebearded feliks dzerzhinsky who founded modern russian intelligence by creating the succeeding vecheka installed his torturers and firing squads to maintain lenins rule he didnt bother with wall cleaning neither did the terrorfuelled intelligence agencies of stalinthe gpu and the ogpu and the nkvd and nkgbnkvd and the mvdmgb and the kgbthat followed although occasionally spaces were scoured for official plaques proclaiming their chairmen as heroes of the soviet union psychopaths like yagoda and yezhov and lavrenti beria the most psychopathic of them all there is an irony that in this glowering barredwindowed mausoleum for a milliontens of millionsghosts such uncertified maniacs could unintentionally have left a psychological legacy making unnecessary their truncheons and electrodes and scalpels and syringes fear is sufficient fear of those truncheons and electrodes and scalpels and syringes and of the ageblackened gouts on the walls of bare cells without a bed or a lavatory hole or a bucket olga ivanova melnik had learned to use that psychology of fear as successfully as she adoptedand adaptedher different questioning techniques there were no bars at the sunfilled windows of the room into which vera bendall was escorted there wasnt a desk either easy chairs were arranged around a low table dominated by a display of bright yellow daffodils that had been moved slightly to one side for the tea thermos and cups a cherry topped the sugar icing of each of the six cupcakes the tape recorder was very small unobtrusive olga dismissed the escorts with a jerk of her head and gestured the other woman to a chair directly opposite vera bendall remained just inside the door terrified eyes flickering around the room she was a gaunt woman her uncombed gray hair straggled around a pinched lined face there had been no makeup to start with and her eyes were red from recent crying her shoulders briefly heaved with the closeness of more tears but she managed to hold back although thin she was heavybreasted and her unsupported bosoms sagged come in sit down beckoned olga softvoiced this wassomeone of the old soviet crushed susceptible malleable a show trial puppet from the preliminary interrogation olga knew the woman was sixtyone years old vera obediently did as she was told although hesitantly scuffing in pressed cardboard shoes from which the laces had been removed there was a button missing from the badly knitted cardigan and the crumpled black skirt was stained and shiny from wear the blouse was stained too they didnt hurt you vera shook her head thats good most of them here only know one way of behaving on olgas instructions the initial arrest interrogator in a windowless basement cell had been a towering brutishfeatured militia sergeant in uniform olga unscrewed the thermos cap and poured do you have milk no thank you no black vera needed two hands to pick up the cup but it still rattled in the saucer spilling im sorry so sorry she made a noisy slurping sound in her urgent need to drink have some cake thered only been one square of bread that morning and a small pitcher of water for the fifteen hours shed been in custody the woman used two hands again nibbling mouselike her fingertips were puffed and swollen from constant nail biting youre here in moscowrussiabecause of what your husband did you know that dont you yes youre allowed the apartment for the same reason i know i want you to tell me all about it youll do that wont you yes please i mean of course the voice was frail like the woman herself the russian was heavily accented would english be better asked olga who was fluent in that as well as french and spanish no i understand is he how hurt falling from the platform the woman stopped eating what why did he do it asked olga her tone abruptly sharp i dont know didnt know what about the gun no believe me i never saw it didnt know he lives with you most of the time you must know about the gun then he never had it at home brought it home so where did he get it keep it i dont know does he have anywhere else to live he stayed away sometimes quite a lot i suppose i never knew where she tried individually picking up the cake crumbs that had fallen on to her greasy skirt dont do that concentrate on what i am asking ordered olga sharply again and the other woman stopped at once sorry i am you must know where he stayed when he wasnt at home i didnt didnt you ask him he told me it was none of my business he was always telling me that does he have a wife a girlfriend vera bendall shook her head hes not comfortable with women why i dont know frightened doesnt know how does he like boys not like that not how youre saying what about friends i dont know olga poured more tea and pushed the cakes towards the woman vera you promised to help me tell me everything would you rather talk to the man who questioned you first no please no broke in the woman then you have to help me vera do you understand what hes done yes the voice was a whisper he shot the president i saw on television what will happen hell have to be punished yes olga pushed the cakes further towards the other woman lets think about you me whats going to happen to you vera youre not russian you live here by permission the woman nodded dumbly you get a state pension because of what your husband did the shoulders started to heave again i can only help you if you help me prove to me you werent involved im not wasnt so who are his friends hes never told me no one ever came but he did have friends he went out where i dont know you asked him accused olga he wouldnt tell me said none of it was my business just his there was a pause is he badly hurt is he political demanded olga vera bendall shook her head refusing to answer i could take your apartment away and your pension have you expelled sent back to england he wasnt right olga needed to pause howwhatwasnt he right the woman hesitated uncertain he hates russia everything was he political olga repeated he read a lot of books when he was younger books about england did he go to meetings he went out i told you and he stayed away yes often yes that wasnt what you told me earlier her lips quivered im sorry im confused they were deviating olga realized i dont understand what you mean by saying he wasnt right he was in the army had to be of course went to afghanistan in the beginning but they wouldnt let him stay he had to leave sometimes he gets very angry you mean hes mad demanded olga intentionally brutal it wasnt such a personally advantageous case if bendall was mentally ill he loses his temper very easily particularly when he drinks does he see a doctor take medication he told me he was seeing a doctor recently not a medical doctor who i dont remember a name i dont think he told me does he drink a lot yes every day every night i suppose so peter your husband worked for the kgb when he came to moscow yes doing what he lectured for some years in a scientific institute in the last few years he used to read reports english scientific magazines give an opinion about them from an office in those latter years or from your apartment both mostly from an office near gum but sometimes from the apartment so kgb people came to the apartment sometimes sometimes did george ever meet them he would have been there when they came how did george get on with his father not very well they argued what about everything george said it was peters fault that we were here what about you and george how do you get on quite well except for when he gets angry what does he do when he gets angry i told you he fights you mean hes violent yes has he ever hit you no ive thought he was going to sometimes but he hasnt why didnt your husband take russian citizenship he chose communism after all no denied the faded woman strength in her voice for the first time he didnt do what he did for political ideology he was ashamed of what hed donehelped dodeveloping the wests nuclear capability he gave it away to make things even olga supposed there was some rationale in the convoluted justification but he used a russian name no that was george he said he didnt want to have the name bendall he chose gugin did george ever fight with his father vera bendall looked down into her lap sometimes in the end george was bigger stronger than peter olga melnik had expected morea lot moreand the irritation was a combination of frustration and disappointment she couldnt believedidnt want to believethe bendalls story could be as banal as this im not satisfied vera not at all satisfied please implored the woman ive answered everything i can i just dont know his friends vera youve got to remember who his friends were he must have said something sometime given you some idea where he went thats what youve got to remember and tell me and the name of the doctor vera bendall looked down at her drooped breasts can i havemy underwear back my laces and belt its uncomfortable youre not going home vera youre going to stay here until you help me properly stay downstairs in the cell that doesnt have a window where a lot of other people have stayed before you no please begged the woman think vera youve got to think very hard remember what i want to know and then tell me charlie assembled video footage from americas nbc and cbs britains bbc canadas cbs and moscows ntv to compare with cnns unique and unparalled film and worked with total concentration to parallel it second for second frame by frame he did so muffled in earphones stopwatch in hand well aware even then he was not technically qualified to reach any conclusion which being charlie he did he was right one hundred and one percent fuck the doubters diamondhard right the copiesthe copies upon copies which anne abbott had protested to be illegalwere already in the diplomatic bag on their way to london for the scientifically provable tests charlie specified but he was already personally sure he didnt need their confirmation what he wasnt so personally sure about was where in the name of christ and his dog his conviction complicated an investigation already more than complicated enough as totally absorbed and externally soundproofed as he was charlie was initially briefly unaware of anne abbott easing herself beside him physically starting at her touch on his arm shit you frightened me admitted charlie who didnt like admitting fear or being startled he depressed the remote control to stop the transmission as he took off the earphones ive been looking for you what is it anne frowned at the obvious irritation i was hoping for an update whats yours there hadnt been any contact messages from donald morrison or the head of chancellery when hed got back from the american embassy im to arrange legal representationbe part of whatever is set upwhen were allowed consular access has it been asked for you didnt know no brookings already made the application maybe he had the same trouble finding you as i did maybe dismissed charlie you got anything i should know about friend or foe wondered charlie wearied that he had to pose the question shed have to be the first to know if he were technically proved correct he explained what he wanted her to listen for in advance of handing over the soundenhancing earphones and gave her his clipboard and stopwatch for her to make her own time comparisons anne abbott stopped after only twenty five minutesonly a third of the time charlie had takenand looked to him in astonishment you could be right so so i dont know what to say olga melnik snapped off the tape recording of her insufficient encounter with vera bendall and for several minutes the room was silent apart from the rewind whirr general leonid zenin said no one can be that unknowing shes lying shes of a type balanced olga a permanent victim you believe her not yet on the recording her interview had sounded worseunproductive unprofessionalthan shed personally admitted it to be at the time what have you done asked the military for his army records particularly medical and the official reasonthe papersfor his discharge theres a team at ntv he must have friendsacquaintancesthere olga paused regarding the tightlybearded hardbodied man with whom she decided it might be pleasurable to ascend bedroom stairs therewas certainly kgb control after the father defected of course there was said zenin who had told olga of the emergency committee meeting thats why it doesnt make sense for spassky to say they cant find files in his time peter bendall would have been important there was another silence longer than the first olga said youre surely not its a question im going to ask if records arent found anticipated zenin spassky is kgb aleksandr mikhailevich okulov already predicted to follow yudkin as president is former kgb and the federal security servicewhich is responsible for presidential protectionis nothing more than a convenient cosmetic name change like all the others since dzerzhinsky olga felt a stir of unease we could be personally destroyed trying to prove that by even making the accusation i wouldnt be making an accusation insisted zenin id be asking for an investigation into missing dossiers even if we could prove it it wouldnt be politically acceptable it would prevent us the militia being accused of any negligence or culpability i suppose it would agreed olga although doubtfully what are you going to do about the bendall woman keep her as terrified as she is she could still have her uses so could the britons and the americans whove got to be officially involved it was performed as a political necessity like so much else both walter anandale and irena yudkin wore deep black and posed for the washington white houses official stills photographer against identifiably different backgrounds described in the accompanying caption as adjoining the emergency wards of their respective spouseswhich neither were both russian and american surgeons refused to allow the most minimal disturbance so close which the protection services of both countries also argued against the setting was in fact in the same room a block away from either victim with a fifteenminute interval to switch the medical equipment backdrop to make it look different there were other stills of the american president and the russian first lady in an adjoining lounge with anandale holding irenas hand each consoling the other irena had frequently to use the handkerchief she kept in her free hand and anandale was drawn and gaunt faced and had earlier dismissed the suggestion of camera makeup the photocall was posed their visible genuine anxiety was not aleksandr okulov was included in some of the lounge pictures but carefully kept out of shot otherwise as were loosely paired entourages of matchingly ranked softvoiced politicians diplomats and functionaries exchanging promises for undertakings and undertakings for promises wendall north and yuri trishin were joint ringmasters moving smoothly between the groups each enacting recovery operations of their own there was an instinctive american dominance personified by the physical presence of the elected walter anandale against the emergencyelevated russian premier although there was no deference from okulov since his securitycleared backdoor arrival at the pirogov hospital an hour earlier it was the american chief of staff who orchestrated the final five minutes of the photoshoot to just anandale and okulov seemingly engrossed in deep continuity discussions it was also north who directed the white house photographer and backed the protective services against admitting television only two organizationscnn for america ntv for russiawere allowed within the precincts of the hospital to record anandale briefly leaving the building for the first time since the shooting he did so with a comforting hand on irena yudkins elbowaleksandr okulov followed slightly behindand kissed her lightly on the cheek before personally handing her into her car only wendall north rode with anandale in the lead vehicle of the american convoy to novinskij bulvar sitting on the jump seat to face the president the glass divide was fully raised between themand the driver and secret serviceman in the front the rear section in which they sat was soundproofed and voicecleaned spell it out for me demanded anandale additional communications were brought in as a matter of course for the visit reminded north because of whats happened nsa is repositioning a geostationary satellite weve got the secretary of state and his people already here with us and a full secretariat youve got the ambassadors office and a threeroomed suite in the embassy compound already checked and cleared by the secret service the embassys a temporary but fully operational and functioning white house for as long as we need it to be donningtons lessening the sedation if i can speak to ruth i might sleep over at the hospital again the ambulance planes ready at sheremetyevo and we flew a fuel tanker in with it for an unbroken flight back to washington anandale nodded approval whats the immediate schedule a meeting in an hour to include the ambassador that gives us time to set up a voice and visual satellite link with washington for a full cabinet session ive called everyone in to pennsylvania avenue and the cia and fbi directors the russians are talking total cooperation and exchange absolutely anandale looked briefly through the limousine window they were using the cleared intersectioncontrolled central lane again with outrider escorts moving so fast the buildings were blurred coming back inside the car he said is it too early for any poll readings north hesitated youre riding a sympathy wave youre up fifteen points and rising anything about the other business north was glad hed spent most of the early hours on the securityswept telephone link to the local party caucus in austin as well as to washington bringing himself as up to date as possible on the independent enquiry by the hostile texas senate into undeclared cash donations for anandales first term election from four separate corporations granted oil drilling and development contracts whileanandale was state governor theres no irregularities showing in the audited accounts that were subpoenad anandale smiled fleetingly much national coverage paragraphs here and there tagged on to the shooting here the moscow visit had been coordinated to overwhelm the texas enquiry whats the word that were not to worry said north whod been with anandale from his days as texas governor and worked as his campaign manager for that initial term success thats good to hear said anandale he looked out of the window again as the car swept over the krymskij bridge to get on to zubovskij bulvar for the final approach to the american embassy okulov was kgb right right you think there could be any link ive asked around already the ambassador doesnt think so they got the death penalty in russia yes sir said north glad hed anticipated that question along with all the rest good said the other man i want the bastard who did this to fry north decided against pointing out that in russia the death penalty was exacted by firing squad one of the larger reception rooms at the us embassy was assigned for the gathering mainly because the satellite screen was large enough to encompass the seated waiting washington cabinet members it dominated virtually one entire wall and most of a connecting corner overflowed with cameras and relay equipment to ensure the exchanges were simultaneous wendall north resolved the washington hesitancy at the presidents preoccupied headdown filmed entry into the moscow meeting by standing everyone followed in both cities anandale waved them down without speaking and before sitting himself discarded his jacket and loosened his tie with another gesture for anyone to do the same if they wanted from washington vice president robert clarke said i want toextend the sympathy of everyone here for whats happened mr president and wish the first lady a very quick and full recovery there was a verbal scramble to be placed on record from others in the room which anandale curtly stopped with a series of thank you thank you after secretary of defense wilfred pinkton repeated practically word for word what the treasury secretary had managed to say seconds ahead of him i met with acting president aleksandr okulov earlier today announced anandale he wants to continue the treaty negotiations suggested that at least we could agree a protocol of intent north said there needs to be a statement to go with todays pictures trishins proposing a joint press conference you and okulov together which establishes my supporting okulov as the successor said anandale he is under their constitution said the secretary of state james scamell was another old time ally from anandales governorship emergency qualified anandale temporarily until proper elections if yudkin doesnt make it if okulov runs and loses against the communists im shown to have endorsed the wrong guy if he hadnt been shot and yudkin had still lost to the communists youd have been doing that coming here scamell pointed out weve got to say something about the treaty anandale looked directly at the camera whats defenses feeling on this the joint chiefs are nervous about a communist succession said pinkton we sure okulovs got the following to take over maybe we should have the local opinion on that avoided scamell turning to the ambassador cornell burton was a career diplomat whod believed himself on the fast upward track the presidential visit could only further speed up but now he wasnt so sure what he was sure about was that he couldnt afford one misstep okulovs a closeddoors manipulator respected for it in the duma but hes alienated some of the smaller parties hed need for a coalition if the communists do anywhere near as well as is being predicted so how well will they do demanded anandale yudkin would have carried a peace vote with a successful treaty im not so convinced that okukov will whats the kgb story the attention switched to john kayley the fbi man said yudkin forced the reforms through and okulov showed him how to do it word is among the old guard that okulovs regarded as a traitor turning against them which could be a very clever doublebluff suggested burt jordan explain that demanded anandale okulov was the heirinwaiting what if he got too impatient to wait any longer keep on top of that ordered anandale okulovs kgb connections worry me arent we leaving something hugely important out of the equation suggested north the guy who did it and why he did it if he turns out to be a protesting communist weve got a whole new picture to color in is he anandale put the question to those around him but the answer came too eagerly from washington from an fbi director determined the american investigation should be bureauled paul smith a burly former circuit judge said ive got twenty more agents on their way to moscow arriving later tonight theyre bringing with them all our filesagency and bureauon peter bendall the father he was british counterintelligences disaster i understand from john whos with you there mr president that their guys let us have all he says theyve got the sons still unconscious maybe even in a coma the mothers in custody weve been promised details of her interrogation but weve asked for our own access and for the witnesses list they were all rounded up by russian security directly after the attack weve asked for the rifle for our own forensic examination here at pennsylvania avenue and were not making our own independent investigation cut off anandale smith unconsciously bit his lip at once regretting not letting kayley take the original question thats what ive got men ontheir way to do under johns command i think though it would be useful for me to come over personally speaking with ominous quietness anandale said i want the attempted murder of the american presidents wife investigated by americans until im satisfied thats happeningsatisfied that aleskandr okulov is keeping every cooperation promise hes made to me todayany treaty discussions are on the back burner with the heat down low north and the secretary of state exchanged brief frowning looks scamell urged again there has to be a statement of some sort mr president anandale remained silent for several moments here it is were in consultations with the emergency russian leadership need to consider the implications of the attack our pledge to continued cooperation and detente unaffected that sort of stuff itll fit the hospital pictures we dont agree any joint media event with okulov until we get all we want he went to the secretary of state and the ambassador i want you to liaise with wendall really find out the communist strength it might play better back home to go hawkish and keep the defense system he looked around the table any thoughts yudkinor his successorneed the treaty to survive thats why were here reminded scamell we leave them with nothing were edging the door open to the opposition we dont leave them with nothing said anandale you find the words jamie the only thing they dont get is the final signature weve surely blown enough smoke about how difficult it all is to make that totally believable i guess so accepted scamell anandale went to wendall north get on to yudkins chief of staff he stopped snapping his fingers yuri trishin trishin picked up the prompted president i dont want himor anyone hes got to tellleft in any doubt whos going to run this investigation as far as my wife is concerned you clear on that quite clear said north would you like me to come over personally mr president hopefully asked the fbi director over the satellite link no rejected anandale at once weve got enough chiefs here already what we need is indians john kayley with his early settler family legend of partcherokee ancestry didnt like the smoke signals he thought he was reading the emergency downing street meeting was scheduled for the entire day but sir rupert dean the directorgeneral returned to the millbank building with political adviser patrick pacey by early afternoon the rest of the control group were already assembled its accepted to be an inherited problem but the decision is that its our problem announced dean already his spectacles were working through his fingers like worry beads a stress indicator the others had come to recognize it was unfortunate that the mans receding hair rose from his head like a tidal wave adding to the impression of startled nervousness because no one else wanted to come within a million miles of it said pacey hardly surprising accepted jeremy simpson the services legal advisor ive heard from the attorney general were arranging legal representation we were told said pacey muffin was on while you were at downing street he thinks theres something odd about the shooting but who better to imagine something odd than the man himself said jocelyn hamilton the bullchested thinninghaired deputy directorgeneral was more unsettled than dean at the russian crisis although concealing it well hed supported the earlier effort to oust charlie from moscow and knew he had been lucky to escape with a formal censure when it had gone wrong dean frowned at the obvious personal dislike what hes shipping over a selection of television footage wants an audio and timed comparison of the shots jesus said pacey in quick understanding his theory or russian his as far as i understand hamilton hesitated hes askedthe ambassador to include him on any official access to bendall i told him he should have waited for official guidance from here im assuming of course were sending a team from here dean let silence be the rebuke only when there were discomfited shifts around the table did the directorgeneral say why would you assume that the deputy colored the magnitude of it surely too much for one man swamping moscow with people would be a panicked kneejerk reaction rejected dean muffin alerted us to george bendall hours before any official communication hes obviously well established and it is an inherited problem repeated pacey bendalls been in moscow for almost thirty years downing streets thinking is that hes british by little more than a fluke hes not ours anymore never was well do all were asked but let moscow and washington take the lead what about the technical checks muffin wants persisted hamilton it could be a complication admitted the directorgeneral theres invariably a complication with charlie muffin warned the deputy max donnington was waiting for anandale in the same lounge at the pirogov hospital that had earlier been used for the photocall the large silverhaired naval surgeon still wore a sterilized ward coat and anklehigh theater boots anandale said at once whats the change no worse you can talk to her in a moment to tell her what youll understand better if you see the plates ive set up a room along the corridor anandale followed the surgeon further into the building cables from an unseen inaudible generator were taped along the newly shined corridor lined every five meters by secret servicemen who came to attention as the president passed the room into whichdonnington led the president was bright from newly installed neon strips and against one wall glowed an already lighted xray viewing screen there was a heavy smell of disinfectant donnington slotted the first plate into its clip and traced his finger around a large completely black area at the end of the shoulder thats where the bullet hit ruth its called the brachial plexus into it run the nerves from the neck routed from between the fourth cervical and first thoracic in laymans terms think of it as a junction box from the brachial plexus emerge three nerves specific to the arm the radial median and ulnar he changed plates showing the arm the bullet that struck your wife destroyed those nerves at the branchial plexus does it have to be amputated demanded anandale hollow voiced no said the surgeon immediately putting the third plate into place ive had to wait this long to ensure that there is no interruption to the blood flow there isnt it missed the arteries the first lady will have a permanently numb and powerless arm but there is no risk of gangrene the arm can stay no use in it whatsoever none said the surgeon bluntly nerves can be reconnected you read about it all the time blurted anandale the damage here is too great rejected donnington you could be wrong there could be a medicalsurgicaladvance insisted anandale of course you need a second opinion and a third and a fourth every expert you can consult acknowledged donnington unoffended im giving you my initial but at the same time considered professional prognosis initial seized the president i dont expect to change it believe me mr president id like to be proven wrong when can she be moved back to america to see other people asked anandale i dont want to risk disturbing anything for at least two daysmaybe longer waiting isnt going to affect the arm in any way its the shoulder i want stabilized before we start thinking of getting on and off airplanes the president stared sightlessly at the xray for several moments what am i going to tell her do you want me to offered donnington no refused anandale quickly ill do it there was a frame over ruth anandales body keeping off even the pressure of the bed coverings from her neck to her waist her face was sallow and shiny from how it had been swabbed and her thick black hair was sweatmatted against the pillow because this early donnington had refused even to allow the lightest of brushing to affect her neck she lay with her eyes closed mouth slightly open her face occasionally twitching her uninjured arm was outside the frame on top of the bed a needle was inserted into a vein on the back of her hand through which pain killers could be administered a catheter tube snaked from beneath the bedclothes and there were other leads connected to heart respiratory and blood pressure monitoring machines across the screens of which tiny mountains peaked with reassuring regularity the hair of the two uniformed attendant nurses was beneath sterilized caps both anandale and the surgeon wore caps too and donnington had changed his gown at the same time as the president had donned his at their entry the two nurses withdrew close to the door but didnt leave one of the nurses said the first ladys conscious and at the sound ruth anandale opened her eyes it took several moments for her to focus and when she did there was a brief smile of recognition she said i cant feel much theres some sensation in my shoulder but nothing else i dont remember there was a shooting reminded anandale youre under a lot of medication am i badly hurt were going to get you home as soon as we can get you better there i cant feel my right arm at all itll be all right when can i go home soon i havent lost my arm have i im going to be all right her voice rose cracking youre going to be fine were going to find all the specialists and get everything fixed i promise why who weve got the man its all under investigation was anyone else hurt the russian president some guards they going to be all right we dont know not yet the womans eyes flickered and drooped and anandale felt donningtons hand upon his arm as they scuffed out of the room anandale said i didnt lie i will find the surgeon to fix her arm yes mr president said donnington charlie didnt hurry responding to the internal messages that had finally arrived when he got back from the viewing theater he first read what had come in from london and checked his email and even then detoured to donald morrisons office just for the hell of it i know its your assignment greeted the mi man as morrison grew older and wiser he wouldnt be so eager charlie thought its not quite that definite the assignment decision had been one of the waiting email messages from sir rupert dean im to assist in any way necessary the younger man offered a package everything vauxhall cross has got charlie took it thanks for getting it so quickly you wont ask will you anticipated morrison sadly i dont know said charlie honestly no one can guess which way this will go its better to limit any possible diplomatic damage by keeping it to one service i expected them to send in a team limitation like i said id like to do something if i can ill remember promised charlie who was still digesting the london edict it put him as much in the firing line as he would have been on the white house podium with the two presidents hed have to be bloody carefulmore careful perhaps than hed ever beenthat he didnt become the fifth casualty charlie hadnt bothered to tell richard brooking he was on his way when he arrived the head of chancellery seemed lost in thought behind a desk totally clear of any activityactually appearing polishedwith blotter pen set and telephones regimented precisely in place no one knew where you were accused the diplomat abruptly aware of charlies presence making enquiries said charlie unhelpfully he had no intention of telling the man what he suspected and anne abbott had agreed it would be best to wait until the confirmation of the technical analysis weve had foreign office instructions from london announced brooking were formally requesting access the man paused coming to unpleasantness and youre to be included ive been told that independently from my people said charlie brooking made obvious his head to toe examination of charlie youll have inferred diplomatic status do you have another suit and some half decent shoes charlie grimaced ive got one for weddings and funerals theres a chance for you to wear it scored the other man weve just been officially informed that the american secret serviceman has died so now its murder said charlie no longer glib there was another message continued brooking a formal offer of investigating cooperation from the russians theres the name of the officer youre to liaise with a woman charlies hand was quite steady as he reached forward for the note that brooking was proffering but his stomach dipped then he looked down and saw the name of colonel olga ivanova melnik it didnt begin confrontationally charlie actually set out to achieve the oppositeto convince her it was ridiculous for them not to discuss the caseby announcing he had brought peter bendalls records back to lesnaya for her to read and was encouraged when natalia said she had vera bendalls initial interview for him she already knew about the meeting charlie had the following day with olga melnik and said the fbi rezident was also scheduled to meet the senior investigating colonel theyd established a routine of undivided shared time with sasha whenever it was possible and the two dossiers remained unread on a lounge table for the hour they spent taking her slowly through an early reader book and discussing what sasha referred to as going to grown up school it wasnt until natalia went to bathe and settle their daughter that charlie got to the vera bendall interview he read it twice before setting it aside slouched with the second islay malt resting on his chest his mind more upon natalia than upon what hed just read he couldnt make any judgment on that evenings fifteenminute conversation so faralthough she had given him a head start identifying peter bendall the previous nightbut he was encouraged by natalias apparently changed attitude and not just professionally that for once was a secondary consideration the first need was for their personal erosion to stop thered been no thought of sexthoughts of sex didnt seem to occur too often to either of them anymorebut he knew natalia hadnt been asleep when hed got into bed the previous night not something to challenge her with he had to be careful not to challenge her about anything while he remained uncertain charlie lifted his glass in invitation when natalia emerged fromsashas bedroom natalia shook her head taking the chair on the far side of the low lounge table for several moments she stared down at peter bendalls waiting dossier and charlie wondered if the seeming reluctance to pick it up was the final hesitation at committing herself wrong to say anythingto speak at allhe told himself it was obviously much thicker than the interview and took natalia longer to read while she did he made himself a third drink that was almost gone too by the time she put the manila folder back on the separating table nothing about the son apart from his existence she said the mothers disappointing too dont you think the question went beyond wanting to keep the conversation going natalia was amazingly intuitive one of the best debriefers hed ever encountered and he wanted her professional opinion she nodded ive also listened to the actual recording i dont get the impression she was lying holding anything back but then again ive known some very clever liars natalia got up and poured herself a glass of the volnay charlie had opened for dinner i offered you a drink said charlie half an hour ago i didnt want one then now i do why had she snapped like that and no i wasnt referring to you as a liar when we first met back off thought charlie so most likely george bendalls a mentally unstable loner that no one knows anything about in no way did he think himself a hypocrite at the moment all he had was a suspicion about the sound of the gunshots if it was confirmed hed tell her not the first high profile murderer to be just that a total nonentity seeking his fifteen seconds or minutes of fame but always the worst to try to investigate natalia shrugged but said nothing why did it have to be so difficult for her to reach a compromise when their jobs overlapped because of the past always the past which she could never completely forget no matter how hard she tried or how much she loved him charlie was making a very obvious effort couldnt sheshouldnt shetry harder charlie didnt want to lose the flow were talking total cooperation is the instruction youd have got the transcript from olga ivanova tomorrow would you have shown it to me if it hadnt been officially ordered hardly the disclosure of the century is it this wasnt helping it surely makes our situation easier natalia shrugged again i dont know basically it doesnt change anything does it the confrontation had to come sooner or later it might as well be now things arent going to change natalia this is it the best its going to get i dont know anything more i can do to make it better for us between us what i do know is that i dont want everything to collapse and i think it is collapsing meaning the concessions have to come from me their relationship was crumbling and it probably was more her fault than charlies im not asking you to make any concessions im asking you to acknowledge the reality and the difficulty of our being together i hardly need reminding of that you under any pressure i could be dont close me out as you have been closing me out the same argument natalia recognized the same persuasive logic and it was logical charlie was a better street fighter than she could ever be i know youre right then trust me natalia allowed the pause thats what ive got to do i wont let you down i did before but i wont again its not just the two of us anymore theres so much else that could go wrong sasha says theyve been talking at school about what parents do two kids said their fathers were in the militia what did she say big problems could easily come from innocuous innocence she didnt know thats how the conversation came up she asked me what did you tell her that we both worked in big offices which will do for now what are we going to tell her when she gets older charlie wished he had an easy answer any answer that might come anywhere close to satisfying natalia it was ineffective and the last thing charlie had ever been was ineffective weve got more important personal questions to answer i know its not the jobs its the effect of them perhaps but not the jobs themselves he sniggered in sudden realization weve come the full circle havent we i screwed everything up the first time by not being totally able to trust youwhich was my terrible mistakeand now you cant trust me so now its my mistake she pounced at once regretting the words as they were uttered no darling insisted charlie patiently youre justified i wasnt charlie filled the silence by refilling her glass which she surrendered without protest he thought about a fourth whisky but decided to change to wine himself as he sat down again natalia said you think theres still a chance we can make it work yes he said at once when she didnt respond he said what do you think im not sure what do you want i want it very much but im frightened theres too much in the way lets move it out of the way urged charlie yes she accepted uncertainly whats your pressure ive got to coordinate all the russian agencies make everything work the rock and the hard place charlie recognized their successes are theirs their failures are yours something like that should she tell him the old kgb files were missing youre going to need my help need someone to bounce theories off i shouldnt have to say it but i guess i do i wont take anyadvantage put youusat risk in any way for once in charlies lifeprobably the first time in charlies lifeit wasnt a promise embroidered in easily expandable elastic the fsb cant find peter bendalls records blurted natalia charlie shook his head in professional refusal it would have been an ongoing current file assessments surveillance psychological profile not just of him but of his wife and son its the starting point for any investigation into george bendall why did she waste so much timeendanger so muchmaintaining her obstructive integrity pretensions natalia asked herself acknowledging the expertise whats your reading immediate sanitizing because of whats in them suggested charlie maybe about george particularly its clumsy but its predictable panic theres the excuse that the kgb isnt any longer the kgb which it was when bendall defected things do get misplaced in reorganization it wouldnt help by reminding her that shed destroyed his kgb dossier and sanitized her own of any original connection with him nothing more sinister charlie hesitated she was being open with him at last and his offering something in exchange would show he was keeping his side of an unspoken bargain you had any technical discussion with anyone natalia regarded him intently about what ive got the soundtrack from four different television films covering the presidential arrival as well as that of ntv disclosed charlie cnn were mute remember theyre being scientifically tested now in london but ive carried out my own rough timing according to my count five shots were fired in a time gap of nine point two seconds thats very sharp sharpshooting were getting george bendalls army records are you demanded charlie pointedly weve asked for george bendallsor georgi guginsarmy records qualified natalia im particularly interested in what theyll say about his marksmanship or lack of it accepted natalia i was frightened enough tobegin with now youve really scared me i preferred the mentally unstable loner wheres the mentally unstable loner get a snipers rifle which it very clearly was from the television pictures there was something else to check he realized it didnt fit this conversation mosowrussiais awash with weaponry you can buy a gun and ammunition for it in street underpasses we cant even look after our nuclear arsenals basic kalashnikovs and makarovs not something specialized like this do you intend saying anything tomorrow to olga melnik charlie shook his head not without proof thanks for telling me isnt that the new deal yes that night they did make love but for each of them it was more a duty than spontaneous passion and it wasnt good charlie said we can get that back too i hope so said natalia both appraised the other in the opening seconds charlie hadnt expected senior investigating colonel olga ivanova melnik to be somewhere in her midthirties which had to indicate a special ability he wouldnt have guessed at from the vera bendall transcript hed read the previous night he thought the cleavage interesting but a little too obvious the unsecured button on her shirt didnt fit the pressed neatness of the perfectly tailored grey checked suit or the pristine orderliness of the high windowed everythinginitsproperplace office and in any case the spiders web tightrope of his current high wire act with natalia didnt allow any extramarital temptations the cleared desk reminded him of that of richard brooking whod delivered the standard lecture on diplomatic conformity before hed left the embassy that morning the head of chancellery had been very pissed off at his ignoring the diplomatic dress code but charlie didnt regard todays encounter as a fancy dress party with luck it might be his first opportunity to start working properly olga was disoriented although she didnt allow any outward sign moscow was a prestige posting and charles edward muffin had been knowingly accepted in moscow as an fbi equivalent a specifically chosen british contributionlike that of americaagainst russias virtually uncontrollable organized crime from his physical appearance she wouldnt have believed the flophaired overweight man sitting opposite contributing anything more than a few kopeks to a charity rummage sale for downandouts for a suit to replace the sagged and pocketbulged jacket and trousers and raftlike suede shoes that he was wearing now would you prefer english she offered speaking it with little accent in a deep oiled voice thanks but its not necessary charlie replied in russian i hope we can work well together i hope so too said charlie her territory her speed until he chose otherwise she pushed across the uncluttered desk what was supposed to be his first copy of the vera bendall interview its very preliminary the discomfort at having this shambling man judge her was worse than it had been with leonid zenin he matched her offering with the heavier mi dossier all we have on peter bendall nothing on the son he was not supposed to know vera bendall was in lefortovo he reminded himself my embassy was told today the official application for consular access has been granted the information had been the only useful outcome of that mornings encounter with brooking the man was injured in the fall its not yet clear when hell be well enough to be interviewed there was obviously a diplomatic necessity for this charade but very little practical benefit apart from hopefully recovering from the vera bendall debacle with an unsuspected transcript of this encounter it was important to establish her supremacy on tape the application extends to the family persisted charlie as far as we are aware vera bendall like her son hasnt applied for russian citizenship charlie nodded to the russian folder already knowing the answer i presume her address is there olga looked steadily across her sterile desk she is in protective custody protected from whom asked charlie people who might take it upon themselves to exact revenge upon the mother of a man who shot their president so she hasnt taken citizenship persisted charlie it would be wrong to underestimate this shamans monster decided olga who had no religion but in whom was imbued the inherent russian respect for witchcraft and holy men who could cast spells there is no trace of her having done so certainly not of it being granted gently does it thought charlie im sure my embassymy governmentwill appreciate that protection thank you intruded olga caught out by charlies inviting pause which of course in no way prevents our officially agreed access iand others from the embassycan easily come to wherever shes being protectively held where is that by the way the criticizingly dismissive inference of her empty interview would be unavoidable on this transcript as i said my initial interrogation is only very preliminary interrogation echoed charlie you suspect shes in some way involved damn the man thought olga he really did have a witchdoctors split tongue its too early yet to decide who might or might not be involved she paused reluctant to correct herself i meant my questioning has only just begun we are cooperating fully arent we coaxed charlie yes agreed olga tightly apprehensive of how charlie muffin could juggle such simple words but anticipating that he would if were sharing theres no order of priority its become a murder enquiry fought olga russian legislation must take precedence im not an international lawyer said charlie its something ill leave to our legal attache to handle through diplomatic channels under such international scrutiny we shouldnt go beyond our boundaries should we olga wished the motherfucker wouldnt keep inviting her opinion to turn against her why oppose him there was enormous international scrutiny under which the claim that vera bendall required protective custody might become even more transparent than it was now in lefortovo vera bendall was very positively her prisoner whose every encounter and movement she could control and totally monitor it was conceivable some indication of vera bendalls innocence or complicity might emerge if britons were allowed access access every minute and word of which could be taped and possibly even filmed if there was something to be learned shed learn it learn too from what the british offered whether their cooperation was genuine and if the encounter was as unproductive as hers there couldnt be any criticisminternally or externallyof what now lay on the desk between her and charlie muffin like a taunt better apparently to concedebe persuaded at leastto an unimportant audience of one than to a much wider and more influential theater dont misunderstand me i wasnt arguing priorities as far as im concerned theres no reason whatsoever why youand others from your embassyshouldnt see the woman charlie hadnt expected the turnaround so quickly hadnt in fact expected it at all you havent told me where she is he had a rattrap forgetnothing mind acknowledged olga lefortovo how many had gone into protective custody in that bleak icilywalled fortress never to emerge and certainly never for a moment to be protected the first transcript was that of an already cowed frightened woman by now vera bendall would be terrified to the point of the insanity she was suggesting for her son thats conveniently central tomorrow would be good it gave her more than sufficient time eleven fine smiled charlie i could come here directly afterwards to discuss anything that emerges all right agreed olga doubtfully thrown off balance by the offer none of the witnesses are in protective custody are they he was playing with her his cat to her mouse no their statements are being translated id prefer them in the original available tomorrow excellent i can collect them after ive seen vera bendall yes this was going to read even worse than it sounded whats the progress of the forensic examination just that in progress therefore incomplete the satisfaction of the refusal was out of proportion to its effect it was something shed have to surrender eventually not available tomorrow i doubt it we havent talked about any positive lines of enquiry its too early to establish any i suppose the most important thing we havent talked about is the official record that would have been maintained upon peter bendall throughout his time here that would have included information upon the son as he grew up olga thought it was like being stripped naked in a siberian winter that would be classified the already prepared excuse for their apparent loss wondered charlie you have officially asked for them though every investigatory procedure befitting the crime has been implemented insisted olga regretting the formal pomposity the moment she began to speak but too angrily frustrated to find other words thats encouraging to hear said charlie my embassy will feel that too on a personal level im sure were going to work together extremely well im not thought the woman as he was escorted from the building charlie decided that olga ivanova melnik was not as good as she imagined herself to be perhaps that was why she found the need to have difficulty with blouse buttons the hidden recording charlie was sure would have been taken wouldnt do much for her either burt jordan was already waiting at their reserved table when donald morrison entered the arleccino waving to attract the mi mans attention when he came in off druzhinnikovskaya ulitza sorry im late apologized morrison couldnt get a taxi somehow it seemed easier when we were at the old embassy but now youve got air con smiled the cia rezident he was a small compact man made to look permanently doleful by the heavy moustache allowed to droop at either end he gestured around the restaurant italian ok for you fine i havent been here before the saltimbocca alla romanas the speciality jordan poured valpolicella i figured it far better to get together like this undisturbed the embassys a fucking mad house how about yours pretty calm considering it was unthinkable to tell the other man the virtually nonexistent role to which hed been relegated hed accepted the americans invitation in the hope of learning something with which to impress charlie muffin and get involved its good everyones pulling with the same stroke i guess it is i get anything its yours likewise when the waiter arrived they both ordered the saltimbocca jordan held up the still half full bottle and ordered another jordan said so what have you got morrison shrugged very little youve already got the counterintelligence stuff from charlie it was all internaleven the jail escapeso bendall was their headache not ours when the rumors began that he wanted to come home the instructions to our man here then was to find him and help him back if hed had anything worthwhile from working with the kgb here we could have negotiated a little remission in the sentence he would still have had to serve we couldnt get a lead we even had some stories planted in newspapers here when the press got freer after hinting as much as we could he never made contact the kgb wouldnt have risked him with anything sensitive they never treated defectorseven foreign nationals whod worked for themwell or with any respect stranger things have happened cliched morrison what about you jordan shook his head the bureau made it a big operation thestuff he leaked was from america mostly los alamos but as far as they discovered bendall wasnt part of any cell he was a solitary spy a walk in to the soviet embassy in london passing on stuff he received from us what about when he got here nothing said jordan thered been the bureau investigation by then showing hed worked alone we didnt try to find him you know said morrison despite all the panic and chaos when it comes down to it theres not a lot were going to be able to do weve still got to make the motions though thats why i thought we should meet like this my word about sharing anything i get mine too said morrison enthusiastically well met its murder now vera the death penalty yes the acceptance was flat totally without emotion olga melnik had hoped for more a collapse even they were in the same room with the same flowers and there was tea again with cake the record light flickered on the unobtrusive tape machine drink your tea the woman did as she was told gnawing at a cake between noisy sips can i have my underwear back and my shoes its really not comfortable without them its regulations refused olga what have you remembered tuesdays and thursdays what about tuesdays and thursdays those were the nights he seemed to stay out most often occasionally others but mostly tuesdays and thursdays better thought olga hopefully you must have asked him about those nights i told you he got angry particularly angry when you asked him about those nights i think so he never told you not once not even a word or a name no what about the name of the doctor i cant remember what did you talk about when he was home we didnt much we watched television sometimes the programs hed worked on he made models models of what cars boats planes things that moved he liked things that moved how did he make them from wood or what wood sometimes wood that he carved and kits the sort that children have i dont remember the people who searched your apartment finding any models it wasnt in their report he broke them as soon as he finished them said they were useless to him what other hobbies did he have none what about guns she had to improve on the original questioning no i told you did he ever go shooting he doesnt have a gun he could have borrowed one i dont know you are remembering things arent you im trying some other people are coming to see you what other people pleaded vera immediately alarmed from the british embassy they want to help like i want to help thats why youre here safe from people who might want to hurt you for what you son has done it was imperative to get that on record after the debacle with charlie muffin she hadnt just underestimated the man shed even more badly miscalculated the collaboration that would be imposed upon her will you be here with them no the woman looked down at her sagging bosoms can i have myunderwear back when they come and the laces for my shoes yes but you will go on thinking remembering wont you ill try olga hurried from the prison warning herself that it scarcely provided a lead but it certainly justified going through the statements of the people and acquaintances with whom george bendall had worked at ntv and if there was no reference to somethinganythingthe man regularly did on tuesday and thursday nights theyd all have to be reinterviewed and specifically asked you had no rightno authorityto arrange access to the mother without reference to me protested richard brooking it should have been done diplomatically through channels you were specifically warned by sir michael himself dick said charlie intentionally using the name abbreviation for its ambiguity thats debatable and im not interested in debating it im interested in finding out why a british national apparently tried to kill two presidents and when an opportunity presents itself like it did today then im going to take it without first asking your permission you want to protest that to london then go ahead and while youre doing it ask them how they feel about another british nationalalbeit one whos lived here for yearsbeing banged up in a stalinera prison without charge thats certainly questionable agreed anne abbott i thought you told me it was for her own protection bollocks rejected charlie brooking looked embarrassedly to anne who smiled and said thats what i think too im not sure it would be proper for me to accompany you to a prison said the diplomat dont then accepted charlie relieved it probably would be better left to us at this preliminary stage agreed anne thanks for the support said charlie as they made their way along the corridor towards his office things are difficult enough without dicks like richard brooking said the lawyer charlie thought that it just might be that he and anne abbott were birds of a feather which would be a welcome change from being surrounded by either vultures or cuckoos the informationstarved international media thronged petr tikunovs press conference at the duma the communist party presidential candidate a burly beetlebrowed man whose campaign managers tried to avoid facial comparison with brezhnev said that irrespective of any current investigation the new government he would be leading after the forthcoming elections would institute the most searching and thorough enquiry into the outrage it took the authorityand interventionof aleksandr okulovs office for natalia to reach the fsb counterintelligence chief and by the time she did it was to announce the exasperated acting president had ordered her personally to the lubyanka which made her as uneasy as it clearly did general dimitri spassky the only delay when she entered the russian intelligence headquarters from which she herself had operated for fifteen years was for the security formality of photographing identification and official authorization as she followed the required but unnecessary escort across the marbled and pillared hall to the elevator bank natalia thought that charlie was probably right that the sole difference between old and new was the name change not true she corrected herself at once shed been transferred outside the service a change she was certainly glad about or had been until now shed recognized quickly enough the professional hazards of being appointed the crisis committees coordinator but she hadnt expected to be sucked quite so quicklyand potentially deeplyinto such obvious infighting but she was here as the coordinatorthe emissary of the acting president in factnot as a deputy director of the interiorministry it put her into a stronger position despite spasskys seniority it had also been regulations when she worked there that visitors were searched irrespective of their outside security clearance or whoevers emissary they were so things werent the same she hoped her apparent advantage continued natalia smiled at the care the escort took selecting the elevator bank away from the lifts that went to the twelve basement levelsa subterranean township for the intelligence elite with shops roads and even a railway connection to the kremlin on which stalin once travelled by special carriage personally to witness the interrogations of purged central committee colleagues spasskys smokefumed office overlooked one of the inner prison courtyards in which such victims were finally put out of their agony and natalia wondered if there was an element of nostalgia in the oldtime kgb generals choice he didnt rise at natalias entry occupying himself lighting a fresh cigarette and having done so said it was unnecessary involving aleksandr mikhailevich you werent accepting my callsas you didnt yesterdayor returning the messages i left there was a recording being made every lubyanka office had been equipped within the first week of the invention of audio tape she was gladmaybe fortunatethat this was such an old office she still had to be alert to responses that could be edited to spasskys advantage and her detriment you mustnt question my authority here natalia fedova i am not questioning your authority i am trying to fulfill the function i was given at yesterdays meeting shed probably cocooned herself in more protection than she imagined by protesting to okulovs secretariat about spasskys awkwardness a meeting would have been arranged today the man was perspiring as visibly as he had been at the previous meeting but natalia didnt think that was the smell competing with the cigarettes there was the sourness of alcohol although shed believed vodka to be odorless perhaps the old man was mixing his drinks you promised the bendall file in twentyfour hours twentyfour hours has elapsed aleksandr mikhailevich has to address the duma this afternoon there are considerations what considerations to whom it is going to be made available are you suggesting that the acting president of the russian federationand a former regional director of the kgb has insufficient security clearance spasskys hands were shaking as he lighted another cigarette of course im not then i dont understand the objection youre making its not an objection have you found the peter bendall file yes too quick gauged natalia what was she missing the complete file covering everything he did after arriving here from the united kingdom up to the time he died to include his family the hesitation of the bloated general was indicative that is what i am trying to establish how having the names of bendalls case officers crossreferenced spassky was an anachronism the last stumbling dinosaur of an otherwise extinct species to whom it was instinctive to lie and evade she supposed she should be grateful but she was abruptly determined not to be crushed when he finally fell dimitri ivanovich crossreferencing case officers on a control that spread over thirty years could take another thirty years you have three hours in which to provide our acting president with each and every recorded detail of george bendall there is very little finally conceded spassky she had to guard against hurrying natalia recognized in growing understanding the son is mentioned in the fathers records occasionally over what period early what do you mean by early when the family were first reunited here how regularly there was a forgotten satisfaction at conductingan interrogationbeing so sure of herself in an interrogationafter so long spassky spilled butts on to his already burnscarred desk stubbing out the existing cigarette for once he did not attempt instantly to light another every month or two i suppose what sort of details progress at school assessments at assimilation is it a complete stop or just interruptions interr began spassky before jerking to a stop too late realizing hed fallen into the easiest of interrogation traps a question asked with the inference of the answer already known they have been tampered with accused natalia openly they are incomplete tried spassky they were in disarray the missing sections will be found not in time i can let you have everything we have up until the time the boy was maybe fifteen or sixteen not let me have corrected natalia at once they are to be sent under fsb seal by fsb courier direct to aleksandr mikhailevich okulov in the kremlin it was fitting she supposed that she should exercise such paranoid selfprotection in the lubyanka please do it now to avoid wasting any more time while spassky made a flurry of telephone calls culminating in his personally signing the dispatch note natalia sat comparatively relaxed reflecting how glad she was that there was now a sensible exchange between herself and charlie refusing an overinterpretation she supposed charlie could have been right the previous night at omissions being caused by the chaos of reorganization but just as quickly she remembered what hed also said about the bendall family file being actively maintained until the defectors death only two years earlier its the fault of archives insisted spassky as the door closed behind the courier you are ultimately responsible for internal security which she had without too much difficulty evaded long before spasskys appointment by cleansing the records of any reference to herself and charlie muffin the missing sections could be found suggested spassky more in hope than conviction or they could not the man was introducing his own doubts now its the primary responsibility of archives persisted the man his mind blocked by one defense there was no purpose in her staying any longer has this meeting been recorded dimitri ivanovich no denied the man at once concentrating upon another cigarette why should you imagine it would be it was once regular procedure it isnt any longer he smiled in recollection a lot of memories at being back none insisted natalia she was in fact very eager to leave there was the ritual exchange of supposed informationtogether with the ritual offer and refusal of englishand another mutual appraisal physically john kayley was quite different from charlie muffinmuch heavier darkerskinned and with surprisingly long and thick jetblack hairbut olga melnik felt a similarity beyond the carelessness of the sagged suit and crumpled yesterdays shirt she was determined against letting this meeting get away from her as it had done that morning with the englishman and felt more confident after the second encounter with vera bendall the brief initial search of the statements of those whod known george bendallor georgi guginat ntv had failed to discover any significance from his mothers tuesday and thursday recollection kayley was as caught as charlie had been by the womans comparative youthfulness against the seniority of her rank and for the same reason his first impression was that it wasnt going to be as easy maneuvring himself into the command role the president was insisting upon and which hed initially chauvinistically hoped possible when hed learned the russian side of the investigation was being headed by a woman he made a mental note to avoid hinting the sexism although he wondered in passing if the cleavage valley was being offered for exploration id welcome a brief run down in advance of reading what youve given me he said bendall himself isnt yet recovered sufficiently to be interviewed responded olga much better rehearsed the second time there are the two interviews ive so far conducted with the mother whos in protective custody she was evasive in the first she began to break in the second this morning i dont believe bendall could have done this alone i think theres something significant in what youll see about his regularly doing something on tuesday and thursday meetings do you think the mother made a point of mentioning it you think shes involved he took out a packet of his scented cigars you mind olga did but shook her head perhaps not directly involved but i think she knows more than shes telling me at the moment olga now had a very definite intention not just how to control this interview but how from now on to handle this bizarre troika she was actually gratefujustthat the fortunately separate encounter with the englishman had gone against her she was alert now to what she might be up against and had had time completely to evaluate her situation she had she acknowledged become arrogant judging everyone by the inferior grafteroded standards all around her in the militia into which she decided neither charles edward muffin nor john deke kayley fitted she didnt have the slightest doubt that both considered themselves superiorbetter able better experienced better resourcedto supervise the investigation she wasnt frightened to compete with either in a onetoone contest with the kremlin insistence upon total transparency her undermining difficulties would come if the two westerners combined to take side against her her answerher protection as well as hopefully her advantagewas to play one off against the other to prevent such a combination there would have been archives on the father being assembled kayley frowned openly still im expecting them later today what about all the witnesses olga nodded towards the minibarrier of stacked files between them all there nothing that connects with anything the mother said the smell of the strange cigars made her feel vaguely nauseous wed also like the rifle for forensic examination its still under tests here youll obviously get the full report wed still like physically to see the weapon and there are the extracted bullets wed also like to see the bullets that you have countered olga time to get a little harder judged kayley with our secret servicemans death weve got an american murdered within russian jurisdiction by someone who appears still to be british she couldnt see the point of stating the obvious but she could turn it back upon the man complicated she encouraged objectivelyand quite obviously we always have to remain objectivethe greater crime the actual killing is of an american it was going far better than hed imagined it might she shouldnt make it too easy its good our three governments have agreed such total cooperation but we have to decide upon a working structure seized kayley the purpose of this meeting announced olga was she jerking his chain how do you see us working operationally she had to be extremely careful of the recording together i suppose charlie muffin isnt here charlie not charles she noted it was understandable that theyd know each other but how well how friendly things still have to be organized established when are you seeing him olga hesitated in apparent surprise i already have this morning the british have been granted consular access that includes the mother of course now the hesitation was kayleys tilted momentarily off balance in view of what youve told me ahead of my being able to read any of this i need to talk to her of course accepted olga but i suppose now theres a diplomatic consideration the purpose of consular access is primarily protection which is after all why i placed her in custody but shes not been charged with any crime cant be from anything weve got so far are you denying me access demanded kayley overly forceful of course not im simply suggesting there needs additionally to be some diplomatic consultations i suppose between your two embassies or maybe just with charlie she shrugged the sort of problems were going to encounter she was losing her apprehension of the american he was going to be far easier to manipulate than the englishman although for once she hoped there wasnt a need for that manipulation to become physical he probably smelled like his cigars you sure theres a need for her to remain in protective custody olga was completely prepared for that demand most certainly if the son had accomplices but youve no objection to my interviewing her not as long as the british have no objection she paused we need to get together establish some ground rules dont we very definitely agreed kayley it had been a disastrous fucking meeting achieving nothing and he was scheduled to talk personally with the director in washington in less than two hours olga melniks only disappointment was the time it took to get rid of the traces of kayleys presence despite having the ashtray immediately removed and all her office windows opened she was still reflecting upon the encounter when the courier arrived from the defense ministry with george bendalls army record at that moment on the other side of the city the diplomatic bag for which charlie was impatiently waiting arrived at the riverbordered british embassy he wasnt prepared for the disappointment it contained if he had been he probably wouldnt have called anne abbott before he began reading the forensic evaluation for which charlie had asked was divided into three partsfactual ballistic the audio measurement from thetv soundtracks and finally the expert assessment impatient though he wassure though he wascharlie decided to go through it in its prepared response to get the answers to his questions in the order in which hed posed them the opening section only ran to two pages of little more than flat statistics dragunov was the western identification for the telescope equipped svd russian snipers rifle introduced into the soviet army in the late s based upon the kalashnikov ak to ensure its high degree of accuracy it fired an obsolete but essentially rimmed mm ball cartridge developed in the early part of the century for the bolt action mosinnagant rifle which was no longer issued to the russian military the svd was gas operated semiautomatic and carried a ten round magazine there was also a commercial version the medved which was usually chambered for a mm sports cartridge attached were photographs as well as sectioned illustrations detailing specific parts and charlie at once identified the weapon over which bendall and the cameraman fought to be the military model anne came in smiling expectantly well not there yet said charlie offering her what hed already read the assessment of sound differences was longer than the opening and more technical it had been made using both accepted accoustical measurements the pascal variations of pressure according to newtons per square meter and the measurement of power creating the sound in terms of watts per square meter the most positive register had been unsurprisingly from moscows ntv track two shots measured eighteen accoustical ohms two were twenty and one was twentyone from both american stations nbc and cbs the highest resonance measured the first two at twenty ohms one at twentyeight and two at thirtythree canadas cbs came out at twentyfive another twentysix and two at thirtyfive the canadian tape had needed to be sound enhanced to its maximum to detect the fifth shot at fortytwo unspeaking charlie pushed across the desk towards the lawyer each page as he finished it she shuffled them to one side although in order without looking up charlie had asked for as complete and as scientific an analysis as possible but hed expected something beforenow it had to be in the final summation he decided turning to it the five shots had been fired in the space of seconds not the slightly longer period he had amateurishly calculated using both versions of the russian weapon tests had been carried out on two separate british ranges by three army marksmen shooting at different times over the comparable distance and elevation of the ntv gantry from the white house podium at life sized models arranged as the presidential group had been each had completed firing in seconds with positive kills of both presidents and the american first lady the figures representing the dead american secret serviceman and the russian security officer were also hit in every test the conclusion was that the actual seconds were fully consistent with the time it would take for one trained marksman to fire all five shots from the semiautomatic dragunov a misleading although understandable laymans interpretation had been drawn from the sound variations of the shots it did not in the opinion of ballistics scientists indicate the presence of a second gunman firing from different positions the positional difference was that of the five cameras from the pod from which all the shots had been fired the sound variations had also been affected by the gunman shifting his stance to take individual aim the ntv sound boom being the nearest although disengaged from its mute camera and that of the canadian equipment having been the furthest away charlie waited until anne abbott finished she did so smiling up at him and said there goes the defense that was going to make me famous bad luck charlie theyre wrong he stated she frowned at him charlie the sound differences arent from his shifting about on the ntv pod there wasnt enough room thats not their only scientific finding its the one thats their mistake you gave them everything even the five different camera points to calculate from you cant argue with it he could decided charlie and would the assumption is that george bendall is a highly trained marksman what if he is or was he was a television station gofer whod been in the army she was disconcerted by the thought that charlie wouldnt let go of an opinion even when overwhelmingly proven to be mistaken theres still a lot we havent got from the russians would he have to admit keeping his suspicion from natalia to get it nothing thats going to affect this analysis insisted anne wait and see said charlie why he wondered was it so difficult to admit to the lawyer the possibility of his being wrong he was relieved at the appearance at the door of donald morrison ive just been lunched by the cia announced the younger man and anticipated charlie jordan told the truth about the saltimbocca being good but mostly he lied olga melnik decided that george bendalls army record under his assumed russian name would form an essentialand convictingpart of the mans prosecution hed served a total of eight yearsa much longer period than shed imagined and something else the stupid mother hadnt volunteeredtwo of them in east germany and eighteen months in afghanistan he had been selected for specialist instruction after showing an aptitude for marksmanship in basic training and qualified on an svd rifle as a grade sniper two years after enlistment in afghanistan he was credited with ten confirmed kills and three more had been judged to be most likely his four of the confirmed kills were listed as senior ranking leaders of the formative taliban regime the first indication of a possible psychiatric condition emerged during his afghanistan service he served six weeks detention in kabul for what was described as a frenzied and unprovoked attack in which the jaw was broken of a fellow member of his own squad there were three other disciplinary report references to violenceone involving an afghani for which he was not imprisoned he was named as one of four suspects in the fatal shooting of a russian major for which another soldier was eventually convicted and after the investigation he was suspended from the snipers detail he was not reassigned to it there were nine different charges of excessive drunkeness on two of which with others he was accused of drinking diluted diesel from military transporters which caused convulsions that required hospital treatment he was based in an army camp in odessa after leaving afghanistan and it was there that he was finally courtmartialed and jailed for six months preceding his discharge for the violent robbery of a civilian taxi driver who lost an eye in the attack olga had just given orders for the multiple duplication of the dossier when leonid zenin called on the internal line from his office on the floor above the fsb cant find all the references to george bendall in his fathers kgb file looks as if theres a lot missing a prosecution will hardly need it from what ive just got from the army bendalls a raving drunken lunatic thats not really the point though is it no agreed olga remembering their earlier conversation what are you going to do hows it going with the british and the americans queried zenin not replying well enough olga felt a stir of uncertainty have they asked for kgb material yes the orders are to cooperate fully they should be told why weor rather the kgb replacementarent able to provide it but shed be the identifiable person telling them olga realized uncomfortably youre right charlie its a hell of a view beyond the embankment the summer sun was striking diamonds off the moskva churned by followmyleader pleasure boats did you manage to catch okulovs duma statement on tv reciprocating the americans hospitality of the previous day charlie had islay malt on the desk between them i thought petr tikunov chewed him up and spat out the bits he didnt want that was charlies impression too it was a pretty obvious inference that the security relaxations were imposed from washington he wont have made any friends with that that your diplomatic playback the american shook his head personal view you not yet met the russian gal this afternoon moving towards it guessed charlie would kayley play his hand any cleverer than burt jordan had with morrison it had been stupid of the man to lie that the agency hadnt tried to find peter bendall after his defection what had amounted virtually to a joint operation would obviously remain on british file charlie said what do you think attractive nice tits professionally difficult to judge from one meeting we agreed we need a working structure she suggest anything no gave me a whole bunch of stuff guess she gave you the same when you met i hope so thought the second meeting with the mother was better than the first suggested kayley not bad charlie conceded should he admit to not having seen it or play the bluff what did olga think that there might be something in it the director had burned his ass for having so little to report about his conversation with the russian colonel it had been wise to hold back about the british access you agree with her difficult to say until ive gone through everything you havent told me what you think time to try an ace charlie decided im keeping an open mind until i see her myself thats best i think so tomorrow right correct on timing wrong on tactics gauged charlie right its good were like that said kayley extending a hand with his forefinger over his index digit youll get it all promised charlie hows about me coming along with you that was practically desperate its british consular access diplomatic im only being allowed in under protest it hardly qualified as diplomatic without richard brooking but kayley wouldnt know that you any idea what sort of pressure im under with the goddamned president sitting on my lap i told you youll get it all i cant do more than that i was looking for a favor charlie recognized the inherent threat im going directly from the mother to olga why dont we establish the working structure then im disappointed charlie which was exactly what colonel olga melnik intended the man to be charlie guessed walter anandale snapped off the remote control blanking the screen upon which theyd watched the entire replay of aleksandr okulovs parliamentary appearance and said thats made me personally responsible for the whole fucking thing including the maiming of my own wife for christs sake that would be an extreme interpretation said wendall north uncomfortable at the reappearance of security lapses hed hoped safely swept behind him we got people at home looking for extremes you know that it certainly wasnt necessary retreated the chief of staff you get on to that guy whats trishin helped the other man why did the president have such a problem with that name trishin and you let him know i dont like what his guys justdone that i dont like it at all and then you get on to our public affairs people and tell them to start lobbying not just among the media travelling with us but back home in washington too i want it countered okulov wants to play dirty pool hes going to get his knuckles crunched we could suggest its the russians trying to get out from under which it is proposed north sounds good agreed the president doesnt help the atmosphere suggested north there isnt any atmosphere to be helped not anymore it remained essential to both sides that there was no suggestion of an irreparable collapse but now wasnt the moment to start talking of diplomacy and compromise north decided ive spoken personally to the four orthopedic surgeons specializing in brachial plexus injuries recommended by max donnington hes made up complete case notes together with the xrays were shipping it all back today and were also flying ben jenningss body home whats arranged marines pallbearers from the embassy here taking the coffin to the plane honor guard at andrews is he married north nodded two kids both at college i should write personally ive already made up a draft what about the vice president attending the funeral it would look right fix it vera bendalls shoes were laced so charlie presumed her bra had been returned as well although she was shapeless beneath a badly knitted cardigan the graystreaked hair was straggled no more than finger combed and there was no makeup there was a dirt smudgebeneath her chin and her hands were soiled blackly dirtrimmed beneath the odd nail that hadnt already been bitten to the quick despite the laces vera scuffed into the interview room stoopshouldered burdened by the unknown fears of whatever was going to happen to her next she stopped apprehensively as charlie stood then gnawed in embarrassment at her lower lip when he held out the one remaining chair sorry she said quickly you dont have to be frightened said anne abbott in english were from the embassy please help me pleaded the woman at once well try promised anne thats why were here wed like you to help us too said charlie vera bendall had responded in english so he did as well he held out the small pocket recorder were going to tape everything is that ok she shrugged at the continued politeness i suppose charlie hadnt bothered to look for the most likely position of the russian equipment although hed shaken his head to stop the horrified lawyer bursting out aloud at the conditions inside lefortovo while theyd waited for vera to be brought to them if the standard fisheyelensed camera was mounted somewhere in the overhead light surround which was normal the warning would probably have been picked up it was a starkly functional room entirely bare except for the center table and three stiffbacked wooden chairs the door was metal with a circular peephole there was a summoning button set into the wall it was strangely almost disconcertingly quiet as if the room had been soundproofed against either internal or external noise there was a prison smell thoughurine sour food unwashed bodies decayto which charlie thought vera was probably contributing tell us about george prompted charlie he had to guard against showing he knew of olga melniks first abortive interview or of the possibly improved second which natalia had shown him the previous evening with other material the russian investigator had not so far made available it was going to be interesting to see how adept a questioner anne abbott turned out to be vera bendalls pentup denials of anything her son had plannedor done came in a babbled rush of protested innocence and uncaring admission of a totally dysfunctional relationship between mother and son but virtually everything shed told olga melnik was included the regular tuesday and thursday routine emerged in answer to a question from anne how did you feel about being in russia explored charlie gently did you hate it as much as george not as much but you didnt like it ive adjusted after all this time no alternative you were a schoolteacher in england remembered charlie from the english records yes were you forced to quit after peter defected no why did you follow peter came in anne i was his wife it was my duty he abandoned you you and george persisted the other woman there was the familiar listless shrug i thought it was the right thing to do george was only five picked up charlie would sasha hate being uprooted from russia if the need ever arose not quite four and a half so he knew virtually nothing of england had no comparison against life here vera frowned considering the question thats right why did he grow up to hate it said anne following charlies direction the faded woman didnt answer at once peter and i i suppose i dont understand said charlie we didnt get on after i came here argued a lot about how much better it would have been if i hadnt come i was close to george then not like it was later he used to take my side thats how it always seemed to be how i remember it george and me against peter every day she trailed off seemingly in bitter memories there were stories suggestions in england that peter wanted to return i wanted to with george what about peter maybe im not sure why didnt you and george go back they wouldnt let us they charlie was dominating the questioning now anne silent beside him the people peter worked for the kgb yes charlies bunchedup feet twitched hed spent more than an hour the previous night hunched over the recorder natalia had protectively carried inand outof the lubyanka as surprised as she had been not just at getting past the reception area without being searchedprepared to insist upon the authority of the acting presidentbut also that spasskys office hadnt been equipped with a white noise baffler to prevent tapes unknowingly being made his instinctas well as another foot spasmtold him the gaps in peter bendalls kgb files hadnt occurred accidentally did peter tell you that you couldnt go back to england or was it one of the russians he worked for peter charlie instantly recognized the hesitation in her voice he had to tiptoe an inch at a time only ever peter as i told the russian detective colonel sometimes in the last few years peter worked from home at hutorskaya ulitza the arguments got really bad around that time that was when george was sixteen or seventeen he said he didnt believe what peter was saying and that he was keeping us prisoner once one of the people who came to see peter took george into the room with them she looked at the water carafe alongside the tape and unasked charlie poured for her did george tell you what went on in the room he said the man told him there were things he had to do but that he wouldnt do them what things he didnt tell me didnt you ask him no charlie felt a burn of frustration at vera bendalls constant lookaway acceptance of everything and anything that happened to her what did he say he said he wasnt weak like peter that they were going to be surprised peter had been in the room persisted charlie yes so he would have heard whatever it was i suppose didnt you ask him said anne he said it was none of my business that it was too late and that if i hadnt wanted to be here i shouldnt have followed him would this be how his relationship with natalia would finallyso disastrouslyimplode if she took sasha away from russia to live with him somewhere in the west charlie wondered again no he decided just as quickly the circumstances were far too different for there to be any conceivable comparison did george accept it the fatalistic shrug came again that was when the trouble started what trouble asked the lawyer not going to classes the beginning of the drinking he was in an accident in a stolen car he wasnt charged with the theft because he couldnt drive he started to use the russian name around that time insisted i call him georgi used a russian name but didnt like russia queried charlie despite already knowing the answer it was a logical question the eavesdroppers would expect to be asked he said he didnt want to be known as george bendall anymore the behavior began suddenly pressed anne as i remember it you must have thought about it the reason i mean vera smiled faintly i did i think in some silly way he thoughtif he misbehaved badly enough hed get thrown out expelled from the country did you challenge him about it not directly i think i said once that it wouldnt work that hed just end up with a criminal record he said he didnt know what i was talking about that he didnt care anyway was there any more contact between him and the kgb people who came to hutorskaya ulitza she nodded the same man came back peter didnt go into the room with them this time then others came and took him to a psychiatrist and for a while he got better although he started to spend a lot of time away not bothering to come home i mean who was the psychiatrist vera i never knew but you knew he was seeing a psychiatrist peter told me he said it was best that id given birth to an idiot and that it was my fault did george continue behaving himself i dont know he would have been about eighteen then he joined the army after that we hardly saw him at all charlie went to speak but suddenly remembered he wasnt supposed to know about the mans military record how long was he in the army a long time he didnt contact meit was always me never ever peterfor years at a time two years was the longest i dont believe he wrote more than ten letters the whole time when he did it was to ask for money for a long time towards the end i thought he was probably dead then there was a letter from a prison in odessa he said he was being kicked out of the army one day he just turned up was peter still alive yes what did he say accepted it he wasnt well by then did the kgb still come hardly ever did george ever meet any of the kgb people again after coming out of the army i dont remember what work did he do after he came out of the army he didnt not for a long time how could he pay you to live at hutorskaya ulitza asked anne he didnt he was still drinking worse than ever after the army every day all day did you give him the money to buy it the woman shook her head positively there wasnt any not for drink after peter died all i got was a rubleamonth pension she could count it to the last kopek thought charlie less than sixteen pounds a month how did he get money to drink stealing he used to go out to sheremetyevo and steal suitcases from tourists and the same at the railway stations at the kiev and kazan departure terminals and at the central passenger bureau at komsomolskaya there was always a lot of western things at the apartment i asked him not to because if he got caught wed be thrown out of the apartment she briefly trapped her lower lip between her teeth again thatll definitely happen now wont it the detective colonel said it could i dont know admitted charlie who thought it probably would hurriedly he went on did he stop she nodded just under a years ago when he started work at the television station how did that happen i never knew how or why it happened but george stopped stealing ever so suddenly it was a long time before he told me he was seeing a doctor a friend who was helping him i dont remember his name but i know youll want to know it ill try ill really try what about the job he said hed met someone whod helped him i thought it might be the doctor charlie felt a flare of hope dont rush he cautioned himself was he still drinking heavily i dont know about at work certainly at home there were always bottles what did he earn i dont know it should be easy enough to find out from the station but it was certainly enough to keep bottles at home it seemed to be who was the person hed met who helped him get the job he never told me do you think it could have been the person he went out to meet on tuesdays and thursdays perhaps stayed with on the times he didnt come home asked anne it could have been do you think this person worked at the tv stations too it would have made sense wouldnt it was it a man or a woman i dont know he didnt have girlfriends it would most likely have been a man i think what were the names of the people who came from the kgb to see peter they didnt have names not names that they were introduced by peter never told me not ever demanded charlie disbelievingly not ever what about peters papers after he died said charlie asking the question as it came to him did peter keep a diary a journal letters a diary and other things he was always writing charlie was aware of anne stirring beside him he said what happened to it taken said vera shortly the day he died people came they had security bureau identification they collected up everything and said it would be returned when theyd finished with it was it no did you have the name of anyone to call to ask no have you asked for peters things back i didnt want to upset anyone i wouldnt be able to get another apartment i cant survive without the pension did george keep a diary have things written down maybe he didnt let me go into his room the militia searched the apartment when they came brought me here i dont know what they took no ones told me natalia hadnt mentioned anything about george bendalls personal property taken from the apartment olga melnik certainly hadnt either ill find out promised charlie get me out of here please the old woman suddenly blurted i havent done anything wrong im in a cell theres no toilet nowhere to wash i will promised the lawyer you shouldnt be kept like this charlie wished anne hadnt been so positive now can i come with you now itll have to be an official release i have to arrange it said the lawyer the older womans face crumpled i dont know what else to tell you what else i can do i dont know anything that will help i will do everything i can as quickly as i can said anne vera bendalls lips quivered and her eyes flooded dont abandon me please dont do that we wont assured the lawyer anne abbott held back until they stepped through the prison gates as they did she breathed out theatrically and said jesus christ i dont think ive ever been in such a terrifying place in my life thats what its supposed to be said charlie you really believe there was a tape recording being made of us and a film jesus repeated the woman welcome to russia theres no justification for her being there no agreed charlie do you think sir michael would agree to her being held somewhere within the embassy charlie looked sideways in disbelief at the woman i wouldnt think so for a minute shes british the wife of a defecting spyafter whom she fledand the mother of a murderer vera bendalls going to be kept at the end of a very long barge pole reminded charlie the ambassadorand londonwill want as little to do with her as possible so much for compassion so much for hard assed political reality weve got to find somewhere better than that place good luck how do you think it went overall she didnt yet know all that he did and he couldnt tell her charlie realized overall we managed to raise more questions than weve got answers for and there were more he still had to ask thats what i think i also think we made a pretty good team she had asked all the right questions charlie acknowledged could be even better with practice in fact i was going to suggest buying you a celebration drink but ive decided helping vera bendall has higher priority lets take a rain check agreed charlie stealing an hour drinking with anne abbott would have been very pleasant but he supposed he had higher priorities too it is bad isnt it worse than youve told me anandale looked down at his wife one side of her body embalmed beneath her protective tunnel theyd been married for twentytwo yearshappily so despite his resisted temptationsand in their personal life hed always levelled with her as she had with him the nerves in your arm have been damaged is that why i cant feel it her hair had been lightly brushed and her face washed properly not with an unguent so that it didnt shine anymore but her pallor was still drained a deathly white there was a saline as well as a plasma drip into her uninjured arm yes will i get the feeling back theres going to need to be treatment weve already got the specialists lined up for when we get back what sort of treatment reconnecting the nerves the bullet smashed them yes what happens if they cant be reconnected were going to the best people in the world to ensure that they can be what if they cant demanded ruth anandale with the persistence of the criminal lawyer shed been before their marriage anandale hesitated swallowing then it will be permanent no feeling at all no no use then no ruth anandale didnt cry her face creased once as if there had been a spurt of pain but then she lay expressionless although not looking at him i broke my leg skating when i was a kid about twelve i guess even then all i could think about in the hospital was that it would be stiff when it got fixed so that id have to limpdrag it maybefor the rest of my life i promise itll be fixed youll have to help me walt help me a lot i dont want a body that doesnt work right look right we wont give up until we get it fixed no agreed ruth we wont the russian foreign ministry is within walking distance of the american embassy which was how wendall north and the us secretary of state finally completed their journey because smolenkaja sennaja ploscad was gridlocked the two russians were waiting in boris petrins office actually overlooking the trafficclogged highway when north began to apologize for their lateness the foreign minister said we saw you from the window its a perpetual problem the floor to ceiling windows were double glazed smotheringany outside noise but petrin still led them deeper into the cavernous room to where easy chairs and couches were arranged around a dead fireplace there was an oasis of bottled mineral water and glasses in the middle of a low glasstopped table the americans took the seats toward which the minister gestured and sat waiting trishin said we want formally to express our condolences about your dead security man local television had been dominated by footage of the coffin being loaded aboard the plane at sheremetyevo north nodded but didnt speak neither did james scamell petrin said i am glad you agreed there was no need for advisers or a secretariat the two americans remained silent politically weve got to move forward now said the russian chief of staff im sure you agree with us on that too im not clear what positive movement there can be in the circumstances said scamell at last the treaty was ready to be finalized insisted petrin it had reached the final discussion stage qualified the secretary of state easily resolvable points argued petrin thats not our interpretation said north your elected president is alive but incapacitated and aleksandr mikhailevich okulov is the legally acting president empowered to make and take all presidential decisions under the conventions of the russian constitution interrupted trishin formally pending elections also required under your constitution in the event of that incapacity becoming permanent or the death of the legally incumbent president finished the equally wellrehearsed north just as formally the pending elections are not specially convened fought trishin they were already scheduled a circumstance of convenience dismissed scamall briefed by the american embassys constitutional lawyer our advice is that it would be legally unsafeas well as unfittingly hasty on the part of both sidesto consider any formal signing in advance of that election there was a visible stiffening from the two russians what do you consider appropriate demanded trishin tightly a joint statement regretting whats happened with the hope that those still surviving make a full recovery and an assurance that the incident in no way endangers the treaty negotiations which will continue recited scamell to defeat the kommunisticheskaja partiya rossiiskoi federalsii there has to be a signed treaty insisted petrin thats been our understandingour agreementfrom the beginning i can continue coming here during the lead up to the elections offered scamell there will only be one obvious inference that the treaty will be agreed with us but not with the communists completed trishin the scenario was norths and as he sat listening to it being spelled out he congratulated himself upon how well it suited both sides although to a greater advantage to america than to russia we are disappointed understated petrin nothing is being withdrawn insisted north things are merely being postponed which they should be what about the joint statement queried trishin which must be a joint statement north said heavily and at once strictly agreed between us with no premature unexpected announcements i am giving you the american undertaking here and now that there will not be anything independent from us petrin and the russian chief of staff looked pointedly between each other trishin said i believe we see the point if it is to be a joint statement carrying the authority of both leaders it should be made personally not issued through spokesmen demanded petrin wed consider that essential theres the question of security north tried but petrin overrode him there is no question of security the man looked around the huge office empty but for them as a reminder that it was an unattributable meeting completing the unspoken threat he said a personal statement by your president and aleksandr mikhailevich would totally guarantee no premature illjudged comments dont you agree john kayley was already waiting in the small conference room adjoining olga melniks suite when charlie arrived at militia headquarters for once the american wasnt fumigating the place with his cigar smoke which was a welcomed relief as he passed over the transcripts of that mornings meeting with vera bendall charlie said ive included copy tapes as well there was a stonefaced headnod of acceptance from the american which charlie interpreted to be continued annoyance at his refusal to let the man in on the interview and thought fuck you too how did it go asked olga whod already listened to her own eavesdropped recording and seen on film charlies warning head shake to the woman whod gone with him to lefortovo one or two interesting points suggested charlie time to start work then she said briskly exactly seized kayley and this isnt the place or the way charlie looked at the other man in open surprise surely yesterdays rancor couldnt have remained as strong as this olga just as quickly discerned the americans irritation hoping shed succeeded in making the englishman its focus charlie said youve obviously got a point to make an obvious one declared the american maybe the three of us can get on well enough together maybe not none of us know yet but passing around packages like this is ridiculous we need a centralized operation an incident room with trained officers indexing and correlating everything computers telephones access to forensic facilities somewhere from which we can all work together be together yesterday all those facilities were flown in from america and have already been set up in a basement at the us embassy its from there that i am going to head up the american side of the investigation an american side which will be fully exchanged with both of you but what im suggestinginvitingis for both of you to join me there have all your stuff filed there itll happen anyway under the sharing agreement but itll be in three different locations with no necessary centralization this shooting is almost fortyeight hours old and we havent got a damned thing properly off the ground yet he looked at olga smiling at last thats not acriticism of anything youve done but look he swept his hand towards the pile of dossiers in front of charlie he hasnt had the opportunity to look at any of that yet he had to bulldoze them be even more insistent if necessary paul smith had made it a clear ultimatum when hed spoken to the fbi director that morning he had twentyfour hours to get everything on american terms under american control or he caught the direct washington flight home the following night charlie had recognized kayleys point long before the american had got to it his mind way beyond what the man was saying the arrangement would suit him perfectly through natalia he had virtually open access to the russian investigation and if he had entree to the american facility he was confident he could discover whatever he wanted or needed even if they didnt want him to now it was olga who was stonefaced you established all that without telling meuswhat you intended in advance its the way im working the american part of the investigation repeated kayley im inviting you both in to be part of it like were supposed to be all part of the same thing what do you say charlie yet again charlies mind was way ahead less than twentyfour hours earlier olga had been trying to drive a wedge between him and the american how quickly what goes around comes around i think its a good idea it is after all what were supposed to be doing all those facilities exist here insisted olga charlie was with him which put her in the inferior bargaining position calculated kayley you dont want to come aboard thats your decision charlie and i will operate out of novinskii bulvar liaise and share everything with you from there not perfect but better than what were doing at the moment she couldnt let it happen theyd combine against her cut her out its a resolve to an operational difficulty im prepared to give it a trial if for any reason it doesnt prove functional well have to come to some other arrangement sure we will smiled kayley allowing olga her escape won he thought youre right agreed natalia looking up from the transcript of charlies interview with vera bendall it throws up a lot of questions most of which i didnt follow through conceded charlie selfcritically the day had continued unexpectedly but in charlies opinion far more productively than hed anticipated kayley had used the fact that charlie supposedly had to catch up with the newly produced informationas they did from his interview with vera bendallto argue their first american embassy assessment should be postponed until the following morning and charlie had gone along with it because the russian forensic material the incomplete kgb dossier and the preliminary medical report upon george bendall were new although then he couldnt have guessed how important he would judge one of them to be when are you going to see her again directly after the us embassy meeting ill fix it there with olga you really think the embassy arrangements will be practical between us were covered from two sides ill take my chances getting what i want from america at the moment all he wanted was one specific statistic from anyone else it would have sounded arrogant but from charlie it didnt thought natalia if only her professional trust could cross over to their personal situation you think from what vera bendall said the kgb were using himhad a use for him charlie shook his head it could be but it doesnt fit you were kgb can you imagine them taking on someone like george bendall i wasnt operational reminded natalia he could have had his uses because he was unpredictable two other things that dont fit itemized charlie how does a drunken unpredictable misfit like george bendall who made a living robbing tourists suddenly getand holda job in a tv studio any job for that matter i was going to ask you that i dont know try the second george bendall retained british nationality how did he get accepted into the russian army at the time the russian army was made up of conscripts and volunteers from fifteen republics of the soviet union the united kingdom wasnt one of them you think its linked to what vera bendall said about the kgb the glavnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravleniye is military intelligence reminded charlie what influence would the kgb have had enough to get him in if theyd wanted charlie hesitated at the direct question but decided things were sufficiently relaxed between them now did the instruction come from your ministry for olga to tell kayley and i that things were missing from peter bendalls dossier there was no hesitation from natalia no she said at once it didnt come from the control group either so its got to be internal militia blame apportioning it was an essential part of their selfimposed personal security that each had their own independent telephone line into the lesnaya apartment natalia rose hurriedly at the recognizable ring of hers anxious that it wouldnt wake sasha natalias was the shortest end of the conversation and she spoke with her back to him so charlie only picked up isolated words she remained by the telephone after replacing it turning to him george bendalls recovered consciousness and the guards at lefortovo found his mothers body an hour ago they didnt take her bra away after shed spoken with you she hanged herself with it for once in her life vera bendall hadnt looked away accepting everything and anything thought charlie from the upper stairway platform on to which he emerged from the lift charlie had an elevated overview of the abruptly converted us embassy basement and decided that all the stories hed ever heard of plots of quicksand being turned overnight into fully carpeted kitchengimmicked american estates of barbered lawns helicopter emplaced matured trees and individual boat docks on canals really were true after all he was gazing down into a plasterboarded and sectioned beehive of criminal investigation complete with its buzzing inhabitants of drones and worker bees at its very center was the incident room itself seried by mostly already occupied desks each with their own individual screen flickering computer telephone and individually dedicated fascimile terminal at one end dominated by a raised dais and a cleared desk larger than the others were two only miniature electronic viewing screens flanked by four trestlemounted static boards and at the opposing end a gantried projection camera linked by an open corridor was what charlie recognized to be a mobile forensic laboratory it was bisected by two long metaltopped bencheseach broken by suctionfitted sinksupon which were mounted three more computers there were four obvious although elaborate microscopes each with two separate but comparisoncapable viewing bases and four pieces of mysterious electronic machinery on its own table quite alone was a large bellowmiddled piece of equipment which charlie guessed to be a camera but wasnt sure a third corridorconnected separation had a inner battlement of gray filing cabinets in the very middle of which was a triptych of cornertocorner archival computers their screens already filling with type being entered by hunched operators encircling everything was an appropriate honeycomb of individual outer rooms each again with its momentarily deadeyed computerfiling cabinet telephone and fax machine each had access to the inner communal area through a door the entire unroofed complex was whitely illuminated by a sky of fluorescent tubing and lifted from the basement concrete by an artificial wooden flooralready covered by sounddeadening carpetbeneath which was concealed what charlie calculated to be literally miles of operating cable and wiring like the wrongly sexed but omnipotent queen bee hed clearly appointed himself to be john kayley stood in the main room expansive buttock perched on the large command desk charlie was surprised to see olga melnik beside the american hed expected her to be at george bendalls bedside in which order would she choose to tell him they both looked up at charlies entry and kayley waved gesturing him down charlie was conscious of briefly becoming the focus of everyone in the main room as he descended into it and supposed olga had been earlier even though there were no forgotten shirtbuttons today there wasnt in fact a shirt the business suit came right up to her neck maostyle as he got within hearing kayley said what do you think charlie said i liked it in the movie kayley allowed himself a tight smile this isnt makebelieve i hope it isnt said charlie kayleys smile went vera bendalls dead the sons come round the words collided almost comically in olgas eagerness to get them out charlie allowed the apparent surprise dead how hanged herself with underwear that was returned to her for your visit it was a poor attempt to spread blame why wasnt it taken away afterwards it was a mistake conceded olga should he hit them this early the suspicion was justified particularly in view of the incomplete kgb file and hed forewarned natalia for her to be ready did she hang herself her neck didnt break if thats what you mean she suffocated choked to death said olga that wasnt what i meant said charlie under whose administration does lefortovo come militia or fsb jesus said kayley understanding olga did too the fsb she said flatly it was a suggestion she had to pass on as quickly as possible to leonid zenin the crisis committee were meeting that morning charlie said she was officially accorded embassy recognition wed like a copy of the autopsy report and for that autopsy to be as detailed as possible olga wasnt sure a postmortem was planned one certainly had to be carried out now of course i listened to your meeting with her read it too said kayley she was upset being kept there suicidally so demanded charlie the american shrugged who knows charlie talked looking around the prefabricated installation in apparent admiration wondering how long it would take him to find what he wanted if indeed it was here to be found and then how to proceed he was still working more from instinct than fact the russian forensic photographs were inconclusive and by themselves were insufficient it was inevitable he supposed that the russians would take offense at the questions that had to be asked others were necessary first or were they was he workingplanning to workfor the possible benefit of george bendall or to prove wrong experts whod dismissed what hed been so sure of wasnt it paranoia in fact to imagine he had to behave like this at all saying nothing until he was sure in the belief he might prevent the convenient evidence of an open and shut case being tampered with as the old kgb files in his opinion had clearly been tampered with the selfdoubt surprised charlie but it wasnt just selfdoubt it extended as always to natalia if his instincts were only half right she risked being caught up in open organizational warfare even she hadnt positively accused him of exaggeration but he knew thats what she was thinking having warnings heaped upon her without having them fully explained it was important charlie had determined for natalia to reach the conclusions for herself without prejudging by having his opinions thrust upon her which didntanswer his immediate uncertainty follow the tried and tested instinct he told himself what about bendall can he be interviewed the recoverys intermittent said olga im going back to the hospital this afternoon youve already seen him he wasnt aware of me aware of anything didnt respond to anything i said there was no hurry for them to see the man charlie decided he was aware of olga moving from foot to foot as if she was impatient to be somewhere else he was probably more impatient for other reasons he looked around the room again so whats the setup heads up everybody kayley called meetthefolks time the tour of the installation was conducted with the pride of a man showing off a new house to most the acknowledgement was smiles and head nods although the scientist controlling the forensic section and the man in charge of archives were introduced by name the circuit finished at the side offices surrounding the main room where two adjoining annexes were specifically set aside for charlie and olga and im right behind you declared the american indicating the office directly after charlies i bet you are thought charlie very huggermugger you going to need any help with the computers kayley asked solicitously if i do ill ask said charlie all access would be monitored so would telephone calls the rooms were glasssided too it was very definitely going to be a goldfish bowl experience olga was still shifting from foot to foot time to resolve both their impatience he thought everything already logged just finishing off programming the witnesses statements said kayley then were totally up to date pressed charlie everything available to be accessed kayley was immediately attentive unless youve got something additional charlie shook his head or have something specific in mind persisted the american no said charlie he smiled guess id better familiarize myself it was impressive there was no dust or debris from the hasty constructionrather there was the discernible and pleasant smell of the perfumed polish that had removed anyand in a corner beside his supposedly personal cabinet the operating lights of an air purifier glowed although there was no noise the answer to a prayer and kayleys cigars thought charlie the desk appeared to be genuine wood although it probably wasnt and the side table upon which the computer was mounted had an angled padded rest upon which charlie at once and gratefully eased his never comfortable feet it was ibm hardware predictably operating the latestand samemicrosoft word program installed on his machine at the british embassy charlie checked the drawers for backup disks but couldnt find any and was unsurprised that he wasnt expectedor intendedto download anything to take away as he took off his jacketfor which a convenient hanger was waiting on the coat pedestalhe saw olga melnik talking animatedly into the telephone in her adjoining office mindful of his earlier expectation of any access being monitored charlie did not immediately boot up what he was most interested in but instead scrolled through the witnesses statements already on disk until he found that of vladimir petrovich sakov the tattooed cameraman who had wrestled with george bendall for possession of the snipers rifle it was the russian transcript produced the previous day by olga melnik with no additions from a second fbi interview which meant the bureau either hadnt botheredwhich charlie didnt believeor didnt intend a meeting of their own which he thought even more unlikely the third possibility was that they hadnt got around to updating it despite kayleys assurances that everything was logged he didnt need the reminder but he pulled up the verbatim record of his own encounter with vera bendall scrolling through the stumbling words again there were no additionsnor explanations for the obvious questionscrossreferenced from russian sources charlie felt an instant stir of excitementa positive throb in hisleft foot which was always the most sensitiveat the visual ballistic images of the bullets that shattered the shoulder of the american first lady and caused the death of secret serviceman ben jennings they were mounted against calibrated measuring grids in exactly the same way as the russian evidence photographs hed already studied of those extracted from the russian president and his bodyguard and which charlie had brought with him charlie looked around through his glasspartitioned cell in feigned casualness olga was now engrossed in her own screen john kayleys room behind was empty no one else appeared to be paying any attention to him whatsoever he clicked on print shielding the screen by lifting his briefcase on to his lap to take out what hed brought from protocnyj pereulok the comparison only took charlie seconds he didnt even bother to take the russian pictures fully from his briefcase instead putting into it what he was now convinced to be the confirming printout of the american evidence he closed the image of the bullets clearing his screen to call up the ballistics menu what he wantedhoped forwasnt there as it hadnt been in what olga melnik had given him charlie pushed his chair back although not far enough to lose the foot rest how to do it so far the interference had been to kgb archives and possibly with papers belonging to both father and son which had according to vera bendall been removed from the hutorskaya ulitza apartment by intelligence and militia officers the challengea positive confrontationwas inevitable and essentially it had to be in front of witnesses to prevent anything else going missing why didnt he wait persuade natalia to guarantee that the complete russian ballistic evidence be made available because it drew her too closelytoo dangerouslyinto the active operational working of the investigation which didnt fitwasnt part of her remit and which from what hed just studied and compared definitely was going to become more difficult would the actual physical american evidence still be here along the corridor or already back in washington certainly something to discover slowly not wanting to attract olgas attention charlie stood stretched and made his way out into the main room smiling back at the few who looked up and smiled at him he still couldnt seekayley he sauntered past the unoccupied command area into the forensic linking corridor hands deep in his pockets a man orientating himself to new and unaccustomed surroundings the forensic controllerbill savage charlie remembered easilysaw him approaching and rose to meet him as charlie emerged from the tunnel hows it going there was no heavy stateidentifiable accent baldnessand the greyness in a compensating beardmade the man look older than he was good finally to be working in something of an organized system pretty unusual situation all the way round agreed the man hows it with you truth to tell were kinda underemployed admitted the scientist russians havent given you the rifle or the recovered bullets then anticipated charlie looking beyond the american charlie saw that two of the other four men in the improvised room were reading magazines and the other two appeared to be testing or tuning equipment johns asked for it you the ballistics expert the other man shook his head indicating one of the magazine readers willie yings our gun man why charlie began moving taking the controller with him not responding until he got within the experts hearing when he did charlie said loudly it struck me there was something missing from whats on the computer about the bullets the chinese face came up abruptly from behind the magazine it was soldier charlie saw aggressively ying said whats the problem here charlie smiled ingenuously lack of facilities britain being the poor relation as usual neither american smiled back nor spoke charlie said you got the bullets here that were taken from the first lady and ben jennings or have they already been shipped back to washington why demanded ying truculently this is the scene of a crime said savage in a halfanswer maybejust maybethere was a god after all i must have missed it on the computer i couldnt find the grainage could you show me where it is im waiting for the russian exhibits said the ballistics expert i need everything for a proper comparison something i need to know about fuck thought charlie turning at john kayleys voice the fbi supervisor was coming out of the corridor like an elephant frightened of missing the sugar bun picnic perhaps remembering the ancestry buffalo would have been a better analogy than elephant he had to force it on charlie decided risk the humiliation of being labelled the cocky limey smart ass dropping the amiabilityreckoning there might even be an advantage in antagonismcharlie said something we all need to know about as quickly and accurately as possible what demanded savage exasperated you do something for mehave something done for me asked charlie only just according kayley his authority you get willie to weigh the bullets youre holding as evidence what demanded savage again the chinese ballistics expert didnt immediately speak then he said i told you i was waiting and why dont wait urged charlie youve seen the photographs ying look enquiringly to his supervisor who said to charlie you got something weigh the bullets insisted charlie ying did so with the impactdistorted metal still encased in its plastic exhibit envelopes the minuscule weight of which was known and easily subtracted to achieve the reading he repeated the simple experiment three times before looking up directly at charlie the american said i wont offer it as empirical until ive tested what the russians have i wouldnt expect you to said charlie as satisfied relief flooded through him but its quite impossible for those two bullets to have been fired from the same rifle isnt it yes conceded the chinese quietly there had been no prior indication that it would be a smaller gathering but natalia decided that despite charlies illexplained insistences she had no positive personal problem and from the previous evenings rehearsal she was quite confident she was totally prepared for anything that might arise the only unexpected although quickly understood absence was that of general lev lvov whose function was now to protect acting president aleksandr okulov the other absentee in the nuance and rumorfuelled hothouse of moscow political uncertainty it isolated general dimitri spassky as the man responsible for the security debacle which spassky had already and very obviously recognized the ashtray in front of the man was overflowing and the hand with which he lighted the continual replacements was more visibly shaking than usual there is some encouraging news announced yuri trishin the president has recovered consciousness the latest from the pirogov doctors is that his condition is stable and that he is out of immediate danger although still critical encouraging indeed great news hurriedly coughed spassky anxious to have his name first on record the impatience of the presidential chief of staff for natalia and the fourth member of the group militia commandant leonid zenin dutifully to respond was almost palpable and as soon as they had trishin said so whats encouraging for me to hear in return nothing conceded natalia accepting it was a question posed to her according to the lefortovo prison authorities she said there was nothing to suggest vera bendall had been likely to take her own life although that did not excuse the oversight of not removing articles of clothing with which she could do herself harm it was hoped to interview george bendall later that day the investigation had been centralized at the american embassy ruth anandale continued to improve although the indications were that she had permanently lost the use of her right arm a decision was being made in the next twentyfour hours whether to amputate the leg of feliks vasilevich ivanov the russian security guard injured in the shooting the likelihood was that it would be necessary natalia hesitated as she came to the end everything on yourterms to your orchestration charlie had lectured dont let anyone else get their explanations or excuses in ahead of you spassky had to be first unless there has been a discovery in the last two or three hours that dimitri ivanovich has not shared with me there is the risk of considerable embarrassment substantial sections of former intelligence files containing information that could be important to this investigation remain missing she turned to the militia commandant i also understand from taped meetings involving senior investigating colonel olga melnik that the american and british investigators are aware of whats happened it was zenin who got in first i am not aware of the americans or british being told if they have been i can only assume it emerged in answer to her being asked why the material was incomplete spassky was quick to follow surprisingly strong voiced in the chosen denial i am not nor ever was directly or personally responsible for archives you are head of counterintelligenceinternal securitywithin lubyanka challenged natalia exactly we are talking of departmental mismanagement are we demanded natalia i dont think we are are archives definitely missing asked trishin yes finally admitted the old man natalia didnt want the impetus taken away from her deliberately taken i have no evidence of deliberate interference insisted spassky has a thorough search been made pressed natalia yes said spassky again isnt it an unfortunate coincidence that vera bendall died in custody in a prison administered by the fsb leapt in zenin i suggest that the most thorough independent enquiry be held so charlie had planted his suspicion in time for some contact between olga melnik and leonid zenin natalias realization was fleeting quickly replaced by near incredulity at what zenin had just proposed the militia commandant was actually pressing for the russian intelligence service to be investigated by an outside organization which was unthinkable even the supposed enquiry into the failed kgbsupported coup against mikhail gorbachov in had been a strictly controlled internal tribunal natalias awareness continued worryingly was this what charlie had anticipated and really been preparing her for a collision of nuclear proportions between russian intelligence and presumably russian civilian police with herself inevitablymore inextricably than shed ever fearedcaught up in the middle and she would be literally trapped in the middle a former kgb executive now a department director of the interior ministry with ultimate authority over the militia the same analysisalthough not necessarily in the same personal orderhad obviously been made by the men in the kremlin office with her spasskys reaction was such openmouthed disbelief that all he could initially utter was what so weakvoiced that he said it again in louder outrage what trishin was no less surprised but more controlled youre virtually making an open accusation surely thought natalia the civilian commandant did not for a moment imagine the militia strong enoughable enoughto confront an intelligence apparatus developed over more than seventy years i believe the gravity of whats happened demands a thorough enquiry insisted zenin i understand too that also to be the feeling of the americans and the british natalia was immediately intently alert charlie hadnt given her any indication of that but then he hadnt properlyfullyexplained all the guidance hed given and zenin had clearly spoken to olga melnik at the american embassy bringing him more up to date than she was what reason do you have for saying that the impression of my officers in direct contact with their investigators impressions isolated natalia there was only one officer olga ivanova melnik the militia chief was railroading the woman was in militia not fsb custody at lefortova said spassky inadequately precisely why i think an enquiry justified argued zenin i do not want any innuendoany innuendo whatsoeverdirected at my service was it as simple as that not an attack at all but simply a defense in advance of any accusation natalia said by whom or what do you consider such an investigation should be conducted what else but a presidential commission said zenin a neat sidestep from direct confrontation natalia recognized the unbelievable challenge had been laid but zenin had separated himself from directly pursuing it i think said trishin that this suggestion needs to be considered discussed with others dimitri ivanovich spasskys hand was shaking very badly when he lit his new cigarette like practically everything in charlie muffins upwardly and onwardly mobile philosophy the vindication was relegated to his mental trophy shelf for later burnishingwhich none ever werewhile he hurried on which practicably was not immediately possible because the bullets and george bendalls rifle had physicallyand finallyto be transported from the militia forensic laboratories in the faraway moscow outskirts of chagino there was coffee and separate reflection in their respective offices while they waited from his charlie saw both olga and kayley in gesticulating telephone exchanges but decided against calling his own embassy there was no time difference urgency having satisfactorily proved his suspicions from a partial test he now wanted the complete ballistics analysis before fittingly lobbing the bombshell into londons lap which wasnt at that precise moment his most pressing concern they now had unquestionably two gunmen from which a neonlit flagwaving conspiracy emerged which jigsawed with missing kgb archives and the death in custody of a potential witness whod remembered the official removal of more papers and belongingsincluding those of the one seized gunmanthat had not been mentioned in anything that colonel olga melnik had provided but far more importantly were not known about by natalia whom hed specifically asked the previous night which as muddied waters went was thicker than pea soup a mixed metaphor that charlie was content with because it was so appropriate there was something approaching a familiar comfort at being confronted by a situationtotally different from that with which hed begun in charlies life the obvious had never if ever turned out to be obvious olgas sudden activity in the adjoining office alerted him to the arrival of the material evidence which kayley escorted her to the embassy reception area officially to receive it was obvious that virtually everyone in the complex knew of a development if not precisely what it was but kayley limited the audience in the forensic section to its specific staff himself olga and charlie the muchfilmed rifle as well as the medicallyrecovered bullets made up the russian package but willie yings concentration was again upon the distorted metal the tests were as straightforward as those earlier quadruple checked within thirty minutes the chinese straightened finally and said there isnt any possible doubt kayley said i need to have this spelled out nice and easy ive got a lot of curious people to tell ying looked invitingly at charlie who said youre the expert the chinese scientist said western european and central european bullets are officially weighed in grains quite literally the measurement is the average weight of a seed of corn one seventhousandth of an avoirdupoidal pound he indicated the still unexamined snipers rifle thats the sovietnow russianmilitary svd the dragunov it fires a mm cartridge the bullets from which weigh grains the commercial version of the svd known as the medved fires a mm sporting cartridge that weighs grains it is technically impossible for the snipers rifle recovered from the scene of the crime to fire mm bullets he turned to the table picking up two glassine sachets these are mm according to their exhibit tags one was taken from the russian guard feliks ivanov the other killed our guy ben jennings ying swopped plastic envelopes all these threethe two that hit the russian president and the one that injured the first ladyare mm they were fired from a gun we dont have by someone we dont know completed charlie now lets talk about other things we dont have either we talking dallas texas november demanded walter anandale emptyvoiced in disbelief theres unquestionably another gunman logically a group said kayley it had only taken five minutes for him to come up from the basement and for wendall north and james scamell to be summoned to cornell burtons embassy office the ambassador sat to one side weve got to get out of here decided the president get ruth out of here ill get on to donnington right away tell him the situations changed said north moving towards the desk phones wait ordered anandale lets talk this through you think this whole godamned things been a set up right from the beginning no cautioned scamell what i do think is that quite early on once we started to negotiate people saw an opportunityfor what exactly i dont knowand began to plan what people whose people demanded the texan yudkins or the communists or okulov who for christs sake the secretary of state shrugged helplessly turning to the fbi rezident i cant help there sir not yet nor can i said kayley anandale turned back to his chief of staff we dont make any more public appearances i dont personally meet okulov or anyone connected with yudkin we time a spokesmanissued statement about the hope to continue negotiations an hour after were airborne on our way to washington everyone clear on that clear echoed wendall north anandale came back to the fbi man you did good john ill remember that make sure that the director knows it too so charlie was right declared sir rupert dean he spoke looking at his criticizing deputy jocelyn hamilton remained silent a copy of charlies moscow fax lay before each of the control group the bullet that killed the american still came from george bendallsrifle professionally pointed out jeremy simpson the legal advisor and now bendalls part of a conspiracy said hamilton choosing his time our situations worse not better we dont know what the situation is rejected patrick pacey irritation at the deputy directors constant carping deepened the permanent redness of the mans blood pressured face we know its escalated insisted hamilton we need to start thinkingplanningproactively theres certainly a need to withdraw muffin for consultation conceded dean his spectacles working through his hands and for preparing contingency plans to build up our investigation in moscow insisted hamilton this servicemaybe its futurecould be decided by the outcome of all this since the end of the cold war and the deescalation of violence in northern ireland its been difficult to justify a counterespionage function apart from becoming even more of an antiterrorism force defining an fbi role is still experimental it cant be seen or allowed to fail replace muffin you mean directly accused the heavily moustached simpson safeguard the department and ourselves qualified hamilton olga ivanova melnik felt as if shed been engulfed by a flooded riverthe swollen volga of her gorky birthplace at the start of the march thawswept helplessly along by swirling currents over unseen snagging rocks allor anyof which was totally alien to olga melniks until now carefully structured and even more carefully disasteravoided career she wasnt of course frightened of being sucked down olga melnik wasnt the sort of person to sink beneath the first ripples of uncertainties she just needed a momentarybackwater time briefly to tread water and examineapportion and equateeverything swamping over her olga accepted objectively that she should have anticipated charlie muffins challenges been readier even for the suggestion that vera bendalls death might not have been an accident she shouldnt have needed the difference in the size of the russianrecovered bullets to be pointed out to her either nor been unprepared for the demand about the bullet casings none of which had been found the reason was obvious from the chaos and panic at the scene of the crime there for everyone to see and understand from at least five different television films but she should have offered the explanation instead of having the admission drawn from her but perhaps her greatest embarrassment close to positive humiliation had been having to admit not knowing the whereabouts of any of george bendalls personal papers the initial militia search squadher officers had removed from the hutorskaya ulitza apartment shed heard vera bendalls eavesdropped claim within an hour of the stupid bitch making it and let more than another twentyfour elapse without even asking about it she would have got around to it eventually she reassured herself not eventually almost at once tomorrow certainly how could she have been expected to cover everything the smallest details in such a short time it was easy for the motherfucking englishman getting everything handed to him on a plate not having to supervise an entire investigation and think about each and every political implication those political implicationsevery implicationwere too great properly to encompass now this soon but the escalation made it logical for leonid zenin to share this first interrogation of george bendall but that was all it was the escalation not any inferred criticism of her oversights how could it be the confrontationthe rock jarringly awkward question after awkward question from the motherfucking englishmanin front of the fortunately limited audience in the american embassy basement hadnt been recorded so there was no way zenin could know would ever know but she couldnt be caught out again shouldnt have been caught out at allshed identified charlie muffin forand asthe danger he was from the very beginning a mistake recognized is another mistake avoided she reminded herself calling to mind the appropriate russian proverb she felt firm ground underfoot no longer jostled by conflicting currents she was impatient to begin the interrogation and hoped zenin wasnt late standing close to the window and looking up gospitalnaya ulitza towards the blue domed church of saints peter and paul the direction from which she expected him to come hed sounded pleased excited even during the telephone conversation when hed told her to wait for him and olga was curious about the crisis committee meeting clearly it had gone better for him than hers had for her she almost missed leonid zenin when he did appear because shed been looking for an official car and zenin was on foot striding past the small commemoration to peter the greats favorite general swissborn francois lefort who was never to knowand doubtless wouldnt have liked it if he hadthat his was going to be the name given to one of the most infamous prisons in russian history olga decided that the bearded militia commandant looked even more impressive in civilian clothes than he did in uniform and felt a pleasant stir of interest wondering what the obviously athletic body looked like in neither she was well away from the window to avoid hinting any impatience when zenin came urgently into the dusty waiting room smiling as olga imagined he smiled during their telephone conversation despite the whitecoated nicholai badim beside him zenin said god what a place an incentive never to become ill affronted the surgeonadministrator said heroes of the crimea were treated here probably in beds that havent been changed since said zenin briskly careless of offense whats the situation with the prisoner you can have thirty minutes i wasnt asking for a time limit hes fully conscious yes and fully comprehending according to guerguen semonvich agayan whats bendall said your officers are with him i meant to you hes responded to our medical questions nothing else we havent asked him anything else its about time someone did then the almost overbearing confidence surprised olga in official surroundings only those in which shed been with him until now zenin had always appeared more subdued striving to achieve some of his dismissed authority the doctor said ill check with guerguen semonvich wait for me here zenin said ive come directly from the kremlin okulovs panicking everyones panicking theyve doubled the protection around yudkin many more security people at the pirogov hospital and theyll have to shift patients out to make room he smiled again and theres going to be a presidential commission into the missing kgb stuff i suggested it at this mornings meeting okulov ordered it on the spot when the conspiracy was confirmed the one person weve got to keep alive is george bendall ive permanently doubled the guard here she had to find a way to tell him about the things missing from the bendall apartment nothings going to happen to him believe me said zenin whats it like at the american embassy i dont know about stepped up internal security the american ballistics man claims hed recognized the difference but was waiting for our material whats the excuse from our people at chagino they hadnt got around to it yet after more than two days they obviously thought they didnt have to bother log it for it to be dealt with later i already have is the englishman crowing olga hesitated not noticeably she answered honestly itwould be better if zenin heard the other embarrassments from her he asked about the bullet casings they were looked for of course after the area was cleared we didnt find any would they have been automatically discharged from the rifle apparently we should have recovered some complained zenin further evidence of the conspiracy how well planned its all been she wished that excuse had come to her in the embassy basement yes accepted zenin doubtfully it was an acceptable excuse theres something else you remember vera bendall saying militia officers took away her sons papers among his other belongings yes said zenin cautiously no written material is recorded among what was taken from bendalls apartment ive spoken to the squad that went there first personally to all three of them each insist there werent any documents nothing written down at all the woman could have been wrong zenin pointed out or other people could have got to the apartment before our officers was there any indications of a search ahead of them they said his room was a mess olga replied honestly again it should be laid before the commission agreed zenin home clear decided olga as the doctor reentered the room half an hour stipulated the man well see how long it takes dismissed zenin the walls of the corridor along which they followed the doctor were stained and in places adorned with uncleared graffitifuck and hell hole appeared several timesand narrowed by bed frames once by two ancient boatshaped perambulators and unrecognizable scraps of metal and framelike pieces of wood zenin said this come up from the crimea too the doctor ignored him bendalls ward was identifiable some way off by the phalanx of guards outside it olga said do you want to lead the interrogation youre the investigating officer olga ivanova ill sit and listen the feeling she experienced surprised olga it wasnt unease it was almost sexually of anticipation she didnt normally feel she had to impress a man id appreciate your input if you think its necessary itll be there if it is the protective cordon stiffened respectfully at their approach then parted for them to enter it was an individual ward further crowded inside by three more militia officers recording apparatus was already assembled its operator was late standing when they came into the room the walls were streaked and discolored but there was no graffiti at least none that was apparent the sheets matched the grayness of the blankets though which also toned with the doubtful color of the bandages helmeting george bendalls head and seeming to extend unbroken to the dressings trebling the size of the mans broken shoulder a halfcircular frame kept the bedding off the shattered leg but he was not connected to any monitors although a catheter tube ran to a container beneath the bed there was a perfect spiders web covering the inside of one of the upperpaned windows complete with its spreadlegged creator and rivulets of longpast rain had tracked top to bottom patterns through the caked grime the recording apparatus occupied the only table and its technician had the only chair militiadiscarded cigarettes pebbled the floor the cubicle stank not just of cigarettes but of stale bodies maybe thought olga indulging herself patients from the s really had been here we think thirty minutes said the psychiatrist i think as long as it takes said zenin olga concentrating upon the prisoner saw bendalls eyes darting from person to person when he became aware of her staring at him he abruptly stopped gazing fixedly up at the ceiling she said everyone can go now we need another chair the recording technician looked surprised but then shrugged the doctor said i think i should stay ill stay too announced agayan you wont said olga no agreed zenin neither of you will out well be directly outside insisted badim a chair was chainpassed in from outside by the departing inner squad one of whom cupped the doctors arm zenin took the chair and sat just inside the door olga realized the militia commandant would not have come into bendalls vision the man would believe she was the only personthe only possible interrogatorin the room bendalls virtually unbroken gaze remained fixed upon the ceiling olga glanced up seeing it was as dirty as everything else looking more towards the recording apparatus olga said george bendallalias georgi guginyou are charged with murder and attempted murder there will be other charges officially proffered at a later date bendall smiled turning slightly towards her but you failed olga declared her tone at once sneering the man continued to stare at her unresponsive the person you killed was an american guard youll still get the death sentence nothing and we know there are others they found the perfect idiot in you didnt they that was clever of them a blink a throatclearing swallow the mummified head remained unmoving your mothers dead too she would have suffered poor woman there was a spurt of blinking swallowing a nearly imperceptibleinstantly correctedhead movement towards her the story of your life isnt it georgi always failure failed father failed mother failed son end result total miserable failure how the voice croaked drythroated now it was olga who stayed silent how she allowed her eyes to flick to zenin the man was leaning forward with both arms on his knees but not looking directly at her concentrating entirely upon the words how did she die the crack had been made in the dam it had to be widened from inside not out hanged shouldnt have been hanged hed have lost track of time believed it to be official punishment shed let it go for the moment why not didnt know anything i thought she did no what didnt she know the crack was creaking apart anything about what the muscles stood out on bendalls jaw so tightly did he bite his mouth closed died for nothing then bendall had sealed the crack and she didnt know how to prise it open again nothing she knew you hated everything didnt believe you hated her though after what your father did to her bringing her here fucking bastard another weakness in the wall olga recognized he was the one who should have died not her there was the faintest of sounds from the doorway where zenin shifted in his chair bendall gave no indication of hearing anything should have been him did you want to kill him yes the word hissed out emotion for the first time why didnt you didnt this man was her only hope thought olga the only one who could provide a lead she had to break him trick or tilt the already unbalanced mind however and whichever way she could british consular protests were irrelevant if there was a complaint all she had to concern herself with was getting a russian conviction in a russian court and she could get a confession and evidence any way she liked to achieve that frightened of him were you no it was a shout proper anger of course you were no he jerked his head around to look directly at her for thefirst time wincing at the pain the movement caused was going to kill him died first olga shook her head theatrically disbelievingly why didnt you get the others to do it like they killed your mother it was convoluted but got her to where she wanted to be the eyes upon her noticeably focused clearing what why didnt you get the others in this with you to kill him like they killed your mother repeated olga you said she was hanged not sentenced by a court strangled murdered invented olga she didnt know the denial this time wailed from him they thought she did the court wont believe you didnt know they were going to do that i dont believe you didnt know they were going to do that youll be considered an accomplice no another wail youre right to be frightened not frightened theyll try to kill you if they can not frightened they would kill you if they could he was looking at the ceiling again lips tight together mistaken direction he wasnt rambling either but then why should he mentally deranged people didnt necessarily ramble wrong to have started with that preconception there was sudden noise from the door a muffled voice olga saw the doctor gesticulating from beyond the wall of security men zenin turned at it too making waving away motions with his hand olga went back to the embalmed man the other sniper was a lot better than you georgi should have practiced more no one else the words jolted through olga she was aware of zenin coming further forward on his chair too she said we know there was two different rifles different bullets liar which way to go they couldnt leave it to you knew you werent good enough to do it by yourself not true you think youre a good sniper georgi trained for the first time there was an inflection in the mans voice a whisper of pride olga thought she saw a pathway you killed people before a lot how many a lot when was that in the army did you train every day when you were in the army course i did had to now there was a hint of indignation but youve been out of the army a long time now havent you bendalls face clouded in an effort to understand good sniper he insisted do you still train every day now youre not in the army the smile was knowing crafty maybe you do dont you nothing who with nothing where did you get the rifle the smile remained but he didnt reply did you fire as quickly on wednesday as you did when you trained every day in the army and since im good two shots over eight seconds thats not fast not for a trained marksman less than eight seconds got it with the wrong correction snatched olga triumphantly she actually looked at the slowly revolving tape spool there were five shots georgi not two the other man really did do better than you hit our president twice and the american first lady you were rubbish no one else he wasnt blinking anymore the eyes were positively drooping now we know there was you know it too there was fresh outburst from the corridor outside and olga saw the doctor and the psychiatrist both arguing with the guards outside she distinctly heard enough and protest over the barricading heads and shoulders of bendalls protectors and this time zenin stood up and gestured the two men through badim flustered into the room still protesting and olga snapped off the recording just before he got to outrage zenin blocked the man just inside the door shut up weve stopped hes ok stalins not in the kremlin anymore this isnt a police state you want to prove that enlightened opinion doctor you just go on shouting and yelling and making too much noise ill even give you your own choice of camp at kolyma the professional anger seeped from badim like air from a punctured balloon this man is still officially in intensive care olga saw george bendalls eyes were shut not twitching with feigned sleep the mans chest rose and fell evenly which is precisely where i want him kept said zenin looking between the two hospital officials if anything goes wrongif he dies under your intensive carethen neither of you will even get a choice of kolyma camp you hear me loud and clear the small stainedcoated surgeonadministrator momentarily remained in eyeball to eyeball confrontation his mouth and throat working with unspoken words finally pitifully he said you proud of what you do hardly ever said the militia commander its something that has to be done zenin led the hurried pace to get out of the hospital trailing olga with him shortbreathed she said i was almost there i could have broken him the only person weve got to keep alive is george bendall zenin quoted back at her you did brilliantly but we pushed him keep him the right side of sanity well get the others push him over weve got what you said he was a chosen idiot george bendall isnt important i want the people who manipulated him the conspirators minutes thought olga infuriated in just minutes bendall wouldhave given them the lead the british are invoking their access agreement tomorrow i want to see him again before they do good idea agreed zenin they were nearing the exit on to gospitalnaya ulitza i am going back to the kremlin theyre waiting yes she said curiously we need to talk more please wait for me at headquarters of course i meant what i said olga ivanova you did brilliantly i told the militia everything said vladimir sakov i told the yanks to go to hell now im telling you you want to be helped out ill help you a bravadoand vodkafuelled bully thought charlie but definitely able to fight from the evidence of the television struggle with george bendall that the world had watched the ntv camera room was cluttered with equipment discarded cups and food containers cigarette debris and protective outdoor clothing charlie said ive read what you told the militia it had occupied less than one page the man had been jolted by bendall knocking the camera off focus turned to yell at him and seen the rifle hed thought bendall was going to shoot him and fought him for the gun no one liked bendall and bendall didnt like anyone in return he tried not to work with the man so fuck off sakov was lounged in an ancient armchair leaking its stuffing into the rest of the mess glass in hand wearing only a sweatstained singlet hanging over even dirtier jeans there was a lot more of the crude tattooing along each arm than charlie had seen on film and charlie was sure he was right although he didnt put the russian older than thirtyfive despite the near baldness he was probably gambling with his front teeth but charlie was in no mood to be told to fuck off hed ascended floor by floor the former comecon skyscraper and two smaller towers blocks from which the second gunman could have got an elevated firing position before abandoning the chore to the recognized fbi group outside the fourth possible location the pain from his feet had reached his knees and was climbing youre not old enough what frowned the man youre not old enough to have been in a gulag and those are gulag tattooes arent they identified charlie and if you had been you wouldnt have got this job your workbook would have been marked smart fucker the man lifted a clear unlabeled bottle charlie hadnt seen from beside the chair and added to his glass it was the yellow of streetdistilled potato vodka harsherand strongerthan that sold in shops all part of the macho image but the remark was less belligerent and his teeth were still intact charlie said father grandfather the man shrugged father pretty dramatic testimonial said charlie in apparent admiration he wasnt guilty of anything none of them were family suffering explained a hostility to authority or officialdom continuing the flattery charlie said still a braveunusualthing to do sakov shrugged not speaking having eased past the barrier charlie didnt want to lose the momentum quite a difference from georgi he hated his father bastard hated everyone cant imagine that worrying you it didnt why didnt you like working with him then morose fucker he drank not properly with the rest of us not with anyone maybe he did have friends here didnt he chanced charlie vasili gregorevich i suppose the man made a vague gesture crossing himself a religious gesture vasili gregorevich who isakov completed the russian he was a good guy never understood what it was with him and gugin no one did was picked out charlie what happened to vasili gregorevich sakov looked surprised at the question dead charlie felt a stir of satisfaction dead how an accident his car got hit by a train on the level crossing near timiryazev park thats where he lived near the park association with george bendall seemed to bring with it a high mortality rate reflected charlie when was that a few months back four five maybe howd it happen dont know tried to race the train thats what they said who said people here talk you know what did vasili do here senior cameraman like me thats what i am nowwhy i got the white house positionsince vasili gregorevich died they were good friends couldnt understand it repeated sakov he lifted the bottle again you want a drink private stuff good charlie had never refused a drink in his life and wasnt going to now because it marked his acceptance but he mentally apologized to his liver the russian poured almost three fingers into an already printsmeared tumbler added yet again to his own and said to the witches being kindly ones charlie touched glasses to the traditional russian toast wishing the witches had been kinder when he was tramping pointlessly around the high rises the liquid burned and went down his throat like a clenched fist they work together a lot vasili and georgi permanent team most of the time is that usual suited everyone else did they know each other before georgi started working here i heard someone helped georgi get a job vasili maybe thats the story i heard i never asked charlie wetted his lips with the drink it stung there a favorite bar everyone drinks in around here elenas on tehnicskij did georgi and vasili use it sakov took his time sometimes they spent time together outside of work then seemed to what about tuesdays and thursdays the russian looked blankly at charlie what his mother said georgi used to do something every tuesday and thursday but she didnt know what it was sakov shook his head neither do i howd it come about that georgi was your gofer on the day of the shooting rostered i guess he didnt ask for it particularly not that i heard youre not drinking charlie brought the glass to his lips again you didnt like working with him i already told you that why didnt you ask for a roster change it wasnt that bad he fetched and carried ok how many days ahead were the rosters fixed a week this was regarded as a big job he brought the rifle up to the gantry in an equipment bag thats what they say you decide what equipment you want of course what was it supposed to be spare tripod stand you didnt check it i told you he did the job ok you told him what you wanted and he did it so thats what happened you told him what you needed and left him to get it ready yes nothing wrong with that the belligerence was back nothing wrong at all agreed charlie quickly how many trips did he need to get everything up two he took the camera and mount up first and put down a line to gather up the leads then went back for the rest of the stuff what about security checks the man shook his head we had our identity discs of coursebut we arrived in an ntv van the security people saw us knew who we were charlie sighed he would have got the rifle up on the second trip yes what did he have to do when you were filming keep out of my way until i asked for something tell me what happened from the time you heard the cavalcade was coming got the warning from the scanner from other cameras along the route picked the cars up as soon as they crossed the kalininskij bridge on to krasnopresnenskaja nabereznaja tracked them all the way to the white house refocused for the tight shots as they got out of the car saw the president go the blood splashes then the fucker went into me thats when i saw the gun he was bringing it towards me i thought so i grabbed at it i saw the fight broke in charlie what did he say when you were fighting you were saying things both of you i saw you i dont remember not properly sakov cupped a hand to each ear i still had the cans on at first to the scanner then they got knocked off we were swearing calling each other cunts i think i said what the fuck was he doing and he said it was right that he had to he said hed kill me to get me out of the way tried to turn the gun i couldnt hear much when the helicopter came over only to get away from him but i couldnt when i tried he started to turn the gun how many shots did you hear none he cupped his hands to his ears again i told you i had earphones on to the scanner did you know georgi was trained as a sniper in the army sakov snorted disbelievingly no did he ever talk to you about himself about the army what he did in his spare time sakov shook his head didnt even know his father was a spy until i read it in the papers bendall would have absorbed the language from the age of four remembered charlie what about politically did he talk about hatingthe new regime the americans anything particular no why do you think he did it because hes fucking mad useless mad maybe thought charlie but not useless is it a long way away not by russian distances but sasha would probably think it was yes a long way said charlie do you have to go by aeroplane yes will you be gone a long time no more than two days will you bring me back a present sasha corrected natalia sharply maybe if youre good said charlie there was a tightness about natalia but they hadnt had chance to talk yet and being good is going to bed its not time yet protested the child it will be when youve finished your milk and cleaned your teeth not fair pouted the girl bed insisted charlie ill be back by the weekend well do something you choose the circus the circus agreed charlie charlie had drinks readyhis islay malt her volnaywhen natalia returned from sashas bedroom she said you spoil her thats what fathers are supposed to do natalia didnt smile dont buy her anything expensive what would you like nothing whats tonights problem natalias disclosure of a presidential commission was hurried disjointed but charlie let her talk herself out im being dragged in deeper and deeper well be discovered you and i she concluded charlie regarded her for a moment in total bewilderment natalia its a commission into howand whythings disappeared from old kgb archives how can that extend to us you cleared all the records of anything to do with us its possible its not she could make monsters from every shadow sometimes from no shadows at all its a risk she persisted its not im more in the middlemore the object of everyones attentionthan we ever anticipated ill be seen an an enemy of the kgb successors nothings changed charlie insisted but it had he thought what have you been called back to london for people wanting to appear to be doing something its called consultation he paused do you wish it was for something more permanent no denied natalia charlie didnt believe her hed been wise not to tell her that anne abbott was being recalled with him i didnt expect things to end like this said olga that wasnt true by the time theyd got to the brandyfrench at his insistencetheyd both known they were going to sleep together there hadnt even been any conversation about it on their way to his apartment what she hadnt expected was the dinner invitationof course impossible to refuseor that hed choose the mercator which really did have to be the best french restaurant in moscow most unexpectedand pleasurableof all was how good hed been once theyd gone to bed sorry of course not his bodyand his performancehad been even more athletic that shed fantasized about looking down at him approaching the hospital earlier that day she turned sideways pleased that hed kept the light on you of course not theres something i havent told you until now what i played your interrogation tape at the kremlin to okulov himself and trishin their opinion was the same as mine brilliant but we decided we dont want you to question bendall again until after the british why there might be something theyre holding back we can use to break him i can break him by myself well do it this way said zenin he hadnt allowed her to take control in their lovemaking either but she hadnt minded that as much as she did this charlie got the jump seat which jammed his knees beneath his chin so tightly he couldnt have jumped anywhere difficult anyway after the exertion of already shuttling between the british and american embassies to ensure they were completely up to date before their encounter with george bendall at least charlie consoled himself he was opposite the slenderthighed anne abbott and not the fatassed richard brooking they travelled initially unspeaking the lawyer and the diplomat exchanging transcripts of olgas interrogation of bendall and charlies meeting with the ntv cameraman as brooking finished vladimir sakovs account of the gantry struggle he looked uncomfortably to the woman whod read it first and said appalling language dreadful agreed charlie shouldnt be allowed anne smiled at charlie a lot of openings well do it as we did with the mother you lead said anne we need to talk about that interjected the head of chancellery about what exactly demanded charlie he didnt want the man buggering things up this is not something im accustomed to admitted brooking in fact i havent ever done anything like it before all good for the cv said charlie better to let anne and i handle it though dont you think ive the ranking authority it was an embassy car with the ambassadors chauffeur charlie was surprised the pompous prick hadnt insisted on flying the british pennant from the bonnet masthead whats the book say youve got to do thered be a guidance book there always was ascertain the full facts establish the nationality is genuinely british obtain the passport number if possible offer consular assistance obtain all united kingdom residency details to advise next of kin make clear any repatriation advance is a loan that has to be repaid and get the applicants signature to that agreement quoted the man anne covered her mouth with her hand and looked determinedly out of the window at the gluedtogether traffic jesus thought charlie lets work our way through all that londons already established hes british with a british registered birth although he doesnt hold a british passport as such there arent any united kingdom residency details and i dont think whatever happens weve got to think about repatriation agree with me so far yes said brooking ascertaining all the facts is what anne and i are here to do right right accepted brooking so there we are said charlie triumphantly all youve got to do is offer the consular assistance tell him anne and i are it and leave the rest to us it doesnt sound much said the man doubtfully its your being there as the ranking diplomatic representative thats important urged charlie yes of course brooking still sounded doubtful charlie said its all a great deal more uncertainmore complicatedthan it seemed to be at first yes agreed brooking everythings going to be recorded thats part of the cooperation agreement i understand that im not trying to teach you your job of courseheaven forbid but on something thats going to be circulated around the highest levels of the russian and american government it might be better if you waited to ask about anything thats not immediately clear from our questioning rather than putting it on tape at the time quite good thinking brooking smiled relieved all quite straightforward really isnt it the best ways always straightforward sighed charlie my feelings exactly said the man one of the several reasons for charlies early morning trip to the centralized incident room had been to ensure with olga melnik their acceptance at the burdenko hospital they were fifteen minutes ahead of the agreed time but the first security check point was at the ground floor reception brooking hurried into the lead producing his russian diplomatic credentials and standing vaguely to attention to be compared against an identification photograph that charlie had given olga and in the temporary separation anne squeezed charlies hand and whispered thats my dinner table anecdote you try to steal it ill serve an injunction charlie said therell be more virtually as he spoke the protest erupted ahead of themi am an accredited representative of her majestys government i must not be physically touchedand charlie turned to see brooking pushing away an attempted body search softly for only anne to hear charlie said oh fuck what did i tell you louder charlie said if thered been that sort of security five days ago people wouldnt be dead and maimed and we wouldnt be here more quietly anne said its still not diplomatically permissible the awareness seemed to be registering at the checkpoint therewas a huddled conversation and brooking was ushered through untouched there was no attempt to body search either charlie or anne although all their documentationas well as their photographswas compared and their briefcase contents examined there was an insistence upon testing the tape recorder to confirm thats what it was to get further into the hospital they had to pass through an airportstyle electronic metaldetecting frame when they caught up with him brooking said that was outrageous ill file a protest whats the point pleaded charlie theyre doing their job authority is the point it might well be acknowledged charlie with a meaning brooking didnt comprehend there are times usefully to invoke it and there are times when you are going to fuck everything up like now i dont think broke in brooking in fresh outrage only to be interrupted in turn by anne abbott i do richard if this all degenerates any worse and im asked why im going to have to say you werent any help at all in fact that you got in the way and were having a row within the hearing of russians one if not more of whom i am sure speaks very good english id also expect there to be cctv cameras with sound and for every moment of this totally unnecessary nonsense to be recorded which i deeply regret as im sure charlie regrets i thought wed talked about this on the way here brookings face burst crimson i he started then abruptly stopped his eyes searching the vestibule and the corridors leading from it for the threatening cameras my name is badim said a voice behind charlie nicholai iliach badim i am the surgeonadministrator i can escort you if youre ready he spoke english and i am guerguen semonovich agayan psychiatristincharge said a second man he spoke english too were ready said charlie fucked up before we start he thought then he thought no im not it was unsettling to realize hed begun to think of himself as part of a team although while he was in england it had obviously been necessary to designate theeagerly accepting donald morrison as the local british contact with the now supposedly centralized investigation and to duplicate all the russian witness interviews perhaps for once there needed to be a team the photocomparison and briefcase check was repeated outside the guardblocked ward but there was no attempt at body searching strictly half an hour said badim well stay with you brooking nodded in smiling agreement charlie thought how fortunate his earlier visit to the american embassy had been and said this is officially a british embassy interview without the presence of any foreign nationals we respect of course your medical restrictions which well observe but you cannot remain with us everything that is said is being recorded and will be made available to your authorities brooking made no move to speak anne said thats international law once youve agreed hes medically and mentally capable of being interviewed which you have badim said ill register a protest as i did yesterday so will i threatened agayan well be directly outside from where we can see the patient and well abide to your time stipulation undertook anne charlie wished she hadnt standing back for anne and brooking to go into the cramped room ahead of him there were again four men inside all of whom looked expressionlessly at them but made no move to leave the graybandaged george bendall lay gray faced on his gray bed eyes closed charlie said well be half an hour a surprisingly slight bespectacled man said our instructions are to remain at all times in the room with the prisoner charlie saw the record light was rhythmically throbbing on the heavy antiquated russian equipment beside the bed we want you to go we have our orders charlie moved to the dirtfissured window to get a better signal on his cell phone and dialled the direct line into the american embassyincident room olga was very quickly on the line charlie said ill put you on to your people and passed the telephone to the clerklike man who listened without responding until the very end when he said i understand he handed the telephone back to charlie as he stood and still not speaking led the other russians from the room charlie was careful to place their recorder on a table on the opposite side of the bed to the still operating russian machine to avoid conflicting disturbance gesturing anne to the solitary chair vacated by the russian recordist there were two other chairs waiting at the door by the time he went to fetch them both badim and agayan lurked in the corridor charlie accorded brooking the seat closest to the eyestight man depressed the start button of their machine and nodded for the diplomat to open the encounter it was several moments before brooking did so not initially anticipating the invitation he stumbled several times calling bendall by name in the hope of waking him he looked sideways in confusion when the bandaged man remained with his eyes closed charlie made rotating movements with his hands for brooking to continue which the diplomat awkwardly did although limiting his contribution to setting out the consular representation by the time hed finished brooking was visibly sweating and his starched cutaway collar had garrotted an unbroken red line around his nervous throat do you understand everything ive said mr bendall concluded brooking the feigned sleep continued brooking looked helplessly at charlie and anne charlie said vladimir petrovich sakov calls you a fucking idiot useless with it although charlie was concentrating intently upon the man in the tunnelled bed he was aware of brookings wince bendalls eyes remained steadfastly closed thirty minutes remembered charlie vasili gregorevich wouldnt have said that would he there was a lid flicker a stirring you think vasili gregorevich died in an accident i dont i think he was killed probably by the same people who murdered your mother olga melnick should easily be able to recover all thedetails of the timiryazev railways crossing crash by the afternoon hopefully with all the other officially tracable queries hed raised earlier that morning charlie was aware of annes uncertain frown across the raised bed covering bendalls eyes opened at once charlie said for the benefit of the tape george bendallgeorgi guginappears to have recovered consciousness and nudged brooking into a repetition of the consular guarantee brooking reacted as if he were waking up too but echoed virtually verbatim what hed earlier registered on tape anne abbott picked up the moment he finished identifying herself as a lawyer there to formulate a defense which would have to be presented in court by a russian attorney i dont want any help from the british embassy from the united kingdom announced bendall his voice wasnt as weak as it had been on the previous days tape to which charlie had listened why are you going down for everyone else demanded charlie ignoring annes fresh look of concern at what amounted to their dismissal by the man no one else when did you get together asked charlie it was the army wasnt it bendall began to hum very softly a tuneless wailing dirge that reminded charlie of middle eastern music or afghan he reminded himself that where you met vasili gregorevich in afghanistan was he in the army with you bendall said something charlie didnt hear his head turned but anne did brother she queried there were no brothers thought charlie it was anne who carried it on understanding is that where you formed the brotherhood joined it in afghanistan there was a moments more humming then never knew you must have laughed at the officers their not knowing said charlie taking annes lead the army record was one of drunken loutishness it didnt fit bendall didnt reply but he sniggered you sure they didnt know pressed charlie you got punished a lot didnt understand what didnt they understand georgi he didnt like his english name charlie remembered didnt understand were you tricking them in the army pretending suggested anne didnt know that was clever said anne persuasively good to stay together afterwards too when you left the army meeting old friends old comrades every tuesday and thursday added charlie he was conscious of brooking frowning in bewilderment between himself and anne comrades said bendall not at first though prompted charlie recalling vera bendalls account you didnt meet up with them at first when you left the army did you the wailing hum rose and fell was that your song what you sang when you were all together asked anne it stopped abruptly tell us the words georgi it does have words doesnt it fifteen minutes left charlie saw he checked that their recorder was revolving smoothly no one knows no one knows what thought charlie desperately secret like the brotherhood he guessed bendall smiled special you were werent you georgi said anne a special person in a special group special secret group that noone knew about shant tell you did you swear an oath georgi asked charlie promise to be loyal to each other protect each other bendall smiled but didnt speak he said that it was right that he had to remembered charlie bendalls words when he was struggling for possession of the gun according to vladimir sakov was that what you were doing when you shot at the president protecting the brotherhood bendalls face clouded had to why did you have to pressed anne what was the president going to do to hurt you and your friends i knew tell us what you knew urged anne right to do it even the same words isolated charlie who told you that someone who helped who helped you friend how many shots did you fire another of charlies reasons for going first to the us embassy had been to discover how many cartridges had remained in the rifles tenround magazine when it had been recovered an obvious questions he was irritated at himself for not finding out earlier that it had been empty when it had been picked up after the fall all of them the mans eyes were becoming heavy how manys that two only two special bullets all they had whos they georgi came in anne special said the man again he wasnt referring to the cartridges charlie decided theyll be very proud of you yes are you proud of them to be one of the brotherhood asked anne the smile was of a satisfied proud man he didnt speak brooking was sitting back in his chair legs extended full length in front of him mind obviously elsewhere probably up his ass thought charlie its good to belong to something a properspecialfamily isnt it coaxed charlie the eyes closed didnt open georgi said charlie sharply who are we why are we here the eyes flickered open although slowly not going to tell you anything if im going to help defend you youve got to tell me things i have to know said anne urgently too tired theres a lot more time as much time as you need said anne all we need well come back again for as long as it takes charlie didnt totally believe bendall was too tired to go on but there was no wayno time because he was already aware of the doctors at the doorit could be challenged nor should it be over a lifetime which seemed to begin when people had dinosaurs for pets charlie believed hed perfected an untrained ability to outpsychologize most psychologists and the amateur freudian diagnosiseven with the essential freudian sexualityencompassed wombs although not physical ones family dysfunction and surrogates with generous outlets for mentally disturbed violence and an already beerhall tested philosophy of footstamping marching songs and a lot of alcohol bendall had performed as much as he intended and had unquestionably given away more than he wanted or imagined he had it was important to leave bendall thinking hed controlled the encounter but with an eroding worm of doubt after you did it how were they going to get you away get you back safely among them there was no obvious physical reaction but charlie was sure bendall wasnt asleep and had heard him thank you for being properly considerate said the waiting badim when they emerged i dont after all think theres anything officially to complain about this is probably the first of several sessions said charlie one visit obviously isnt enough i suppose not said agayan walking with them back through the cluttered corridors you typed his blood when he was admitted of course of course confirmed badim he needed transfusions its ab were there any other tests badims head came around sharply the only concern was to find the right blood group for a safe transfusion youve still got some of the sample yes could we have some now badim stopped why we want to test for alcohol that was sufficient for the man to know thought charlie it could be tested here and id appreciate a copy of those tests just as im sure youd like to know the result of our analysis which ill guarantee for comparison im not sure im authorized its a medical request i understood you to be the surgeonadministrator the responsible authority i am said the easily offended man a sample wouldnt need any specific control we could wait said charlie wanting to stop short of the heavily guarded vestibule and you know our authority is from the kremlin for several moments the man hovered uncertainly then he gestured them into a room about two meters further along the corridor which they were never to know was from where olga melnik had the previous day gazed down upon the approach of her new lover agayan walked away with the other russian immediately inside brooking said this has all been absurd a total waste of time the man is obviously mentally unwell that will have to be the plea obviously agreed charlie there was no way it could have been anticipated theyd be in this room so it wouldnt be wired or cameraed but he still looked intently around ignoring the diplomat anne said i told you we were a good team didnt i and i agreed reminded charlie what do you mean demanded brooking just technical stuff said charlie i want a copy of that tape to take with us to london said thelawyer it probably wont be admissable in court but i want a psychiatric assessment so do i said charlie its much less of an embarrassment to the government if hes certifiably insane someone not mentally responsible for his actions offered brooking that and the fact that he has lived here for twentysix years charlie had to force himself to talk to the man luck all the way along the line mikhail badim reentered the room alone carrying a phial in his outstretched hand were testing for alcohol too a comparison is essential for an empirical result accepted charlie he was contributing more towards a mitigating defense than to the continuing investigation but then that was the primary purpose of todays interview in the car on the way back to the embassy anne said to the diplomat do you feel theres any reason for you to come with us for the next meeting not at all said brooking hurriedly i think i fulfilled everything i had to do in todays visit i thought it all went very well despite the unfortunate fellows obvious madness very well indeed echoed charlie walter anandale ended the urging of both wendall north and the secretary of state for a diplomatic compromise by rejecting their suggestions in preference to his own which didnt include acting russian president aleksandr okulov and just as curtly ordered them to fix it jeff aston the now unquestionablyobeyed head of presidential security insisted they needed a highwaycleared intersectioncontrolled route from the embassy to the hospital but gave the embassy as the return destination in the demand to the gia traffic police the secret service chief also insisted upon being in total media charge once more restricting the still picture and television coverage of anandales meeting with the russian leader to american white house cameramen it also guaranteed his being in total controlof their release which was to be timed to give the impression that the american leader his wife and entourage were still in moscow when the intention was for them to be already high over the atlantic on their way to washington the american president spent the first thirty minutes at the pirogov hospital being reassured beyond the already promised reassurance from admiral donnington and a support group of russian physicians that ruth anandale was sufficiently fit and recovered to be medevacced back to america only then did he go completely encircled by agents and with the towering aston by his side to the other wing of the hospital where north and aston had spent those same thirty minutes hurriedly arranging the photocall with the russian presidents protection squad lev maksimovich yudkin was fully conscious although still attached to dripfeeds and linewaving monitorswhich made for fittingly dramatic picturesbut too weak for any conversation which was not the intention anyway anandale was however posed as if they were in discussion as well as solicitously standing by the mans bedside it only took fifteen minutes as they made their way back to the americancommandeered wing james scamell said this is going to be interpreted as a snub to okulov fix it with the statement were going to issue demanded anandale abrupt departure for urgent medical treatment for the first lady no time for official farewells apart from seeing the president whose recovery were delighted about he looked sideways at the secretary of state and your staying hereplus the unattributable briefings youll giveestablishes that everythings still on track you know what weve just shown by being allowed in like that demanded aston rhetorically that russian security is godamned awful and that they havent learned a thing even you mr president shouldnt have been allowed in i wouldnt have permitted it if the situation had been reversed unseen behind the presidents back wendall north gave the secret service chief the stiff middle finger in his wifes room anandale said were going home to get my arm fixed said the woman to get your arm fixed agreed anandale olga melnik had already heard the russian tape but went through the pretense of reading the transcript charlie took back to the embassy incident room together with his original recording to become part of the evidence collection while she didwith john kayley in his room absorbing it for the first timecharlie studied the autopsy report on vera bendall he skipped the normal medical introduction although noting that the woman was described as generally undernourished eager for the specific findings the cricord cartilage of the larynx had been crushed but the odontoid peg of the second cervical vertabrae was intact which it would not have been if she had succeeded in properly hanging herself there were three lesions in the neck caused by the support metal breaking through the left bra cup there was predeath bruising to her shoulder blades and to the back of the head which the pathologist attributed to the back of her body hitting the cell door presumably in her death throes or in the agony of strangulation no photographs had been taken of the body before it was removed but according to the prison guards reports the woman had been virtually in a sitting position with her back against the door there were mortuary photographs of the body naked showing strangulation bruising completely encircling the neck there was bruising on the finger endings of both hands which the medical examiner suggested were caused by the womans instinctive efforts to loosen the ligature in the final moments before death the pathologist described as lividity the discoloration to vera bendalls knees and thigh and to both buttocks all of which was clearly visible on other post mortem photographs in the opinion of the russian pathologist the medical evidence was as consistent with a choking persons failed last minute change of mind when an attempted suicide hanging went wrong as it was with any suggestion of foul play which made it too inconclusive for either definitive finding but not for me declared charlie carrying the report out into the larger room as kayley and olga emerged from theirs i think i hear you welcomed kayley and ive heard johns opinion continued olga there was an inherent moment of reluctance not actually at sharing but at the worry of not knowing how it would be interpreted and acted upon by people whose minds worked so much differently from his this was a static evaluation of something that had to be carried on charlie reminded himself which kayley had obviously already decided as the pathologist remarks there unfortunately arent any photographs of vera bendall in the position in which she actually died three guardsand the prison doctorhave sworn statements that she choked herself by twisting her bra around her throat attaching it to the cells protruding locking mechanism and then dropping in the expectation of breaking her neck which wasnt ever possible we know the precise measurements of the lock from the ground is only a meter her neck didnt break couldnt have broken she was suspendedaccording to what the guards evidence suggestwith her legs and buttocks virtually against the ground slowly to suffocate which is what the pathologist describes broke in olga playing devils advocate there are too many things that dont click together came back charlie lividity is after death bruising when the blood puddles at the lowest possible point in the body where its no longer being pumped because the hearts stopped medicallyprovablyvera bendall has blood puddling in both knees and both buttocks she cant have died in two positions she either died on her knees or on her back which accounts for the much more substantial blood collection in her buttocks charlie offered the series of mortuary photographs showing the continuous unbroken predeath bruising around vera bendalls throat that marking isnt possible if she halfsuspended herself with her back against the door and her calves and buttocks against the ground the strangulation line would have been continuous in the front but not at the back her weight would have kept the ligature away from the nape of her neck leaving it unmarked vera bendall was choked to death from behind on her knees her neck totally encircled from behind until she died the bruising to her head and shoulders came from her struggling against the knees pressed hard up against her of her killer like the bruisingto her fingers came from trying to prise the ligature away she was held like that throttled on her knees long enough for the blood to begin to puddle in the front which it did even more obviously in these pictures when she was turned on to her back and the bra attached to the door lock olga turned to kayley the american said i didnt get the total neck encirclement it makes it even stronger i want to take all the autopsy material back to england get independent pathology opinions said charlie talking to the american you doing the same kayley nodded lighting one of his aromatic cigars you want to tell us about england charlie wasnt aware of any air extractors in the main room feeling the passive fumes at the back of his throat consultation with my directorate bullshit bureaucracy the usual stuff youre both set up here no need im not there was obvious disbelief on the faces of both olga melnik and john kayley charlie humped his shoulders exaggeratedly thats all it is there isnt anything more he was glad of the precaution of taking his packed case to protocnyj pereulok that morning he had hoped to go back to lesnaya to say goodbye again to natalia and sasha but this was taking longer than he expected the american matched charlies shrug exhaling a wobbling smoke ring at the same time if you say so charlie i say so why the fuck didnt anyone believe him when he was actually being honest kayley made a flag of the transcript charlie had just delivered you sure as hell got under his skin opened some doors maybe allowed charlie to olga he said is there anything on the isakov death at timiryazev accepteduntil nowas an accident replied the woman all ive been able to get so far is the basic militia report its an ungated crossing his car stalled straddling the line hit by the kalininin express so hard it virtually broke in half autopsy interrupted charlie olga shook her head and of course hes been buried ill apply for his exhumation what about a military record the detailed request has gone to the ministry of defense and an organization a brotherhood pressed charlie hed definitely run out of time to get back to lesnaya that too as soon as we find if we can find whatever service vasili isakov was in i bumped into a lot of your guys checking vantage points for the second gunman charlie told kayley there were more of them than me so i left them to it four possible high rises the tallest the comecon building recounted kayley wearily they even checked the ukraina hotel across the river between the most obvious buildings theres a total of fortytwo positions eight more if you want to include the almost impossible hangingoutofthewindow points no one heard anything saw anything although most were looking from their windows at the presidential arrival no shell casings found by my guys or handed in before they asked two more high rises that could conceivably have been used theyre being checked because everythings being checked it was like climbing everest backwards wearing skis thought charlie whod never dreamed of risking his feet in such contraptions ill only be away two days tops donald morrisons taking over i want to see bendall for myself announced kayley its the murder of an american thats going to be the major charge youve had your consular access hes russias prisoner said charlie but youre no official problem charlie supposed he should have checked legally with anne abbott richard brooking never came into his thinking none at all kayley said thanks for that at least charlie let it go luck with the interview he already knew how he would pursue the next meeting with bendall but had no intention of prompting the american it was always possible john kayley might nervetouch something far more productive than what hed so far achieved it would be interestingalthough hopefully not ultimately demoralizingto see i intended to get back to say goodbye but we overran ok there even seemed to be a distance in the sound of her voice on the telephone i think the bendall interview is good its on file in the incident room if you want to access it ok any problems today no ill only be gone a couple of days you said tell sasha i love her remember what i said about a present i love you i love you too keep safe on their way to sheremetyevo in the embassy car anne abbott said im back to thinking theres a dramatic defense were a long way from finding it you sure the accountants will stand our staying at the dorchester by the time they get the bill well have been and gone they wont have any alternative do you go out of your way to upset people do i upset you you make me laugh and curious you ever see liberace perform anne exploded into laughter i only just know who liberace was what the hell are you talking about theyve got his glass piano in the dorchester bar its pure kitsch youll like it charlie answered the car phone on the central reservation beside the driver morrison said moscow radio has disclosed the second gunman theres been an official russian government enquiry brookings going around in circles olga melniks been on demanding to know if it was us i told her we hadnt broken the agreement who did it asked anne when charlie relayed the conversation something else on the long list of what we dont know said charlie it worked letting the british have the second interview declared zenin it was a good idea agreed olga it had been his idea for her to cook at his apartment that night and she was nervous because in this ridiculously short time it had become overwhelmingly important to go on impressing him the unfamiliar need for which made her even more nervous shed chosen pasta with clams and mussels and squidtrying for the joke by insisting the black sea fish were a crimean souvenir shed collected from the hospital the previous dayand hed seemed to think it funny as well as continuing the italian theme with chianti the englishmans very good the woman too what did the defense ministry say asked olga the request for anything known about vasili gregorevich isakov and brotherhoods had been made with zenins superior authority to ensure a matchingly authoratitive response that secret societies arent permitted in any of the services i told them that wasnt the question what about myourinterrogating bendall again well see if giving the americans as well as the english their turn is the good idea its proved to be so far the americans can go ahead of us we can use whatever they get when we go again waiting will also give us time to hear back from the military thats where the conspiracy is what weve got to find what about the second gunman leak it was anonymous a telephone call which they reported without trying to check ive got people looking into it he leaned across the table touching his glass to hers the pastas wonderful this is wonderful im glad she said responding to both remarks i havent asked you yet if youre married im not she said she looked around the apartment i suppose your wife could be away although speaking as a trained investigator there isnt any obvious evidence of anyone else living here if there was one she could be away zenin agreed smiling back but there isnt im embarrassed now to have said that shit dont be im not olga thought it couldnt be happening so soon so quickly charlie muffins tightly structured timetablemost specifically his intention to get back to moscow in two daysbegan to unravel before his first appointment that was scheduled for ten thirty he was at millbank before nine to set up the various tests and analyses he wanted upon the material hed brought with him no longer with an office or any working facility within the building everything had to go through sir rupert deans personal assistant a dedicated spinster whose christian name remained unknown and who had long ago decreed she should be universally known and addressed simply by her surnamespencewithout the courtesy of miss he had to negotiate his way past two junior secretaries to get into her sanctum and having done so reflectedand passingly mournedthe transition from roedeanaccented experimentallyeager debutantes with legs that went all the way up to their shoulders to unsmiling businesslike practicality from women whose legs looked as if theyd been carved from solid oak by a man with a blunt hatchet spence herself needed such support for a granite body formidable enough to have singlehandedly repelled a special forces invasion of the directorgenerals office the woman listened in intimidating silence to everything charlie wantedeven asking to ensure hed finishedbefore bluntly declaring it wasnt possible in two days he should have known there were no laboratory resources in the headquartersbuilding the ballistics people worked from woolwich arsenal and she very much doubted psychiatrists and psychologists would drop everything to put him at the top of their lists it took charlie thirty wheedling minutes to persuade her personally to try to arrange the mental assessment from the tapes and their transcripts and to dispatch the ballistic and blood samples to their respective testing centres its still not possible she insisted ive heard everythings possible backed by your authority and ive heard bullshit and how good you are shovelling it but shed enjoyed it charlie decided i brought you a souvenir to thank you in advance charlie took the joke maestroika set from his briefcase doll by doll identifying each russian leader depicted in succeeding order of leadership whose face would be the next in line he wondered reassembling the figures one inside the other the smilefinallybroke the professional shell in which she clearly existed within the building illuminating a surprisingly young face dont expect two days but ill try to get it done as quickly as i can still with time to spare before the meeting with sir rupert and his advisors charlie took his time shuffling along nostalgically familiar corridors to the cafeteria in which he recognized no one and where no one recognized or acknowledged him in return the coffee was as he remembered like a longterm alcoholics urine sample and all the riverview tables were occupied so were those in the middle section charlie found an empty singleseated table near the clattering service entrance one of its legs were uneven so the coffee spilled the moment he put it down why nostalgia he demanded familiarity perhapseven to being shunted to the worst table in the roombut there shouldnt have been the smallest iota of remembered regret so why was there why had he enjoyed the innocent flirtation of being with anne abbott in the liberacepianoed dorchester bar the previous night and the cab ride through the flower dazzling green park and actually looked at and liked for the first time the humpshouldered statue of churchill glowering at the parliament buildings just remembrance not nostalgia and certainly not regret he never thoughtreminiscedof any of thisin moscow it was a freak of deja vu or something he couldnt find a better phrase to describe he had enjoyed being with anne abbott the previous night not in any silly dangerous way not even flirtatious theyd just made each other laugh and in his case hed been able to say things make jokes without balancing every word for hidden misunderstood or misconstrued meaning before uttering it relaxed he thought surprised despite the impending encounter and whatever it was in which he was professionally involved in moscow for this brief returning moment he felt relaxed at ease would natalia be feeling that with his not being in moscow unburdened briefly gratefully unendangered when charlie got back to the top executivelevel floor spence said everythings gone off and ive got calls in to those who can read our minds charlie wished he had a mind reading facility he said i knew you could make it work for me spence i havent not yet everyones waiting for you in the conference room it adjoined sir rupert deans office and was necessary for a full gathering they were assembled at a long table with the directorgeneral in the center their backs to the thames from where charlie was directed to sit he could see the yellow and green antennahaired mi building on the other side of the river it reminded him to call donald morrison sometime that day it was not charlies first encounter with the control group and dean didnt bother with reintroductions instead he said weve kept ahead until now so well done so far but now its all changed the only thing that isnt changed is our need to stay ahead which is why youve been withdrawn announced jocelyn hamilton brusquely eager we need to know the extent of the conspiracy how much more deeply we might become involved his adversary charlie knew from the past there always seemed to be one as he looked directly to the burly deputy director charlie caught the sharp sideways look from dean and thought shot yourself in your stupid mouth asshole charlie said i know what we need at the moment i cant provide it then perhaps you need help supervision even seized hamilton at once perhaps what we all need is to hear what charlies got to tell us before we start offering suggestions said patrick pacey irritably an ally charlie recognized he remained unspeaking using the silence against his attacker until dean came in supporting him too lets hear that charlie what is there to add to what youve already shipped back which weve all seen im having our own ballisic confirmation obviously but its already come from the americans said charlie there were definitely two gunmen and it was the second one who hit the russian president and ruth anandale i believe vera bendall was murdered inside lefortovo im hoping our pathologists will agree with me on that the russian autopsy verdict is that the evidence is inconclusive why would she have been killed broke in jeremy simpson the groups legal advisor the statements youve given us dont read as if she knew anything i dont have answers for most of the questions youre going to ask admitted charlie reluctantly maybe she did know something but didnt realize it had to be silenced before it emerged maybe she did know was part of the conspiracy but hadnt expected to be put in jail committed suicide because she couldnt withstand the interrogation said hamilton which would be the worst imaginable scenario unnecessarily reminded the permanently redfaced political officer assassin son of a british defector is bad enough assassin son with british defectors wife as an accomplice is appalling charlie shook his head vera bendall was neither clever nor strong enough to have been actively involved or included what she knewif anythingshe knew accidentally or was killed for an entirely different reason prove it any of it demanded the deputy directorgeneral i cant said charlie this wasnt how hed expected it to be he was appearing to have reached far too many conclusions upon far too little evidence if vera bendall was murdered the conspiracy has in some wayto involve disaffected factions among highly placed russians with access to lefortovo said sir rupert dean which points to the fsb formerlyor alias eventhe kgb whose files have disappeared completed charlie he added an intelligence service irrespective of whatever its name is now that was in the forefront of the coup against change were going around and around in unresolved circles protested hamilton maybe thats the intention suggested charlie another maybe he recognized uncomfortably hamilton sighed off we skip down another yellow brick road i cant wait to hear this theory in charlies mind everything made sense was supported by known established facts but as he paraded themanalyzed themin his mind he stumbled over too many maybes its too clumsy george bendall is mentally unstable possibly alcoholic if the intention was to kill onepossibly twopresidents no conspiracy group would trust george bendall to carry it out or only allow him just two bullets to do it or put him in a position where it was inevitable that he would be seized charlie paused for breath wondering if his parting question to bendalhow were they going to get you away had properly registered with the man there were various expressions on the faces of the men opposite him none which charlie judged receptive pressing on determinedly he said it was the second gunman who put two bullets into lev yudkin and hit the american first lady most likely in mistake for the american president they didnt need george bendall except to be caught queried the bald moustached simpson following charlies argument except to be caught agreed charlie why demanded hamilton what for i dont know charlie was forced to admit to create a confusion send everyone the wrong way theyve certainly succeeded here if that was the intention jeered hamilton charlie didnt feel relaxed anymore he felt exposedwallowingand he didnt like it weve all read your hospital interview with the man said the directorgeneral his spectacles moving back and forth between his hands like the preparation for a conjuring trick give us your analysis of that again im having it assessed by experts assured charlie grateful for the escape but i think bendall fits a mold he comes from a totally dysfunctional family hates everything and everyone hed got a predilection to violence usually under the influence of drink the army doesnt help him appearsi repeat appearsto make it worse but there seems to have been a group a brotherhood to use his word that admitted him his firstonlyacceptance they had a song if youve listened yet to the tape i sent along with the transcript you heard him humming it you also heardand readhim several times use the word special there were a lot of mentally questionable often drunk violenceinclined men in beerhalls in munich from the s onwards who had their own particular song and thought themselves part of a special select brotherhood i dont believe this broke in hamilton shaking his head in exaggerated incredulity charlie wasnt sure that he did anymore before he could continue simpson said do you think thats where the conspiracy is among this so called brotherhood yes and i think i can establish it in time insisted charlie its a question i want to put to a psychiatrist or psychologist but i dont infer that first encounter with bendall as obstructive a refusal to talk he thinks hes clever there is often a deceptive cleverness in madness i believe bendall imagines hes playing with me being cleverer than me but that he wants to tell me about whoever or whatever it is he was a part of im trying to work it out mocked hamilton are we following the theories of freud here or could it be jung or there again could it be the teachings and crystal ball of madam maud the clairvoyant in a gypsy tent at the bottom of a pier somewhere jocelyn hamilton clearly wasnt aware of the profound russian belief in clairvoyants and superstition charlie decided ignoring theridicule he said im hoping to get some sort of psychiatric or psychological report within twentyfour hours we accept a conspiracy conceded the directorgeneral slowly theres forensic proof at least of that it succeeded in removing the russian president from the political scene possibly forever if it didnt actually kill him hurtin one instance killedothers why should a well organized group in any way involve someone as unstable as bendall who if youre right will eventually expose them it doesnt make sense thats my point pleaded charlie only just avoiding the exasperation being obvious not yet it doesnt make sense far too little does it might when the russians trace bendalls army medical records find evidence of a special group in the units in which bendall served and theres a proper investigation into the death of the ntv cameraman vasili isakov but then again it might not sneered hamilton every other face remained blank unconvinced and unimpressed patrick pacey whose function as political officer was to liaise with the home office and downing street said i want a positive answer is there any possibility of another briton being involved in this i cant give a positive answer apologized charlie i dont know is there any possibility of the mother being found to be involved i dont personally believe she was but again i cant give a positive answer charlie couldnt remember any debriefing being as bad as humiliating as this there was an echoing silence the permanently redfaced political officer said there was an overnight note from sir michael parnell that the russians are furious at the leak about a second gunman that makes it an official diplomatic enquiry i wanted it kept back as much as they did said charlie so it didnt come from you persisted hamilton of course it didnt said charlie careless of the indignation what about from someone youre dealing with in moscow one of your sources asked dean it was more of a strident klaxon than a warning bell that sounded in charlies mind if thered been a diplomatic enquiry it was official and could easily become annexed to the presidential commission into the missing intelligence dossiers it would not have come from any of my sources how good is liaison between you the americans and the russians persisted hamilton would donald morrison have told mi across the river of being lied to by the cias burt jordan charlie said good enough i think everythings fully computerized in the american incident room which means that anything one or the otheror bothdoesnt want put on the computer isnt logged in the first place dismissed hamilton have you been totally open with whatever youve obtained independently those were my instructions from here reminded charlie which isnt the answer to my question said hamilton yes ive shared everything it was more or less true the qualification came down to timing if the leak didnt come from youor any of your contactsand it didnt come from the russians then the americans must be the source said jeremy simpson whats their benefit in doing that there isnt one as far as i can see said charlie when the hell was there going to be a question to which he did have an answer addressing patrick pacey he said im surprisedperhaps even more curiousthat so quickly theres been diplomatic traffic from moscow about a criminal investigation certainly about something that happened less than twentyfour hours ago arent you yes agreed the political officer reflectively whats your point something along the lines of protesting too much more convolution sighed hamilton i think its a valid observation contradicted the directorgeneralbut the question remains why whats the russian benefit theres going to be an investigation by a presidential commission into the missing kgb files reminded charlie reminding himself in turn of the possible personal implications this could deflect some of the pressure on their successors the fsb a lot of whose senior officersdimitri spassky most definitelyare former kgb theres a logic there agreed dean a rare commodity derided hamilton we need a lot more to move this discussion on said the directorgeneral i could make some calls offered charlie donald morrison would obviously be firstmaybe even brookingbut dare he risk telephoning natalia i think wed benefit from a group discussion too said hamilton balefully spence was waiting when charlie emerged into the outer office woolwich arsenal say itll take three days for the ballistic confirmation you want theyre miffed at being caught out on the acoustical assessment and three days is the earliest for any psychological profile the blood tests will be ready by tomorrow what i cant take back with me will have to be sent in the diplomatic bag said charlie the formidable woman shook a permed head the psychologist didnt want to do it at all called it working from a distance he wants to see you to answer whatever questions he might have he wouldnt be back to take sasha to the circus charlie realized that was appalling pounced jocelyn hamilton at once muffins clearly out of his depth unable to handle this he proved there was a second gunman simpson pointed out it would have come out through ballistics insisted the deputy director but he suspected it first said simpson equally insistent and he was the first to learn of bendalls involvement if we keep him on the investigationwhich i personally dont think we shouldmufin needs to be supervised argued hamilton somebody else definitely should be put in charge that would look as if we believed he was the source of the second gunman disclosure said pacey are you sure he wasnt demanded hamilton sir rupert dean said i prefer muffins theory of it being an fsb leak theyre the only beneficiaries although not by much so do i said simpson i propose that muffin is taken off the case entirely said hamilton and that we send in better qualified investigators from here what do you imagine someone from here could have achieved better than charlie muffin in just five days demanded simpson were not in fantasylandyour yellow brick roadwere in murderous reality maybe even more murderous than we yet know thats theatrical protested hamilton no refused simpson its what i called it murderous reality charlie lives there knows the place speaks the language and as hes proved has got useful contacts sending someone from here at this stage cold would be stupid quite apart from the reason ive already given i see no purpose whatsoever in sidetracking charlie muffin supervising him agreed pacey theres nothing to show muffin isnt doing everything he should be doing theres no reason to replace him how many times did he say in answer to anything he was asked i dont know demanded hamilton probably not as many times as the russians or the americans with whom hes working said simpson arent we losing sight of the fact that with the uncertainty that surrounds this department we cant afford to take a chance with charlie muffin said hamilton its a matter of opinion whether or not were taking a chance said the directorgeneral belatedly joining the exchange i think ive expressed my opinion said hamilton youve certainly done that said simpson i think we should leave things as they are id like to get more guidance from the ambassador in moscowsaid pacey this russian note has diplomatic implications well give it twentyfour hours to see what the guidance is from the ambassador and what charlie gets from his calls to moscow decided dean and then pressed hamilton then well talk again said the directorgeneral the spare room spence found for him reminded charlie of the cell hed occupied for so many years when hed been permanently attached to the millbank building it was at the rear the one dirty window overlooking a clutterfilled courtyard and other dirty windows but it had a reasonably dustfree desk and a chair and a secure telephone and charlie was totally uninterested in anything else he reached donald morrison immediately richard brooking was still spinning in circles reported the mi officer the head of chancellery was blaming charlie personally for what he complained to be criminal intelligence wrongly crossing the boundaries into diplomacy the ambassador had sought foreign office instruction how to respond to the russian note morrison had spoken personally to john kayley who insisted the leak had not come from any american source olga melnik had reminded him it was she who had demanded the second gunman remain secret they too were therefore blaming the leak on britain and in particular upon charlie morrison was slowly working his way through the witness reinterviews so far there was nothing new although other colleagues at ntv described bendall as a loner with isakov his only friend doesnt help your being there instead of here said the younger man you denied it of course no one believes me there was a pause it wasnt you was it charlie thanks a fucking lot it most certainly didnt help his being in london youd have asked the same question it was true charlie conceded what else isakovs exhumation is scheduled for tomorrow ill go as our representative there wasnt a lot of purpose but charlie supposed it was necessary what about bendalls medical records psychiatric particularly colonel melnik says they havent heard back from the defense ministry this was a wasted call charlie decided that it brooking said he wanted to talk to you if you called that would be an even greater waste of time dont tell him i called you havent told me whats happening back there not enough said charlie anything more you want me to do keep safe charlie asked forand gotjohn kayley first when he telephoned the us embassy incident room and at once initiated the conversation about the second gunman arguing the only beneficiary could be the fsb its a possibility allowed the american the reluctance was palpable a damned sight more likely than meor youdoing it insisted charlie you left out olga accused kayley whats she say that she was the one who insisted it be withheld a carosel of denials thought charlie whats new technical guys came up with something said kayley got hold of a complete tv film of the presidents and their ladies from the moment they got out of the cadillac until yudkin got hit they slowed it virtually frame by frame at that degree of slow motion you can see that ruth anandale movedinstinctively i guessas yudkin was shot that movement put her in front of anandale himself she took the bullet which would otherwise have hit the president killed him maybe it was just a fluke that it didnt who have you told anticipated charlie you olga washington obviously as a leak test it was a pretty poor effort charlie decided when are you seeing bendall later today i might be here longer than two days you going to tell me what youre there for i already did yeah id better speak to olga kayley brought her to his telephone rather than transferring the call charlie listened for the echo of the recording device but didnt detect it he couldnt hear anything of kayley in the background either olga listened with matching unspoken disbelief to his denial of the leak and to his fsb suggestion before he was halfway through charlie asked himself why he was bothering and then abruptly realized there was an expanded question that should have occurred to him long before now the awareness took away the pointlessness of establishing contact anyone bendall knewwho might have been part of the groupfailed to turn up at the television station no anything else you know of the exhumation yes what else were you expecting it was a general question sighed charlie no theres nothing else to tell you i wont bother to repeat what i told john no the woman accepted the blinds were down and the lights were out charlie recognized what more do we know about vasili isakov ive got people on it nothing yet ill call again tomorrow see how johns interview with bendall went yes the russian put down the telephone without saying goodbye when charlie got back to the upper floor spence said the interrupted meeting had been further postponed until the following day although sir rupert was available if there was anything he should know from charlies contact with moscow there isnt said charlie dejectedly burt jordan was with kayley so was the embassy lawyer whose name was modin and whose jewish grandparents had fled from kurybyshev to escape the stalinist pogroms on their way to the ward after the security check nicholai badim said that bendall seemed greatly improved from the previous day and guerguen agayan agreed knowing of charlies earlier confrontation kayley had insisted olga phone ahead and the inner security guards left the room unasked there were chairs already waiting the tunnel support was still over bendalls legs but the bed had been raised propping the man up into a near sitting position the lawyer identified the three of them more for the recording than for bendalls information kayley said good to hear youre feeling better bendall smiled but didnt reply kayley took a pack of kent cigarettes from a sagging jacket pocket and said you want a smoke i dont said bendall the voice was far stronger than it had been on any previous recording i wont then jordan said whyd you try to kill the american president george my name is georgi whyd you try to kill the american president georgi reasons what reasons good reasons wed like to hear them said kayley none of your business it is georgi said the fbi man the presidents wife got hit but we think you really tried to kill him thats what you did didnt you aimed to kill the american president bendall smiled again but didnt reply you know you were set up said jordan you were meant to get caught while the other guy got away there was no one else you only had two cartridges there were five shots liar from his briefcase kayley took a copy of that days trud which led with the disclosure of the second gunman and held it up for the man to read bendall frowned but said nothing why are you frowning georgi jordan demanded didnt you know there was a second shooter its a fake said the bandaged man kayley swapped trud for moskovskaya pravda izvestiya and nezavisimaya gazeta all three dominated by the same coverage and laid them out side by side on the bed in front of the man well have a television brought in you can watch your own network its their lead story too not true they really made a fool out of you didnt they said jordan jesus how they must be laughing i dont want to talk to you anymore cant understand why youre taking the rap for people who set you up like this said kayley theyre not doing anything to help you need to think lets think it through together said kayley bendall began to hum the wailing dirge that song got words asked jordan the man hummed on appearing oblivious of them itll help you if you tell us about the others said kayley comrades said bendall comrades who deserted you cheated you said kayley no go away tell us what we want to know and well go away said jordan go away the roared demand was so unexpected that all three americans actually jumped and there was a scuffed arrival of the two doctors at the door bendall screamed it again and tried to lash out at jordan with his uninjured arm he missed but swept the tape recorder off the bedside table laughing when the cassette hood broke as it hit the floor he threw his head back and shouted go away over and over again breaking the words occasionally with a cackling laugh he finally stopped shouting exhausted and when he did thehysterical laughter turned to tears they streamed unchecked down his face and his nose ran too agayan hurried in from the doorway pushing past the lawyer what did you do to him say to him we didnt do anything said kayley defensively just tried to get answers to some questions go away mumbled bendall his voice a hoarse whisper yes go away agreed the psychiatrist this is bad badim had his fingers at bendalls wrist checking his pulse bad he echoed in the car on their way back to the embassy jordan said we hit a nerve and maybe broke it said kayley its being overemphasized insisted charlie for what reason demanded natalia to create precisely the situation thats arisen to spread suspicion and distrust among us the way to prevent any official curiosity about natalias dedicated interior ministry telephone number appearing on his hotel bill was to pay itand then destroy ithimself it would only represent a temporary outofpocket expense so were back to kgbof fsbdisinformation doesnt it fit better than anything else natalia didnt reply for several moments and when she did it wasnt an answer the leaks been added to the presidential enquiry remit well be ok well be found out im not able to get back as soon as i thought i would how long three maybe four days dont call me direct again like this it could be traced you havent told me if theres anything new bendall had a mental collapse when he was with the americans why had she waited until now to tell him because her personal concerns were overwhelming her professionalism he answered himself forcing the calmness charlie said hes all weve got we all know that what do the psychiatrists say they havent been able to talk to him properly yet therell be a tape thats the system were working with here the transcript hasnt got up to my level yet and you havent got a prognosis of his condition i told you psychiatrists havent been able to talk to him yet medically he seems ok ill call began charlie but natalia said i told you i dont want you to ill see you in a few days yes tell sasha im sorry about the circus well go next weekend yes she said again almost uninterestedly for several moments charlie sat hunched on his hotel bed reaction colliding with reaction what the fuck had little bigfootinthe mouth said to tip bendall over the edge more importantly what was needed to pull him back and at this moment he couldnt yes he could kayley had told him about the intended meeting again charlie got at once through to donald morrison you heard how kayleys meeting with bendall went he told me earlier it was to be this afternoon not a word im having all the meetings analyzed by people here so i need not just a transcript but a copy tape can you chase kayley up get one shipped over in the diplomatic bag as quickly as i can promised morrison if not quicker encouraged charlie he actually thought it was the mi man coming back to him when his phone rang five minutes later instead anne abbott said hows your day been you dont want to know about it said charlie his mind not fully on the woman i do charlie ive got to know about everything remember leonid zenin insisted they personally confirm the extent of george bendalls collapse by going to burdenko hospital which olga had intended to do anyway she was irritated at not having initiated the suggestion ahead of the man it was becoming practically automaticor did she regard it as essential to try to impress as much out as in bed among the ground floor and ward level security men there was a discernible footshuffling uncertainty that they were in some way going to be blamed which zenin did nothing to allay by sweeping autocratically past both contingents shaking his head against any verbal explanation from either group the warnedinadvance nicholai badim and guerguen agayan were waiting outside bendalls room theres no purpose in going in said badim theres a room along the corridor we came here to see for ourselves said zenin theres nothing to see do protested the doctor please open the door let us in it wasnt a request and olga felt a sexual flicker at the authority she said there were some sounds like scuffling on our dedicated tape your people got to the door before i did i understand he was trying to hit one of the americans lashing out at them you mean he was fighting them off asked zenin at once no one was watching even from outside said the doctor he was wildly out of control by the time i got here my impressions was that he was trying to hitto hurtthe nearest person zenin put himself closest to the deeply snoring comatose man difficult to believe someone as heavily bandaged as this would even think of trying to hit out at anyone think is the operative word said agayan bendall wasnt thinking he was reacting to what demanded olga the tape was permanently revolving and she wanted to be featured on it as much as possible agayan shook his head to something he didnt want to confront by tomorrow i want to know what in your considered analytical opinion went wrong today insisted zenin that sort of opinion is not possible overnight do you really need reminding of the importance of this of everything connected with it of course not protested agayan in matching indignation good said zenin the smile was a lipwithdrawn grimace so youll know how essential it is to help us in every way you can and i look forward to getting that help by tomorrow he looked to badim whats wrong with him medically is he unconscious deeply sedated he had to be quietened olga said could he be rational again when he comes around i dont consider hes ever been totally rational intruded agayan bringing both militia officers around to him at once hes said things weve believed to be important things were trying to work on work out said olga are you telling us it could all well be fantasy quite easily said the psychiatrist he might well not even remember what he did every taped conversation indicates that he knows perfectly well what he did rejected zenin in your judgment perhaps said agayan your judgment isnt necessarily mine a smile at the psychiatrists refusal to be intimidated was flickering at the corners of nicholai badims mouth it was outmatched by another of zenins teethbaring grimaces i knew it wouldnt take you long to help with a diagnosis said the militia commander we can xray an arm to find a break patronized agayan we can brainscan a hemorrhage or a tumor because theyre physicalmanifestations we can visually see the problem on a screen we cant photographvisually seemental illness we can conduct outward observations and attempt verbal analysis and try to fit our conclusions into general and wide guidelines and every time we do it we know those guidelines are far too general and far too wide and that we could be wrong by a margin of one hundred percent precisely because i know the level and importance of what im being asked to do i dont want to be wrong by a margin of one hundred percent thats why youre going to have to wait for my opinion of this mans mental condition and health if you think anything hes said gives you something to follow up follow it up but dont expect it to materialize if it does youre lucky if it doesnt youve encountered the problem i meet every day of my life the day you start solving a one hundred percent of all crime ill be hoping to reach a twentyfive percent success rate with my patients the only sound in the room was the sonorous rumble of george bendalls drugged breathing trying to come to the aid of her lover olga said when will you be able to give us a firm diagnosis the man shrugged shaking his head at the same time i dont know i havent been able to get past you people for a proper conversation yet he said he understood me when i charged him remembered olga he might equally have said he knew how to land a space vehicle to the moon if youd asked him said agayan you both told me he was medically and mentally able to be interviewed charged even olga accused the two doctors it was the psychiatrist who continued to answer at the time we agreed that we both considered he was today he suffered a mental collapse which proves everything ive tried to make clear to you about reaching mental opinions when will the sedation wear off asked zenin sometime during the night said badim what happens then we see how he behaves how rational he appears to be and then try to decide what else to do might he need to be further sedated pressed olga quite possibly could he never properly recover to what until now weve believed to be a rational level of comprehension asked zenin yes thats possible too for all our sakes i hope youre wrong said zenin you dont have to concern yourself about my career said agayan only your own we need a newa betterpsychiatrist insisted olga she hadnt liked seeing zenin so openly opposed the man shook his head not looking at her across the car in which they were driving again without discussion back to his apartment this will go to trial whether bendalls got a mental condition or not the caliber of every russian witness will be important in front of an international audience agayan will look good in a witness box olgas embarrassment became admiration i still think hes hiding behind psychiatric mumbojumbo bendalls understood whats been going on i want you to talk very closely to kayley see if bendall was trying to fight them off from doing what something being done to him physically olga twisted in her seat to stare directly at zenin you surely dont imagine kayleys fbi a counterintelligence agency probably the other man too maybe even the supposed lawyer argued zenin scopolamine is a known part of their lie detection equipment just like it is with our people pentothal too in similar circumstances the fsb would use them the kgb certainly did we should have asked badim to check for puncture wounds said olga reflectively what now zenin looked at her supposing the americans did inject bendall suggested olga the violencethe mental collapse evenmight be the result of their drugs against whatever other medication hes on zenin made the call from his apartment badim said he hadnt looked for injection marks on bendalls free arm which would now be punctured by the sedatives hed had to administer to calm the man there was one failed injection which would have left two marks reluctantly he agreed to take a blood sample to test for any drug other than those recorded on bendalls hospital log even more reluctantly he agreed there could possibly have been a violent reaction if bendall had been given an unauthorized drug zenin remained on the line for both security group leaders to be brought to the telephone each man insisted that the briefcases of the three americans had been thoroughly examined but that their orders had been that no body searches could be carried out upon accredited diplomats those orders had been reemphasized after such a search was attempted upon the british embassy visitors a prepared syringe would have been no more obtrusive than a pen said zenin as he replaced the receiver an hour later nicholai badim called back as instructed there was what could be a puncture mark on bendalls uninjured arm where no hospital doctor would have attempted an injection blood had been taken for tests that would take at least twentyfour hours theyll deny it said olga they wont be able to if we can prove hes been drugged said zenin so demanded anne shed chosen the italian restaurant in wilton street because it had memories charlie hadnt asked she hadnt offered the britishwhich seems to come down to meare being blamed for the leak the ambassador or brookingprobably bothhave made it political my people here dont see things the way i do theres one trying to dig my burial pit the scientists and professional experts cant break away from other things to do what ive asked the psychiatrists or psychologistschrist knows which or whoare demanding i stay to answer their questions which means i cant get back to moscow where i need to be he couldnt tell her about george bendalls collapse there was no way he could officially know that all thats all that comes instantly to mind said charlie allowing the cynicism so youre pissed off thoroughly fucked off he sipped the barolo hed ordered in preference to her chianti suggestion glad shed conceded but curious it had taken a long time coming too long but now the feet were throbbing and he was sifting the windstrewn intrusions the lawyer sipped her own wine curious about what the cleverness of it all offered charlie it never was about a mentally unstable man with a gun we were intended to realize there was a second gunman and believe we were uncovering other scraps anne frowned at him im not sure what youre telling me charlies reply was delayed by the arrival of their food guinea fowl for anne winecooked veal escalope for him as the waiter left charlie said you ever personally experienced a sandstorm annes frown remained no you cant see where to put your feet the direction in which to go in which direction should we be going if i knew id take it this wasnt any better than it had been at millbank earlier at least anne appeared to be taking him seriously in which direction should i be going which way have you been told to go asked charlie mental instability up to and including unfit to plead im being kept back too for consultation with psychiatrists looks like youre stuck with me or you with me im not complaining in which direction was this going did the engagement become a marriage he finally asked guessing the earlier reference to the restaurants particular memories two years four months and three days very specific prison counting scratching off the sentence on the cell wall not his businessor his interestcharlie decided remaining silent he wouldnt compromise his careerhe was a lawyer like meand i wouldnt compromise mine we met at weekends but there were others in between that didnt really mean anything after two years four months and three days we realized that we didnt mean anything either almost precisely the time hed been permanently in moscow with natalia thought charlie at once he stopped the reflection irritation burning through him making him physically hot there wasnt the slightest comparison it was ridiculous even attemptingimaginingto make it he and natalia had to do something though to resolve their problemsreal or otherwisebefore they got any worse before they ceased to mean anything to each other too inconceivable though that was perhaps it was personally a good thing the london visit was being extended giving them both time and space to realize what it was like to be without each other even for a short period strawclutching charlie recognized objectively thered been other short breaks since theyd been togetherintervals longer than this one would probably beso nothing was likely to be different when he got back werent both of them allowing a selfdeceitan hypocrisy invoking sasha as a bondin prolonging their staying together have i said something awkward im sorry apologized charlie my mind went off at a tangent i could practically see the cogs moving want to talk about it no sorry no i am said charlie that was rude youre quite a mystery man at the embassy you know charlie felt a stir of concern thats what im supposed to be story is that youve got an apartment in what used to be a royal palace a minor grand duke was supposed to have lived there before the revolution he had to stop this divert it is there such a thing as a minor grand duke its diplomatically better for me to be physically separate from the embassy morrison doesnt live outside the compound im officially recognized by the russian government like kayley and the fbi morrisons accreditation is as a diplomat it was getting threadbare anne frowned you lost me on the logic of that there doesnt seem to be any charlie gestured for the waiter to clear their plates needing the interruption she shook her head against anything more and so did charlie he said is this the anne abbott courtroom technique you offended no what then curious at the interest with luck the joking flirtation of the previous evening might just be the diversion she smiled i like to get to know as much as i can about people i work with particularly when its as close as we seem to be thrown together thats an anne abbott technique what you see is what you get said charlie inwardly cringing at the bmovie dialogue now im curious itll be interesting to find out they walked back towards the brompton road along beauchamp place pausing to window shop after anne said she could use the extra time in london to restock her wardrobe reminding charlie hed have a longer opportunity to buy sashas promised present and something for natalia too despite her insistence that she didnt want anything anne walked easily familiarly with her arm looped through his pleasantly close natalia wasnt tactile like that too long by herself caring for herself he guessed charlie halted determinedly at the main road demanding a taxi it was anne who suggested the brandy nightcap which became several there were only stools at the bar which brought them close together again charlie didnt try to move away neither did anne she said i ever tell you my philosphy about sex no its the obviouslogicalprogression of friendship what about love thats different thats letting things go too far very free spirited said charlie with whom had she philosophied in moscow he wondered i dont want any more brandy ok do you no time to go to bed then they stayed close together walking to the elevators and got a car to themselves and kissed and charlie enjoyed the uncommitting uninvolving excitement of it shutting his mind to everything except the woman he was holding and who was holding him back without any resisting stiffness or overhershoulder hesitation they went to his room because it was the nearest along the shared corridor but there was no firsttime urgency which heightened the pleasure they undressed each other savouring the unhurriedness of it and when charlie was naked she held him at arms length and giggled that he looked better without his clothes and his feet were a revelation all of their own and charlie held anne the same way and said he liked everything he saw without any qualification they led each other matched each other her preference his preference and burst together and charlie didnt allow himself the surprise that he was able to do itall of itso quickly again anne said i won the second time i had a multiple orgasm thats a whole new definition of friendship said charlie still breathing heavily thats all it is though ultimate friendship no confusion itll be the only thing that isnt confusing so far said charlie so it was meant for me said walter anandale the white house showing of the slow motion tv film of the shooting had been delayed until that night because of the time the president had spent at the conveniently close walter reed army medical center on washingtons georgia avenue to which ruth anandale had beenimmediately admitted secretary of state james scamell was the only cabinet member absent from the meeting i dont think there can be any doubt sir said wendall north she took my bullet said anandale more to himself than anyone else in the room wendall north decided against pointing out that the intercession had been totally accidental yes sir she did wouldnt that have been a hell of a coup wiping out both presidents at the same time unthinkable said defense secretary wilfred pinkton we any closer to understanding it fbi director paul smith shifted uncomfortably at the anticipated question were running the investigation just like you ordered mr president the incident rooms ours totally under our supervision at our embassy bendall had some kind of relapse when kayley was interrogating him today everything had to be suspended that isnt an answer to my question we dont so far know who else is in the conspiracy i want ass kicked paul i want each and every son of a bitch involved in this either in the chair or behind bars for the next hundred years and im disappointed youre not telling me youre there already you tell kayley from me i dont care how its done just do it it was three am moscow time when paul smiths email couched in even stronger terms was taken by the directors personal assistant to the communication section of the fbis pennsylvania avenue headquarters assburning time the man told the transmissions operator make sure its not yours the remark only marginally misquoting the president was intended as a joke it didnt become one two address lists had been defined in microsft outlook for the russian investigation kayley was the backchannel eyesonly route for information and messages restricted to the bureau rezident not to be shared under any circumstances kayley was the block address automatically distributing washington traffic to olga melnik and charlie muffin to maintain the impression of complete cooperation the fbi operator was new being introduced into the job on the normally less stressful evening shift it was the first personal directors message hed ever handled and he agreed with the assistant that it was very much assburning in his nervousness he clicked the cursor on kayley paul smiths dowhateverittakes instruction was waiting in olga melniks email box when she arrived in the incident room that morning intentionally earlier than usual in her determination to confront john kayley obeying zenins telephone instructions she called donald morrison before leaving the american embassy the time difference also benefited charlie muffin in reverse it was still only seven in the morning london time when he got the call from morrison charlie awakened instantly and his interrupting questions finally awoke anne abbott beside him still sleepily voiced she said what is it if i knewunderstood itid tell you said charlie charlie muffins reception was very different from the previous day within minutes of his beginning to speak at the reconvened meeting even jocelyn hamilton straightened from his overlytheatrical shoulderslumped affectation and hunched as attentively as everyone to the tape of george bendalls collapse charlie finished with the verbatim transcript of the fbi directors cable that morrison had relayed that morning no one spoke unwilling to offer an opening opinion it was the directorgeneral who did finally sir rupert dean said no they quite simply wouldnt have tried to drug him its inconceivable kayleys under enormous pressure said charlie i dont think its inconceivable said patrick pacey all and every investigatory means he quoted from the bureau directors misdirected email earlier and explicit orders clear understandingsfrom the highest level theres very obviously been instructions we dont know about that fits what could have happened in burdenko hospital at the moment its only an unidentified although possible puncture mark on bendalls arm which has no medical explanation or purpose to be there cautioned charlie theres no proof it was an unauthorized invasive injection until they get the results of the blood tests where legally does that leave usthe united kingdom asked the subdued deputy director jeremy simpson hunched uncertain shoulders totally uninvolved particularly with charlie here in london which probably turns out to be very fortunate going beyond that if its true legallytechnicallyit constitutes a physical assault upon george bendall thats according to our law and as bendall again technically is still a british subject i suppose there are grounds for us to protest but i dont see any practical purpose in our doing that i dont know what it qualifies as in russia even if theres any competent statute but is that what we should be talking about if the americans have done this it surely blows any honest cooperationany cooperation honest or even limitedcompletely out of the water absolutely quickly agreed hamilton gratefully seizing the lawyers lead but it doesnt affect a legal prosecution for murder does it argued the directorgeneral just as quickly it might affect bendalls abilitycompetenceto plead if the damage is permanent said simpson it could possibly be part of a defense plea in court that had been annes first reaction as they lay side by side immediately after the telephone call from donald morrison in moscow charlie decided against saying anything despite the fact that anne was known to be back in london for consultations whats the russian response asked dean i dont know not yet said charlie olga melnik told morrison shed been withdrawn from the incident roomwhich means from the american embassyfor discussions it wasnt clear with whom what did you tell him to do asked hamilton to get to the incident room as quickly as possible find out everything he can im calling him there later if theres anything he doesnt want picked up on the american monitor hell go back to our embassy after weve initially talked and well speak on a secure line from there the americans are monitoring our calls demanded hamilton everyone in the room looked at the man in varying degrees of surprise charlie said of course they are id do the same in their circumstances the deputy flushed and shook his head but said nothing more pacey said sir michael parnells guidance from moscow was that it was a serious diplomatic breach if it were proved we were responsible for the second gunman leak but that theyd been embarrassed as it is by the accusation whats happened since diminishes the leak problem i suppose although that was public and this isnt yet qualified charlie in another caution but whats happened now helps us i wasnt responsible for the leak so a denial would have been the truth after todays developmentsthe fbi directors cable in particularlythe leak looks far more likely to have come from america if parnell wants to be told what to do tell him to deny it in the strongest terms said dean almost impatiently which america will do about this injection business of course whats the chances of the russians suspending their part in the supposed cooperation charlie accepted hed be able to answer that better after hed spoken to natalia which it was now essential he do despite yesterdays insistence that he shouldnt after a lifetime of professional truth paring convenient deception and ingenuous openfaced lying charlie didnt have the slightest doubt he could smother any guiltcertainly over a three thousand mile telephone linkbut at that moment he was surprised disappointed even that there was no selfrecrimination about the previous nights unfaithfulness there hadnt been any awakening with anne beside him that morning either and certainly shed exemplified her own unique philosophy doing nothing saying nothing to make their being together anything but totally unremarkable morrisons telephone call had been theonly conversation at breakfast to his parting arrangement to meet at the bar that evening shed smilingly queried whether it was intended only to be a friendly drink and hed asked what else it could be and seriously shed said nothing remember there hadnt been any embarrassing pretence of kissed farewells or lingering hand touching either so why didnt he feel any shame or guilt if he loved natalia as much as he was always telling herand himselfthat he did because it wasnt any more than annes special philosophy he wasnt going to pretend to fall in love with anne and she wasnt going to pretend to fall in love with him each knew where they stood orperhaps more appositelyexactly where things lay no confusion no problems a perfect unencumbering unendangering ultimate friendship finally addressing the question charlie said i dont know about positive suspension they might although by cutting themselves off theyd be cutting themselves out the speculation thrust into his mind but he chose not to introduce it until hed thought more fully about it i guess things will remain in limbo until the results of the tests for any nonprescribed drug so i ask again said hamilton where does that leave us in a reasonably good position as charlies already pointed out suggested pacey the political manipulator its not our argument its for the russians and the americans to fight out hopefully we could work between both camps if there is a positive split thats how i see it agreed charlie when did you plan to go back asked pacey tomorrow hopefully as soon as ive seen the psychiatrist wouldnt there be an advantage in keeping out of it for a little while longer charlie very positively shook his head weve got a murder conspiracy to uncover understand this is yet another sidetrack i dont want to go down i think youre right said dean simpson said quite apart from whether or not bendall was drugged where can we go if his collapse is irrecoverable thats whats worrying me most of all conceded charlie probably nowhere which was he decided the sidetrack downwhich he did want to go and a journey upon which he had already been far too longand far too effectivelyprevented from taking but he thought at last that he could see some signposts leonid zenin collected the coincidences like unwelcomed souvenirs the car taking him to the kremlin swept past the white house on krasnopresnenskaya naberezhnaya at precisely the time of the shooting eight days earlier and entered the ancient citadel by the most traditional pine grove borovitskiye gate through which the security detachments had so vainly argued would have brought both presidents to an arrival ceremony in a totally safe inner courtyard zenin didnt hurry crossing the square gazing around at the easily patrolled castellated ramparts and gated internal labyrinth acknowledging how utterly protected everyone would have been hindsight instead of foresight some had it some didnt what he wondered would be shown today those summoned had been personally selected by aleksandr okulov primarily to exclude not just general dimitri spassky but to keep any awareness of the gathering from the suspected fsb yuri trishin whod adeptly adjusted to being chief of staff to the emergency president was automatically included the foreign minister boris petrin was an essential figure hurriedly added because of the overnight developments and federal prosecutor pavl yakovlevich filitov was there for the same reason zenin and natalia guaranteed both the complete liaising knowledge as well as the necessary continuity of the investigation okulov was the last to enter the suite which came close to overwhelming the small number assembled despite being only an anteroom to the much larger main chamber and natalias immediate impression was how much more physically confident okulov appeared to have become in such a short time no longer the shadowy eminence grise but the positively stridingimperious almostman very definitely to be seen determined to be judged in black and white leadership terms he even seemed to dominate the baroque echoing surroundings confirming that perception the short hardbodied man said things have come to light in the last twentyfour hours that need to be discussed to decide the future of the shootinginvestigation he looked to zenin general zenin had been given no indication of how many would be attending and had copied twice as many transcripts of the fbi directors message as were necessary it took him slightly longer to distribute them around the table than to disclose the discovery of the possible but unauthorized injection mark on bendalls arm filitov a whitehaired pedantic lawyer came up from his email printout and said this is outrageousverging on the hystericalbut the puncture mark is only a possibility according to what ive understood you to say we need to be absolutely sure zenin made a deferring head movement towards okulov if theres a positive pharmacology result from the tests during this meeting i shall be informed okulov still smarting from what he considered the personal insult of walter anandale leavingvirtually fleeingthe country without any contact said whatever the outcome of the medical tests where does this leave any future cooperation thats a political decision far beyond my responsibility said zenin what i would ask this meeting to confirm is my immediate decision that under no circumstances can bendall be seen without our people being present in the same room hes our prisoner under our arrest the british have the right of diplomatic access but theres no legal requirement for the americans to see him again physically an even more charismatic figure than the emerging okulov and also someone extremely sure of himself judged natalia with everything predicated by personal as much as professional considerations she said it was an american who died and the man who killed him will be tried by full and open judicial process not according to the cowboy justice obvious in this washington message seized an unexpectedly outspoken filitov which is exactly what this message is agreed okulov an invitation to cowboy justice lynch law or whatever the fbi contingent herean fbi in this country at our invitation and permissionarrogantly considers they can do natalia at once saw beyond the remark charlie was in moscow because of the fbi presence if the americans were expelled his remaining was thrown into doubt which took the decision abouttheir continuing future natalia stopped the thought finishing it differently from how it began it didnt take any decision about her and charlie out of her hands rather it thrust it forward for her to decide her choiceher avoided refused headinthesand choicewould be whether to go with him if he were ordered to leave or stay it was important for her to remain objective to concentrate upon the immediate positive rather than the negative of an uncertain future how tight is the security that bendalls been under since the moment of his arrest the moment of his hospitalization in fact all attention switched to her zenins most curious of them all the closely bearded police chief said total i thought thats been made clear to the extent of a detailed log being kept of everyoneincluding doctorswhove had access to him zenin said of course but natalia thought she detected a whisper of doubt everyone listedincluding doctors and hospital staffare being questioned of course said zenin again whats your point demanded the federal prosecutor premature unsubstantiated reaction which i thought youd already warned against said natalia i accept there is strong circumstantial evidence against the americans but look at the timing of their directors instructionstwelve hours after their encounter with bendall and the discovery of an apparent puncture wound in the mans arm lets not accept the obvious i want to be sure we dont overrespond to be proved wrong at some later date theres been very little practical progress so far in the murder and conspiracy investigation id welcome the generals suggestions how it could have progressed any quicker or more practicably said zenin in stiff personal indignation it was not a criticism it was an observation said natalia of course the american directors instructions is ill considered and reprehensible and i am not arguing against a protest if the feeling is that our making it is justified but it also shows impatience which i think is understandable lets not forget that it is our fsb thatcant find files that could be important or that according to vera bendall unknown peoplepeople we cant tracetook from her apartment what could be other evidence that might be equally if not more important or that the military still havent provided anything more than the most basic of george bendalls records or that in russian custody vera bendall died in what could at least be suspicious circumstances she was going on too long natalia realized almost appearing to offer a defense for the americans which she hadnt set out to do certainly this latest episode with george bendallcoupled with our awareness of what would appear to be the official american attitude towards the investigationshould be our most direct concern but i think there would be a benefit considering it in context with the other things ive set out there was a momentary silence heightening natalias discomfort it was the rotund chief of staff who moved them on yuri trishin said there is a further purpose for this meeting the establishment of the presidential commission i had already decided it should be concentrated upon the fsb took over okulov he smiled towards natalia but which im now persuaded should be expanded to include the points youve just raised perhaps others as well which will provide an answer to any complaints washington might make against us for how the investigation is going said trishin completing the double act this was hardly the emergency meeting natalia had believed it to be from the expression on zenins face it wasnt what hed anticipated either the police chief said when will that commission convene thats a matter for its members said okulov he smiled again im appointing you natalia fedova to be its chair im aware of course of your previous connection with the kgb just as i am even more aware of the constant public reminders of my previous association but i consider that a benefit rather than a disadvantage you dont have to be introduced into its workings nor hopefully will it be as easy to keep things from you as it might from someone unaware of those workings i think speed is of the essence and you wont need to be briefed on the progress of the investigation youvebeen monitoring and liaising since it began and youve given us ample evidence this morning of your impartiality the man switched his attention you pavl yakovlevich are obviously necessary for the legal application of the enquiry the third member of the tribunal will be yuri fedorovich which ensures i am fully aware of everything at all times yuri fedorovich has the terms of reference quite simply they are that you have the presidential authority to bring before you whatever witnesses and material you demand with physical imprisonment at your disposal for anyone who fails fully to cooperate and i want a preliminary report within a week sooner if thats possible any questions natalia was sure there would be a lot but at that moment so complete was her astonishment that she couldnt isolate one from another her thoughts like dust swirls in the wind was she more exposed or better protected was her ability being recognizedrewardedor was she being made a target did she really have the authority would it be acceded to her by filitov and trishin and whoever else she might now have to confront or was she a puppet a totem andinevitably the ghost always hovering in the corridors of her mindwould it could it endanger her and charlie as much as shed feared when shed first learned there was going to be such an enquiry the immediate positive she urged herself again all the other uncertainties could wait i appreciate the confidence i will do everything i can to fulfill it if i hadnt believed you capable i wouldnt have appointed you said okulov the transition from gray to black was remarkable natalia decided answeringfor the moment at leastone of her own questions she decided the appointment strengthened rather than weakened her zenin said how will this affect natalia fedovas liaison role with the existing group of which i am part not at all said okulov for the reasons i thought id already made clear zenins face imperceptibly although only briefly tightened at the public rebuff before there could be any further reaction one of trishins aides came quickly into the anteroom and gave an obviouslyprearranged signal to the militia chief whod started getting to his feet at the secretarys entry there was a hiatus after zenins departure the federal prosecutor said he would be pleased to serve on the tribunal as if he had a choice and natalia sat trying to get her thoughts into order deciding that while her appointment carried with it powerfull access to the acting president himselfand prestige it was also the path into an unmapped minefield in which she risked making many enemies both known which would be unnerving and unknown which could be potentially disastrous and forcing the examination further she honestly acknowledged that for once charlie was not a primary endangering factor shed been pushed farther across the swaying bridge between professionalism and politics the reverie was broken by zenins reappearance the shouldersback march to the table almost a parody of okulovs earlier entry well demanded the standby leader before zenin properly sat there was provable traces of thiopentone in bendalls blood declared the militia commandant stretching his announcement for its maximum effect whats that said okulov pentathol identified zenin a truth drug in common use in american agencies he extended a further pause but not available as such in this country he came sideways to natalia perhaps not as circumstantial as it was an hour ago evidence not proof refused natalia dogmatically she wasnt concerned at zenin not being an ally she hoped though that he didnt become an enemy proof or not we have to react in some way insisted okulov consciously bringing the american expression to mind he decided that whatever the outcome of the investigationand long afterthe fbi directors message was going to be a smoking quickly reloaded gun and theres a way readily to hand suggested foreign minister boris petrin lets not forget the american secretary of state stayed on after the presidents hurried exit i propose that i summon the american ambassador and james scamell and ask them to explain their directors message and at the same time ask how theythink an unprescribed druga truth drugwas found to be in george bendalls system so soon after his interview with american officials perfect accepted okulov he allowed a pause as theatrical as zenins earlier and make it clear we will do our utmost to prevent it being leaked to the media which we were unfortunately unable to do about a second gunman the home office pathologist was a nervously moving distracted man named geoffrey robertson whose strained and bulged laboratory coat had clearly been bought before the weight gain from the sort of overflowing doorstepthick sandwiches he was eating when charlie arrived there was a dab of mayonnaise on the mans chin he frowned seemingly unable to remember charlies confirming telephone call before saying the russian business and leading charlie to a side table in his office on which everything that charlie had provided was laid out in meticulously neat order dominated by the russian photographs in advance of any professional protest charlie said i accept the difficulties asking you to work like this im looking for something a bit more positive than the russians are prepared to agree i need properly to examine the body of course said the pathologist and theres virtually no sceneofcrime material whatsoever but im prepared to agree with you that she was much more likely to have been manually strangled than suffocated by her own hand in a botched attempt to hang herself he paused looking down at the photographs with charlie beside him look at those closing sutures after their examination shes almost been nailed back together im always offended by the lack of respect in stitching like that vera bendall was someone who didnt get any respect in life either said charlie but you were saying the post lividity bruising as you said in your notes is the most obvious that and the complete neckencircling bruising with the crushing of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx but look here he demanded isolating four photographs ive done a comparison betweenthe bruising on either side of the neck see its heavier on the right side than it is on the left to have garrotted her as totally as this her killer would have had to stand behind her pulling right to left left to right that heavier bruising to the right of the neck shows in my opinion that her killer was left handed thats the stronger pressure and here he picked out two more photographs see those two slight sidebyside bruises above the ligature mark ive seen those before in these sort of strangulations theyre made by the killers thumbs where he drove them into the neck for additional leverage and youre right in my opinion about the shoulder blade markings thats where she was pulled back against the knees of the man strangling her can you give me that in a report the man shook his head dislodging the mayonnaise to add to the stains on his already marked coat not to be produced in any court i havent personally examined the body there is no scene of crime material not to be produced in court interrupted charlie all i want is a contrary more positive opinion than the russian pathologist is giving robertson remained doubtful id have to qualify it make it clear that it was entirely an opinion based upon the photographs but that opinion would be what youve just told me the man nodded slowly i suppose i could say that please say it encouraged charlie and there was the blood sample it showed mg said the bulged man too glibly and without consulting his sidedesk preparation spell it out insisted charlie satisfied more than surprised the legal alcohol limit beyond which someone is incapable of being in charge of a moving vehicle is mg per ml of blood said the doctor literally responding to charlies demand bendall was two and a half times over that limit drunk persisted charlie by our legal driving standards yes those readings are incontrovertible robertson appeared surprised theyre scientific which i can have in written analysis to take back with me to moscow i dont know what the legal alcohol limit is to drive in russia protested the man id guess its nonexistent but im not investigating a drunk driving offense said charlie robertsons laboratory was in north london but charlie still managed to get back to millbank by midafternoon spence told him the directorgeneral did not want to see him unless there was a positive development and that he could use the same temporary inner courtyard office that hed been allocated the previous day charlie reached donald morrison on the basement incident room extension the younger man said a lot seems to be happening but i dont know what it is when kayley and i got to the cemetery the exhumation had already taken place there was just an empty grave and a militia guard who wouldnt talk to us kayley said he wanted to speak with you but he was called upstairs about an hour ago and hasnt come back so the investigations stalled has it ever started charlie smiled at the cynicism our pathologists just agreed vera bendall was murdered and george bendall was drunk when he fired surprising that he hit anyone thats what im thinking it had been automatic professionalism for charlie to bring back from moscow not just the russian ballistic evidence but actual firing tests conducted by the americans using the rifle recovered from george bendall now he was glad he had it was probably fortunate too that offended prima donnas at woolwich arsenal had staged their go slow can i tell kayley no refused charlie at once i need to discuss it with others first not others only anne abbott preparing george bendalls seemingly impossible defense nothings come from reinterviewing the witnesses but the personneldirector at ntv confirms it was vasili isakov who got bendall the job anything else you want me to do i feel a bit like a spare prick at a wedding hanging around with nothing to do charlie smiled again this time at morrisons too obvious oneofthestreetboys ribaldry aloud he said there arent supposed to be any spare pricks at a wedding it wasnt a convenientsafetime to call natalia there was more than enough time though to go presentbuying charlie actually thought hed received a few presents himself that day but they were in kit form he had to assemble them himself petr tikunovs second press conference since the shooting was again overwhelmed by the international media the burly communist presidential candidate accused okulov of stealing his partys idea of an investigatory commission but okulovs enquiry would be a coverup he insisted conducted by puppets personally selected by okulov himself in answer to repeated questions about okulovs former association with the kgb tikunov said he left the public and the voters to judge the mans previous connection with the intelligence service the majority of whose officers he knew resented the disbandment and reorganization imposed by the existing government disbandment and reorganization which had allowed the rise in crime culminating in the attack upon the two presidents after his reelection fighting crimeand seeking the fsbs assistance in doing sowas going to be his immediate priority if the need was for someone intimately aware of all the facts to bridge the two situations i should have been the one appointed protested zenin olga wondered if she would ever get properly to know this man you werent for the very reasons okulov gave it needs someone knowing every facet of the case but factionally above it she is youre not youre the one who initially proposed an enquiry into the fsb are you sure shes factionally above it all arent you she was kgb before all the changes just like okulov which okulov specifically referred to from what youve told me referred to as a benefit olga wished she were with him instead of talking on the telephone but everything was far too new to make demands upon him the very thought surprised her when had she ever been the one to seek and hope in a relationship lovers danced to her tune not her to theirs until now exactly the time to get things in propernormalbalance then spend at least one night apart they werent after all rutting teenagers discovering sex for the first time but was it onlyjustsex that thought didnt even deserve an answer i think we should be extremely careful we dont in some way fall victim said zenin precisely what shed warned him about in the very beginning remembered olga we can be how did the exhumation go i advanced the timing as you suggested it was over before anyone else arrived the tissue samplings were delivered to the laboratory by midafternoon kayley called six times during the day trying to make contact what about the british their new man nothing lets talk tomorrow early im missing not being with you she blurted and at once regretted it wishing she could bite back the words what he started just as unthinkingly but instantly recovered yes im sorry theres things tomorrow tomorrow night i mean if youre free im free said olga as always charlie let natalia talk first knowing her need was greater and afterwards kept his account brief and factual well she prompted when hed finished she hadnt mentioned the inference of the fbi possibly being expelled not wanting to trample over ground already muddied by being walked on too many times before you couldnt be better protected against our situation becoming known assured charlie sure that was the point of her questionyoure spanning everything knowing everything and attracting enemies in doing so she said ive convened the first session for tomorrow summoned the fsb chairman himself along with all the rest above any enemies looking down at them outqualified charlie you can dispose of them before they can endanger you youre ahead whichever which way you want to look at it youre actually taking things forward professionally as a criminal investigation natalia allowed i wish id known about the pentathol before seeing the pathologist it would mean a second visit he supposed what state is bendall in now still sedated it was a good suggestion you made about a visitors log praised charlie i hadnt thought of that whats it like being back there the moment for guilt charlie recognized nothing came ive been too busy to do much else but work and appear before committees i did get time to buy sasha a doll it wets itself and has to have its nappy changed shell like that hed forgotten buying sasha the same on a previous recall to london i hope youre looking after her he said with insufficient thought i was looking after her very well a long time before you reappeared on the scene came back natalia at once his mistake charlie accepted best of luck for tomorrow yes i hope to get back the day after you told me already goodnight then goodnight she hadnt told him she loved him thought charlie but then he hadnt told her either he was still by the telephone when it rang anne said that was a hell of a long call im in the bar waiting liberaces lookalike ghost is about to make a pass at me if its liberaces ghost youre safe said charlie charlie had again to filter what he could tell the lawyer from what he shouldnt have been in a position to know but there was sufficient for anne to remark that he seemed to be working hard to provide her with a tv soap opera defense short of that being available however the decision had been made to have bendall examined by two independent russian psychiatrists to formulate a plea of mental impairment or even outright insanity depending upon their diagnosis but all that hinged on what sort of recovery the man made it would also help if the court psychiatrists had access to bendalls previous psychiatric history that vera had mentioned a russian lawyer necessary to lead bendalls defense had been engaged by fax that afternoon from the list anne had brought to london with her so youve finished everything discussed and decided she agreed you going back tomorrow she frowned in mock offense you in a hurry to get rid of me no said charlie not at all good and i havent done any shopping theyd eaten again at a restaurant of annes choice in notting hill and they had a nightcap again in the hotel bar and went unquestioningly to his room afterwards she said were getting very good at this maybe we should take it up professionally charlie said i thought we had the bag containing sashas doll was by the wardrobe toys prominently printed against the name of the shop in which charlie had bought it anne said youve already managed to do your shopping some said charlie he waited for the obvious question but she didnt ask it natalia fedova had triumphed in a jungle of human animals for a long time before sashas birth and for three years afterwards and in doing so like charlie had perfected a number of survival rules oneunknowingly again like charlie with whom shed never discussed itwas never to be pulled down by the mistakes and misjudgments of people who imagined they knew better than she did which she anticipated without needing proof would be the attitude of both yuri fedorovich trishin and pavl yakovlevich filitov and why she set out from the very beginning to impose the control inherent in her appointment she recognized the danger of the strategy and hoped charlie was right in his assessment of her strength befitting their presidential credentials they were allocated a suite of rooms with a fivestrong secretariat within the kremlin itself and natalia summoned both men to it an hour before their scheduled start supposedly to brief them upon everything that had come before the crisis committee she did so with two of their secretaries at the prepared apparatus determined that everything be recorded filitov was just slightly ahead of the chief of staff with the authoritychallenging protest that hed thoroughly assimilated all that had come before the committee with which hed been provided overnight but natalia talked them both down insisting upon her agenda that their initial concentration be upon the missing kgb dossiers extended only to what the succeeding fsb might have taken from the bendalls hutorskaya ulitza apartment because of her intimate knowledge of the former kgb structureas well as her personal knowledge of the crisis committee discussions which might not be reflected in its written materialshe intended leading the questioning but of course expected them both to contribute it was not until natalia said she would seek filitovs advice before invoking theirimprisonment provisions that she got the impression they were beginning to defer to her although the prosecutors reaction at first was more one of undisguised surprise i dont think we should lose sight of the rank and importance of people with whom were dealing cautioned the lawyer nor suspected natalia of the clear threats petr tikunov had made at yesterdays press conference its precisely because im aware of the rank and importance that were discussing the provision now an opinion surely based upon a personal experience which ended several years ago suggested trishin i dont believe the acting president intended the recourse to be used lightly it wont be assured natalia we wont forget though that it exists trishin attempted to restore his prerogative by querying natalias full understanding of the other terms of reference which shed anticipated and not only answered without hesitation but corrected two that he misquoted filitov remained silent until that days witness list was brought in by the registration clerk the federal prosecutor said at once we were not consulted about the summoning of the fsb chairman himself do you have a problem with it natalia was glad she hadnt discussed it of course i do why of course yesterday you talked of premature reactions reminded the lawyer this is inappropriately premature until weve had the opportunity to judge the compliance do you feel its inappropriately premature she asked trishin the chief of staff looked uncertainly towards the recording bank i think prior discussion would have been advisable now natalia indicated the silently turning apparatus your dissent has been noted i didnt say i dissented trishin quickly insisted if we are to reach a combined opinion which is in the terms of reference weve got to come to combined decisions upon the conduct of the enquiry perfect politicospeak natalia recognized combined decisions or majority decisions their exchanged looks answered natalias question before filitov did the lawyer said our primary term of reference is speed which requires majority opinions in my judgment the man paused to establish the mockery dissent can always be noted after politocospeak legalspeak acknowledged natalia and eachrarelyas illuminating as the other she hadnt expected to benefit so muchbe warned so quicklyfrom this presession encounter she was glad shed orchestrated it as precisely as she had she hoped she could continue the momentum although again she didnt foresee the quickness with which that would come about there was still ten minutes to go before the official opening when their registration clerk reentered the chamber and initially bent to natalias ear with his copy of the witness list we all need to hear demanded filitov an unscheduled witness whom well hear at once announced natalia first deputy director gennardi nikolaevich mittel i dont understand protested trishin his frowned confusion matching the other mans it wont take long promised natalia at mittel came confidently into the room the fsb deputy was a young man with an indented scar grooving the left side of an otherwise unlined face his deeply black hair was helmeted directly back from his forehead in greased perfection and his civilian uncreased gray suit was just as immaculate the smile as confident as his easy entry showed sculptured dentistry he took the fronting chair natalia indicated and crossed one razorsharp leg across the other you are not on the list of witnesses whom this commission has asked to help it gennardi nikolaevich invited natalia it was predictable she supposed but shed thought there would have been a written protest not a patronizing emissary you summoned my chairman said mittel as if in reminder he remained smiling viktor ivanovich karelin is indeed among those whom we wish to question agreed natalia beside her she was conscious of trishin and filitov shifting in belated understanding whom you will understand is an extremely busy man said mittel i am here to represent him i am sure i shall be able to help you with any questions you might have natalia let a silence chill the room viktor ivanovich fully understands that this is a presidential commission the smile faltered of course as you do yes you have discussed it with viktor ivanovich he personallyofficiallyappointed me to represent him tell us for the record what you and viktor ivanovich understand a commission established by the acting president to be the man was no longer smiling he unfolded his legs it is an enquiry into some irregularities that appear to have arisen in the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti an organization that no longer exists in her former chief interrogators role within special service of the kgbs first chief directorate natalia had invariably found conceitcondescensionthe easiest shell to crack she wondered if the man knew how much of the fsbs defense hed given away in that one reply that wasnt an answer to my question so ill make it easier for you do youand your chairmanunderstand the authority of this commission of course mittel was wary now his hands forward on tighttogether legs an authority not lessened by the fact that aleksandr mikhailevich okulov is at the moment acting president it is the authority of the office said mittel an authority and an office that your chairman is too busy to observe i can assure this commission that no disrespect was intended to it or to the acting president i think that is important to be established on the record said natalia indicating the secretariat lets see what else can be established you have been deputed as the highest official of the fsb to help this enquiry yes so help us mittel gazed back at her blankly im sorry i dont where are the complete files of peter bendall a british physicist who defected to the soviet union in the corollary details that would have been maintained upon his family after they joined him in moscow the information that would have been kept separately upon the son george bendallalso known as georgi guginand everything that was taken from the family apartment at hutorskaya ulitza upon peter bendalls death and again upon the seizure of george bendall nine days ago natalia wondered how long it would be before trishin or filitov came into the exchange or were they remaining gratefully quiet leaving what was clearly an immediate and dangerous confrontation entirely to her mittel remained unmoving for several moments there was the faintest hint of the earlier smile quickly gone as i pointed out a few moments ago the kgb no longer exists as an organization it has been largely disbanded its functions manpower and archives greatly reduced what remained was absorbed by the fsb which i represent here today on behave of its chairman and on behalf of its chairman i have to assure this enquiry that the most rigorous search has been made among archives that the fsb inherited to locate the material youve asked for i regret to sayregret to tell this commissionthat nothing has been found which is what we are going to be told by everyone else from the fsb whom we have called here today i am afraid so one leg was crossed easily over the other again the reforms and supposed new democracy were still fragile the more so in the uncertainty of the rapidly growing communist strength and the fsb remained a megalith waiting in the wings to reemerge as an unchallenged government within a government to protect herself there had to be provable discussion with the other two on the panel even that might not be as protective as she hoped would you retire gennardi nikolaevich but dont leave the anteroom well need to call you back the intention is to reduce usand by inference the acting presidentto a laughing stock insisted natalia the mans actuallytold us what each and every witness weve called is going to say we need to consult said trishin we are consulting right now i meant with the president the president noted natalia not aleksandr mikhailevich or acting president if we do that were making a laughing stock of ourselves proving ourselves totally inadequate for the function for which we were appointed its directly confrontational judged filitov apparently cautioned natalia could she bring them with her convince them their knowledge that shed once served in the kgba service to which trishin had already referredmight help both men were looking at her waiting she didnt continue finally filitov asked whats that mean its classical textbook whatever name or acronym or initial letter designation you want to choose theyre elite above reproach question or examination said natalia i still dont follow protested trishin our reaction is their test of strength the strength of aleksandr mikhailevich okulov if he succeeds to the presidency against those who will oppose him how much of a two edged sword was it to have maintained the secretariat recording she was committed now not a sword carrier more a solitary standard bearer stranded in the nomansland between opposing forces thats your professional judgment based upon your knowledge of the organization demanded filitov yes said natalia at once which makes it essential to consult aleksandr mikhailevich before we do react declared trishin relieved at the decision being taken from them no refused natalia quickly again that is the test you yuri fedorovich are the presidentsthe acting presidentschief of staff the man who reflects his thinking speaks for him acts for him you pavl yakovlevich are the judiciary for the first time in more than seventy years the supposedly independentofgovernment law imore tentatively although more specificallyrepresent civilian law enforcement one of the few functions that has really been lostto the fsb by the cosmetic disbandment of the kgb in microcosm who we represent is the new order in russia arent you overstressing the symbolism challenged filitov i dont think so said natalia as forcefully as she could are you inferring fsb complicity in the attack upon the presidents you know from the crisis committees discussions that have been made available to you that complicity hasnt been excluded although theres no proof whatsoever to support an accusation reminded natalia at this stage im suggesting nothing more than the lubyanka moving to turn a potentially embarrassing weaknesstheir loss of recordsinto a positive strengthtesting benefit we have now not just to match but outmatch that strength or if you prefer outbluff them how demanded trishin forehead creased in his effort to keep up if we accept the arrogance of first chief deputy gennardi mitteland all those who are going to recite the same denials after himthen we destroy ourselves on our first day insisted natalia i suppose we do allowed trishin uncertainly filitov nodded agreement but didnt speak so lets play the hand urged natalia lets confront their confrontation now only harder lets face the arrogance down at least for today that allows you yuri fedorovich all the time you need to consult and discuss with the acting president she nodded to the secretariat with the advantage of every word thats been exchanged if we havent responded as we should then tomorrow we back down under the bullying of the fsb which effectively ends any purpose in our being empanelled the only humiliation will be ours which it will be anyway if we collapse now under fsb pressure not quite contradicted trishin the humiliation will be that of acting president okulov as well which it will be if we cave in now filitov said its a convincing argument id welcome a better one admitted natalia i dont have one said the federal prosecutor neither do i said trishin the spring had gone out of gennardi mittels step when he was recalled and there was no languid crossing of legs natalia said we do not think you or your chairman fully understand the importance of what this commission is charged and authorized to inquire into which is unfortunate we will not accept your deputizing for viktor ivanovich karelin you will return to the lubyanka with a copy of our terms of reference and with the request from us to chairman karelin to make himself available before this commission tomorrow we will continue today to examine the other fsb officials in the very sincere hope that they will not repeat the explanation that you seemed to think adequate but as you indicated that would be their response we would have you advise chairman karelin that it is unacceptable and have him bring with him tomorrow people better able to answer our questions do you have any questions first chief deputy mittel the mans throat was working in his astonishment but no words came at once when they did they were strained in disbelief i would respectfully ask this commission to reconsider this commission does not believe there is anything to reconsider said natalia we look forward to seeing chairman karelin before us at the scheduled time tomorrow shed imposed her will natalia accepted but at what cost or purpose they used the satellite transmission installed for walter anandale visually to conduct the washington cabinet meeting when hed been in moscow although this time the exchange was far more restricted in numbers although not in emotion which went through the whole gamut from implacable fury to benign unconcern there were three in each capital in the specially adapted embassy room on novinskij bulvar james scamell sat between john kayley and the ambassador cornell burton in washington the president was flanked by wendall north and the fbi director paul smith the guiltapportioning onetoone encounters had been conducted behind closed doors before the linkup but the recriminations still simmered like summer heat off a tarred road paul smiths humiliating inclusion was a continuing part of the mans punishment we were roasted alive complained the secretary of state voice still tight with the memory of their summons to the russian foreign ministry petrin actually used the word arrogance and cowboy and we didnt have a position to come back from how the hell did it happen a mistake that shouldnt have occurred said anandale still gripped by the anger with which hed flayed the fbi director towards whom he intentionally looked sideways as he spoke whats the proper story of this damned injection we categorically denied knowing anything about it which we dont quickly came in kayley outwardly gravefaced like the rest of them but inwardly the happiest man involved knowing that from now on he was absolutely fireproof doublecoated in teflon whatever went wrong could be squarelyirrefutablyblamed on the directors stupid instructions even more stupidly wrongly directed for everyone to read none of us touched the guy its absurd imagining that we would except for the email said scamell who two hours earlier standing in the russian ministry being treated like a miscreant schoolboy had finally seen disappear any publicly acknowledged diplomatic credit for almost a years commuting between washington and moscow we can swear on a stack of bibles a mile high that it wasnt us and theyll laugh in our face just like boris petrin laughed in my face theres no purpose in my staying here anymore but for the fact that by coming home id be inferring we did do it were screwed here mr president we couldnt be in a worse position if we tried to invent one what about the practical ontheground operation asked wendall north there isnt one dismissed kayley the russians have withdrawn from our combined incident room switched the timing of an exhumation that might be important so i wasnt able to be there its the autopsy thats important and ive no way now of getting that he hesitated wanting to build his selfprotecting barricade as strong as he could we were told at the foreign ministry that we wouldnt in future be allowed any access whatsoever to bendall effectively weve been closed down jesus said anandale stretching the word in his exasperation we didnt do it started wendall north it was a rhetorical remark but kayleys day had begun facing scamells suspicion the dishevelled man said can we get this straight the first and last time wedidnotdrugthegoddamnedman appreciate you making that so clear to us continued the chief of staff so who did kayley shook his head discomfited by his overreaction god only knows what about the british persisted north kayley shook his head again too long an interval from the time they saw him which only leaves the russians isolated smith desperate to make some sort of recovery how about it being a setup injecting the guy and pointing the finger at us to break up the cooperation whats the point of their going to all the effort demanded scamell resentment at our leadership answered smith everyone waited for someone else to make the point it was anandale who did we made a pretty good job of screwing that up for ourselves the president let the repeated criticism settle before he said ok what can we do to restore the situation itll need a substantial gesture advised the secretary of state something like getting the treaty back on track i agree said the ambassador diplomatically were looking pretty bad here i cant remember so bad i dont want to go that route rejected the president ok weve got to play pullback but as it wasnt us and it couldnt have been the british the russians did it themselves and are using it to force us into treaty concessions im not going to do that thats my only idea said the secretary of state what about my talking to okulov direct suggested anandale thats the one thing i dont think you should do get directly involved warned scamell i think youve got to remain above the actual recrimination so do i said wendall north at once i want to get the damned thing back on course find the sonofabitch who did what he did to ruth insisted anandale its got to be right first time said scamell thought out from every which way so lets do just that agreed anandale lets you and i think about it from every which way over the next hour or two jamie call me at four your time i want a recovery idea by then olga melnick pushed herself back in her chair waiting for zenins lead she didnt feel dependent inadequate the feeling was of being comfortable able for the first time to rely on someone she wasnt ready yet to start thinking of love because she wasnt sure she knew how to recognize the emotion but it was something she had to confront soon the militia commandant said theres just no way of telling how big this conspiracy is is there it doesnt look like it she agreed she picked up the autopsy report on the exhumed remains of vasili isakov for this much pentobarbitone still to be tissue traceable in the body he would at least have been too deeply unconscious to have felt anything when the train hit him i read the opinion reminded zenin he couldnt have been forced to take it all orally it would have been injected probably mixed with alcohol too and that couldnt have been the americans said olga so were back to the fsb now zenin took up and let drop the official security log of everyone admitted to george bendalls ward it lay among the other reports on the table between them in zenins top floor moscow militia headquarter office a starkly functional bakelitetiled brezhnev era memorial to personal bribebolstering aggrandisement and boxed awfulness there were already cracks fissuring from the driedout wateranddust glued bricks of the outer rooms into the mans inner suite in one corner of which the floor was already too uneven to support anything heavier than a triangular stand for zenins exchanged mementoesmostly unhung plaquesof foreign police visits so how did they do it not isakov on the level crossing they could have managed that a dozendifferent ways particularly if he had been drinking the night it happened and was already incapably drunk i mean at burdenko ive personally questioned every squad leader each one is adamant no one who isnt recorded on that log entered bendalls room and apart from the british us and the americans its just doctors and nurses one of whom has to be an fsb plant declared olga obviously agreed zenin i want every member of the hospital staff on that list investigated until we find out who it is ill personally organize it olga promised she hesitated unsure whether to make the suggestion remembering zenins annoyance at what he considered his being overlooked their relationship allowed her to do it she decided dont you think we should pass this on to the presidential commission its negative at the moment said zenin there was no irritation in his voice therell be a lot of fsb people altogether in one place at the same time people who could be questioned to shorten the time itll take us to find the fsb operative at the hospital if indeed we ever do find who it is thats a constructive point agreed zenin well pass it on ahead of my seeing natalia fedova at our next group assessment he tapped the third folder on the table the finally arrived and complete military medical record on george bendall listed however as georgi gugin theres nothing constructive about this liver enlargement through excessive drinking a stomach ulcer probably from the same cause but no psychiatric evaluation broke in olga zenin wearily shook his head he might have been selected as a sharpshooter but he was still only an ordinary soldier like one of the twenty million sacrificed during the great patriotic war which is what men like george bendall are sacrifices to be offered up whenever the need arises theres no concern about their mental health the less they can thinkrationalizethe better thats exactly what george bendall is isnt it seized olga a sacrifice selected when a need arose hes all weve probably got said zenin my fear is that werenot going to be able to get beyond him to discover the rest to understand the true story olga was surprised at the unexpected depression were making progress no were not olga ivanova refused the man were being directed further and further into a maze and i dont know how to avoid our going deeper into it or how to get out from where we are now reluctantlyfor the first time making herself face the total reality of itolga acknowledged that zenin was right we cant let it happen fail i mean whats the way to stop it happening olga didnt have an answer the botanic gardens on moscows glavnyy botanicheskiy sad with their enormous tunnelshaped glassed exhibition halls had been the secret tryst for charlie and natalia after hed been sure enough of her lovewhich he wasnt any longerto admit his supposed defection to the then soviet union was phoney but that because of that love he was refusing to trigger his kgbwrecking return to london until hed guaranteed her safety from suspicion or recrimination there was a twitch of recognition when he was ushered into the presence of the psychiatrist whod analyzed the tapes and the transcripts of the george bendall encounters a slippershuffling housekeeperor maybe even the mans elderly and totally disinterested wifeled charlie through an echoing mausoleum of a hampstead house directly into a carbuncle of a glass greenhouse abandoning him at its tropicallyheated entrance from there he found his own sweaty way through giant fronded plants and ferns and sharp quilled brilliantly technicolored cacti to locate along the third path he followed the shoulderstooped cardiganed professor arnold nolan was in conversation with himself narrowspouted watering can in one hand snipping secateurs in the other his canopy of white hair more tangled than the foliage he was tending his patchworkpatterned slippers matched those of the elderly woman and charlieenvied their obvious troddenintocomfort shapelessness the man showed no surprise at charlies arrival beside him just slightly raising his voice above the earlier selfconversation he said plants have an intelligence you know they feel discomfort injury so ive been told said charlie perspiration was rivering his face and forming into tributaries down his back restful things plants ive come about the moscow tapes i know see that plant there dionaea muscipula have to feed it flies and insects isnt it pretty do you mind if i wait outside i find it very hot in here the man turned for the first time fixing charlie with pale blue eyes hot you think so very much so nolan wasnt sweating at all charlie saw the mans cardigan was thick all the buttons secured if you need to shant be long charlie returned gratefully to the outside corridor feeling the sweat dry upon him wondering if hed make his second meeting with geoffrey robertson when hed telephoned the pathologist the man had said he could only give him ten minutes and insisted charlie be on time an hour from now charlie heard the shuffled scuff of nolans approach before he saw the man he was talking to himself when he finally appeared or maybe charlie thought he was talking to the plants hed read that people did come on said nolan as he past and charlie obediently followed over his shoulder nolan said like to meet your man interesting i appreciate the difficulty of what im asking your not being able to do that awkward but not a problem said the psychiatrist some things are fairly obvious others not although hed never actually seen one charlie decided nolans office looked like the inside of a bears cave after a winters hibernation it was a completely shelved cavern of books which overflowed on to the floor and on to overstuffed leather chairs and acouch interspersed with apparently discarded papers and magazines and occasionally skeletal newspapers from which articles had been clipped the debris was so great that there were clearly delineated paths through it the most obvious to the overwhelmed leathertopped desk with side alleys to the bookshelves theres a chair said nolan waving to his right with a distracted arm as if hed forgotten where one might be when the man snapped his desk light on charlie saw his tapes and their transcripts were neatlysurprisinglystacked next to a pocketsized replay machine im only able to give youto suggesta general picture began nolan abruptly professional there are clear indications of a schizophrenia which is too often used as a catchall when people like myself cant think of a more positive diagnosis were not going to go all hollywood and suggest there are strange voices telling bendall what to do i suspect though that hes obsessional hed be very susceptible to being told what to do particularly if he loved or felt particularly close to the person giving the instructions what about more than one person a group interrupted charlie nolan pursed his lips possible but there would still need to be one person in that group upon whom he would need to focus but certainly a group could be important to him your notes were helpful hes classically dysfunctional alienated from a splintered home thats why the army might have been attractive to him somewhere in which he might have felt embraced a family he did know or have but i think it would have been too big too amorphous but a group a brotherhood wouldnt have been and lets get a correction in here because its important all the interviews so far have been wrongly directed the americans most of all bendall needs to be encouragedpraised admired loved if you like not ridiculed which has been the tone of everything ive listened to so far with yours as a possible partial exception from what youve said in your notes theres certainly more than one persona conspiracyinvolved here but bendall did what he did to become admired by his friends in the same mentally disturbed way that loners have attackedkilledfamous people to become famous themselves did hedoes heknow what he was doing broke in charlie again very much so thats part of it a very important part thats your way forward when you talk to him again how can i get him to tell me who the others are nolan gestured uncertainly from your interview more than any of the others i got the impression that he wants to tell someone after all his life being discarded and down trodden hes suddenly someone the object of everyones attention he wasnt just being used physically to fire a rifle he was being usedmanipulatedmentally those short staccato replies to you are indicative he believed he was playing with you testing you out let him go on thinking that let him think hes superior in charge theres something that wasnt in my notes that ive only just discovered said charlie somehowi dont know howbendall was administered with an unauthorized drug thiopentone it could have been during the american interview when he broke down could that have any long term effects combined with the other drugs with which hes being treated affect in fact how he might be in any future sessions nolan humped his shoulders you know what the prescribed drugs are charlie felt a burn of embarrassment im sorry now hes well out of surgery i guess itll just be some type of sedative suggested the psychiatrist thiopentone shouldnt react against any of the barbiturates so it wouldnt have caused that outburst during the american session the psychiatrist shook his head that was far more likely to have been caused by the way he was being talked to he was being ridiculed which was how hes been treated all his life he simply closed himself down why did he break all the models he made which his mother told me he did models of things that moved could have taken him away from an existence he hated had they been real noland judged that was his physical way of showing that hatred of his surroundingsmakinghis imagined escape and then smashing itbefore he began showing the actual violence towards others can i send you other tapes id like you to ive never worked like this before as i said its interesting and remember something else i told you let him think hes superior cleverer you going to find that difficult not at all said charlie ive been doing that all my life the pathologist was wearing a clean laboratory coat but it was again at least two sizes too small geoffrey robertson gave the same answer as the psychiatrist when asked about thiopentone but promised to get a definitive assessment from a pharmacologist if charlie sent back from moscow george bendalls complete medication list cant understand the point of it being done said the man that is the point of it being done said charlie for people not to be able to understand why and its working brilliantly with the needminimally productive though it turned outfor a second meeting with the pathologist charlie had put back for an hour his appointment with the ballistics expert at the woolwich arsenal but he was still late and knew at once from the mans demeanor that archibald snelling had fantasized for the further delayed thirty minutes about the toothbrushed lavatory cleaning sentence he would have imposed in a much mourned earlier army career from the mans disapproving top to toe and sideways examination charlie guessed his appearance would probably have got him denied the toothbrush and that he would have had to scour with his bare hands if not his own toothbrush snelling had to be almost two meters tall and although there was a slight stomach sag in the parade ground rigidity his voice retained the cometoattention bark into the mans office which actually did overlook a parade ground came the occasional and distant sound of a weapon being discharged the only chair available was straightbacked and woodenseated and charlie turned and sat with one arm crooked over its rear rail just for the hell of it snelling was sitting to attention shoulders squared ramrod straight you got something more to tell me demanded snelling at once id hoped youd have something to tell me retorted charlie the aggressiveness was an abrupt contrast with the attempted helpfulness of the other specialists that day but then remembered charlie he had shown the manor his colleaguesto be lacking charlie was more irritated than offended he certainly wasnt intimidated i dont understand complained the man i dont either said charlie it might help if you explained in more detail what the problem is you dont have another dragunov photographs charlies feet twitched in aching unison slowly he said why would you expect me to have another dragunov color began to prick out on the mans already red face youre still only considering two rifles the one recovered from the arrested man and the unknown different caliber medved yes lets go into the workshop it was a march more than a walk along a connecting corridor and charlies feet hurt with the effort of keeping up it was a long room with what was obviously a firing range leading off to the right some with unmarked targets others with bulletrecoverable butts for analyses and comparison deeper into the room were benches equipped with vices and calibrating machinery and enhancing cameras snelling led past it all to the far end where there were the sort of backlighted viewing screens against which xrays are normally examined upon the entire bank were clipped what charlie realized when he got closer to be the hugely enlarged photographs of the bullets recovered from the moscow victims closer still he saw each was identified against the victims name separated by a gap was what were marked to be pictures of bullets test fired from bendalls gun by the american ballistics team were not interested in the mm bullets from the medved dismissed snelling a blackboard pointer now in his hand this he tapped the third print is the bullet recovered according to your notes from american secret serviceman jennings this the pointer went farther to the right is from the russian security man ivanov and these snelling moved over the division to the american prints are pictures described to me asbeing three separate test firings from the svd recovered from the gunman george bendall yes said charlie the svd bullet from ivanov is a better comparison than that from jennings although theres still just enough said the ballistics expert look at them theres no marking but look at the american test firings see it the pointer tapped impatiently theres a groove line on every one you know was rifling is charlie did but he said no snelling sighed the barrels of riflesparticularly snipers riflesare bored like the thread of a screw it increases accuracy and velocity theres a fault a snag in the rifling of the svd you say was used by george bendall any bullet fired from it would be scored like these three pictures of the american test firings show them to be identifiably marked but the bullets that hit jennings and ivanov are not theres substantial impact damage qualified snelling but they dont appear to be from the photographs with which ive been provided so they werent fired by george bendall ill go as far as saying that in my professional opinion its highly unlikely anne abbott was again waiting in the bar when charlie got back late to the dorchester what would you say if i told you the bullets that killed ben jennings and cost feliks ivanov his leg werent fired by george bendall demanded charlie id say holy shit and then id ask you to convince me in moscow the american embassy incident room quieted at john kayleys entry kayley said the president has accepted the resignation of paul smith as bureau director will it be enough queried someone in the room as far as i know there isnt anything else sir rupert dean said are you telling us george bendall didnt shoot anybody it was the first interruption since charlie had started to speak fifteen minutes earlier in the riverview conference room at millbank and he was enjoying the unqualified attention even jocelyn hamilton hadnt found anything to attack charlie said in the opinion of one ballistics expert with fifteen years of specific forensic experience matching bullets with guns it is highly unlikely from the photographs hes seen that the two bullets thought to have come from bendalls rifle were in fact fired from it hes now submitted what he examined to two other specialists for their independent assessment he also wants to examine the physical evidence all the recovered bullets and bendalls rifle until hes able to do that he says he cant be categorical will the russians release them demanded hamilton at last i wont know that until i get back said charlie at the moment theyre in the incident room at the american embassy it could be that their ballistics people have come to the same opinion and carried out the tests our man wants to conduct reached a definitive conclusion in fact you had this overnight known about it for fifteen hours protested hamilton whats wrong with the telephone all sorts of things if the calls made to the wrong place and number said charlie savoring being able to puncture the mans attempts so easily i spoke to morrison at our embassy on a secure line first thing this morning got him to check whats been made generally available by the americans on the incident room computers which are supposed to hold all the evidence we have its convenient our two embassies are so close it didnt take him long tocome back to me again on our own secure line there was nothing about this as of an hour ago so if the american have picked it up theyre not sharing it how do you read that asked jeremy simpson i dont said charlie they might not have found it yet if they have they might be holding it back to be some sort of bargaining counter to recover with the russians or they think its something only theyve discovered and dont intend sharing it at all if they havent got george bendall they havent got anyone who really matters neither have the russians simpson pointed out lets talk about that demanded patrick pacey more to the lawyer than anyone else how clear are we if what the director said is provable that bendall didnt shoot anyone they were aware of anne abbott charlie reminded himself and there seemed no longer any reason why he shouldnt refer to her charlie said a lawyer from the embassys legal department came back from moscow with me shes postponed her return because of this to discuss it and possibly get different instructions those instructions will have the advantage of russian law which i dont know in sufficient detail said simpson we accept theres a conspiracy which bendall has in some way to be part he was at the scene he had a gun and he fired it even if he didnt hit anybody if the bullets arent his i think it helps greatly with a mitigation plea like the fact that he was drunk and that theres a mental problem if we get the real conspirators in the dock we could possibly show bendall to be the totally manipulated dupe and if we dont get the real conspirators in court persisted the political officer weve got a defendable not guilty plea to murder a guilty pleawith the mitigation ive talked aboutto conspiracy to murder assessed simpson but lets not lose sight of the fact that under english law conspiracy to murderpremeditatedly planning a killing rather than committing the act in a moment of anger or passionis held to be worse than the actual crime itself so were not a great deal further forward said hamilton im not qualified to offer a legal opinion said patrick pacey what i can assess is our ability to offer a political and diplomatic defense and i think thats gone up tremendously and in so doing continues to justify this department agreed the directorgeneral looking pointedly at his deputy and his continued posting in moscow charlie recognized he wondered how natalia would feel about that when he told her if he told her he probably wouldnt he hadnt talked to her in any detail about the initial criticism in london which was now virtually immaterial anyway it had been a more conscious decision to withhold the uncorroborated ballistic findings even before shed told him of the fsb confrontation during the previous evenings call despite getting the unintended admissions and concessions from the insufficiently programmed secondary witnesses shed gone farther than he would have liked or suggested in summoning the chairman of the fsb particularly with the presidential uncertainty and it surprised him he was even more anxious now to get back to moscow and talk to her about it what else was there for the two of them to talk about nothing charlie decided at once no commitment no recriminations therefore no guilt jocelyn hamilton said are we in any way affected by the dismissal of the fbi director i dont see why we should be said pacey its obviously a political gesture a pretty dramatic attempt to recover by the americans desperate almost might that not indicate that they havent got the ballistic analyses yet queried dean i dont think so charlie came in quickly always aware that sir rupert was an academic not a sewer soulmate you want to burst a dam you set a heavy enough charge to ensure everythings engulfed the entire responsibility for the breakdown between america and russia has been dumped upon their director whos blown away charged convicted and sentenced if not to death then to career oblivion washingtons adopting russian precedentpurgingis easier for russian to understand and hopefully to be enticed back into the sharing communal fold we do need to be part of a sharing communal fold dont we suggested sir rupert dean charlie was way ahead of the older mans reasoningwhy in fact irrespective of todays discussion hed never intended sharing the woolwich arsenal doubts until he got back to moscowbut showing the deferential diplomatic awareness that would have surprised everyone in the room he said i think so sir for all the reasons weve already discussed so weve got the way to achieve it havent we said dean charlie smiled as if in initial understanding yes we have havent we viktor ivanovich karelin was someone who stroveand succeededto be the sort of man crowds were made of inconspicuous unrecognized and unknown he actually cultivated the amorphic graynessgray face gray hair gray suittraditional for an intelligence head but which was all the more necessary in the current leadership flux he was a kgbera bureaucrat politicallyand willinglypromoted by the president as a hopeful bridge across which the old would cross to the new in attitude and allegiance which some although not all attitudes and allegiances had and which added to what the pliably adaptable karelin viewed as a major personal problem his now being stranded in the middle of the bridge without knowing which side visibly to head for sending gennardi mittel in his place had put him on the traditional side of the divide he had never in a million years expected the unthinkably directhumiliatingchallenge which had to mean that the intelligence he had so far had analysed on the likely successionand aleksandr mikhailevich okulovs strengthwas questionable in which case there had potentially been a very bad miscalculationa mistake for which professional analysts would be called to explainand from which he had to recover or at least put himself back in the middle of the bridge the problem was getting back there without losing any further face the truthor what he believed to be the truthwould actually add to the humiliation there was none of the arrogant strut of his previous days emissarywhen karelin entered the kremlin room although there was a selfenclosed confidence about the man when he sat folded his hands in his lap and waited to be addressed ive come this farreluctantlynow you come to me only yuri trishin knew what the fsb chairman looked like so completely did karelin preserve his anonymity and that recognition came from an unpublished photograph on presidential record not from any personal meeting the photograph had been badly lit to be intentionally misleading natalias immediate impression was of a selfassured professional she hoped she was right it would meanshould mean if she were rightthat he wouldnt be taking this personally it would have been worrisome that he looked intently and undividedly at all three of themherself last and most intently of allas if identifying them had she not earlier that morning received the acting presidents signed congratulations for her previous days handling of the fsb opposition the moment for their meetinthemiddle diplomacy decided natalia thank you chairman viktor ivanovich for coming today im afraid there was a misunderstanding said karelin there was a slight sibilant speech impediment which is what we believed it to have been said natalia hands extended hands touched no embarrassment i would like to help the commission if i could we hope you can said natalia more positively nudge him off the prepared path she thought was the fsb actively involved in the attempted assassination of the russian and american presidents karelin gave no facial or physical reaction whatsoever neither did he artificially hesitate as if surprised or offended by the question no not a hard enough push natalia decided remembering the telephone call from leonid zenin has the fsb any assets within the burdenko hospital i dont understand that question said karelin again without hesitation hed demanded briefings on every possible question but the hospital hadnt been mentioned its a very simple one said natalia is there someone on the medical staff of the burdenko hospital who is an informant or operative of the fsb there would have been when the organization was the kgb there hadnt been a government body civilian institution or supposed independent organization that hadnt been infiltrated not to my knowledge you are the chairman viktor ivanovich such awareness would be far below your personal knowledge wouldnt it karelins concentration was absolute the two men either side of natalia non existent yes this is a presidential commission we have the highest security clearance karelin was churning inwardly bewildered by the questioning i acknowledge that the fsb has taken over the responsibilities of the kgb beside her natalia was conscious of pavl filitov shifting noisily and decided the federal prosecutor was communicating with karelin in sympathetic body language it was going to be a surprise for him and trishin when she stopped allowing both to hide behind her skirts knowing as they did of okulovs congratulatory letter both men were noticeably deferential in a greatly reduced and publicly accountable way natalia could not have anticipated that response and for a moment she needed to recompose herselfadjust her mindto the maximum benefit does the fifth chief directorate still exist i had forgotten you were once a kgb officer said karelin a weak responseweak threatnatalia decided does the fifth chief directorate still exist with greatly reduced functions and no longer under that designation she had to be careful not to demean the man will you undertake to have the former fifth chief directorate whose responsibility was to emplace kgb agents and informants in all public services checked to see if your succeeding organization has an asset within burdenko hospital not without knowing the reason for such an enquiry karelinlistened expressionlessly still physically unmoving to natalias explanation and didnt speak for several moments after shed finished when he did he said i will have that search made we appreciate your cooperation smiled natalia she gave herself pause to anticipate the moment then she said ill now hand the inquiry over to my colleagues there was a deafening silence more disconcerting for both filitov and trishin by the way the fsb chairman visibly moved his head between them in expectation it was the federal prosecutor who finally verbally stumbled into the exchange and almost at once natalia was conscious of karelin relaxing settling more obviouslycomfortablyinto his chair filitovand occasionally trishinrecited their questions never once pressing the man nor did they pick up from the concessions that had been prised out of the previous days witnesses after their dismissal of gennardi mittel karelin was clearly a professional so he would be reading the encounterparticularly trishins part in itas she was the presidential chief of staff was nervous deferring to the other man so he was uncertain of the current political situation according the organization karelin representedand karelin himselfthe respect of fear russias intelligence apparatus had always commanded there was another more personaland disconcertingconclusion to be drawn she hadnt properly succeeded in including either trishin or filitov in the difficult questioning so she was very obviously isolated it would be wrong for her to show the unease of the men sitting on either side of her natalia chose a hesitant gap from filitov and said we yesterday took evidence from four officials of the registry and achives department which appears to have remained unchanged in the reorganization that is so it was agreed that the records of peter bendalland those upon his familywould have been specially assigned to be retained not disposed of that is so repeated karelin none of the witnesses we questioned yesterday could accountfor their disappearance can you help us about what might have happened to them there was clearly an unauthorized removal stolen you mean pressed natalia yes confirmed karelin the reorganization since the early nineties has been substantial something in the region of personnel have been released ill feeling was inevitable the bendall dossier is not the only instance of interference and tampering of sabotage is it the wish of this commission that i have investigated every one of the people who have been dismissed condescension invited by the deference of filitov and trishin recognized natalia im sure we can bring that down to manageable proportions registry would have the names of every control under whom peter bendall operated after his arrival here people who would know the existence of everything involving the family theyd also know which if any officer associated with the bendalls is among those discharged from the service and likely to be disaffected thats a very constructive suggestion said karelin it would help all of us involved now to be able to talk to the officer described by the mother as having spoken specifically to george bendall when he was being disruptive at home pressed natalia its noted it was suggested by the mother that during that disruptive period the kgb arranged psychiatric counselling for george bendall registry would have the identity of that psychiatrist wasnt that put to registry personnel yesterday queried the man they said they were not aware of the treatment wed like the question reemphasized with your authority it will be and i think we can even more tightly confine the search for officers who removed material from your archives said natalia it was only positively decided in the last four months that the american president was actually coming here for the summit so it was only in the last four months that the conspirators would have hadany need for the bendall files no one to whom we talked yesterday from registry and archives was seemingly able to help but if called upon by you personally i would have hoped they could have even remembered people showing an interest in the material wouldnt you karelins smile could only have been of admiration for her laserlike paring of possibilities but it was still glacial i would have hopes so too i think we might have made considerable progress today chairman karelin i trust that we have we can look forward to hearing from you very soon then you will hear from me promised karelin the smile was glacial again guerguen agayan limited the attempt to fifteen minutes but bendalls response to every question either zenin or olga put to him was to hum the wailing tune and zenin gave up after only ten they withdrew to the cluttered office of nicholai badim zenin said so hes worse i dont think theres an actual deterioration said the psychiatrist i think that was todays game has he spoken coherently to you asked olga there hadnt been a chance to listen to the permanently maintained recording barely but he understands what im asking him whats he say about the injection he cant remember it being done whether or not it was the americans im surprised hes out of bed said zenin turning to badim the surgeon said physically hes healing remarkably well i didnt want any lung congestion from his being kept in bed how long will he be confined to a wheelchair pressed olga the problem is the conflicting injuries said badim his shoulder isnt strong enough to support his weight on crutches and he cant use his fractured leg unsupported so how long insisted zenin several weeks three at least said the surgeon but hes recovering well very well said badim although doubtfully knowing there was a point to the questioning and he understands whats being said to him demanded zenin of the psychiatrist i believe so said agayan so theres no reason why he shouldnt be arraigned in court in a wheelchairappear in public and be formally charged badim looked uncertainly to the psychiatrist and then back to zenin no medical reason allowed the doctor the public dont know whats going on zenin said to olga so its the militia who are getting all the media criticism for the investigation making no progress im going to move for a court appearance the british airways flight began its descent over moscows flat firdotted western plain towards sheremetyevo and obediently charlie and anne secured their seat belts its been a trip of discovery declared anne her legal briefing had been as jeremy simpson anticipated but she was excited at the drama of the defense to murder in all sorts of ways agreed charlie the wheels snatched at the ground and they were pushed back in their seats by the reverse thrust of the engines thanks for showing me liberaces piano its a must on every cultural visit readjustment of friendship now that were back on home territory she suggested it might be an idea lets see the impatient embassy chauffeur on the arrival concourse said charlie was to contact donald morrison as quickly as possible so charlie used the car phone morrison said president yudkin died an hour ago the death of lev maksimovich yudkin ratcheted up by varying degrees the pressure upon everyone and marked the beginningalthough at the time unrealizedof eventual awareness of a few of them sir michael parnell personally unavoidably reinvolved himself and was waiting with richard brooking when charlie and anne abbott reached the embassy the premature relief of both diplomats to their overeager overinterpretative acceptance of the ballistics information was abruptly tempered by annes explanation that there still appeared a prima facie case of conspiracy against george bendall that explanation stretched to a detailed summary of accusations possible under russian law up to and including terrorism which like conspiracy to murder carried the death penalty she hoped to be able to give them better guidance the following day after her initial meeting with the russian lawyer engaged to lead bendalls defence charlie used the same needtobringmyselfuptodate escape finally to end the empty encounter which he did with a hopefully selfbenefiting assurance to both knickerwettingor perhaps more distastefully knickerfoulingdiplomats that he would alert them to anything professionally relevant charlie had actually left the embassy and was making his way past the zoo before he realized that in their totally consuming objectivity he and anne had parted in the embassy as professionals making personally disassociated arrangements for the following day and not as lovers who had explored every sexual depth and height together it was at about the same time of the still unembarrassed return that charlie remembered too he hadnt followed up his embassy arrival message on natalias personal lesnaya answering machine that he was finally on his way home and by then there wasnt anyoint in calling she was at the mansion apartment when he got there she looked tired positively careworn the skirt of her suit creased from several days wear it was still waterpocked from bathing sasha and her hair was straggled for the first time charlie was conscious that although there wasnt any gray natalias once lustrous auburn hair was fading she gestured towards herself and said i expected you to call again tell me you were on your way i was it was a heavy meeting you look wonderful ive had a heavy day too sashas asleep i didnt tell her you were coming home in case you were delayed shes missed you it came out like a readfromacard statement what about you demanded charlie what about you returned natalia in an echo do you have to ask that bastard he accused himself it was your question yes i missed you and worried about you and missed and worried about sasha as well doubletreblebastard im glad youre back this is for you it was a diamond bar brooch hed bought from the dontforget jewellers shop in the dorchester foyer she stared into the box for several moments its lovely and thank you but i told you not to ill leave sashas beside her bed to be there when she wakes up as he positioned the ribbontied package charlie saw an identical doll already perched on the edge of sashas toy box one eye collapsed in what looked like a wink i forgot it was from the last trip wasnt it shit natalia whod come into the bedroom with him said we can say its a sister or that her father is an idiot to whator involving whomdid that excoriation apply its a sister insisted natalia why was he so on edge the awkwardness between them wasnt entirely of his making charlie tried to assure himself there was an overpoliteness two people who didnt know the other very well each anxiously waiting for the others lead he said we didnt kiss hello no we didnt did we she agreed she sounded uninterested when they did kiss that was polite too dutiful back in the main room he went through the familiar drink making ritual and as he handed natalia her wine he said youll have more to talk about than me she did and it was thirty minutes and another drink later before she finished ending with the decision to arraign bendall in open court youve got the monkey not the organ grinders protested charlie i dont know what that means we havent got the real assassins just their performer its publiclypoliticallynecessary now that the president has died whos pushed for it to be so quick the militia initially now the kremlins taken over we know it wasnt bendalls bullet that killed yudkin reminded charlie urgently in fact it doesnt look as if bendall shot anybody doesnt look like it to whom demanded natalia she listened to charlies account as intently as hed listened to hers when he finished she said i see what you mean then make others see urged charlie its going to be a show trial like the show trials of the s but this time not just the outside world but russia will recognize the staging recognize that the people responsible arent going to be accused politically itll be a disaster yes it will be natalia agreed in further understanding argue against it insisted charlie its not a decision in which im personally involved have any part of youre at the very center of everything except this youve got the ear of people the federal prosecutor and yuri trishin for christs sake who can be more involved that those two maybe it needs rethinking natalia conceded you told me okulov backed you when you confronted karelin further reminded charlie that strengthhis confidencewill be known now wherever its necessary to be spread an empty trial which this will be will make okulov look ridiculous its an independent legal decision bollocks rejected charlie itll be twisted by okulovs opponents to be his decision in his eagerness properly to take over as president natalia offered her glass to be refilled again as charlie was doing it she said were talking politics russian politics at that i thought our jobyour job particularlywas to solve a crime okulov backed you against the fsb i dontwe dontwant okulov displaced natalia was silent for several minutes i hadnt thought that far forward now we have you have ill make the point as strongly as you can encouraged charlie as strongly as i can promised natalia they prepared dinner togetherstarting with the beluga hed bought at the airportand halfway through charlie realized that the polite reservation had gone that night though when he reached out for her natalia had turned her back he changed the gesture into arranging the covering more closely around her before turning sleeplessly on to his back somewhere hed professionally missed something he decided something that he was sure even though he didnt know what or where it could be was important vital even then he wondered what anne was doing and wished he hadnt arkadi semenovich noskov was a huge man both in height and girth and made to look even bigger by the full unclipped beard like a black canopy over his chest the bass profundo voice rumble from low within the barrel chest and charlie thought the man would have better occupied one of the opera stages natalia had tried so unsuccessfully to convince him he should enjoy than a courtroom charlie hoped that in the theater noskov had chosen he wouldnt be called upon to sing too many tragedian lament although the performancein which charlie had so far featured that day werent encouraging charlies biggest frustration was not being able to disclose the russian intention to arraign george bendall which made largely pointless this first conference with the lawyer charlies dissatisfaction was compounded by the outcome of every telephone call hed so far made in attempted anticipation of the meeting the first had been to the incident room and after outlining the british ballistic opinion he said the rifleand the bulletsarent any longer at the american embassy they were withdrawnphysically removed by olga melnikwhen the militia walked out of the cooperation arrangements our ballistics experts will only provide a definitive opiniontestify if called upon to do soif they can scientifically examine bendalls weapon and its not usual for the prosecution to make physical evidence available for defense analyses either rumbled noskov im surprised they did in the first place he looked directly at anne and you know from your consultations in london that its unlikely theyll limit themselves to one charge which brings us back to mental impairment said anne it was charlies cue to recount his london meeting with the home office psychiatrist which he concluded with a forewarning from another of his unproductive calls ive tried to speak to olga melnik but was told shes unavailable ive left messages telling her were going to the hospital weve been officially told we wont be able to interview bendall alone reminded anne theyre making simultaneous recordings noskov pointed out wed hardly gain anything by being by ourselves with the man do we have russian psychiatrists available asked anne the huge man nodded but i want to see bendall by myselfwith just you twofirst i want to gain my own impression before getting theirs charlie half expected olga melnik to be waiting for them at the burdenko hospital but she wasnt there was no attempted body search by the foyer protection squad but they insisted upon examining the briefcases that noskov and anne carried only guerguen agayan waited beyond the cordon at bendalls ward noskov said to the obviously alerted second group two of you stay the rest get out to make room ill stay too insisted the psychiatrist i dont want another collapse charlie was impressed by the lawyers unchallenged command even with only two guards and the doctor remaining noskovs size meant the room was crowded as the embassy car had been bringing them anne squashed into a corner of the rear seat with charlie gratefully relegated to the front beside the driver from the moment of their entering the solitary ward charlies concentration upon george bendall was absolute registering the mans consciousness of everything around him instantly isolating the intentness with which bendalls eyes followed the initial chairshuffling uncertainty of accommodating themselves in the confined space charlie was very aware of how close to him anne had to sit he had to learn across her physically touching positioning the tape recorder carefully away from the already operating russian equipment remember me georgi invited charlie noskov had agreed during their cramped drive that charlie should try to follow the london psychiatrists direction bendall didnt respond his attention entirely upon the gargantuan russian lawyer its good to see you out of bed said charlie who hadnt imagined the man would have been fit enough to be put into a chair the injured shoulder didnt look to be wrapped so heavily and without the head bandages the fair hair flopped greasily bendall continued to look unwaveringly at the bearded russian charlie said youve given us a hell of a lot of work georgi and were getting nowhere you really planned everything very well didnt you the attention faltered briefly bendalls eyes flickering towards charlie who went on i dont just mean us the british everyone else too america russia youre really leading us by the nose bendall finally looked properly towards charlie a smile twitching at the corners of his mouth the wailing hum was almost inaudible charlie said i dont know what were going to do admit were beaten i guess the dirge grew stronger noskov shifted creaking his overburdened chair charlie said you knew you could do it didnt you georgi beat us course i did thats what everyones going to recognize how much better than anyone else youve been i know i wonder if that kgb guy will realize it the one who talked to you with your father that time bendall frowned but said nothing you remember that time wasnt frightened im sure you werent not someone capable of doing what youve done now wouldnt do what they wanted when i got in the army charlie thought he heard annes intake of breath what was that georgi what did they want you to do doesnt matter not now it would have mattered to them if you refused thought they had me but they didnt why would they think that because of your father no rejected bendall loud voiced didnt need him never needed him always your own man flattered charlie could he chance it they helped you get in the army though didnt become their man because of it not like my father taught them a lesson this could be the opening of the gate thought charlie hopefully if the kgb had got bendall into the army he would have had a control they must have been pissed off at that made life difficult had people argue with you try to persuade you tried didnt work he must have got into a lot of trouble the man who tried to persuade you took him away the lead at last there was a man who came to see you like they came to see your father yes a soldier like you i bet he wasnt as good as you with a rifle bendall smiled at the continued blandishments wasnt a marksman charlie breathed in deeply what was his name georgi dont remember the reply was too quick but it would be wrong to press to risk the gates closing the control would have joined bendalls unit around the same time as bendall was installed giving them a date from which the name could be deduced from the mans withdrawal i suppose you had to use all the skills you learned in the army to set your white house operation up it must have taken a lot of time a lot of planning clever certainly that youre going to be very famous theyre going to know georgi gugin therell be books written bendalls eyes moved back to the lawyer who was sitting with his head slumped beard flowing over his chest part of the preparation was for noskov to remain unidentified charlie said no thats not right there wont be books the remark brought bendall back to him frowning yes there will charlie shook his head not the way youve organized it theres not enough known for anyone to write a book a book needs all the facts and information we do know about vasili gregorovich though know that he was killed drugged and left to die in front of the train i really dont understand that vasili gregorovich isakov was your friend your special friend why did he have to be murdered wasnt he doing things properly obeying orders bendalls uninjured arm began to twitch violently and charlie tensed for another uncontrolled outburst agayan came forward too bendall said the bastard killed him the voice was uneven snagging the words agayan said easy georgi easy now to charlie he said youll have to stop whos the bastard georgi tell me encouraged charlie ignoring the warning thats enough insisted agayan i know who said bendall more controlled hes all right charlie told the psychiatrist to bendall he said they should be punished for killing vasili attacking your group have been charlie knew hed lose itlose bendallwith one wrong word but he didnt know how to go on people should be told know what happens to anyone who attacks you yes there was movement from the doorway where the two guards were but charlie didnt look wanting to hold bendalls eyes which were very clear and quite alert the man knew what they were talking about understood what was being said by comparison charlie felt he was blindfolded into charlies mind echoed the psychiatrists words i got the impression that he wants to tell someone after all his life being discarded and downtrodden hes suddenly someone the focus of everyones attention the television of the shooting was incredible its been seen in every country in the world millions of people have watched there was a positive smile bendall didnt speak a world stage with you on it the smile stayed yes charlie saw a way to continue thats how it should go on i want it therell be cameras at the trial everyone will be watching you listening to you arkadi noskov stirred there was more movement noise from the doorway bendall said thatll be good it was the prearranged time determined charlie arkadi semenovitch noskov is your lawyer hell be with you in court we all will be to help you came in noskov perfectly on time there are things you want to tell the court maybe withdrew bendall cautiously you want them to know dont you the earlier ordering command had gone from the sonorous voice it was coaxing now inviting maybe theyll have to know everything to understand and itll be important not to miss anything out able for the first time to break his total concentration charlie saw that despite their tape recorder anne was hurriedly scribbling notes on a large legal pad he couldnt see beyond the two remaining guards at the door agayan was sat back seemingly content with bendalls recovery nothing will be missed out said bendall well have to prepare carefully make sure of that yes bendalls smile was back thats my job said noskov making sure nothings left out you want everyone to know about vasili isakov yes then well need to talk about it for me to know all there is you understand that dont you i suppose so charlie was nervous of the obvious doubt aching to reenter the exchange but that wasnt part of their car cramped rehearsal it all has to come out to make the impact you want encouraged noskov and charlie relaxed i want to think about it charlie abruptly realized that bendall was relaxing too formulating proper sentences instead clippping his responses to one or two words id like you to do that urged the lawyer youve thought about it already havent you of course i have people will be surprised wont they itll be sensational we know it will well have to go through it before we get to court though so that i can guarantee we dont forget anything i wont forget its best that we talk about it first there might be things ill have to do evidence ill have to find to confirm what youre going to say i want to stop now think declared bendall id like to talk a little further tried noskov when i want to insisted bendall exercising his imagined control not when you want to i dont want him pushed said agayan the british psychiatrists assessment had been remarkable accurate thought charlie compared against all the other interviews theyd made quantum leaps forward but did he have a comparison against all the interviews now that the russians werent sharing information anymore the situation between himself and olga melnik had to be resolved as quickly as possible well come again tomorrow at the same time noskov was saying ill see postured bendall go now i want to think charlie had to stand to reach across anne again for their tape machine and as he did so he saw nicholai badim in the outer corridor olga melnik was expressionless beside him they needed the large waiting room not badims smaller office from the way olga went through the ritual of introduction to arkadi noskov charlie guessed she knew of the mans reputation even if she hadnt met him before olgas attitude towards anne abbott was cursory to the point of being dismissive no one sat the hospital surgeonadministrator looked hopefully for guidance between everyone else in the room but was disappointed agayan sat quietly in a corner charlie told olga ive been trying to reach you he wondered what he could conjure from this encounter olga said i got the message thats why im here you and i have a lot of operational things to discuss apart from today said charlie those operational things have changed not between you and i our two countries the investigation has moved on to what it was encouraging charlie thought its officiallylegallyunder the direction of the justice ministry how can that be noskovs voice was like a thunder roll the facts have been laid for an official arraignment the declaration removed the restrictive frustration between himself and the two lawyers but as always part of charlies mind was way ahead of the current conversation looking for darkened alleys and hidden side tracks he didnt believe olgas being there was in direct response to his earlier attempted contact although his messages was that he would be at burdenko was she trying to separate him further from the americans by the premature announcement if she were there was every reason to go along with the invitation even though he was sure by now that natalia was not keeping anything back as pivotal though they both imagined her to be a lot could be withheld from natalia if not positive information attitudes and intentions it was important for them personally always protectively to get indications of before they were instigated noskovs attention was on the doctor is bendall fit enough to go to court for an initial arraignment confirmed the man and mentally hes capable added agayan he simply mustnt be crowded pushed responding to annes whispered aside noskov said ill seek independent medical advice on that there are restrictions on access said olga ill want those examinations to be in the presence of this doctor a hospital panel if necessary you can make your application condescended olga i dont see how bendall can be arraigned on what i understand so far to be the available evidence protested noskov thats a matter for legal judgment and interpretation avoided olga easily what are the formal court charges going to be demanded noskov imperious voiced again olga wasnt as cowed as the ward guards again a decision for the justice ministry and the federal prosecutor the militia function has been to present the evidence charlie saw the opening evidence it is officially agreed between our two countriesbetween london and moscowshould be shared i know you have withdrawn material from the american incident room but i expect that agreement still to exist between the two of us again that is no longer a matter for me said olga all the evidence has been passed over to the federal prosecutor it has to be hisand the ministrysdecision if the arrangement still exists we will make formal diplomatic requests said anne of course you will patronized olga charlie gestured back along the corridor you have just duplicated the recording of a conversation between bendall and his legal advisors there is no legal prohibition upon our doing that noskov nodding his head in agreement charlie said has there been any further interrogationrussian interrogationsince the claimed injection medically proven injection corrected the woman medical proven injections gritted charlie and waited there may have been it was her first overconfident lapse olga ivanova you are the chief investigating officer you would personally have conducted any subsequent interviews color spread up from the russian detectives throat any subsequent interviews would form part of the evidence already filed on record and held by the federal prosecutor and forbidden to us demanded anne ive no way of knowing what the ministry or prosecution response would be to an official request for access which will be legally filed promised noskov and diplomatically made as well according to the terms of our agreement supported anne olga melnik was a messenger boyor girlcharlie realized answering his earlier uncertainty but well briefed by whom he wondereddont get sore get even he reminded himself invoking one of the axioms of life as our professional cooperation appears to be over you cant expect me to pass on the evidence thats been gathered in london olgas hesitation was so long it was as if the breath had been taken from her at last she managed i most certainly would if it contributed to the further progress of the investigation which i thought was being pursued independently now goaded charlie thered been a miscalculation he guessed briskly he said to the lawyers lets go to make those representations as quickly as we can hopefully get things back on course theres a lot else for us to do as you know in the car noskov said its political anne said but stupid or something said charlie his feet throbbed to a metronome beat espionage had been a fucking sight easier than this charlie arrived at the american embassy just before noon dropped off at novinskij bulvar by the two lawyers on their way back to their respective offices to file their respective protests promising both as he got out of the car that hed call if he thought there was anything relevant from the now isolated american investigation the fbi station chief was waiting in the incident room closely flanked by donald morrison after the younger mans backup during his london absence charlie didnt have the heart to exclude the man now that hed returned charlie anticipated some sort of outburst from the crumpled cigarperfumed american at the news of the impending court appearance but john kayley remained reflectively silent he didnt initially interrupt either when charlie began outlining the bendall bullet disparity but then abruptly held up a stopping hand to lead the way through the linking corridor to the improvised laboratory and the american ballistics scientist willie ying said at once weve been waiting for your corroboration is that why it isnt computerized yet angrily demanded the ignored mi man its your defense against a murder charge said kayley in a smooth defense of his own you wouldnt have wanted the russians knowing about it in advance if it had only been a temporary walkout would you the dont get sore get even philosophy was american remembered charlie it would be good somehow to give morrison his personal chance but not now and the man was soon going to learn how things were eked out did you get actual test firings before the rifle was removed the chinese smiled twenty fired at measured graduation from in front and from behind the measurable distance from which bendall shot not a score mark on any of them not that distance has got anything to do with it the best guess is that bendalls bullets went off somewhere in the park behind the white house weve actually looked said kayley i had guys examine the most obvious treesanything that might have stopped a bulletin the line of fire came up with nothing there was a shift of increasing anger from donald morrison but before the younger man could speak charlie said i need those testfired bullets from the runaround i got from olga melnik this morning i dont think ill get the rifle for my people to test you got it guaranteed kayley well need testimony as well pressed charlie there was a shrugged headnodding exchange between the two americans kayley said you got that as well itll be good to show the bastards how wrong they were walking out on us charlie couldnt quite adjust the reasoning but it wasnt something to dispute he didnt physically need the rifle and anne had her dramatic defense to at least one of the charges likely to be brought one good turn deserves another charlie thought offering that mornings tape hed brought to be copied into the evidence collection he said george bendall wants to tell us all about it he wondered if morrison imagined he was a team player or whether the man realized the rules were only applied one way it might mitigate the humiliation of his being ignored by the americans kayley smiled as he listened halfway through he ignited an aromatic cigar when the replay ended kayley said he does doesnthe then he said you take bendall just a little further down the road and were going to have the others the bastard whoever he is and the russian militia will come crawling back the last part was further reasoning that charlie found difficulty with but he didnt dispute that either lets hope i can take him further kayley said ive got to go upstairs there are people wholl want to hear this theyre bastards too said morrison vehemently as he and charlie returned to the main incident room dont take it personally soothed charlie theyd have tried to fuck me if i hadnt come up with it you sure demanded morrison positive said charlie who wasnt but wanted to help the other man hope i havent disturbed your room too much said morrison when they reached it to charlie it didnt appear to have been occupied by anyone else he settled into his place with its convenient foot rest and logged on to his computer to bring himself up to date scrolling patiently through the alphabetically assembled files stopping abruptly at the name vasili gregorovich isakov it had been compiled by three named fbi agents and ran to twelve pages although it wasnt the written material that immediately interested charlie three photographs had been scanned on to the disk john kayley was again included with the ambassador and the secretary of state for the satellite link with washington but only walter anandale and his chief of staff were waiting at the white house end hed have to wait kayley knew but it was difficult so weve got a new game opened the president which we need to play very carefully advised james scamell how said anandale i think you need to come back for yudkins funeral you serious there are still guys out there who tried to kill me as serious as its possible to be mr president your not attending will be read every which way all of them bad one spinwill be that youre too scared another that youre abandoning okulov to be beaten by the communists who are incidentally demanding an immediate election to confirm an elected president then theres the treaty theres growing media speculation that there was a hidden agenda that we never ever really intended to conclude it and that it was a cosmetic dance to go on until yudkin got confirmed for a second term wendall north admired the secretary of states diplomacy scamell wasnt talking of moscows media pressure he would have got from his own people at foggy bottom that mornings washington post story of a potential paper trail from oil contract firms finally being followed to anandales election funding the chief of staff said i go along with jamies assessment mr president were in a box here with only one way out whats happening with the investigation john avoided anandale kayley had risked holding back from either the secretary of state or the ambassador the russian decision to arraign bendall wanting to present it ahead of any official announcement as his personal discovery despite the breakdown with the moscow militia he also explained the ballistic evidence as an exclusive detection of the fbi team he headed he had to concede the british would be the source of any statement from bendall from which it might be possible to locate the others in the conspiracy but did so inferring that britain needed bureau manpower and scientific expertise to continue the investigation find the people who shot ruth picked out the president instantly if we get the statement the brits expect backtracked kayley now were getting there enthused anandale im giving it to you as its come to me said kayley stressing the impression of urgency at the same time as shielding himself from questions he couldnt answer theres a lot i need explained further pieces to fit together weve got things to talk about when i get there john hinted anandale to the secretary of state he said is it going to be a state occasion world leaders id imagine so said scamell find out ordered the president heres how well run it ill come early for meetings with the british premier and the french president overnight either in london or paris so i can be in and out of moscow from either city the same day as the funeral you need to meet with okulov insisted scamell not to do so would be worse than not going at all said north in continued support im not giving anything away for nothing said anandale you make it clear whichever way its necessary that i wont meet okulov if their damned investigators dont come back to the table he hesitated everything else stands im out of there the same day ok its obvious the british are getting through to bendall insisted olga taking the russian copy of the interview tape from the machine on the table between her and leonid zenin and were getting every word of it the militia commander pointed out if we do get a lead to the rest of them arraigning bendall will be premature its out of our hands now said zenin and its not a trial its a public arraignment for public consumption the formal laying of the formal charges the prosecutor can apply for adjournments as long as we ask him you sure its wise shutting out the british as were shutting out the americans pressed olga theyve obviously got something or bluffing olga shook her head i dont think he was bluffing well see how their next interview goes decided zenin we can easily get back together if it turns out to be really productive he was silent for several moments in fact it might be an idea if you were actually present able to see as well as hear for ourselves were going to come out well from this olga ivanova olga smiled at his automatically talking in the plural of both of them i think we already have you got it charlie agreed anne excitedly an absolute defense to murder an expert witness even id still prefer him to be british said charlie he was distracted by the isakov file like so many other unresolved impressionsfrustrationsthere was something in it demanding to be seen but like all the others he couldnt see it ive filed the diplomatic protest sos noskov legally anne was disappointedcurious evenat how subdued charlie was were still short of too much else he was glad hed printed off the isakov material to bring back to the embassy to go over it further there could be the breakthrough with bendall if you continue teasing him along as well as you did today and that could be as early as tomorrow her ambition was making her overconfidenceor overexpectantcharlie decided then all our problems will be over or just beginning misery guts realist he corrected anne put into its designated order the material charlie carried into her office thirty minutes earlier and gestured vaguely in the direction of the embassys residential apartment block the weary end to a long day you fancy a happy hour drink charlie couldnt at that moment imagine anything he would have enjoyed more no ok anne showed no offense no anger at a rebuff which charlie hadnt intended it to be that night natalia came to him in bed and the lovemaking was as uninhibited and passionate as he could ever remember even from their first excited discovery days afterwards natalia said im sorry charlie sorry for too long being such a shit weve both been shits said charlie and at last felt the overdue and searing guilt viktor ivanovich karelin was the first intelligence chairman natalia had ever personally met but the apparent diffidence was so alien to the lower hierarchy with whom she was familiar that she was vaguely disconcerted by it which she acknowledged she was perhaps supposed to be although she didnt get the impression there was any affectation about the selfeffacing demeanour another interpretation could be that karelin was so sure of himself and the power he represented that he didnt feel the need to posture and intimidate thank you for returning to us so quickly greeted natalia what would the man have managed to achieve in thirtysix hours compared to what their presidentendorsed demand to the defense ministry had generated in less than twelve five of those with the previous night intervening it would be important for herthe tribunalnot to appear to try to trap the man you stressed the urgency reminded karelin were indeed anxious to hear what you have to tell us said filitov stilted in his eagerness to get himself on the everkept record there has clearly been considerable malicious interferencepossibly destructionof a substantial proportion of archival material concerning peter bendall and his family admitted karelin at once i have instituted an enquiry the results of which i will make fully available to this commission when it is completed honesty or yet further prevarication she was the trained interrogator natalia reminded herself this malicious interference is it indiscriminate consistent with the haphazard pilfering by disgruntled former personnel about which we talked earlier or is there a pattern a smile wisped across karelins face there is unquestionably a pattern had the smile been admiration or something else having been specific natalia intentionally generalized help us with that no material whatsoever remains for what would have been the last five years of peter bendalls life and the son nothing which there wouldshouldhave been unquestionably the woman with her kgb background was the only one who might be difficult the lawyer and the politician were spreading their bets so the interference has been calculated carried out for a reason obviously agreed the fsb chairman what reason demanded yuri trishin karelin frowned thats what ive set up an internal enquiry to find out the man looked fleetingly across the echoing kremlin room towards the recordkeeping secretariat there is clearly an attempt being made to discredit the organization i head by apparently implicating it in the assassination of the president the fsb was obviously in no way involved its only culpability is a serious lapse of internal security which has already been corrected as well as those responsible being punished the fulcrum upon which natalias early employment in the kgb had been balanced was her being able to judge whether the person she was interviewing was lying or being truthful karelin had conceded what they already knew and had established internal enquiries which was precisely what her outside commission had been created to prevent despite which natalias professional assessment was that the fsb chairman was telling the truth continuing to call upon her previous association and awareness of russian intelligence working natalia said peter bendalls records would not have been concentrated archives would have been crossreferenced with registry while he was alive even though his practical use might have become minimal there would have been a current file maintained upon him the shadowy smile came and went again its the very fact thatthe removal has been from several different centers that confirms a pattern nothing whatsoever beyond that which has already been made available has survived persisted natalia karelin had his tidbit ready i have obtained from registry the identities of four of peter bendalls control officers one of whom might calculated from the sons age have been the man who might have corrected george bendall in his teens and obtained psychiatric help for him the kgb would have had a copy of that treatment insisted natalia ive checked there is no copy said the man there was a shift from the men either side of her but natalia remained unmoving curious at how karelin was providing his information he was unarguably cooperating but at his own careful pace which she realized she was making easy for him the occasional smiles were more likely to be selfsatisfactionjust tinged with gratitudeat how he was manipulating her questioning than admiration of her technique it would be as wrong too obviously to challenge the man as it would not to make him aware as subtly as possible that she recognized his skill id like to think that he particularly was available to help us but i dont imagine that any of them are theyre all dead the fsb chairman confirmed she was very good to have anticipated that a loss to the service in fact how karelin in his complete selfconfidence decided to test the woman the first who took peter bendall over upon his arrival in died of cancer in his successor had a stroke in the control most likely to have put george bendall back in linebriefly at leastwas electrocuted by faulty wiring in his apartment and the fourth committed suicide by hanging himself he was one of the officers made redundant during the restructuring of the old service a disgruntled officer seized filitov overanxiously beyond which weve already extended the discussion dismissednatalia karelin hadnt finished but wanted prompting she guessed you didnt give dates for the last two deaths shed more than passed the test decided karelin the man most likely to have lectured george bendall died three months ago the one who committed suicide did so last month both deaths were accepted for what they appeared to be came in filitov unexpectedly karelin took folders from his briefcase offering them across the table they are the personnel files on all four the last two are marked both their deaths are now being investigated for possible suspicious circumstances the result of those investigations like the internal security breaches will be made available another intelligencerestricted enquiry natalia noted but there had to be other controls after theseat least oneduring the last five years of peter bendalls life she spoke looking down at the newly presented dossiers needing the names none fitted yes agreed karelin and a case officeror officersfor the son thats the system there was no way an outside tribunal like this could breach the protection built up over so long by the succeeding intelligence services but it would be wrong for him to be complacent about this woman we made another request at our previous meeting reminded natalia about fsb presence at burdenko hospital there is no fsbor longestablished kgbpresence at burdenko hospital asserted karelin positively it was time natalia decided despite the awkwardness with which karelin had tried to ringmaster the encounter she still had to guard against appearing confrontational there isor has beensome sharing between us the americans and the british into the shooting of the presidential group more particularly perhaps with the british who have consular access to bendall their interview recordings are automatically duplicated karelin sat politely attentive making no effort to anticipate what natalia might say but knowing there was something for which he had not been able to prepare at one such interview yesterday bendall claimed the kgb maneuvredhis admission into the russian army and that a control was infiltrated to monitor whatever function he was expected to perform in the military continued natalia i know nothing of this said karelin his face was masklike it was predictable but natalia had still hoped for more from the interview it would appear bendalls control was withdrawn or discharged from his specialized unit after bendalls persistent refusal to operate as he was instructed it should be fairly simple to check personnel movement from military records especially from a specialized unit said karelin at once he genuinely didnt know anything about it but it was quite likely to be the case and if it was it took the enquiry outside hisof fsbcontainment perfect decided natalia we realized that this morning unfortunately not in time to advise you in advance of your coming here the defense ministry provided us with the names of fifteen men discharged transferred or reassigned from bendalls group during the first six months of the mans service she pushed the defense file across the desk towards the intelligence chief the four control names youve supplied are not among these wed like you to have registry run a check against the fifteen karelin hesitated then picked up the folder i cannot confirm the kgb had anything to do with arranging bendalls army service karelin felt himself tricked despite her effort to prevent his thinking that we accept that chairman karelin its not what were asking you to confirm we are asking you to compare the fifteen names through registry in an attempt to discover if any kgb personnel accompanied george bendall into his military service that should be very easily possible shouldnt it within hours even i would expect so agreed the expressionless man if one of them does appear in registry lets hope hes still alive said natalia the meeting had been convened solely because of the fsb chairmans approach to them and filitov and trishin appeared surprised that natalia didnt move at once to suspend it until the promisedwithinhoursresult of their new request to the man but natalia decided that she had sufficient excuseif not the true reasonto argue against george bendalls court arraignment there were other more selfprotective points she felt necessary to establish too virtually as the door closed behind viktor karelin she said whats your feeling about what weve just been told each man looked to the other to respond first pavl ivanovich pressed natalia its positive confirmation of the conspiracy being within the fsb declared the lawyer yuri fedorovich i was surprised at the chairmans openness said the presidential chief of staff he has though taken all the enquiries away from uskept everything internalwhich we were specifically appointed to prevent natalia pointed out hes undertaken to make them available to us said filitov something will be made available qualified natalia we have no independent way or method of knowing whether we are being told the truth or how much of any enquiry is being given to us weve been very effectively and very cleverly neutered trishin shifted uncomfortably i wouldnt go that far think about it demanded natalia the silence lasted several moments before filitov said what do you suggest natalia tapped karelins naming dossiers an independent professional militia investigation into the two most recent and violent deaths a presidential insistence upon there being an outside militia presence or monitor on the internal fsb enquiries and an independent militia trace upon the fifteen names we received this morning from the defense ministry thats directly challenging chairman karelins integrity protested filitov not to do so is directly challenging ours and by inference that of the acting president insisted natalia acknowledging the repetition of the same argument as before but at that moment anxious to move on to what she considered the other more important argumentthe defense ministry names opens the door into the conspiracy only if one of them is on the fsb registry insisted filitov no refused natalia weve got last known addresses as well as names and every legal justification for having the militia fully investigate every one as soon and as quickly as possible beginning today in fact there was a pause from both men filitov said yes i suppose that specifically would be the right course for us to take i agree said trishin which surely creates something else to be considered suggested natalia what demanded filitov the court arraignment of george bendall what consideration is that of this commission demanded filitov quite separately from anything with which chairman karelin might return from the registry check we are providing the militia with a source which could lead us to others involved in the conspiracy could greatly affect the charges and prosecution against george bendall said natalia directly addressing filitov she said surely the prosecution doesnt know enough for an arraignment this early arent you risking a flawed case not giving the investigation more time the arraignment isnt the trial rejected filitov thats weeks away time enough for all the conspirators to be identified and arrested and cojoined in a prosecution upon whatever additional charges need to be proffered world attention will be upon us for the funeral of president yudkin said trishin politically it is necessary for there to be a publicly witnessed court appearance he hesitated and there has been some overnight communication from the americans that make that even more essential she was wasting her time natalia acknowledged she didnt have either logic or law on her side quite apart from political necessity which more often than not wasnt affected or influenced by eitherthe order is from the kremlin from okulovs office itself said zenin he was redfaced pacing his crumbling office needing movement to exorcise his fury why asked olga she pushed the indignation into her own voice but was secretly glad at the instruction to resume cooperation what little progress had been madefar too little though it washad been through association particularly with the englishman there was more professionallyby which she meant career enhancingto be gained than sacrificed by linking up again no reason was given zenin slumped in his seat its a personal rebuke to me olga had momentarily forgotten the withdrawal had been zenins decision no its not if it had been considered a mistake it would have been overruled immediately you were actually supported somethings happened to change things zenins smile was as brief as it was reluctant yes i suppose youre right she was the person who had to crawl back olga abruptly realized her own anger surfacing am i expected just to walk into the incident room as if it was all a big misunderstanding im sorry said zenin unhelpfully so am i it wouldnt be as difficult with the englishman despite the previous days argument at the hospital her personal difficulty would be openly descending into the american embassy basement with everyones eyes upon her todays hospital meeting zenin started to remind but stopped at the tentative entry of his personal assistant a uniformed major the man extended the package he carried and said its been couriered from the kremlin for immediate and personal delivery olga saw the smile no longer reluctant settle on zenins face as he read it remained when he looked up weve got names of people from bendalls unit who could have been his kgb case officer the commission wants us to trace every one its your entry back ill assign the investigators you provide the list as part of the combinedinvestigation and wed already decided you should be at the british interview this afternoon it wouldnt make any easier her humiliating embassy reentry thought olga she said the militia will be directly and identifiably investigating the fsb what we agreed would be dangerous zenins smile faltered not our decision provably ordered by the presidential enquiry were still being sucked in too close warned olga she was waiting directly outside george bendalls ward when charlie arrived with the two lawyers five chairs were set out in readiness in the room already emptied of guards who hovered further along the corridor beyond the woman charlie saw bendall was in a chair too charlie was sure the bandaging on the mans leg as well as the swathe around his shoulder and arm was less than the previous day handing charlie the list olga said names you might want to put to him theyre the men moved out of bendalls unit in the first six months of his army service you havent put them to him already demanded charlie at once they had to have been perhaps they had but she wanted bendalls failure or refusal to respond to be on his recording not on their no longer shared duplicate ive only just got them olga replied honestly only just arrived here myself would she risk the lie being exposed by bendall protesting hed already been asked it wasnt important charlie dismissed he had them to put to the man he nodded further into bendalls room have you interviewed him today olga shook her head speaking more to arkadi noskov professor agayan and two colleagues conducted their psychiatric assessment this morningill see you get them of course but i havent taken my questioning any further charlie saw annes eyebrows lift at the name familiarity but didnt give any reaction himself he wouldnt have imagined the previous days british protests would have brought about such a totalreversal another reflection that wasnt important he ushered the two women into the room ahead of him and set up his tape noskov overflowed beside him youre looking better georgi the schedule was again for charlie to lead the questioning although for the lawyers to come in at once if there was something they wanted to pick up upon the mans eyes went to each of them in turn but he didnt respond assessing his audience for the latest performance charlie decided you feeling ok bendall shrugged cant imagine someone like you found this mornings meeting too difficult didnt know what they were talking about rubbish most of it thats what i told you before youre cleverer than any of us but we do need to understand more ourselves to make it easier for others to get the complete picture of what its all about theyll find out its the complete picture thats important joined in noskov we mustnt leave anything out i dont intend to it had been a useful interruption judged charlie it just could happen your not being able to remember the name of the man the kgb put into the army with you for instance people might not believe that if you cant recall a name think you were making it up bendalls face darkened and his mouth opened for the shout but before he could charlie said we dont think that of course thats why weve done what we can to help you bendalls mouth closed but the expression remained suspicious he needed to be aware of every expression charlie realized which he couldnt do and read out the fifteen names at the same time without looking at anne he passed the list across the bed to her at the same time saying weve got some names that might jog your memory people who were in the army with you annes takeover was seamless kirril semenovich kashva she began bendall remained blank faced blank eyed yevgenni iosifovich ibrimacimov no reaction whatsoever sergei leonidovich golovkin lost his nerve broke in bendall was good at first had a good eye but then he developed a shake cant be accurate if you shake not like you flattered charlie wanting to break the recitation no not like me smiled bendall ilya aleksandrovich dolya resumed anne bendall shook his head swirling the lank hair there was no grimace of discomfort from the injury boris sergeevich davidov there was a recognition almost imperceptible a fraction of a second but charlie was sure hed seen the movement in bendalls eyes the vaguest tightening around the mans mouth igor mikhailevich amosov continued anne her concentration entirely on the list had a breakdown like sergei leonidovich weak sneered bendall yakov ivanovich lomakin persisted anne to bendalls further head shake after the following two identities the man stopped bothering even with that rejection listening but giving no response the only exception was with the last of the fifteenvladimir grigorevich pigorovwhom bendall once more dismissed as weak unable physically to endure the training so the man the kgb put in with you isnt one of these pressed charlie not that i recognized charlie was sure that both olga and anne stirred at the qualification he said you would have recognized it if he had been among them wouldnt you maybe do you want us to go through the list again offered anne not so soon wrong to push him remembered charlie would you like a copy of the list to look through on your own yes accepted bendall at once let me have a copy to take my time over theres something that we cant understand need you to help us with said noskov you only had two bullets and we know that five were fired so there had to be someone else did you know there was to be someone else charlie tensed for the outburst remembering the hysteria of the american interview but instead of answering bendall softly began the dirge his eyes fixed somewhere above their heads hurriedly charlie said tell us about february georgi the thursday night vasili gregorovich died you were with him that night werent you the humming stopped all of us the brotherhood prompted charlie drinking singing where were you drinking dont anyone interrupt try to take over thought charlie it was a good night all there all six of you chanced charlie felt good avoided bendall everyone drunk everyone drunk agreed bendall anatoli nikolaevichs birthday charlie wished the others in the room would stop shifting not wanting bendalls reverie broken by the slightest distraction keeping his own voice an even dull monotone wanting only to stroke the strings charlie said a lot of toasts smashed the glasses the first time traditionally vasili gregorovich was all right to drive though knew how to drink best drinker among us why didnt you go home to timiryazev with vasili you often did didnt you dont remember i was drunk someone did who give us his name abruptly demanded olga melnik stridentvoiced bendall physically jumped and blinked several times as if being awakened and the fury surged through charlie anne groaned audiblyand that annoyed charlie too bendall looked carefully alertly from one to the other smiling and charlies anger went as soon as it had come it was noskov who tried to retrieve the mood the thunderous voice soothing encouraging youre doing well georgi were getting somewhere tell us about the funeral you all went to that didnt you how do you know bendall was still smiling i dont said the lawyer i want you to tell me about it not the time weve got all the time in the world i told you that misunderstood noskov not the place corrected bendall of course youll be able to tell everyone in court accepted noskov quickly recovering thats what i want you to do tell me and then well tell everyone again in court make sure everyone understands no refused the man i decide i know you do said noskov everythings your decision will you see me tomorrow bendall appeared to consider the request all right outside in the corridor olga said at once im sorry it was its all right stopped charlie we didnt lose anything both lawyers looked at him in surprise anne said we were going like a steam train in there bendall was driving said charlie olgas request to come back to the incident room with him precluded the noskovcrowded embassy car charlie hailed a taxi and rode to novinskij bulvar without asking about the apparently renewed cooperation and olga didnt offer an explanation the attention at their entry wasnt as obvious as olga had feared and kayley greeted the russian as if there had been no interruption in her being there charlie held up the tape like a prize and said its the best yet olga matched charlies gesture with what she carried and saidweve got a list of names that possibly includes bendalls kgb minder in the military weve assigned individual teams to trace each one lets hope to christ that this is liftoff at last said kayley that night zenin took olga to bed early and was more demanding than hed been before and afterwards she lay exhausted beside him wondering how much longer it could possibly last unsure for the very first time how wellor badlyshe would be able to cope when it ended whenever it didagain for the very first timeit wouldnt be by her choice its not proof he said picking up the earlier dinner table conversation youre reacting to instinct i know admitted olga but im right i can feel it the lead we want is among those fifteen names if hes there well find him we should allow ourselves more time not worry so much about media timing persisted olga you know the answer to that will we share zenin was quiet for several moments after weve got him got everything what if hes still serving in the fsb its more than possible but weve got the authority of the presidential commission will we invoke it if we have to be careful darling personally careful i mean how was it for you going back today better than i thought it would be you think the americans with all their manpower will try to trace all the fifteen without a doubt that could be our protection suggested zenin maybe we will share give the americans the name if we think weve discovered it let them take on the fsb olga turned moving her hand over his hairmatted chest do that itll be safer the fsbs wrecked and karelin with it all the more reasonevery reasonfor not being associated with its destruction russian intelligence changes its face but not its memory ill look after you said zenin for how long asked olga wishing she could have bitten the words back as she uttered them stiffening beside him she lay with her eyes closed as if by not seeing she shut out the embarrassment she felt him turn towards her its something for us to talk aboutthink aboutisnt it is it she said breath tight in her chest how would you feel about having me as a husband as well as a lover id feel very happy how would you feel having me as a wife very happy and very proud it wasnt going to end it was going to go on forever and olga couldnt imagine anything she wanted more now weve got even more reason to be careful i dont want to lose this to risk anything you think you would have got more asked natalia charlie shook his head bendall wasnt lost in memories it was an act feeding us a bit at a time and making us dance to his tune he smiled at the unintentional pun and its a bloody awful tune too you achieved a hell of a lot though as much as bendall wanted to give he hadnt told nataliadiscussed with anyonewhat he believed to have been bendalls recognition of the davidov name totally unoffended by charlies disbelief and anxious to earn the offered fifty dollars the concierge of the dilapidated block on fadeeva ulitza had two hours earlier let charlie into davidovs listed apartment address to prove the man was no longer there unprotestingly watching charlie explore the few pieces of furniture that allowed the place to be described as furnished davidov had lived alone and hadnt been friendly complained the man davidov had been about thirtyfive years old and looked fit as if he trained running or swimming or something like that on the few occasions the concierge even remembered seeinghim davidov had worn a suit with a collar and tie so the caretaker assumed he worked in an office three militiamen and some americans whod said they were detectives had already been there so he guessed davidov had done something pretty serious charlie agreed it might have been and left with the promise of another fifty dollars if the man called his embassy number to tell him davidov had reappeared hoping hed outbid the americans to whom along with the militia he decided to leave the legwork involved in trying to trace davidov further at least until the following day how long do you think it will take ive put to him the idea of the court being his stage i wouldnt be surprised if he kept a lot back until he appears in public you might not have to wait long said natalia i ran into a brick wall arguing the court hearing should be postponed then this afternoon okulovs ordered the arraignment should be the same day as the funeral thats in two days said charlie can you imagine the media coverage not when we enter a plea of not guilty after everyones seen the television film said charlie theres something else what the justice ministry have decided theres insufficient evidence of foul play for a militia investigation into vera bendalls death wheres the fix from the justice ministry or the fsb lefortovo is ultimately under fsb control reminded natalia natalia accepted she had been outmaneuvred with almost childlike ease but bruised pride was the least of her several concerns her need was to adjust charlies dontgetsoregeteven philosophy the only guide she had from all the halfremembered conversations andanecdotes to reverse the ambush filitov and trishin had trapped her into just thirty minutes before viktor karelins arrival she was on her own and in those first suspended minutes she couldnt see a way to do it there were no smiles wisped or otherwise from karelin the face of the fsb chairman was as fixed as the way he sat facing them the only movement the slight tremor in the hand in which he held her initiated recommendation for militia involvement in the fsb internal investigations we felt you should be advised in advance as a matter of courtesy improvised natalia it had been filitovs insistence backed by the chief of staff that there should be a vote upon advising karelin before forwarding the suggestion to the kremlin ridiculous though the pretense had been with the two men so determinedly against her the point as always had been to establish a provable safety net record from which the most glaring and worrying inference was that the federal prosecutorbut more importantly yuri trishinseriously doubted aleksandr okulovs formal election chances and were taking out insurance against the overthrow of the new regime with the inevitable resurgence of the omnipotent intelligence service of which the man himself had once been such an integral part by a majority decision hurriedly added filitov in unnecessary confirmation of natalias reasoning i believe the problems that have been uncovered within my organization can be very adequately dealt with internally said karelin one in fact already has been your recommendation there has been overtaken by events she could come back to that later gauged natalia a vague idea was formulating but she didnt know how to carry it through to the end were not questioning the adequacy of your organization the intention she paused unsure at the risk but then recalling filitovs blatant entrapment is to protect it they had to commit themselvesfrom their own mouthsif she was going to turn their maneuvre back upon them she needed a responseany responseshe could use protect it demanded karelin he always had an escape to keephis service inviolable but he was intrigued by their even imagining such an intrusion was possible not their imagining he corrected the woman whod once been in the service it was as difficult to understand as okulov appointing an investigating commission in the first place with her as its chairman good enough very good in fact natalia was conscious of filitov and trishin twisting sideways towards her matching karelins bewilderment and just as obviously turned herself to the chief of staff you would agree wouldnt you yuri fedorovich that one of the essential remits of this commission is to ensure external transparency particularly as far as the united states of america is concerned trishin sat trying to anticipate towards which abyss he was being prodded unable to he reluctantly said yes and theres also the undertaking personally announced by the acting president to make public the findings of this enquiry yes agreed trishin again even more entangled it was going better than shed hoped but it would be wrong for her to read too much too soon into their confusion she went back to karelin one of your first remarks to us was to deny emphatically any fsb part in an assassination conspiracy natalia thought some of the stiffness had gone from the nondescript man karelin said which i just as emphatically repeat and which will be set out very specifically in our conclusions all of which are to be made fully public said natalia that hadnt been agreeddiscussed evenand she waited for trishins challenge but it didnt come having allowed the wait natalia went on arent we limiting ourselves by only discussing an assassination conspiracy im not sure what youre talking about complained karelin natalia could see her way nowactually realizing there was something positive to learnand was not in a hurry the longer she strung it out the further filitov and trishin would be stranded public international perception said natalia i still dont understand protested karelin who believed he did but was unwilling to risk a mistake there has been considerable ill feeling between us and the americans over some aspects of the overall investigation reminded natalia its reflectedclearly through informed and official leaksin the highly critical media attacks in the american press you have been remarkably open with us conceding that the fsb has been seriously embarrassed wouldnt you agree viktor ivanovich that such an honest admission exposes you and your service to international media accusationspeculation at the very leastof complicity an accusation i am totally refuting insisted karelin she was right he admitted to himself natalia abruptly switched back to trishin intercepting as she did so the look of concern passing between the men on either side of her denied or not it is the sort of hostile analysis the international media will make and against which it is necessary for the fsb to guard wouldnt you agree yuri fedorovich not if the denials were made strongly enough tried the politician are you viktor ivanovich prepared to take that chance with the reputation of your organisation at stake demanded natalia moving between the intelligence chairman and the chief of staff before switching to the prosecutor are you yuri fedorvich she had them boxed and tied with ribbon isnt this escalating out of proportion said filitov recognizing how totally their intended isolation of natalia had been thrown back at them answer your own question natalia returned at once outside militia participation will show the fsb and its chairman willing to be totally transparent to international opinion and judgment prove it has nothing to hide it wouldnt prove anything of the sortthe fsb like its predecessor were adept enough to conceal anything they didnt want found outbut that wasnt the point at that precise moment the point was justifying any sort of outside monitor its a convincing argument said karelin im glad its been made and im personally glad youve acknowledged it said natalianeither filitov nor trishin would be so happy with the secretariat transcripts now she wondered how much more benefit there was to be achieved karelin lifted and let drop the no longer agitated hand that still held the proposal for militia involvement and i appreciate the courtesy and the consideration there was even finally a fleeting smile you have no problem with the idea i need to consider it further which i will do keeping your arguments very much in mind natalia fedova you said one of the uncovered problems has already been dealt with prompted natalia colonel spassky was held responsible for the internal security breach disclosed karelin he has been dismissed and a new directorate chairman appointed to instigate an entirely redesigned system it is conceivable that during that reorganization there might emerge some further information on the interference itself natalia acknowledged that spassky had to be the most likely and available scapegoat that had been the ineffectual mans role from the very beginning you left yesterday to carry out a registry search for us none of the names from the ministry of defense with which i was supplied appear on any registry or archive documents of the current fsb or the kgb which preceded it said karelin formally that would seem to bring to an end any further assistance you might be able to give us said trishin does it came in natalia sharply the identity of any who might be involved could be among material intentionally removed as part of the conspiracy couldnt it most certainly if any of them were part of it agreed karelin everything had to end on her personal terms decided natalia or perhaps more essentially to her personal benefit weve no other witnesses unless you can suggest anyone else theres no one confirmed karelin at once at the moment the fsb is inextricablyand inescapablylinked with a very carefully planned treason because of which it can only be discredited natalia spelled out until we prove otherwise said karelin there it was the toptobottom investigations karelin hadnt d closed and into which he wouldnt for a moment admit outside in vestigators such very careful planning wouldnt have been possible by disaffected personnel abruptly dismissed your service i dont think so agreed karelin could there be factions still within the fsb that might want to discredit you personally and the organization as a whole if there are they will be discovered insisted karelin in further confirmation of the undisclosed purge can you suggest to us whoor whatelse might be responsible asked trishin anxious to restore himself not at this moment said karelin im discounting a foreign intelligence service one could not have infiltrated to this degree ive used the word discredit reminded natalia if this conspiracy isnt totally explained and the conspiratorsall the conspiratorsbrought to justice couldnt we be talking about the destruction of the fsb certainly about the need for yet another but more complete restructuring all of these difficulties have been realized and are being acted upon assured karelin the unbreachable confidence was wavering thought natalia they are also difficulties that we will necessarily have to recognize in our report to the acting president are you warning me you believe the fsb is actively connected with this outrage demanded karelin im certainly not said filitov i am advising you of the evidenceand the observationswith which we have to work said natalia with the hope of further contact and cooperation between us charlie judged it so far to be a day more confusing than mosttoo many of which had already been confusing enoughcouldnt see how it was going to get any better and wished now he hadnt responded to instinct by returning to fadeeva ulitza instead of going back to burdenko hospital with the lawyers defense psychiatrists and donald morrison the initial uncertainty was the conciergesdisclosure of the arrival at boris davidovs abandoned apartment within an hour of his having been there the previous night of an fsb squad according to the caretaker theyd asked similar questions to everyone else and appeared to be trying to locate the man which they wouldnt have had to do if he was still a serving officer but certainly would if hed served in the past and needed to be removed from awkward questioning another perhaps far more feasible thoughtcountered only by charlies impression of bendalls reactionwas that the fsb had joined the game of musical chairs and were chasing each of the fifteen names in the footsteps of the fbi and the militia to test that possibility charlie went directly from fadeeva ulitza to the american embassy and was further frustrated nowhere in any of the fbi reports was there a reference to their overlapping with either the intelligence or police service of the fifteen eightincluding davidovwere logged as being not immediately traceable but with enquiries continuing two were serving prison sentences and another had died four years earlier shot by the militia in an attempted armed robbery in an arbat jewellery store three were working for security firms offering protection to western businessmen in moscow from organized mafia and the last was an instructor in the gymnasium at the balchug kempinski hotel none of the security men nor the gym instructor remembered georgi gugin as serving with them in the army despite the television and newspaper pictures nothing of the militia efforts to trace the fifteen was yet logged on the centralized system john kayley came down into the incident room from the upstairs embassy as charlie finished his fruitless computer scroll the american was in shirtsleeves dark with sweat across his shoulders and beneath his arms kayley said you want to guess how many secret servicemen we got coming here with the president no refused charlie seventyfive they hear a sound louder than a sparrows fart theyll open fire and therell be another massacre you part of it kayley shook his head i got a court hearing to attend and exsoldiers to find hows it going kayley gestured to charlies blank computer screen what you see is what we got which so far is fuck all you all set for tomorrow short of just about everything id like said charlie honestly you think were ever going to get it asked kayley kindling one of his cigars into a perfumed cloud charlie considered for several minutes before he replied no he said confronting the doubt properly for the first time i dont think from the way its going at the moment that we stand a chance in hell charlies seriousness appeared to concentrate kayleys mind and i believe youre probably right i dont think we are either thank christ he thought for the teflon protection of paul smiths overreactive email charlie seized upon anne abbotts unexpected car phone requests for a preparing prehearing revieweager for a sounding board after the brief exchange with kayleywithout waiting for morrisons return to the incident room arkadi noskov was already tightly wedged into the largest available chairwhich would have enveloped anyone elsein annes embassy office vodka glass contentedly resting on his tablecloth of a beard charlie accepted the offered scotch even though it was a mix anne wasnt drinking so howd it go charlie asked it would have been better if youd been there said anne charlie detected the edge to her voice im sorry he queried so are we she said bendall went through the routine with our psychiatrists but said he wouldnt cooperate with anything else if you werent there which you werent a serious oversight acknowledged charlie it really was spiralling into a totally fucked up day the refusal wouldnt do anything to restore donald morrisons confidence either charlie said you really think he had any intention of saying anything today were never going to know are we what about the psychiatrists he was impeccable replied the deepvoiced lawyer his behavior virtually amounts to proof of his sanity without our needing to be professionally told is that what the psychiatrists did say that he was fit to plead demanded charlie theyve promised qualifications in their written assessment but theyre unanimous on the deciding factor that hes mentally capable of understanding a criminal charge said noskov and that hes mentally aware of what hes done capable of distinguishing between right and wrong finished anne what are the qualifications said charlie delusory to the point of severe fantacism anne set out fluctuating schizophrenic paranoia susceptible to mental manipulation whats that give us asked charlie at best psychiatric mumbo jumbo for a plea of mitigation said the russian lawyer cynically and weve got the intended charges which are conspiracy to murder murder membership of a terrorist organization terrorism espionage and discharging a weapon with intent to endanger or take life enumerated noskov espionage isolated charlie curiously theyve trawled through the statute book and will probably come up with some they havent got to yet said noskov with continued cynicism dont forget its only the initial legally required arraignment the prosecution will formally lay the charges ill formally enter a plea of not guilty to each and thatll be that for the next ten or twenty or however many custodial remands the prosecution ask for perhaps said anne offering their individual bottles to each man for refills whats that mean questioned charlie bendalls demanding to address the court she said when we told him tomorrow wasnt the time or the place he threatened to dismiss us and defend himself she hesitated thats when we could have done with you most to calm him down charlie accepted the persistent criticism were here to review lets do just that assemble what weve got or rather what we havent got said anne give us your analysis against ours on his way to protocnyj pereulok charlie had believed he had everything neatly compartmented in his mind but almost as soon as he began to talk the doubt arose the undoubted conspiracy was brilliantly conceived by people with sufficient power influence and knowledge to penetrate kgbera material and come literally within a hairs breadth of a snipers rifle sight to assassinating two presidents as it was theyd killed one and by a fluke of an instinctive movement maimed the wife of another anne cut in impressively advocatorial when charlie talked of a brotherhood and listed what theyd believed hed extracted from bendall about it even managing a passing imitation of the mans wailing dirge delusory to the point of severe fantacism she reminded and thats from our own experts ok we know from the number of shots fired and the different caliber of the bullets that there was a conspiracy but any half decent prosecution with a television film like theyve got will cut us to pieces if we start talking of stupid bonding songs and blood brothers weve got an irrefutable defense to murder said noskov the rest only just helps with a mitigating defence on the evidence of mental instability hed have believed it though wouldnt he said charlie slowly someone who was easily deluded retreated into fantasy in preference to his own shitty existence would grab at the blood brother nonsense wheres that take us asked anne charlie didnt know but his feet throbbed which was a good sign what are the inconsistencies the things that dont fit most if it said anne despairingly no refused charlie lets go through it again to find what doesnt fit unarguable facts its brilliantly no charlie stopped himself its a professionally conceived operation the sort of assassination that would have needed the expertise of an organization trained and equipped to carry out authorized killings the fsb and before them the kgb interrupted anne and before them all the rest agreed charlie we know from the different calibration of the two different rifles that there were two different marksmen each capable of firing a total of five shots in under eight seconds professional marksmanship but not professional planning if it had been truly professional the rifles would have at least been of the same caliber an inconsistency recognized noskov lets mark it charlie agreed now lets look at all the others george bendall a dysfunctional mentally unstablebut mentally malleableman who was long ago trained as a marksman a third rifle but only two bullets because they know he cant hit the intended targets and if he hits anyone elsewhich he fortunately didntit doesnt matter purpose the dupe who is intended to take the blame his cowed frightened mother who doesnt appear to know anything yet is murdered in a jail for which the organization with the capability to commit assassination is responsible and his apparenthis onlybest friend also possibly murdered in what was made to look like an accident on a level crossing anything ive missed out bendalls mystery pentathol injection reminded anne ok lets add that accepted charlie anything else orkulov and the kgb said noskov simply wheres that slot in it doesnt if its successor service is involved whatever the changes they rarely shaft their own charlie hesitated again remembering the number of times hed been strung out to dry not often anyway okulov appointed a presidential commission into the fsb argued anne after the shooting and with the finger pointing at them and him said charlie politically he didnt have any alternative into his minds eye came the two taunting photographs of vasili gregorovich isakov what the fuck was it he couldnt see with everything else so fragmented this discussion wouldnt be taken forward by his getting the prints from his office and inviting the lawyers examination is that it both lawyers nodded their heads so whats there that shouldnt be like i said most of it remarked anne thats not helping threw back charlie balancing her earlier criticism you know the impression im increasingly getting invited anne both men looked at her waiting i dont find it difficult to imagine that theres someone on the inside of this investigation manipulating the whole bloody lot of us just as they manipulated george bendall there was a long silence one of the conspirators said noskov finally maybe even more than one suggested anne think about it nothing adds up every move weve madeevery move anyone else has made as far as were awarealways runs into a brick wall are you suggesting someone at our level pressed charlie feeling the beginning of a chill at his recognition of how much sense annes remark made im just pointing out that weve been made to dance around in circles and for that to happen so consistently it would be useful for the bad guys to have someone very close to the investigation you think okulov is masterminding it to get the presidency thats the only level with a link to the fsbor rather the kgb before itthat makes sense im not sure what i think said anne uncharacteristically careless okulovthrough trishin being on the commissionwasnt the only one who fitted thought charlie he ran the resttheir faces eventhrough his mind desperate for a more likely suspect and failed which didnt prove anything nothing was provable the whole thingthe entire speculationwas based upon a casual throwaway aside that just only just might have sinister implications but from her chairmanships of both the russian coordinating groups and the presidential commission natalia perfectly fitted the incriminating profile which was absurd what reasonwhat possible purposecould there be for natalia even to be remotelyconnectedthe ultimate of unacceptable absurditieswith the killing and maiming of people and yet it had been a working dinner and the recalled james scamell had only minutes before quit the regents park official residence of the united states ambassador to england leaving anandale and wendall north alone together anandale said you sure the plug will hold theyre short eleven documents three the minutes of the meetings at which the decision was made to contribute the soft to your campaign and in which you were specifically named assured the chief of staff ive got the chief execs personnel guarantee theyre shredded whats left is a general discussion about election funding as far as the paper trail goes it was a discussion upon which no action was taken no names mentioned how many of the board know five what if theyre subpoenaed theyd fall too diverting company funds without stockholdersand the full boardsapproval is fraud a criminal offense they could plea bargain cop an amnesty for turning states evidence theyre firm theres insufficient to pressure any of them anandale swirled the brandy in his snifter how long before the grand jurys concluded two weeks and from now on its the dregs no one who can hurt us guaranteed north youre still high on the sympathy wave and the media are taking the dutybeforepersonalsafety line of your going back for the funeral three specialists have so far decided theres nothing that can be done for ruth only two to go im very sorry to hear that mr president find more doctors wendall better qualified we cant let her stay like she is shes too proud the chief of staff looked unnecessarily at his watch donnington will still be up at the hotel ill call him right away lets go outside the countryeuropes fineif he gets the name of the right man ill make sure donnington understands you really think i should do what scamell wants in moscow after all the speculation kayley doesnt buy it and weve been through the protection arrangements with a finetoothed comb aston says its safe its been rehearsed so many times everyone can do it in their sleep wendall north had ensured that this time there wasnt a single security provision or objection in which he was a named participant i want everyone with their eyes wide open said anandale charlie stayed late into the evening alone in his own embassy office going through everythingeven the cnn filmknowing it was ridiculous but having to acknowledge that anne abbotts suggestion deserved consideration and that when it was considered natalia was the best placed of any possible suspects to be an inside source he couldntwouldntcontemplate her being involvedaware in advancein the actual murders that was totally unthinkable but examined closelyand charlies examination was microscopicthat wasnt what the lawyer had theorized anne abbott had been referring to the almost orchestrated confusion afterwards which still didnt make sense wasnt it as unthinkable that shed become inveigled afterwards knowing complicity after the crime would be as badas criminally culpableas knowing of it before he asked himself if she could have acted unknowingly and decided that was impossible natalia was far too astute to allow herself to be used unknowingly it was only when he spread the reflection to honesty and integrity trying to imagine any conceivable situation in which shed be prepared to sacrifice either that charlie felt the first real flicker of unease he didnt doubt that natalia would abandon honesty and integrityeven contemplate breaking the lawto protect sasha and the risk to sashathe upheaval to their daughter more than anything that might happen to herhad been natalias constant corrosive fear ever since shed moved into lesnaya still not enough still unthinkable there wasnt even circumstantial evidenceit was circumstantialvery circumstantialhypotheses at best or worse it was past nine when he finally got home going directly to the drinks tray when he entered the apartment natalia said i could have kept something waited so we could have eaten together if youd called to say you were on your way im not hungry a development charlie shook his head complete review for tomorrow tomorrows only a formality surely it was obvious shed know that charlie accepted lawyers wanting to know were prepared for the unexpected are you charlie hesitated wondering if he were good enough to make their conversation a test remembering hed once before been able verbally to trick her we dont know enough to be prepared for anything expected or otherwise what happened with you today natalia said i came closer than i ever want to come again to being washed away and charlies feet twitched and he wished they hadnt charlie listened with a divided mind assessing her account as she wanted him to but at the same time unsuccessfully searching for any nuance that might resolve the doubt created by anne abbott when natalia finished he said did you think you could manage it not at first now comes your report said charlie would there be any indication now filitov and trishin said they needed time to read all the statements which is ludicrous theres only karelin whats your opinion serious maladministration within the fsb but not complicity someone with access has to be part of it shed personally gone to the lubyanka supposedly to pressure spassky had actually talked to him afterwards about how lapse internal security was and shed knew her way around the building you going to say that its obvious wed make ourselves look stupid not to what if filitov and trishin dont agree i dont see how they can disagree if they do i can record a dissenting opinion will you natalia frowned what else can i do how would she confront the actually suspicion something curious came up during our review what the thought that someone connected with the investigation might be part of the conspiracy misleading or blocking things charlie spoke looking directly at natalia who looked directly back who she demanded it was a general remark youve probably got the widest overview of anyone what do you think natalia shook her head i dont see it if we chase that well confuse ourselves even more than were confused now charlie decided he knew her too wellhad spent his entire life spotting deceitnot to have detected something in that reply which he hadnt and yet two planes were needed in addition to air force one to carry the number of secret service personnel the travelling white house surgeon admiral max donningtons mobile hospital facilities and virtually every nationality of every accredited white house journalists television as well as print a carefully selected group of correspondentsthe tv majors commentators as well as political reporters from what was considered americas national press and all the texas mediatravelled on the presidents aircraft anandale word perfect from the secretary of states briefing papers spent a full thirty minutes in the back of the presidential jet talking unattributablyon the european union trade protectionism scheduled for discussion with british and french leaders despite limiting to hours the amount of time he would be in moscow he also intended to meet acting president aleksandr okulov because of the circumstance of the visit it was inappropriate to go into any detail of the star wars treaty negotiations but as they all knew secretary of state james scamell had remained in moscow apart from this short trip to london it was quite naturally a difficult personal return to moscow for him he had no safety concerns whatsoever having complete confidence and trust in the joint security measures of the american secret service and the russian presidential protection service as its former and forever proud governor he deeply regretted the pointless time money and effort being wasted by the politically hostile texas legislature time money and effort that would these past months have been spent better and more properly governing the best state in the union he was pleased to say that the first lady was responding to treatment and there was every reason to hope she would make a full recovery back in his separate private section of the aircraft anandale said ok you gave them enough for a whole months coverage judged wendall north ill have public affairs circulate it to the media on the other plane said scamell dont want to leave anyone out you know what theyd rather see demanded the president rhetorically theyd rather see me shot by the sons of bitches who missed me last time because its a better story theyre not going to get it assured north youre coming back like this is good enough you speak to donnington he talked to people in england before we left well have names when we get back tonight jeff aston the head of the secret service detail appeared from the flight deck were on our way down the advance planes are already there everythings set up anandale looked out of the window as the aircraft descended through the clouds and the flat treetufted plain came into viewhe said god awful place no wonder no one smiles they landed as before at the same military installation on the eastern outskirts of the city there were three television positions none elevated and five still camera places between them and the arriving aircraft was an outwardly facing wall of secret servicemen through whom there were minimal gaps for unimpeded pictures the speciallyflown in bullet and blast proof cadillac was hard topped with darkly tinted windows and drew up to within ten meters of the steps even before they were secured into position at the same time aleksandr okulov and boris petrin emerged from their waiting smokewindowed zil to make their way forward in a greeting line with individual interpreters there was a second shielding line made up equally of russian and american protection officers walter anandale emerged the moment the doors of air force one opened for the required topstep photo opportunity but was dwarfed almost at once by jeff aston two more similarlysized secret servicemen covered the president from the back and side making awkward the crowded descent to the ground okulov was several inches shorter than anandale and appeared even smaller against the american guards when he came forward to embrace anandale russian bearhug style anandale barely responded anxious to be released the group moved so quickly towards the waiting vehicles that scamell and wendall north had to hurry down the steps to avoid being left behind the american chief of staff supervised the transportation ushering aleksandr okulov and walter anandale into the cadillac alone but for their interpreters anandale and okulov sat side by side their translators facing them from the jump seats lev lvov the russian presidential protection chief was crammed into the front seat alongside jeff aston the raised glass partition closing them off from the rear of the vehicle okulov said hows the first lady recovering said anandale thank you fully i hope theres still a lot of specialist treatment necessary the armor plating which extended from the sides down to theunderside of the car brought its weight up to nine tons but it was still travelling at ninety mph down the central reservation of the cleared road there were two ranks of escorting motorcycles the outer line closing off any space left by the inner it was impossible to hear the overhead helicopters through the steelreinforced roof orkulov said i trust all the misunderstandings are resolved between us over this investigation i believe they are but the progress is slow said anandale the englishman is appearing in court today slow in detecting the others with whom he is involved i understand that immediately prior to the outrage no substantive difficulties remained between our two sides over the missile defense system there were some there had been no independently confirmed statistics for nuclear holdings they have now been exchanged between our foreign minister and your secretary of state there remain uncertainties with china and north korea uncertainties that existedand stayed parallelbefore and during our negotiations according to our intelligence north korea is increasing its nuclear capacity with beijings assistance there was a momentary silence they were entering the city now along barriered streets this time totally devoid of people apart from regularly distanced uniformed militia officers okulov said that is not our information anandale shrugged youll accept of course that i have to make judgments upon the best advice i receive an enormous amount of time and even more commitment has gone into bringing our two sides to where we are now it would be very unfortunate if at this stage it were to fail my secretary of state has remained in moscow reminded anandale we have publicly travelled into the city together today does that mean our negotiations are going to be concluded with the signing of the treaty demanded okulov directly it means our negotiations are continuing to a hopeful conclusion that hope being that no unexpected insurmountable difficultyarises said anandale as the cavalcade swept across the cleared red square for the televised entry into the kremlin american television had a simultaneous feed from the russian coverage of anandale flanked by scamell and north solemnly filing past the open coffin of the assassinated russian president aleksandr okulov was already in place by the time they reached the receiving line in the center of which stood a blacksuited raisa yudkin her two sons either side of her she smiled at his approach and anandale leaned forward to kiss her hows ruth said the woman her voice heavily accented getting better he gave a slight movement towards the coffin im so sorry he shook the hands of both boys and moved off there was a preinterment reception also televised in an adjoining state room and anandale allowed scamell to steer him into two appropriate groupsgerman and italianbefore settling briefly with the british anandale said he was looking forward to the following days working lunch and the prime minister said he was too it was not until they were back in the armored cadillac slotting into their prescribed position in the cortege that wendall north said you happy how it went hear for yourself invited anandale through the now lowered separating screen he said you get it all jeff loud and clear mr president assured the secret service chief slotting the recording of anandales conversation with okulov into the cadillacs cassette deck everyones concentration was totally inside the vehicle oblivious to everyone and everything outside when the tape snapped off anandale said well couldnt be better said scamell thank you jeff said anandale pressing the control to raise the screen you know what im thinking im thinking that now weve got the texas problem out of the way we dont need the goddamned treaty wed do better carrying on perfecting the shield technology lets take pause on that mr president advised the chief of staff ok agreed anandale but carry out some very discreet soundings see how further developing it plays on the hill charlie was able to see the first five minutes of anandales televised arrival at the military airfield before leaving for the hospital and watched with an impression of deja vu wondering what emotion the american president would be having the reflection went at once driving to the hospital with anne beside him responding perfunctorily to the occasional remark from the lawyer bent over her case papers in final preparation his own concentration fully upon the lingering doubt about natalia shed come to him the previous night wanting him but he hadnt been able to respond which had never happened before the only excuse hed been able to think of was tiredness from the investigation and shed turned away tight with frustration and the tension had still been between them that morning impossible though it wasridiculous though it waswhat if natalia had been drawn in not in the actual shootings but in some coverup afterwards george bendall had unchallengably been involved in a murderous conspiracy but they had a guaranteed defense against the murder charge itself so there was no risk of an innocent man being wrongly convicted she would be obstructing justice certainly but how many times had he done thatand worseany means always justifying a practical end a lot although always with more of an episode resolved and more of the opposition punished what ever he had no moral or integrity grounds from which to criticize or question which wasnt his problem he forced himself to admit his problem was entirely personal the thought of her holding a distorting mirror in front of him which was the most absurd of all but not all he thought on relentlessly his doubt wasnt solely about the investigation maybe not even a major part of it he was stirring into the mix all his own uncertainties about himself and natalia changing the metaphor holding up his own distorting mirror in front of himself charlie he started at her demand realizing hed missed a question the first time sorry what you think you can keep bendall quiet repeated anne thats what were going to the hospital for but i dont have a magic formula do you really want to keep him quiet she demanded turning to charlie in the back of the embasssy car he promised sensation remember he could unlock everything i want it for myself first not for a herd that would include the worlds press said charlie olga nicholai badim and the psychiatrist guerguen agayan were outside the ward when charlie and anne approached after passing through the entrance check which charlie noted to be as stringent as it had been on the first day minus only the disputed body check the regular threeman team was inside bendalls room but there was a much greater numbera lot in militia uniformfurther along the corridor waiting to escort the man to the court anne said we need prehearing consultations a condition was made about a protective presence said olga which you can be said charlie curtly there is no need for the guards within the room or for any medical attendance thats for us to decide said agayan is he fit to appear in court asked charlie yes said badim can he stand sufficiently theres a crutch looking more closely into the room charlie saw there was an old fashion tshaped support propped against the side of the wheelchair in which bendall was already seated then youve fulfilled your function we want the room empty except for attorney abbott myself and militia colonel melnik agayan moved to protect further but olga said thatll be all right we havent a lot of time there was a shuffle of passing people inside charlie recognized that bendall was dressed in the jeans and longsleeved sweater the man had been wearing during the tussle on the tv gantry although they appeared to have been cleaned he didnt recognize the faded fabric windcheater in which bendall only had his right arm the left side pulled over the mans injured shoulder there was scarcely anybulge from the bandaging and charlie guessed it had been further reduced there didnt appear to be a particularly thick dressing at the mans hip either the routine of arranging their own recording was practically automatic charlie said sorry i wasnt here yesterday georgi you had something you wanted to talk to me about no said bendall you kept asking for charlie reminded anne not important anymore it might be said charlie why dont we just talk it through i dont want to there arent the facilities for us to talk in a court cell said anne thats why were here ok said bendall i mean weve got to talk about anything here said anne there wont be another chance theres nothing to talk about you remember our telling you yesterday that this isnt the full trial its just to formally list the charges i know there was a tinge of irritation in bendalls voice youll have to stand for a few moments while the charges are put i can do that arkadi semenovich will enter the plea you dont have to say anything youll be allowed to sit when thats over the prosecution will ask for an adjournment and that will be that ok the faintest smile pulled at the corners of bendalls mouth you dont say anything georgi stressed charlie you let your lawyer say it all you got anything to say say it to me here now changed my mind dont urged charlie the frustration burning through him bendall said i want to go now im ready lets talk about it some more no refused bendall his voice raised there was movement from the outside corridor olga said the prison transports waiting charlie said we dont want any outbursts in court georgiyoull get your chance to say all you want but not today you understand bendall said i want to go well come here afterwards promised charlie back in the embassy car he said i fucked up yesterday badly agreed anne at once so many roads were closed or restricted because of the funeral security that they had to make an elaborate looping detour to get to the central criminal court building there was a bristled hedge of television cameras stills photographers and sound and print journalists blocking its front and charlie too late regretted the identifiable embassy car he shouldered a path for anne wincing at the klieg light and flashbulb glare both of them ignoring the shouted demands in english for them to identify themselves none of the uniformed linedup militia officers made any effort to help them the yelling jostling scrum pursued them into the pillared vestibule and charlie only picked out noskov because the man towered over everyone else when they reached the russian lawyer charlie to whom public identification was anathema said lets get into court out of this it was a comparative oasis of calm and quiet beyond the heavy doors it was the first time charlie had been inside a russian court and his initial impressions was that it was very similar to those he knew from england apart from the more functional raised bench for the five examining judges being necessarily longer but without any carved canopy the centrally positioned dock was raised the same as in england topped with a familiar surrounding rail and to its sides and rippled out in front were benches for lawyers their support advisors and court officials two rows were cobwebbed with headsets for simultaneous translation and at the second sat the sixstrong american legal team selecting their channels and testing the sound the rest of the court was already nearly full a stenographer was at his table beside the one facing row directly beneath the judges bench to one side was the press enclosure from which reporters were overflowing into a standing line in front there was a lot of noise coming from an overhanging balcony into which charlie couldnt see but which he assumed to be the public gallery theglassed booth from which the proceedings were being televised was at the same height as the public gallery adjoining the translators pod olga was seated next to a tightly bearded impressively uniformed and medalled man with other officers attentively around them at his entrance charlie saw her bend to the man who turned expressionlessly to examine him olga gave no facial reaction either there were two uniformed militiamen at every door into the well of the court and a further two at each of the two doors leading on to the judges bench john kayley was away from the rest of the americans in one of the shorter rows to the side of the dock when he saw charlie he gestured that there was a seat beside him noskov said anything hed changed his mind said charlie noskov sighed you warned him about histrionics as well as i could noskov led anne to the first row facing the bench and charlie eased himself next to the american kayley said whats new nothing said charlie you found any of those missing from our fifteen not a one have the militia added any nope going to talk to olga about it later you coming straight back returning to the hospital first to talk to bendall the noise abruptly increased and there was a turning of heads and charlie turned too to see bendalls wheelchair being lifted from an unseen stairwell into the dock seated the mans head scarcely came level to the rail bendall looked alertly around him smiling up at the television position and charlie thought an actor he was sure bendall would attempt his promise to be sensational which it probably would from the slight smile on kayleys face the american guessed it too there was the ushers demand in russian to stand for the crocodiled entry of the five judges the dock warders supported bendall until he got his balance on the single crutch beneath his right arm and prodded him to remain upright after everyone else sat for thecharges to be read bendall stood tight against the dock edge showing no discomfort the clerk set out the charges in both names the chosen russian identity first beginning with the conspiracy to murder and finishing with the intent to endanger or take life throughout charlie sat twisted towards the dock waiting although he was aware from the corner of his eye of the huge lawyer levering himself to his feet for the equally formal pleas he saw too that anne was turned completely towards the dock as expectantly as he was noskov got as far as my clients pleas to these before bendalls shout drowned him out i want to tell started bendall but then anne screamed no and from behind charlie there was an earringing explosion and then another and the side of bendalls head burst in a cloud of scattered red debris charlie swivelled to see a man already running lowered pistol still in hand from the first of the continuous rows back towards the door through which charlie and anne had entered fifteen minutes before and then he saw one of the guarding militiamen with his markarov drawn crouching and now charlie shouted no dont but the policeman fired jerking the running gunman to a complete stop and in the split second in which he remained like that frozen the court guard fired a second time to send the man crashing backwards charlie and kayley instinctively moved together and reached the gunman at the same time both shots had hit him in the chest smashing so much into a pulp there was nothing left to show if he were capable of breathing which he wasnt so deafened was he by the shots that charlie lipread more than heard kayley say now what the fuck have we got nothing said charlie not able to hear his own voice either the initial panic was only slightly less than the aftermath of the presidential shooting there was a pandemonium of shoutingscreams evenand a melee of people milling without direction apart from getting away from the killer now lying harmlessly dead every militiaman had his weapon drawn and were adding to the noise shouting to each other for instructions and brieflyfrightenedcharlie became conscious that the officer who had killed the gunman had the makarov trained upon him as if about to shoot and charlie yelled for the man to turn the gun away it was leonid zenin who restored order the bearded militia chief clambered up on to one of the benches to become the focal point of the court and bellowed for quiet and when the noise began to subside bawled again for order by the time he achieved it the judges were being bustled out of the court zenin told all his officers to holster their weapons before calling upwards for those on duty upstairs to empty the public gallery ahead of gesturing others to shepherd lawyers and officials from the well of the court still partially deafened charlie lipread more than heard anne ask if there was any reason for her to stay and shook his head and told her to leave anne smiled and nodded arkadi noskov and the american attorneys were anxiously filing out without protest charlie felt a prod against his shoulders from another officers clearing the court and shook his head again now in refusal identifying himself as an investigator there was another shove with the order he did hear to leave as olga arrived and told the policeman charlie could remain kayley was arguing with another uniformed man by the dock and charlie walked with her as olga crossed to them to repeat the permission olga gazed without any emotion at the nearly headless body of george bendall crumpled in one corner of the dock the man lay with the bandaged arm oddly thrown up as ifto protect himself the warder over whom most of bendalls brain debris had scattered had been sick and was slumped in the furthest corner from the body caught by a thought charlie turned and looked towards the television position realizing that these killings would again have been caught on camera we back to square one wondered kayley charlie was relieved to begin hearing properly at last i wish i knew there was he thought too much he wished he knew they all turned at zenins approach olga made the introductions when kayley offered his hand olga said no you dont shake hands in the presence of death its bad luck charlie saw that zenin had held back from responding everyones getting more than their fair share of that george most of all zenin looked between the dock and where three uniformed officersone a majorwere standing in a semicircle around the dead gunman and said loudly that nothing was to be touched or moved until forensic examiners got there beside charlie the american said whats that saying about stable doors and bolting horses charlie recognized how immediately zenin had adopted command he even followed the man himself as they went back to the body the gunman blondhaired and heavily moustached was lying on his back his eyes still open his left leg was folded beneath his right and both arms were spread out his gun a makarov was about three feet from his right hand both militia shots had caught him fully in the chest caving it in his shirt red to begin with was totally soaked in blood that was seeping into the lapels of an already crumpled fawn suit id like to include my forensic people said kayley zenins hesitation was momentary of course i think that would be a good idea the american smiled to find battery power on his cell phone within the confines of the court the staccato conversation with the embassy incident room was very quick i want every guard officer assembled zenin told the major as the uniformed squad began filing back into the court zenin said who called out no alive he might have given us something dead he cant said charlie a gun stumbled the militiaman whod shot the assassin he had a gun in his hand i thought he was going to fire again you behaved totally correctly reassured zenin ill approve a commendation he looked around the assembled officers how the hell did an armed man get into the court there was no reply i asked a question demanded zenin he had authority a shield said a man halfhidden at the rear of the group come forward say that again ordered zenin the officer was young his face still actually pimpled with youth he had a shield authority what shield federtnaia sluhba bezopasnosti search the body it was olga who instantly stooped not repelled by the gore and careless of her formal militia dress uniform getting bloodsmeared it was an expert body search she lifted the jacket pockets open with a pen tip more easily for her fingers to go inside with the minimum of displacement she found the fsb shield in the left side pocket the congealing blood made it difficult to get the jacket away from the body she found the wallet in the inside right pockets using the pen to flick it open the photograph was official the man front facing according to regulations his name neatly printed beneath it boris sergeevich davidov she read out unnecessarily knew he had to be around somewhere said kayley air force one was just clearing russian air space when the news was patched through from the embassy relayed by the american lawyers anandale said i was right it is dallas november oswald kills kennedy ruby kills oswald ruby dies and no one ever finds out what it was all about said wendall north finishing the historical comparison there was a babbled surge when they emerged from the court john kayley was swallowed up by the waiting american attorneys and charlie once more found anne by using arkadi noskov as a marker visible above all the rest charlie identified davidov as the killer and said dont ask me where that leaves us because i dont know dont know dont know dont know he thought it was a constant mocking chant bendalls dead queried the russian lawyer charlie thought noskov would have been able to see into the dock as hed passed very dead charlies ears had cleared completely but they ached i want formally to place on the court recordand publicly announcethe absolute proof of bendalls defense to murder declared noskov left as it is the prosecution have an assumption of guilt does it matter now thats how it will be left on file said anne we knowand can provehe didnt do it so the consideration is natural justice youre the lawyers said charlie justice natural or otherwise scarcely seemed to fit any of his most pressing considerations natalia would hardly be able officially to conclude her enquiry now although with davidov dead he couldnt see how it could be taken any further how anything could be taken any further which was of course the intention the intention or natalias intention it seemed very easyautomatic evenfor the suspicion to be part of every thought now i cant professionally act anne reminded noskov the russian nodded understanding her point ill call you later in the embassy car anne said i know you told me not to ask where this leaves us but where does this leave us beaten said charlie that sounded personal it is with bendall deadand with the russians determined that veras death was suicidetheres nothing more officially for me todo everythings down to the russians anne pointed out she hesitated isnt it all over for you too charlie i dont like being beaten come on charlie i missed something two more people are dead we went through it all she said not properly im going to do it again and again until i find what it is charlie insisted that richard brookings demand for an immediate meeting at protocnyj pereulok could only concern legal matters which anne could easily handle by herself nodding in agreement when she called him a bastard and actually locked the door of his office against any interruption hed been right about the court television although he hadnt expected it to be made available so quickly or to every moscow television channel it was even on cnn which used the new footage as an excuse to rerunsometimes side by side on a split screentheir film of the presidential shooting charlies initial total concentration was on the courtroom film feeling an odd discomfort as his own very clear and visible part of it he saw himself flinch at the first explosion his head swivelling between the dock and the gunman davidovs shooting was very quick and accurate the bucking of his hands the clearer definition between the two shots than the noise itself which virtually merged into one sound there didnt appear to be any separate impact either bendalls head simply disappearing in one burst charlie was turned towards davidov facing the camera when he shouted able clearly to see his lips form the word his memory was of calling no only once but there were two separate utterances before davidov was shot by the militiaman at that moment cnn split their transmission again between the two films running the courtroom killing of davidov against the camera pod struggle between bendall and the ntv cameraman vladimir sakov for possession of the snipers rifle and at that moment the awarenesses engulfed charlie he was physically chilled although the shiver was more in frustration at what hed missed for so long than from the feeling of coldness his internal telephone momentarily distracted him but charlie ignored it strained forward for a repeat of the comparison betweenthe two films sure that he was right sure that hed seen things properly for the first timehad most certainly for the first time seen what was most important but which hed consistently overlookedand allowed the scourging personal annoyance it had been there all the time like a banner in the breeze and hed missed it and it didnt matter that everyone else had missed it as well what mattered was that it had taken him so longtoo longand too much still remained unexplained the rerun began and charlie looked now at what he knew there was to see the annoyed chill of belated awareness changing to a warmth of satisfaction as it unarguably showed on the screen and then he remembered how momentarily deaf hed had to understand what people had said in the court in the initial minutes after the shooting and saw something else he should have recognized but hadnt london had the film it would only take an hour two three at the outside the photographic evaluation shouldnt take any longer but with an addition charlie thought as his problem with vasili gregorovich isakov finally slotted into its long overdue place charlie snatched up the internal telephone on its third demand talking over richard brookings demand that he come at once to the chancellery he would charlie promised when hed finished liaising with london which at that moment had the higher priority he depressed the receiver to disconnect the protesting diplomat but left the handset off its cradle to prevent the man intruding a fourth time charlie had the fbicollected photographs of vasili isakov before him for the next rerundetermined against any wrong or misconstrued assumptionand afterwards quite positive he gave himself thirty minutes to compose the fax to london to ensure there could be no misunderstanding about what he wanted richard brooking was tightlipped white with fury when charlie eventually reached the mans office anne abbott sat quite relaxed on the other side of the desk brooking said you were specifically told to report to me the moment you entered the embassy im not permitted to report operationally to you to avoid any awkward diplomatic crossover reminded charlie i report to london which is what ive been doing about what insisted brooking hasnt anne told you brookings face became a mask i meant what precisely have you discussed with london getting everything ass about face for far too long admitted charlie but now i think were on the right track track was the apposite word decided charlie he still needed a hard metalled road preferably stretched out in front in an uninterrupted straight line the assembled men sat quietly around the communal table the identical photographs and transcripts in front of them before each place was a photoanalysists magnifying glass but only jocelyn hamilton had found the need to use it he kept it in his hand when he looked up and said its a great pity it took so long to discover weve each of us had it here practically from day one said patrick pacey a great pity that you didnt pick it up for us and saved everyone a lot of time i think its a brilliant deduction of charlies said sir rupert dean coming in as a buffer between the two other men everything he suggested has been confirmed were in an even more jurisdictional quagmire than we were before warned jeremy simpson the legal advisor ill need definitive guidance of course but with bendall deadand the case against him dying with himi dont see weve any legal claim to remain associated with the investigation the directorgeneral gestured with the arkadi noskovs news agency statement of george bendalls bullet caliber defense to murder theres still an unsolved case of conspiracy i would have thought we have every justification to remain involved despite bendalls death we dont even know if there are other britons involved i dont want to know if there are said patrick pacey no one laughed simpson made his own gesture to the material in front of him charlies only got one lead and its russian he hasnt got the authority to pursue it and as he points out in todaysmessages theres a high mortality rate among people who become identified i propose that muffin is positively ordered to do nothingto take no further part in the investigation even if hes permitted to do sountil we have the necessary jurisdictional guidance said the deputy director of course the court episode is deplorable but objectively its the least difficult outcome there could have been for us things should be allowed to settle not be stirred up as cynical as that is i think it may well be the government attitude said pacey uncomfortable at politically having to side with a man with whom he almost invariably disagreed and whom he did not personally like its charlies breakthrough protested dean id like to let him run with it we still dont know what the hell its all about our primary remit is to forewarn the government against the unexpected we cant do that putting charlie on hold its my adviceand my political opinionthat we should urged pacey particularly with the legal uncertainty we should at least wait until thats clarified all right agreed the directorgeneral reluctantly and lets not give muffin any excuse for intentionally misunderstanding said hamilton charlie didnt misunderstood but he discarded the donothing instruction after the first reading intent upon the technical evaluation which confirmed everything hed asked to be checked he hesitated unsure which call to make first finally deciding upon natalias personal answering machine at lesnaya shed be able to guess just how much there was to do after what had happened he dictated he didnt know how late he was going to be but it would probably be a good idea to eat without him and if he was very late to go on to bed to anne abbott charlie said you want to hear just how ass about face it all was ive got islay malt at the apartment i checked with the embassy commissary to find out what you preferred what about a video player state of the art thirty minutes accepted charlie there was nothing wrongnothing he should feel guilty aboutin his having a drink while he talked these new developments through and anne was the most obvious person to do that with the lawyer who knew every facet of the investigation i could have postponed moving in said olga everythings organized and under control insisted zenin there was no need i want to find out what sort of wife im going to have apart from my clothes theres not a lot more to bring the important thing is that youre here said zenin after what seemed to be an eternity of constantly not knowing charlie knew this was very definitely wrong knew that despite every snatchedat justificationand there were official and legal justifications for his choosing anne with whom to discuss the analysesit should have all been kept strictly professional which was how theyd agreed by her rules things should be restored after their return from london so why had he changed the rules hinting a situation that shouldnt arise certainly not in the insular claustrophobia of an embassy in which everyone knew before it lowered its hind leg when a mouse peed selfflattery he wondered answering his own question with another anne being interested in him while natalia wasnt not good enough by a million miles charlie rejected at once juvenile an even worse selfaccusation or alternatively the arrogance that had been the life raft to keep him afloat for so long closer but still not sufficient adventure happened as it had with him and anne to be taken and enjoyed but as no more than thata shared adventure to end when it ended as unexpected adventures always did or should do so why was he threading his way through the lesserused passages between the functioning embassy and its residential compound until this moment so determinedly avoided that it took all his concentration to negotiate a lawyers question although hardly appropriate never ask a questioneven to yourselfto which you dont know the answer backresponding to kayleys earlier questionto square one dont ask dont get a reply you dont want go for the moment with the flow wherever it goes he was copping out charlie honestly acknowledged at last hoping for something without being the provable instigator anne was barefoot in a sheer beige silk and cashmere sweater beneath which she obviously wasnt wearing a bra and jeans and which didnt betray a pantyline either the islay malt properly offered without either ice or water was alongside the stolichnaya which did have an ice bucket on a low table between matching piece of leather furniture too large correctly to be described as easy chairs but just slightly too small to be miniature settees the apartment was pastelshaded modern grays and blues which was hardly a choice considering its newness and the curtains were drawn back for the ships marker river illumination and the lights of unseen traffic necklacing tapaca nabereznaja beyond anne said you pour for yourself ill pour for me sorry i couldnt manage liberaces piano you didnt give me time to ship it over as he generously served himself charlie said it wouldnt have gone with the decor too much glitter do you want to eat i could fix something with the miracle of microwave thats not why im here anne hesitated the foreplays been tantalizing shall we get to the point of whatever you are here for now it was charlies turn to pause he decided against picking up on the sharpness holding up the cassette as he crossed to annes vcr charlie announced the entire film of the presidential shootingdont look at anything but the struggle between bendall and sakov he was defending himself against his oversight charlie recognized and wanting to impress her at the same time and heres this mornings the very moment that bendall then davidov was shot weve watched so much so often that theres nothing more to see dismissed anne which was my problemour problem admitted charlie he passed her a transcript ill play the white house shooting again and this time follow it with what bendall and sakov are yelling at each other which ive had london extract verbatim with russianspeaking lip readers what watch jesus exclaimed anne staring down at the paper in advance of the film being run youre watch repeated charlie taking up the commentary theyre on the camera platform theyre fighting for possession of the rifle sakovs preventing bendall shooting again fire at anybody thats what we all thought but he wasnt doing that at all read what bendalls saying stop shoving got to get away you cunt you know ive got to get away theyre waiting for me stop pushing shoving me too near the edge cant hold on stop but thats what bendall was doingholding on to prevent himself being thrown over the edge charlie glanced across at the lawyer who was coming up and down between the film he was describing and the transcript of what the struggling men were saying to each other and heres sakov when they swing around as hes hit by the swivelling camera and what hes saying can be lipread youre dead georgi done what youre here for down you go like vasili gregorovich no use anymore let go the fucking rifle heres the helicopter marksman get the fuck out the way need a clear shot and you see that sakov tries to do that and bendall says no you fucker youre coming with me everyones coming with me and thats when the bodyguards get to him up the ladder but thats something else i missed bendall doesnt fall not really from the true heightfrom the pod he slips under the rail grabs at the edge and for a second hangs suspended before his hands are kicked away kicked away by sakov but bendalls lessened by a good two meters maybe more how far hes going to fall so the drop doesnt kill him which it was intended to came in anne understanding which it was intended to agreed charlie instead it badly hurts him but leaves him alive the holder of the smoking gun to tell all when he gets his moment in court said anne with her customarily quickness which he thought he had this morning continued charlie heres todays transcript he scrolled through for the moment he wanted here heres davidov turning away from killing bendall the guns by his side not in any firing position he sees the militiaman for the first time standing in front of him now look at the words not me get out of the way thats the door get out of the way of my door not the door my door the door hed been told hell be able to use to get away just like bendall had been told hed be able to get away from the camera platform and lose himself in the crowdhelped by whoever it was waiting for him belowbefore anyone properly realized what had happened which he would have been able to do if vladimir petrovich sakov hadnt grabbed him and tried to throw him over the edge there was a long silence then anne said that it no said charlie he slid across the table towards her two of the photographs the fbi obtained in their background investigation of vasili gregorovich isakov the clearer showed the young man in shorts and a singlet smiling into the sunlight at a beach bar with a wine glass halfraised towards his lips as if he were responding to a toast bendalls closestonlyfriend who died on the timiryazev level crossing too drugged and drunk literally to know what hit him look at his left armthe one holding the winejust above his wrist i can see it said anne now look at this said charlie restarting the presidential shooting tape but very quickly into the struggle pressing the pause button and pointing with his finger right against the screen the sametattoo two parallel lines with an arrow like a fulcrum in between them on the same place on sakovs wrist londons done the comparison although it wasnt really necessary theyre identical you any idea what were talking about here some said charlie her admiration was obvious and he enjoyed it anne insisted on stopping to get crackers and cheese and changed to wine although charlie stayed with scotch and asked for both films to be shown again against their transcripts why let bendall live anne demanded when the transmission finally stopped sakov fails the first time but theywhoever they arehave got bendall at their mercy in hospital maybe they tried with the injection reminded charlie pentathol and alcohol alcohol we thoughtbecause we were supposed to thinkwas residual in an alcoholic an abnormally high level injected directly into a vein into the blood stream to kill a man suffering advanced cirrhosis except that it didnt and afterwards he was under heavier guard surrounded by doctors and nurses it was too dangerous to try again anne shook her head i think youre close but not close enough where am i going wrong demanded charlie unoffended glad she was questioning with a lawyers mind i dont know but its too loose an end it always was insisted anne bent forward in total concentration bendall was alive uncontrolled and liable at any moment to tell ustell anyonewhat it was all about compared to that the risk of trying a third time to kill him wouldnt have been a consideration i said maybe the injection was another attempt to kill him said charlie you want another scenario what prompted anne bringing her head up to him he wasnt uncontrolled the very opposite he was controlled what werent wehavent webeen given youve lost me charlie there arent any taped records of george bendall being treated talking to doctors but probably more importantly to a psychiatrist agayan not necessarily but agayan told us himself that hed had several sessions with bendall remember him saying something about bendall being a classic textbook case anne nodded doubtfully its agayans voice on the tape closing kayley and the americans down when their one interview blew up in their faces said charlie and guerguen agayan was always around at every interview we had with bendall interviews that arnold nolan our own psychiatrist said at the beginning were entirely wrong misdirected to get a proper response from anyone with the mental condition nolan suspected bendall to be suffering the mental condition agayan would have known how to govern when he wanted to and manipulate when he wanted to i talked to you in london about what nolan told methat people with bendalls condition are totally susceptible to directional suggestion charlie paused at the further recollection totally susceptible to directional suggestion particularly under the administration of drugs like pentathol how about bendall being kept total controlled by an injected drug his medical doctor chanced upon finding just that once i dont want to piss on the fire youre stoking up here charlie but there are so many holes its threadbare youre suggesting guerguen semonovich agayan is in this conspiracy right up to his neck right its a possibility or another psychiatrist and that hes the mind manipulator who got george bendall up on a tv platform with a gun in his hand to be held responsible while others carried out the assassinations we know thats what bendall was there for we just dont know who put him there anne held up her hand lets keep it simple bendalls supposed to be pushed over and killed but instead hes just badly injured now for the coincidence of all the hospitals in moscow bendall gets taken to bingo its the one to which his puppetmaster guerguen agayan is attached and doublebingo gets assigned to care for the guy whose strings hes been pulling i believe in coincidences but i dont believe in this one during annes dismissal charlie had sat staring down into hisglass locked into the sort of concentration shed shown earlier when he looked up he was smiling i never knew how or why it happened but george stopped stealing ever so suddenly he quoted it was a long time before he told me he was seeing a doctor a friend who was helping him i dont remember his name ill try ill really try there it is anne why vera had to be killed in lefortovo before she could remember youre forcing the bits into the jigsaw because they look the right shape it fits youll have to do a lot more to prove it and whether theres a need to prove anything is another debatable point isnt it instead of answering charlie said i need to see bendalls body id like to see davidovs too but even though hes dead weve got the right of consular access to see bendalls body havent we i havent got a clue admitted anne but what are you looking for tattoos i wouldnt have believed that if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes id have dismissed it as kids stuff conceded anne charlie shook his head remember how george reacted at belonging to an elite elite groupssocietieshave often used tattooes as a sign of elitism the praetorian guard of the roman emperors marked themselves out like that so did the nazi ss its the sort of shit george would have gone for and so did vladimir petrovich sakov picked up anne you think theres a chance in hell of making him tell you about it she waved towards the vcr youve got evidence there of his being part of the conspiracy hes not going to incriminate himself by admitting anything else im working on it which wasnt true charlie thought there was a way to turn sakov but it could also be the way to expose natalia if shed become part of an intelligence service coverup he was already officially on hold why push it any further anne topped up her glass and leaned back in her encompassing chair tucking her bare feet beneath her we could have done this in the office i know hed forgotten the directness how did your daughter like her doll she already had one just like it london was good a lot of fun yes im not looking for commitment charlie or to pick up other peoples pieces i wasnt going to ask you to you sure about microwave magic yes but thanks another time when its right yes when its right natalia had eaten but was still up when charlie got back to lesnaya watching the only story being covered on the late night news charlie said i thought youd already be in bed i stayed up to watch this again do you want anything no he nodded to the newscast hows that change things im not sure were recalling karelin obviously what about you im waiting for londons instructions until then im not to do anything it took until now to be told that charlie frowned what im surprised it took until now to be told that it all happened this morning and i had to go back and forth to london and go through god knows how many conferences and discussions at the embassy so of course it took until now natalia froze the transmission at the exodus from the court and there you are on tv looking as if id shit myself i almost did a little later when i saw the militia officer had his gun on me natalia didnt smile and theres the british lawyer charlie frowned again yes the one you went back to london with yes you didnt tell me she was a woman i didnt think it was relevant shes attractive i dont think thats relevant either where the fuck was this intuition coming from was she at tonights meetings she was at todays meetings with a lot of other people what is this im just surprised you didnt tell me your lawyer was a woman thats all natalia you spend every minute of your day working more with men than with women does it ever occur to you to tell me about them it probably would if i went on an overseas trip with them well it didnt with me and if youre reading something into it which i wish you wouldnt because theres nothing to be read in then im sorry sorry things are breaking down between us as badly as they seem to be doing yes agreed natalia solemnly im sorry about that too when charlie answered anne abbotts internal voice mail message she at once announced i know where bendalls body is and how you might get to see it where how back at burdenko theyve called expecting us to handle the funeral arrangements by which they really mean the cost brookings apoplectic he usually is are we going to bendall was still officially a british subject legally theres a liability but we need a declared death certificate brooking doesntwant to sully his hands by asking for it and says we know the people there you volunteering the hospital vestibule seemed oddly empty without its challenging guard detail but the receptionist recognized charlie and located nicholai badim on her second attempt she said youre lucky he doesnt have a theater list after the preceding twelve hours his luck deserved to change charlie decided he had a lot of bridges to rebuild and leaving lesnaya without bothering with breakfast was scarcely the way to begin the reconstruction he wasnt sure he yet knew where or how to start but running out of the house wasnt the way if anything it was an unspoken admission of what natalia suspected him of having done in london even sasha had detected the frigid atmosphere asking why they werent talking and why he was leaving so early the previous night theyd laidalmost theatricallystiffly apart natalia jerking away when shed relaxed into a half sleep and accidentally touched his leg with hers the balding quickly blinking surgeonadministrator came curiously into the foyer frowning at charlies reason for being there we could have arranged that by telephone the man was anxious to reestablish the authority that had been too often overridden during the questioning of bendall charlie decided ive also got to satisfy myself that it is bendalls body formal identification the frownand irritationdeepened see it theres hardly anything left of the face to identify its a necessary formality you must surely know what bureaucracy is like the other man shrugged gesturing for charlie to follow as he thrust off deeper into the hospital if it will hurry things up we need the mortuary space ive told the militia i want to get rid of the other one davidovs body is here as well his luck was definitely changing were the nearest mortuary to the court its inconvenient an imposition the corridor along which they were walking was littered with dirty laundry predominantly sheets some abandoned on the floor and some piled up on a row of empty metalframed beds a lot were bloodstained there were also equipment cartons and boxes mostly empty but a few were still sealed and unpacked there was even a stack sealed in the lift in which they descended into the basement badim seemed oblivious to it all all the mortuary drawers appeared to have name designations on them boris davidovs was next to bendalls there was only one attendant in the room who half straightened at badims entry but then decided not to bother with the respect the surgeon ignored him too hauling bendalls drawer out himself and flicking the covering sheet back from the near headless body it was made bloodlessly white by the refrigeration ok the russian demanded impatiently the sheet still covered most of the dead mans torso charlie quickly lifted it uncovering the left side the upper part of the injured arm was still bandaged almost down to the elbow but the wrist was bare on it was the parallel line tattoo separated by the arrow fulcrum what are you looking for said badim at charlies shoulder charlie lowered the sheet id like to see davidovs body too why im not sure how much information london will want in my report they might have a query about davidov and i dont want to have to bother you a second time the adjoining drawer was withdrawn even more impatiently badim said i dont want to be bothered again either the entire upper part of davidovs body appeared crushed no attempt had been made to clean up the bullet wounds there was the same matching tattoo on the mans left wrist are you carrying out autopsies the cause of death is self evident in both cases they havent been asked for no finally satisfied thank you said charlie falling in step with the man as they left the mortuary all i need now is the certificate how quickly can you have the body removed ill try to have things moving as soon as i get back to the embassy charlie wondered upon whom brooking would unload that chore the man had actually smiled his gratitude when charlie had offered to collect the certificate today if possible urged the russian i can understand how glad you and dr agayan are to get the hospital back to normality badim turned to charlie in the elevator frowning again agayan hes not attached to my staff charlies telltale feet throbbed but he was here part of your team the surgeonadministrator made a disparaging gesture towards the cardboad litter we arent funded sufficiently for cleaners let alone a resident psychiatrist agayan is at the serbsky institute which was the principal kgb psychiatric institute in which soviet dissidents were incarcerated and many made mad to justify their imprisonment at the height of the communist oppression charlie instantly recognized how did he come to be involved seconded in as part of the emergency when bendall was admitted seconded in by whom badim humped his shoulders uncertainly the militia i suppose he would have been the obvious choice there was another foot twinge why the obvious choice he knew bendalls case history had treated him in the past apparently it only took minutes for badim to complete the certificate are you sure youve now got everything you want more than sufficient thanked charlie once the floodgates opened things usually seemed to come in a surge but did he want it to anymore her kgb career had been based on psychology and natalia was sure she psychologically knew charlie intimately and wished for once that she didnt he hadnt denied it if he had positively she would have accepted it because she wanted to accept itbelieve itfor herself and for sasha and for thembut he hadnt so he hadnt wanted to lie to her personally and by not lying hed confirmed what had only been the vaguest of suspicions predicated upon nothing more than the televisioncaptured look and whatever the lipmoving exchange had been between the woman and charlie as shed left the court he hadnt denied it the four words were a continuing mantra in natalias head distracting herdeflecting herfrom the reconvened meeting which had just ended as inconclusively as every other session with viktor karelin now all she wanted to do was end it to get away from these two men and their verbal carousel of avoidance so enclosing was her despair that natalia felt something close to the need to runlike charlie had run from lesnaya that morningwhich was absurd because there was nowhere mentally or physically to run but didnt she have to didnt she have to make some move either physically or mentally to end her impossible perpetually conflicting situation with charlie muffin what about loving him which despite everything she still did she at once acknowledged the much more important question what about his loving her he hadnt sufficiently when hed abandoned her in london all those years ago and he clearly didnt now so there was no point in going on with the pretense convincing herself it was better for sasha and better for her there were too many risks too many dangers and shed fooled herself into believing there was some way she could handle it he hadnt denied it now it was time for her to deny thered ever been a chance of their making a life together natalia forced the reflections back willing her concentration entirely upon the more impending demands almost as unsettled by the behaviour of the two men supposedly conducting the enquiry with her federal prosecutor pavl filitov had tried as hard that morning as on every other occasion to be conciliatory and nonconfrontational towards the recalled intelligence chairman but yuri trishins attitude had been quite different and she still didnt understand it its time to finalize our opinion and make our recommendations to the president agreed yuri trishin didnt respond to filitovs inviting look it was the chief of staff who said yes were either of you better satisfied with chairman karelin today than on previous occasions i was not impressed at all said trishin natalia felt the slightest lift of satisfaction at what small though it might be was the first positive opinion trishin had volunteered since the commission had opened which he wouldnt have offered if there hadnt already been some discussion between the man and the acting president whom he represented pavl yakovlevich i believe there has been serious infiltrationsabotageof which the disappearance of any details of boris davidov having once been an officer in the kgb or the fsb is a part said the federal prosecutor stating the obviousbut avoiding a commitmentwith a lawyers pedantry that wasnt the question but lets explore your answer said natalia it isnt simply records of boris davidov that disappeared from the federal intelligence archives the man got into court using official identification from the federalnaia sluzhba besopasnosti and shot dead with an officially issued weapon a man accused of murder wouldnt you agree thats an appalling lackand breachof internal security filitov stirred uncomfortably at the pressure before the lawyer could speak trishin said thats very definitely my assessment further guidance from another kremlin suite natalia recognized from the quick look he gave the other man she suspected filitov at last realized it too the lawyer said there are unquestionably grounds for criticism not censure for maladministration filitov waited for the chief of staffs lead but trishin remained silent finally filitov said that might be an extreme judgment weve been made to look internationally ridiculous said trishin and throughout these hearings weand the acting presidenthave been treated with contempt by everyone we have summoned from the intelligence community now it was natalia who hesitated surprised at the virtual confirmation of pressure from aleksandr okulov but it was more than that they were being told which way to go but the responsibilitywould be theirs not okulovs what about an external investigation i do not believe the situation can be left to an internal fsb enquiry which is very obviously and clearly chairman karelins intention declared trishin what recommendations do you propose invited natalia intent on the answer shed never expected to get this strength of argument from trishins earlier prevarication wasnt sure she wanted it after her earlier doubts about her and charlie what are your suggestions pavl yakovlevich retreated the chief of staff at the moment of commitment the federal prosecutor looked across the room at the notetaking secretariat there should be criticism for the lapses and a request to chairman karelin to publish the result of the internal enquiries and yours yuri fedorovich said natalia quickly before the chief of staff could identify her as the proposer there should be a totally independent external investigation with its result published set out the portly chief of staff it should be made clear to chairman karelin that he and his officers are legally required to respond to every enquiry a requirement that has been blatantly ignored here and our findings should also be that the existing senior command structure of the federalnaia sluzhba besopasnosti is guilty of serious failings in its administration and that steps necessary to correct it should be made public was it conceivable that his political ambitions had turned aleksandr mikhailevich okulov so totally against his former colleagues or was the determination to reject the speculation that the same ambition implicated him in some way with the attack upon the two presidents or something altogether different an agenda she couldnt guess at she said whats your feeling upon those proposals pavl yakovlevich the federal prosecutor stared for several moments at trishin i believe they are too draconian and you havent responded yourself yet i believe the attitudes and the events justify them which gives you a two to one majority in favor acknowledged filitov unless you care to make it unanimous i dont said the lawyer i also wish to register a minority disagreement thats your right recognized natalia i know it is charlie reached his decisionthe only one there realistically could have beenlong before he got to the american embassy it was going to be the first time in his neverlose neverbebeaten life that hed turned his back on a halffinished operation and he didnt give a shit integrity was natalias problem not his he didnt care if she was even peripherally unwittingly involved the suspicion was probably an aberration like so many other bloody stupid things hed done in the last few days but he couldnt take the chance the only consideration was bridge building keeping himself and natalia and sasha together and to do that he was prepared to make any compromise and every concession anne abbott would expect an explanation which would be easy hed simply lie and insist that bendall didnt have a tattoo not tell her about davidov or agayan at all which only left vladimir sakov whom she did know about easy again she was more aware than he was that he had no legal authority to arrest or interrogate the cameraman hed tell anne hed done the only thing possible alerting the russians and leave it at that it wasnt important anymore to impress anne madness to have triedwanted toin the first place to have been flattered by the adventure should he admit it to natalia confess to the madness that it had been and plead her forgiveness flagellate himself if thats what it took what if she couldnt forgive him consider it his final betrayal to go with all the rest too dangerous a strategy safer to say nothing neither deny nor confirm it was after all only intuition remarkable though that had been the next few dayshe hoped not the next few weekswerent going to be the best fun hed ever had but hed brought the ashes on his own head so hed have to livewith it just as long as natalia was living it with him there was an atmosphere of flatnessof everything being on half powerabout the american incident room john kayley came odorously from his side office and said tell me youve come up with something to keep this investigation on the road like what kayley shook his head in defeat were stymied ive got everyone carrying out a total review but weve done that already days ago now everythings under russian control where is olga asked charlie looking into the empty office hasnt shown ive got calls in what are your people saying in london im to sit and do nothing until told otherwise yours ive still got a murder and the maiming of the presidents wife by a person or persons unknown and until i find who those persons are my ass is being burned every hour on the hour scamells gone to the foreign ministry to try diplomatic pressure to get us actively involved but all well get is the runaround im fucked charlie for the first time in my life i dont have a lead to follow or a path to take after the fuck up with the director i thought i was fireproof but not any longer this could be goodbye john deke kayley so all suggestions will be gratefully received the way to take everything forwardprobably solved it allburst upon charlie with complete clarity he said sorry mate im as stymied as you are charlie bypassed both richard brooking and anne abbott once more locking himself away in his riverview office and actually standing at the window running the idea through his mind for problems and finding none except one causing difficulties for natalia if she was being manipulated in some way which was as high as he was any longer prepared to consider her being an unwitting inside source and the danger of which was after all why he intended lying to anne abbott and doing nothing about what hed discovered that day turning his back charlie reminded himself again for the first time ever it irked him like the nagging persistent pain from anabscess that was going to go on hurting until it was lanced whatever compromise or concession he thought in further reminder his personal difficulty was that giving up had always been the one compromise hed never been prepared to make so now was the time to learn at least he knew himself he could probably have brought everything to a conclusion although examined as closely as he was examining now it wasnt one hundred percent certain that he and kayley could have instilled sufficient fear brooking agreed to see charlie at once and said again how grateful he was when charlie delivered the death certificate a complication had arisen with the russians arguing the embassy was responsible for vera bendalls burial as well but at least in her case they had a certificate the housing officer was arranging it all they were hoping peter bendalls plot would be big enough to accommodate two more coffins with luck theyd manage the interment without the media learning about it anne said it was bad luck that george bendall hadnt been tattooed but that it had been worth checking and agreed that they had no jurisdiction whatsoever to investigate vladimir sakov she wondered what olga would do with the information about vladimir sakov and charlie said he didnt know but the militia colonel had promised to keep him informed so whats that leave you to do she asked wait for londons instructions said charlie they were waiting for him on his personal fax machine when he got back to his office with bendalland his killerdead the enquiry became entirely one between russia and the united states of america he was to take no further active part in the investigation merely to maintain a liaison role to enable the file to be closed when it was satisfactorily concluded now hed been officially told to turn his back charlie recognized it still irked him because hed never done that when officially ordered either charlie called out for sasha which he always did if he got home to lesnaya at a time she would be up but there was no scurried response natalia was sitting in one of the large lounge chairs facing the door as if she were waiting charlie said i hoped youd be home did you wheres sasha sleeping over at marinas shes only five marina was sashas closest friend at preschool five and a half which is old enough retreat charlie warned himself of course it is we could go out to dinner if you like no hed poured the ashes over his own head charlie reminded himself im getting a drink would you like one no from the drinks tray he said londons told me to stand away from the investigation leave everything to the militia and the americans have they she shouldnt have packed the cases waiting in the bedroom because she didnt want to do it now that the moment had comenow that shed made the plansnatalia wanted to pull back but knew she couldnt or could she it was only the cases really couldnt she hide them in a closet stay after hed left the following morning and unpack them charlie sat on the matching couch close enough to reach out and touch her but not doing so from the attitude so far it was going to be a long time before hed be touching her how did today go was it fair to seek his advice there was no one elseanother finally accepted professional although now cynical reason for changingher mindand charlie had a batlike protective antenna not the way i expected better seized charlie lets go through it natalia did hesitantly to begin with and charlie didnt once interrupt hoping hed found the first bridge when she finally finished he said i think youre right about pressure from okulov hes got to do something to impress washington to get the treaty he needs for the election and purging the fsbwhich needs purging from what youve told mewould be a hell of a way publicly to do it with the commission which recommends the purge the casualty of any battle between the communistleaning fsb and the existing group in the kremlin natalia was right charlie accepted and at risk if the presidential shooting was left to run inconclusively into the ground so what about his own rock and a hard place trying to protect natalia by not using what he knew against endangering her if he did according to everything shed told him it had been nataliaprovably on secretariat tapes and in secretariat notebookswho had been consistently critical of the fsb from the outset of the official enquiry with yuri trishin the presidents chief of staff unpersuaded until today which showed nataliaarguably although she wasnt a disenchanted former kgb officerthe prime instigator of any fsb overhaul an obvious and unavoidable target it could also be the unproven unproveable evidence of yuri trishinnever natalia even unwittinglybeing the internal source to the conspiracy a new mantra echoed in charlies mind unproven unproveable i want to talk something through with you again i want to go on talking about this misunderstood natalia deciding at the same time that there were several closets in the unused bedrooms in which she could hide the cases until the following day thats what i am thinking about im sorry i thought she stumbled shit shit and double shit even charlies frustration cursing was automatic for her good thought charlie she was on the defensive a footplank if not a bridge every little helped so hed push it as far across the gulf as he could dont try to think ahead of me talk with me what reason was there for trishins uturn today karelin stonewalling as always as always echoed charlie snatching at the response hes stonewalled at every encounter even sent sacrifices at the beginning yes natalia accepted questioningly do you remember our conversation about there being an inside sourcea leakfor every move in the investigation to be sidetracked or misdirected yes she questioned again she couldnt follow him see the point towards which he was going could it have been trishin be trishin natalias mind was in a turmoil too many unconnected thoughts fluttering in a windblown paperchase doing what using you manipulating no natalias mind cleared the paperchase wind abruptly blowing away the uncertainty you didnt mean using me manipulating me you thought it was me suspected me imagined i was part of something she was forward in the chair eyes bulged in outrage no frantically denied charlie despairing of her psychologytuned intuition im frightened youve been used i have havent i charlie used for such a very long time stop it natalia he shouted stop this going wrong getting any worse i can help theres a way she jerked up but having done so didnt know what to do thrusting forward but then coming back to stand over him to stare down contemptuously sasha is staying with marinas family because i asked if she could i didnt want her to be here tonight to see id even changed my mind was going to try to forget whatever you did with that woman because it could have been a mistake something you didnt think about but you dont do anything without thinking about it do you you bastard youre even ready to think id cheat on you be prepared to mislead your fucking precious professionalism stop it charlie shouted again this is stupid shouldnt be happening im not part of anything a conspiracy or a cover up or whateverelse it is your contorted convoluted mind imagines you want to know what im guilty of im guilty of believing that you could change and love me and trust me and dear god wasnt that a mistake you did it very well charlie you got a posting here and you realized how useful id be and you managed to make it work for all this time she was hysterical beyond immediate reason sit down please sit down and listen to me natalia youre wrong all the way wrong sit down and listen to me listen to what i have to say what has to be said im leaving charlie announced natalia shaking her head as she walked away its over should never have begun she emerged at once from the bedroom with a case in either hand im asking you not to leave charlie was standing his hands out you should learn to trust someone sometime charlie but you never will where are you going an hotel initially which one dont become a nuisance what about sasha what about her what are you going to tell her how about the father who didnt want to see her for the first three years she was born had to go away again thats not fair or true lets not get into a discussion about fairness or truth i love you charlie called after her natalia quietly closed the door behind herself charlie waited at the british embassy entrance to authorize john kayleys admission the american said you look rough bad night kind of said charlie wallowing in a lake of selfpity and islay malt hadnt been the best idea you mind passing on the cigars for a while not if you tell me what im here for pictures and moving lips kayley followed the video struggle between bendall and vladimir sakov with the lipread transcript before him and did the same directly afterwards with the courtroom killing but on this showing charlie freezeframed the tattoo comparison between the ntv cameraman and the fbicollected photograph of vasili isakov charlie said bendall and davidov have the same tattoos in the same place their bodies are at the burdenko mortuary but the hospital wants to get rid of them we need photographs londons taken responsibility for bendalls body we might be able to bluff the hospital about davidov but at the moment the priority is with the living more than the dead before he gets dead youve done good charlie damned good you worked it out to the very end already not yet charlie admitted but i think i know how to would natalia ever learn what hed done to keep her safe he already had the list of moscow hotels to call later to find out where she was hows this measure for size once as charlie talked kayleys hand strayed to his cigars but the american remembered in time smiling apologetically when charlie finished kayley said we swing a trick like this im permanently in the bureaus hall of fame and youre a todiefor friend for life but well never get it to work that mean you dont want to give it a try sure as hell no but well only get one hit you think washington will go for it the presidents wife was shot for christs sake by a bullet meant for him and you ask if theyll go for it you going to ask them first kayley snorted the rejection it doesnt work my tits in the ringer for failing if it does work ill announce it and wait for the presidential congratulations officially im on watch and listen no active participation its my call anyway and theres no jurisdiction now youre trying to talk me out of it just getting the rules of engagement clear between us insisted charlie like you said we only get one hit so where the station says hes off sick i called without saying who i was lets hope hes not too sick vladimir petrovich sakov didnt sound too sick but there wasnt the belligerence there had been in the mess room of the ntv studios the muffled demand to identify themselves was shouted through the chipped door of the apartment in a crumbling block on kazakova ulitza gradually being shaken off its sandballasted foundations by the perpetual shuddering traffic of the inner peripherique behind and the reverberating railway line in front when they said who they were the voice came back stronger fuck off relieved its us kayley shouted back there was no reply we know vladimir petrovich said charlie weve got all the proof we need too we even know about the tattoos kayley gently pushed charlie out of the direct firing line through the door pulling himself to the opposite side the american said loudly you worried id be if i were you id be shit scared there was still no response from inside i just realized something said charlie this railway line is the one on which vasili isakov was murdered further up at timiryazev isnt it you think they might try that again why not said kayley responding to charlies nodded invitation you got away with it well enough last time didnt you vladimir whats it like knowing youre going to die and that theres nothing you can do about it asked charlie you really must be shit scared you want your life saved you open the door vlad old buddy advised the american were your only chance so stop being an asshole the shuffling was audible on the other side were waiting said charlie but not for much longer added kayley there was the grating of more than one lock being released aheadof a longer clattering sound vladimir sakov put himself to one side for a warning view of several meters along the outside corridor headnodding them into the room the long sleeves of the wellpressed blue woollen shirt were buttoned hiding the body markings and the jeans were much cleaner than those at his meeting with charlie at the tv station the apartment was surprisingly neat and well furnished in contrast to the outside neglect and there were photographsone of instant interest was of a much slimmer younger sakov in army uniformbut charlie didnt get the impression of permanence the impression he did get was of a very different man from the gutrot swigging slob of the tv mess room charlie turned at the repeated clattering and saw there was a cats cradle of chains crisscrossing the inside of the door the dead lock and mortise looked new a makarov lay on a table which was totally hidden from the outside when the door was open kayley gestured to the handgun and said youre going to need more than that to keep you alive once everybody knows what we know so its only the two of you who do at the moment this mans training had involved more than being taught how to use a camera charlie thought pushing the pained condescension into his voice he said vladimir petrovich do we look as if we just drove in from the steppes in a hay cart we said we know and one of the things we know is that your job was to kill george bendall not save him do you think wed come here and confront a willing killer without insurance come on charlie hoped sakov hadnt seen the tension twitch through the bulged american theyd all three been standing but now charlie walked casually as if he had the right to a chair closest to the photographs beyond the one showing sakov in army uniform was another of the man in swimming shorts none showed sakov with either male or female companions kayley found himself a chair and finally sakov sat down very slowly enabling the russian to see what he was doing kayley extracted the lip moving transcripts from the manila envelope he carried let me read something to you youre dead georgi done what youre here for down you go like vasili gregorovich no use anymore recognize those words yourwords and what bendall said back no you fucker youre coming with me everyones coming with me if youd pushed him properly not let him see you coming it would have worked and he would have been over the top head first before that cnn lensman heard the commotion and turned his camera on you saw everything that was real bad luck wasnt it how said sakov there wasnt the slightest belligerence in his voice any more that favorite phrase of politicians said charlie read my lips now youve got to read ours said kayley he went into the envelope again taking out isakovs picture and the cnn freeze frame just so you know what there is by tonight well have the match from the mortuary with bendall and davidov so far kayley hadnt put a footor rather a wordwrong but charlie hoped the american properly realized they were dealing with a professional could he risk a wrong word taking things on as he wanted howd you feel after bendall survived after youre coming with me everyones coming with me i know hes cleverthats why he was moved in at oncebut you were putting a hell of a lot of trust in just one very clever man to keep bendall from talking werent you what a pity you didnt have someone on the theater staff at the hospital bendall could have died under surgery and the problem would have been over wouldnt it youd have got him the second time guerguen semonovich could do anything he wanted with the idiot said the russian his uncertainty deepening he had bendall trained like pavlovs dogs responding without question to any instruction any guidance isakov too to an extent isakov trusted him believed he was curing bendall of his demons got it thought charlie triumphantly all they needed was that little extra nudge one wrong word he thought again he was about to speak when kayley began even though but charlie urgently talked over the american but guerguen semonovich agayan didnt train you the kgb did and you were the link between the idiots and the real planners thats why i dont understand why theyve let you live the court was the end that closed it down but it didnt did it pressed charlie kayley came back on track again indicating the makarov and the chained door and you didnt believe that it did yourself did you vlad old buddy for fucks sake stop calling me vlad old buddy erupted sakov youd better believe it said the american were your wayyour only wayto stay alive now you said that before both charlie and kayley recognized the half question as the beginning of the capitulation kayley said heres how it is the toss of a coin only in your case vlad old buddy heads you losethe moment we make public what we know with all the photographs and the lip read transcriptsand tails you lose again because they cant afford to let you go on living telling all you know so heres what you do you run to me to america i get you out of here on an american flight on a phony passport like weve got a lot of russian defectors out before you testify before a grand jury telling us all about the conspiracy so that we can issue legal indictments against everyone whos part of it to enable moscow to make all the arrests then we put you into the witnesses protection program new identity new citizenship and a us government pension and you live happily ever after what guarantee have i got youll do all that a better guarantee than youve got staying alive here when we go public said kayley but think about it you think the president of the united states of america isnt going to be grateful for you telling everyone who tried to kill him and so badly hurt his wife i get full amnesty thats the deal when asked sakov his voice almost inaudible how much time do you think youve got none sakov finally conceded i dont think so either agreed kayley dont call me vlad old buddy anymore i wont promised the american ruth anandale had her good hand to her face sobbing and it was a mistake to reach out for the useless one because she screamed hysterically dont stop it dont touch it its dead theres progress all the time insisted anandale a worn out assurance the moment theres a breakthrough well have it i told you youd get better and you will i promise stop it walt stop it stop it stop it im a freak always going to be a freak cant dress anymore as i want swim as i want and ride as i want and play tennis like i want i cant even cut my own fucking food anymore or drive a car anymore or write my name anymore a freak wait whats it like to be married to a fucking freak it had been max donningtons suggestion to be discreetly in the background when anandale told his wife that the two european brachial plexus specialists had unanimously agreed with the american surgeons that there was no treatment or surgery possible to restore any use to ruth anandales arm the admiral came quickly forward already prepared come on ruth take these theyll make it easier ruth anandale was calm when she looked up at the man these arent the pillsthe tranquilizeri need max what about some pills to make it really easy anandale remained for another hour in the private quarters of the white house waiting until his wife finally fell asleep and when he was sure she had and wouldnt hear he said to donnington you think weve got an additional problem unquestionably trauma of some sort was inevitable the only uncertainty was the degree does this degree needs specialist treatment too i think it would be wrong not to consider psychiatry as i told you before your wife is going to need all the help she can get anandale looked up irritably at the butlers hesitant entry i told you i was off limits i think youll want to hear mr north said the man what demanded anandale emerging into the outer dressing room kayleys got one of the guys involved the cameraman on thegantry with bendall hes defected and agreed to go before a grand jury kayleys on his way with him now for a moment anandale stood with his head bowed savoring the moment then he looked up smiling i dont want a single rat to run the security blackout on this is absolute tell justice i want a grand jury empanelled at once starting today and i want to see kayley the moment he hands the guy over it took charlie less than an hour to locate natalias booking at the radisson slavjanskaya hotel on berezhkavskaya naberezhnaya having done so he sat uncertainly in his embassy office for a further thirty minutes finally deciding against a personal encounter particularly in front of sasha whom he was sure would be staying there with her the longest time of all was spent composing the letter because charlie always had the greatest difficulty openly expressing personal feelings which was probably the root cause of all his problems with natalia he acknowledged he wrote finally that he loved her and he loved sasha and wanted them both back with him at lesnaya he was sorry how badly things had collapsed but that it wasnt irreparable all they needed to do was to talk to get the misunderstandings out of the way the compromises accepted he was certainly ready to make compromises and hoped she was too there also might be another reason for them to speak very shortly she knew the number at which hed be waiting charlie took the metro to the kievskaya stop and was careful entering the foyer not wanting any accidental meeting he waited to see the receptionist put the envelope in the pigeonhole for room there was no key displayed which meant she had to be there he was back in the lesnaya apartment by eight no message had been left on the answering machine during the time he was away the telephone didnt ring during the rest of the night either john kayley was poucheyed bristlechinned and the alwayscrumpled suit in which hed lived for close to fortyeight hours looked like the dustbin liner a bag lady would have rejected around him hung the sourness of curdled cigar odor charlie had snatched at the outside line hope flaring that kayleys call from sheremetyevo had been natalia he again waited at the embassy entrance for the americans arrival direct from the airport when he did get there charlie said now youre the one looking rough but happy said kayley the telephone warning had given charlie time to have the islay malt and glasses ready pouring charlie said we got all the reasons we want to celebrate kayley offered his glass towards charlies to make the toast as the glasses touched the american said youre not going to believe it any of it ive heard that a lot of times never like this how much did you get before handing him over charlie was glad the other man appeared to have sickened himself of his scented cigars the riverview office was becoming clogged by the aromatic residue enough to get almost the whole of the conspiracy the grand jury should get the rest what they dont will come out of the woodwork here once we issue the indictments itll be christmas wrapped charlie refilled their glasses leaving the bottle within easy reach between them so what am i not going to believe its a kgb stalwarts conspiracy but its not a kgb conspiracy its also an fsb wrecking cabalto rebuild the old style kgbbythe communist party who see it as their red carpet back into the kremlin kayley paused and who would most probably have got there if you hadnt got in the way charlie my problems not disbelieving protested charlie its understanding to understand youve got to hear it in sequence insisted kayley be patient sakovs a kgbnow fsbcolonel career officer originally working out of the third chief directorateresponsible for monitoring the armed forces which the armed forces resent to the point of eliminating anyone they discovered doing itwith two functions hes an agentinplace a spy within the russian army reporting back to lubyanka anything and everything the second function is as a spotter isolating potentially useful and usable people for what was at the time he was in afghanistan the kgb ok heres the first thing i cant believe because i never could broke in charlie i cant believe any espionage service worthy of the description would isolate bendall usable repeated kayley thats how bendall was described to sakov by the lubynka unpredictable mad drunk whatever he was still the son of a british defector he had to have a use somehow somewhere theyd had him pinned to the board like a specimen since childhood sakovs instructions are not to get too closehe says he doesnt know who the kids immediate kgb control was within his army unitbut constantly to watch and assess he doesnt go for it at first defectors son or not but he does concede one thing soberand under daily trainingbendalls a hell of a shot able to take the eye out of the ace every time and he likes killing psychotically in afghanistan he used to volunteer always out in front with his hand up its an abilityand a tendencythat gets registered like everything gets registered remember what the wise man said about knowledge being power thats the watchword every espionage service in the world learned from russian intelligence so what do they do with it as far as bendall is concerned file it of course were talking an old time kgb faction total control freaks who keep records on everyone sakovs army cover isas a movie and television cameraman gives him all the excuses to move aroundfilmeverything and anything he wants another of the official divisional propaganda photographers is vasili gregorovich isakov who likes as often as he can to attach himself to bendalls sniper unit his control anticipated charlie kayley shook his head you know how the saying goes boys will be girls seems that the military record we got was tightened down a lot according to sakov who was there the only time bendall showed any stabilitybecame normalwas when he and isakov were a couple bendall didnt get drunk and he didnt fight and he hit everything he shot at right in the middle but being gay in the militaryany militaryisnt a good career move they werent particularly discreet about it and military intelligence just arrived one day unannounced and took isakov away never to be seen again bendall just flaked off the wall he became virtually suicidal like an animal according to sakov thats when he drank diesel fuel and almost died charlie accepted that he needed the chronology for perspectiveto understandbut he was impatient to get to something he didnt at least have partial knowledge of even without kayley smoking his office was going to smell like a humidor for days so they throw him out and he continues to freefall poor wanttobeblind vera convinces herself hes stealing western visitors cases at sheremetyevowhich he does occasionallybut georgiboys bigger income is working as a male hooker around the tourist hotels and how do we know because russias now redesigned and renamed internal security service the fsb has an attachment on bendalls militia rap sheet and know every time a foreign gay has the balls to file a complaint after waking up from a night of passion to find his wallet and jewellery gone the militia are in on it clarified charlie just wait until i get to the cast list confirmed the american topping up their glasses again now we get to the broader picture the president of the united states gets some domestic difficulties and needs a diversion the president of russia doesnt look as ifhell make second term unless he gets a big one a marriage made in heaven but the kommunisticheskaya partiya rossiiskoi federatsii see an even greater potential the american secretary of state commutes back and forth forever dangling a treaty banning the us nuclear missile defense system an american presidential visit was trailed for months time enough to organize the assassination of two world leaders ensure a communist reentry into the kremlin and wreck to and for the communist benefit all russias intelligence organizational reforms everything goes back as it was before with gorbachov a blip in russias history and yeltsin the joke he always was thats not a broader picture complained charlie thats a panoramic screen sit back and listen to the coup of the century promised kayley colonel sakovs out of the army by now working for ntvstill the ideal posting to roam with a tv identification where he wouldnt be permitted otherwiseand where vasili gregorovich isakov is chief cameraman and delighted to help an old army photographer colleague but sakov thinking there isnt a coincidence it isnt a coincidence agreed kayley as chief cameraman isakov gets all the plum assignments and has even better access to places hes singled out for positive fsb approach to become a source before the treaty shuttling starts when it does our conspirators find a very different use for the guy when do i get names demanded charlie finally giving way to the impatience two that sakov positively knows are nikolai ivliyev and aleksandr kashva both communist party deputies in the duma but therell be more when the shit hits the fan set out the american the lubyanka traditionalists are general gennardi nikolaevich mittell first deputy director of the fsb and general boris andrevich lvov commander of the presidential protection division real jewel in the crownkeeping them in front of every turn in the investigationis militia general leonid sergeevich zenin hes the bearded guy in court and sakov also told me that although hes not sure he thinks pavl filitov is in there zenin told him it wasfilitov not anyone in the justice ministry who rejected a murder investigation into the death of vera bendall and you already know about agayan hows that for having a king in every castle in theory unbeatable said charlie mittel was the deputy with whom natalia clashed on the first day of the commission hearings he remembered how was it supposed to work did work almost completely insisted kayley sakov stages an accidental encounter with bendall whos cruising his favorite hotel the national during the reminiscences sakov drops the fact that vasili isakov is the chief cameraman at ntv the tearful reunion takes place that same night isakovs got a lot of pull its easy to get the longlost bendall the gofers job its happy families again the conspiracy need is to get bendall under some sort of manipulative control he starts to settle down again but sakov suggests to isakov that his boyfriend will benefit from seeing a psychiatrist enter guerguen agayan mr mind bender himself from the serbsky institute in less time that it takes to say labotomy theyve got their pavlov dog whos planning all this broke in charlie sakov isnt clear on that he thinks theres a group a committee in the duma mittels the liaison with lvovwhos supposed to keep the president alive ready to supply the route details when the time comes but lets get back in sequence sorry sakov says they cant believe their luck when the presidential summit is announced knowing theyre going to get the top prize its the signal to press the wellprepared button on bendall by killing isakov who killed him interrupted charlie again sakov says he doesnt know but i think he does maybe it was sakov himself he was certainly involved admits to being with them both the night isakov died bendall is distraughtinconsolable which is what hes supposed to be agayan starts putting in the fix convinces bendall whom he can apparently make jump through hoops that isakov was murdered on the orders of the president lev yudkin sakov works hard to cover his ass here claims not to know where bendall got the rifle but i cant see how it could have beenanyone but him to know so much about everything else and have a blank here doesnt make sense he also says he doesnt know how agayan kept the pressure up on bendall but that doesnt square with me either like i said a lot of the gaps are going to be filled by the grand jury and the outcome back here he certainly doesnt denybecause he cantknowing that bendall was going to shoot because his job was to kill bendall afterwards as we know and can prove sakov says that had he got bendall over the edge but hed survived the intention was for the waiting lvov to shoot him on the ground but that lvov couldnt because of the delay of the fight alerting everyone to what was happening now its all falling apart around them accepted charlie adding to their glasses panic time because of what sakovs said during the fight agreed kayley but these guys are resilient they know from lvov whos right there literally on top of bendall that the guys unconscious by the time he comes round in burdenko after surgery agayan is there authorized to surgeonadministrator badims satisfaction by general leonid zenin in overall charge of the militia investigation why doesnt agayan kill him sakov says he doesnt know how agayan managed ititll certainly be a hard question for badimbut no one else at the hospital apart from agayan was ever totally alone with bendall if bendall died wed have demanded an autopsy agayan would have put himself in the frame slipping him some unauthorized drug and obviously he couldnt do it in front of badim or the nurses or the guards it was just always too busy jesus said charlie and we thought only sakov would be shitting himselfl i told you agayan was mr mind bender the way sakov understands it agayan convinces bendall hes got a second chance of revenge against lev yudkin in public by making the exposing declaration he was trying in court when davidov shot him now theres a lot of questions here stopped charlie bendall knows sakov tried to kill him because all along according to agayan sakov was in on the plotto kill isakov which he was but agayan convinced the poor bastard that sakov was working for the kremlin under yudkins orders that was going to be part of the courtroom denunciation which gets us to davidov hows he get into the picture panoramic screen corrected kayley smiling according to sakov a kgb department unaffected by the supposed reforms and still maintained within the fsb is the executive action departmentdepartment vto organize and carry out assassinations davidov served in it he was simply ordered by deputy director mittel to carry out the killing davidov was heading for a particular door because hed been told his escape was arranged actually there was another shooter outsideprobably one of the gunmen who shot at the presidential group outside the white housewaiting to take davidov out but the militiaman put him down first charlie shook his head davidov had the same tattoo i saw it its not an arrow between two lines its supposed to be a bullet in the barrel of a gun its traditional for marksmen in russian army sniper units marks them out as an elite which i remember you getting close to unscrambling davidov was a sniper although sakov doesnt remember him being a contemporary of bendalls he must have been spotted by someone and brought into department v when he left the army his kgb records are lifted along with everything else that was taken probably to be embarrassingly found when hes identified from his army records isakov and sakov were both cameramen challenged charlie it was a love symbol for isakov when he and bendall were together in the army made them elitespecialtogether it was agayan who insisted sakov have it done to make him part of the groupa blood brotherwhen they all got together at the tv station sakov had all the other shit put on his arms to make him one of the boys in the army his father was actually a career office a major in the kgb it was agayan who guided sakov organizing their special evenings drinking and singing that wailing song which again was some fraternity crap they went in for in afghanistan charlie was glad he had more islay malt in the office closet the bottle they were drinking was almost empty mittel lifted all the missing records and files totally to incriminate the fsb every one he and whoever else hes working with at the lubyanka agreed kayley making itand viktor karelins chairmanshiplook ridiculous karelin could never have survived neither could okulov recognized charlie remembering the recommendations of natalias official enquiry whatever the outcome of the commissionor whether okulov accepted its findings or notthere would have been no way okulov could have convinced anybody the assassinations werent orchestrated with the help of old kgb friends to get his presidency confirmed it would have been a walkover for the communists even with their problems with the commission it was a brilliant game plan said kayley emptying the last of the bottle between them the communists win by a landslide okulov karelin and reforms vanish into oblivion and the communists regain the kremlin and hold the duma gennardi mittel gets the chairmanship of the fsb and leonid zenin transfers as his deputy vladimir sakov goes back into the fold his field life over to become chairman of whatever fsb directorate he wants and boris lvov is appointed head of the militia and finally washington is given the stiff middle finger to its son of star wars treaty in the hope of making things awkward for the american president even if hes not killed charlie heard the other man out but said at once what problems with the presidential commission mittel apparently persuaded karelin to let him represent the fsb so he could really stir the shit but the chairperson was a fiesty gal who sent him packing and insisted on karelin appearing personally and zenin expected to get the commission chairmanship imagine that as a destructive duo fiesty gal picked out charlie natalia was still in danger if the grand jury hearing didnt evidentially produce everything kayley had just told him theyll run make some move when they know sakovs gone kayley looked curiously at the bottom of his empty glass anticipated it he said triumphantly mittel was sakovs direct contact i had sakov call himrecording it obviouslyto say he wasgoing out of town got mittel on tape ordering hima supposed television cameraman dont forget to stay in moscow and wait to be told what to do next that everything was under control sakov comes from gorkiy thats where theyll be looking for the next few days not washington how quickly will the grand jury return the indictments sakovs the only witness it only took me about four hours to get what ive told you whats the route then kayley shrugged anandale talks to okulov direct to fix their simultaneous prime slot television appearances giving okulov time to brief karelin to get everyone in the bag first and you know the best bit what okulov gets his sweeping election victory when the communists are exposed and anandale gets the sonsofbitches that maimed his wife maybe even the actual guys from department v who pulled the trigger but without having to suspend or cancel americas missile defense system which guarantees his second term too aint that the prettiest thing and you i was called by the president into the oval office and with the acting head of the fbi and wendall north as witnesses got told i could choose whatever internal bureau division i want you really have got me into the hall of fame charlie youre welcome it might have been by proxy but hed maintain the never lose never be beaten philosophy he got the second bottle from the corner cupboard all weve got to do is keep up the frustrated act over the next few days said kayley itll be a walk in the park insisted charlie who did he have to walk with he wondered thats what both the american and the englishman are saying according to kayley american newspapers are openly saying that its a conspiracy between okulov and his old friends said olga what about official investigation asked zenin they say theres nothing positive they can do theyre waiting for the result of the commission like we are olga cleared the table while zenin carried the remains of their dinner wine into the lounge ive been talking to people said zenin theres no way okulov or karelin can survive do you think a change of government will affect us personally who knows smiled zenin olga

options trying to find a way to move forward i want to get it over with finished it will be soon said olga emptily charlie waited four days before going to the radisson slavjanskaya hotel again carefully allowing two hours from the end of sashas schoolday the immediate anger would have gone by now he certainly wouldnt lose his temperhe had nothing to lose his temper aboutand hoped natalia wouldnt either certainly not in front of sasha if natalia insisted hed even keep it a telephone conversation although hed have more chance of persuading her if they could meet face to face alternatively she might agree briefly to leave sasha in the room so they could talk in the hotel lounge or bar although he thought that unlikely he didnt want to leave sasha alone in a hotel bedroom himself no matter how briefly charlie found the house phone in a corner of the foyer glad it was an enclosed booth the man who answered in room said charlie must have the wrong extension he was a computer technician from kiev whod only arrived that morning the receptionisttold him natalia fedova and the little girl had booked out the previous day without leaving a forwarding address back at lesnaya charlie walked aimlessly around the echoing rooms as he had every night since natalia left that night though he stopped in sashas room properly seeing for the first time that there were still things of sashas that natalia hadnt taken particularly toys then he saw that the doll hed bought back from london was there but the previous forgotten sister with the droopy eye wasnt the perfectly coordinated seizures were filmed to be shown directly before the simultaneous telecasts by both presidents anandale personally pressured okulov during his alerting telephone call after the grand jury indictments for fbi agents to be visibly present at each arrest which took place at four am at each doors were jackhammered off their hinges everyone named by sakov was confronted before they could get out of bed john kayley who was with the loyal fsb officers who took deputy chairman gennardi mittel into custody was identified during the presidents address to the nation as the officer who had broken the case olga melnik was taken manacled from the apartment with zenin and held for a week before being released the detentions were announcedsimultaneously againfive hours before the televised appearance of the two leaders and in midafternoon petr tikunov the communist party presidential candidate put a gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger in his broadcast anandale spoke of a plot that could have destabilized world peace which was now strengthened and more secure because of the cooperation between two great nations okulov even more grandiosely talked of russia being pulled back from reentering the dark ages and of a cancer being excised from an organization and a political party which sought to subvert the new russian democracyhe echoed anandales insistence on a strengthening between the two countries and said he was looking forward to officially becoming russias leader in the forthcoming elections neither referred to a missile defense treaty charlie muffin watched alone in his echoing apartment smiling at the sightrepeated after the presidents identificationof john kayley for the first time in a freshly pressed suit and laundered shirt there was inevitably a cigar charlie had turned to cnn for their quickly assembled documentary on the entire investigationdominated once more by the gantry fight between bendall and sakovwhen the telephone rang his stomach hollowed at natalias voice you she anticipated at once yes why did you give it away to the americans thats the way it worked and now that filitovs been arrested you know i wasnt the leak i said i was sorry im glad youve called he could persuade her not easily perhaps but now they were talking he could convince her to call the whole nonsense off there are some things i need to collect come back natalia please hed let her have her pride clothes and some stuff of sashas how is she fine she asks after you i miss her and im lost without you and i want you both to come back can i come by tomorrow to pick them up thats when it would be best when they were in the same room together what time about now ill be waiting he was he opened volnay but left it in the refrigerator to stay chilled and abandoned the idea of canapes because it would be trying toohard he did put cornflowers in a vase though because they were her favorite and it was quite normal for him to buy them for her he poured himself scotch which he would normally have done at that time but left it untouched on the low table illogically he had expected her to ring from the street and started at the sound of her key in the lock only just getting to his feet as she entered she had a case in either hand charlie went towards her but looked beyond for their daughter youre back wheres sasha seeing his look and realizing his misunderstanding natalia easily lifted both empty cases and said to carry what ive come to collect charlie stopped uncertain whether to go on to try to kiss her not a good idea he decided ive opened some wine no thanks ive got to get on she couldnt let him talk her round you got my note at the hotel of course i went again but youd moved out ive got a temporary ministry apartment until i can find something i want you to come back here you said it would be so easy to say yes but she really wasnt sure if she wanted to not totally i made mistakes lets not make any more its too claustrophobic were not happy together he had to agree with that we can be not all the time but most of it people arent not all the time lets learn from this not suffer from it i dont feel im suffering i need space to breathe which was what she felt shed been doing breathing feeling free sit down please lets talk i need to pack sashas staying at marinas again but i said i wouldnt be long you sure about this yes now youre making the mistake natalia walked around him and disappeared into their bedroom saying nothing charlie went to follow but stopped again it would be wrong to crowd her i need space leave her alone let her seefeetwhat it was she was abandoning he stayed standing but sipped for the first time at the neglected drink natalia crossed from their bedroom into sashas without looking sideways along the corridor towards him when she emerged with the two cases he said do you need help with them no i want to be able to see sasha yes so i need an address ill let you have it when i get one what about now itll only be a few days stay strong she told herself dont give in dont do this keep safe charlie he remained standing after the door closed behind her quietly again the drink forgotten in his hand he put it down abruptly angrily spilling it and at once wondered whyfor whose benefithe was performing like someone in a b movie he went into their bedroom seeing that this time natalia had cleared everything from her closets he thought at first shed only left one thing in sashas room the doll hed brought back from london then he saw beside it the diamond bar brooch hed also bought there for natalia plots true or false are necessary things to raise up commonwealths and ruin kings john dryden absalom and achitophel
