david morrell double image to stirling silliphant for route naked city and all the other wonderful things you wrote that made me want to become a writer dear friend you accomplished what all true writers aim toward you changed someones life the terms shoot and take are not accidental they represent an attitude of conquest and appropriation only when the photographer grows into perception and creative impulse does the term make define a condition of empathy between the external and the internal events stieglitz told me when i make a photograph i make love ansel adams one the pit smelled of loam mold and urine it was three feet wide seven feet long and three feet deep the size of a shallow grave coltrane had been lying in it for thirtysix hours a rubberized sheet under him an earthcolored nylon sheet suspended over him anchored by dead branches and further camouflaged by fallen pine needles two hundred yards below the wooded slope on which he was concealed vehicles were arriving six big openbacked trucks jounced along a narrow road into a clearing in the deserted valley with an echoing rumble a bulldozer and a backhoe struggled to keep up a few flakes of snow drifted to the frosthardened ground as the convoy stopped next to a rectangular area roughly fifty by a hundred feet where the ground had been disturbed having waited so long coltrane frowned toward the increasingly dark clouds drifting into the valley and prayed that the weather wouldnt turn against him he raised one of the four cameras arranged before him focused its zoom lens and started taking photographs men in tattered winter clothes clutching automatic rifles jumped from the trucks and scanned the slopes around them despite the care with which coltrane had hidden himself he tensed when they concentrated in his direction afraid hed been spotted he ducked his head and pressed himself harder against the floor of the pit when the men changed their attention to another area of the valley coltrane let out his breath taking more pictures a bandylegged heavychested beefyfaced man with dense dark hair and a thick mustache waved directions to the bulldozer and the backhoe got you you bastard coltrane pressed the shutter button unable to get over his good fortune back in tuzla his contact on the un inspection team had spread out a map and indicated a dozen areas that they intended to investigate of course they wouldnt get around to those areas until they finished with the dozen areas they were already investigating the schedule depended on the weather which was due to worsen now that november was almost half over by the time the investigators reached all the suspected areas the men they wanted to prosecute would have eliminated the evidence against them coltrane had chosen the most isolated spot his compass and terrain map preventing him from getting lost as he made his way burdened by two knapsacks across streams and ridges toward this slope concealed among bushes waiting two hours he had studied the rugged landscape for any sign that he had been noticed only after dark had he constructed his primitive shelter and crawled into it exhausted craving sleep but knowing that food had to come first the cheese sandwiches and dry sausage he had brought along but even before eating there was one thing he knew he absolutely had to do check his cameras throughout the next day and night coltrane had remained in his cold hiding place permitting himself movement only when he ate more sausage drank from a straw inserted in his canteen or turned onto his side urinating into a plastic bottle all the while he had secondguessed himself telling himself that he was wasting his time that he had chosen the wrong location or that nothing was going to happen in any location and he might as well hike out of here the dingy bar where his fellow photojournalists hung out in tuzla was beginning to seem more and more appealing but he hated to surrender to impatience giving up wasnt in his nature and now he was overjoyed that he hadnt not only was he getting prime photos of what the un inspection team had suspected was happening at various sites but he was also documenting the participation of the man they most wanted to nail dragan ilkovic a perfect name for a monster the son of a bitch leaned his rifle against the front of a truck and braced his hands on his powerfullooking hips watching with satisfaction as the bulldozer went to work plowing earth the backhoe moved into position behind it heart pounding against the rubber sheet coltrane kept rapidly taking pictures glad that he had brought four cameras each with a different lens and film speed some with blackandwhite film some with color so that he wouldnt have to waste time changing film below him a man with a rifle shouted pointing fiercely at what the bulldozer had exposed the beefyfaced man hurried over yelling commands at the backhoes driver for a frustrating moment the commotion hid what agitated them but the group quickly parted some of them rushing to help unload a large piece of equipment from a truck and coltrane reacted with horror the small image in his viewfinder intensified by the magnification of his zoom lens he was staring at corpses a soulsearing countless jumble of them the bodies had been thrown into the mass grave with such careless haste so tangled among one another that it was impossible to know which leg belonged to which torso which arm to which shoulder to which neck to which skull the confusion became more manifest as the weight of the bulldozer crushed spines and rib cages clothes had disintegrated flesh had rotted creating a common putrescent black mush from which gray bones protruded and lipless mouths gaped in silent eternal anguish during the war this region in eastern bosnia was supposed to have been a uncontrolled safe haven for muslims from hundreds of miles around as many as fifteen thousand muslims had hurried here seeking protection the target had been too tempting for the serbs who surrounded the area and bombarded it forcing the un troops to surrender surprisingly the serbs had let the muslim children go but they raped the women to breed the muslims out of existence by forcing muslim women to bear serbian children and as for the men coltranes mouth filled with bile as he worked the cameras taking more and more photographs of what remained after the serbs had loaded the muslim men into trucks and driven them to isolated valleys like this one where they dug pits with bulldozers and backhoes lined the muslim men up on the edge of the pits and shot them some of the pits like the one coltrane photographed held as many as four hundred corpses he had been told it took a lot of hate and determination to get the job done but the serbs had been up to the challenge when they had finally shot the last muslim in the back of the head they had used the bulldozers to spread earth over the bodies and that was that problem solved everything neat and tidy except when the war ended and bosnia had been carved into serb croat and muslim regions the un had started talking about outrages against humanity a warcrimes tribunal was convened in the netherlands and suddenly a lot of serb commanders like dragan ilkovic down there had become wanted men they had to be tidier the roar of a large machine attracted coltranes notice toward the cumbersome piece of equipment that the men had unloaded from one of the trucks it had a huge funnel on one side and a spout on the other it resembled the device that city cleanup crews used to pulverize fallen tree limbs in this case the machine was a rock pulverizer that dragan ilkovic had brought from one of the many nearby mines the backhoe was dropping bones into the funnel the spout on the other side was spewing horrifying pebbles into the back of a truck the pebbles would be eliminated in a shaft in one of the mines coltranes informant had suspected the trouble was no one could prove that this sanitizing was actually taking place until now coltrane thought with fury abruptly he noted how quickly the clouds were darkening and thickening the few flakes of snow had become flurries he had to work fast he got a closeup of dragan ilkovic switched to a wideangle view and felt his heart stop as the camouflage sheet suspended over him was torn away hands grabbed his arms and shoulders guttural voices barked coltrane barely had time to snag the straps on his cameras before he was jerked from the pit the hands spun him bringing him facetoface with two muscular men wearing outdoor clothes their features flushed with anger the repeated clicks of his cameras must have alerted them as they searched for intruders conversely the clicks amplified in the confinement of his narrow shelter had prevented him from hearing their footsteps creep toward him okay guys calm down coltrane had no hope that they understood him but if his tone communicated his intent the men had absolutely no interest in calming down instead they shoved him backward coltrane made a futile placating gesture look i was only camping no hard feelings why dont i grab my stuff and leave the men unslung assault rifles from their shoulders several times in nicaragua at the start of coltranes career later in lebanon and iran armed men had confronted him about photographs he had taken their attention had always been on his cameras but these men barely glanced at his cameras as they raised their weapons all they seemed to care about was his chest jesus coltrane reacted without thinking pretending to stumble back he twisted as if to try to regain his balance and kept twisting spinning to face his attackers again swinging his heaviest camera by the end of its strap the bulky zoom lens collided with the chin on the man to coltranes right bone crunching with a groan the man lurched to coltranes left jolted against the second man and threw off his aim the second mans assault weapon blasting chunks from a tree coltrane rushed the men as they toppled into the pit swinging the camera again he cracked it across the second mans forehead blood flying the man collapsed startled voices echoed from the valley coltrane jerked his gaze in that direction the small figures below had heard the gunshots they were glaring toward this slope some of them pointing others shouting the heavychested man grabbed his rifle and scrambled toward the slope coltrane raced toward the ridge top entering the dense fir trees on the opposite side shadows enveloped him his cameras banged against him the one he had used as a weapon was smeared with blood the lens had shattered if only the camera isnt cracked he hoped if only the film hasnt been exposed to light despite the frenzy of his descent he pressed the rewind button and heard a whir relieved that the motor hadnt been damaged immediately he lost his balance a mat of fir needles slipping out from under him his back struck the ground so hard that his teeth snapped together he fought to dig in his heels to prevent himself from sliding faster down the slope but the needles kept giving way he tumbled walloped to a stop against a tree and grimaced from a sharp pain on his right side finding where the camera had rammed against him have to get the film protect the film hands trembling he freed a catch at the side of the camera flipped open the back and pulled out the rewound film his elation lasted barely a second as shouts crested the ridge behind him fear rocketed through him struggling to catch his breath he shoved the film into a pocket dropped the damaged camera and charged down the remainder of the incline even on a sunny day the massive fir trees in this region were dense enough to filter light but this had not been a sunny day the dark clouds massing turning the afternoon into dusk the air became colder snow started falling again at first sporadically then steadily a gentle blanketing that made a whisper as it settled through the fir boughs behind him the shouts became more angry a staccato burst of gunshots shredded tree limbs coltrane reached an icerimmed stream almost tried to leap across but realized it was too wide and veered to the left for certain he couldnt just jump in and wade to the opposite bank the water was so cold that it would give him frostbite or hypothermia he had to try to find a fallen log that bridged it but the stream widened as he ran along it and there werent any logs the color of his clothing brown woolen pants a green ski jacket a matching knit cap that he had pulled down around his ears had been chosen to help him blend with the evergreen forest he tried to assure himself that at least he had that advantage the thought didnt give him much confidence when another stuttering burst of gunshots riddled the trees despite the unfamiliar language the tone of the shouts behind him left no doubt that the men were cursing slowed by the slippery accumulation of snow coltrane saw a fir tree close to the stream and noticed that one of its boughs dead about nine feet off the ground extended over the water he leapt his leathergloved hands fought for a grip on the bough the snow made the bark slick straining he tightened his fingers dangled felt the awkward weight of his remaining three cameras hanging from his right shoulder and struggled hand over hand across the bough behind him closer branches cracked footsteps thundered he dropped to the ground on the opposite side of the stream straightened and raced deeper into the forest determined to get the film from his cameras he pressed their rewind buttons without warning something yanked him backward the jolt had such force that he thought hed been shot but instead of falling he hung on an angle his boots on the ground his body suspended over the gathering snow a moment of disorientation cleared and he realized in dismay that a stout branch had snagged one of his camera straps the branch had torn the right shoulder on his ski jacket it had gouged his skin he slipped painfully free of the strap heard the cameras rewind motor stop whirring opened its back stuffed the roll of film in a pocket abandoned the tangled camera and charged onward if i can just keep going the snows falling harder itll fill my tracks he thought behind him heavy splashes told him that some of his pursuers had jumped into the stream too impatient to wait in line to go hand over hand on the branch wails followed the icy water shocking their bodies at least some of them will be slowed coltrane tried to assure himself but he was also slowing the forest sloped upward gasping for breath he struggled higher the pain in his ribs getting sharper although he had jettisoned two cameras he still had two others and continued to fear that something would happen to the film in them grabbing one as he ran he pawed open its back and yanked out its rewound film only to moan in despair when he dropped the cylinder into a drift rushing he stooped to fumble through the snow and retrieve it shoving it into the jacket pocket where he had put the others the camera he had just unloaded blew apart the explosive force throwing him onto the snow he felt intense heat then bitter cold along his left side nausea swept through him as he realized that a bullet meant for his back had struck the camera deflected off it and sliced through his left side he rolled toward the cover of a fir tree as the faroff crack of a rifle echoed through the forest he had to find where the shooter was to avoid his line of fire struggling to his feet he risked a glance through an opening in the trees toward the direction from which he had come snow settled on his eyes making him blink repeatedly the wind stopped the snow eased just for a moment and he shivered at the sight of a bandylegged bulkyshouldered man on a ridge across from him dragan ilkovics thick features braced against the sights on his rifle ilkovic fired again the bullet whizzing past coltrane tearing up snow and earth enraged ilkovic switched his rifle from single shot to full automatic releasing a burst that went wild as the snow swirled back in greater force ilkovic vanished in the storm and coltrane felt a bonedeep chill clutching his bleeding side stumbling higher up the slope he fled the louder noises of his pursuers the wind had worsened to a gale by the time coltrane reached the top if not for his injuries he might have hurried over the crest in which case he would have died for the other side of the slope was a cliff its bottom invisible in the gusting snow which way right or left as far as his limited vision allowed him to determine the cliff continued in both directions but whichever way he chose following the ridgeline was predictable all his pursuers would have to do would be to separate and outflank him i cant go back the way i came he thought he saw an outcrop ten feet below him squirmed over the edge ignored the pain of his injuries and hung to the agonizing limit of his arms when he released his grip and hit the ledge he fell to his knees then his chest hugging the rock he feared he was going to pass out but he couldnt allow himself to give in to weakness he had to get far enough down the cliff that his pursuers wouldnt be able to see him in the snowstorm pulse racing he peered over and saw another ledge but it was farther down than the first one had been even hanging by his arms he would still have to drop several yards and the force of the landing would almost certainly throw off his balance plunging him over the edge as the angry voices rushed closer to the top he imagined what would happen when his hunters got there staring down their sullen faces would break into smiles when they saw him crouching helplessly ten feet below them their grins would broaden when they opened fire he had to the snow gusted at an object that weighed on coltranes injured shoulder his remaining camera he frowned at its nylon strap if he didnt get off this ledge in the next thirty seconds he wouldnt be going anywhere again frenzied he extended the strap to its maximum length about four feet hoping it would hold him his lungs heaved so much that he feared he might faint when he looped the strap over an outcrop and squirmed down pretending he was clutching a rope it wouldnt get him to the next ledge but at least it would get him closer the snow buffeted him trembling he eased lower the ledge not yet close enough to drop to almost a body length away spasms shuddered through him because he hadnt moved his hands to get lower the strap had done it for him it had stretched it groaned every impulse urged him to hurry but he didnt dare any strong motion might cause the strap to stretch to its breaking point closer the strap broke scrabbling against the cliff face he felt the wind shove him into space he fell clawed at the rock and landed half on half off the ledge the wind struck him harder his gloves lost their grip slipping over he tensed in panic his stomach soaring toward his throat as he anticipated his impact on the rocks far below with startling abruptness he jolted to a stop much sooner than he expected his legs buckling his body collapsing it took him a moment to realize that he had landed on another ledge he might have passed out he couldnt tell one thing he did know was that as he lay on his back blinking upward through the thickening snow he couldnt see the top of the cliff which meant that he couldnt be seen either but he didnt dare rest the snow might lessen at any moment and reveal him he had to keep moving another wave of nausea swept through him as he forced himself to sit up when he peered over the side his vision cleared enough for him to see that the next ledge was only four feet down wincing he lowered himself onto it the next time he peered down he discovered he was on a slope that led to the bottom the snow rose above his ankles shuffling through it his legs kept threatening to give way but he refused to let them surrender i have to get the film out of here he urged himself the air dimmed the snow becoming gray his vision narrowing his thoughts blurring when he stumbled into a fir tree its icy needles stinging his face he realized that he must have been walking halfasleep he could barely see his hand in front of his face if he didnt find shelter he was going to freeze to death sinking to his hands and knees he crawled weakly beneath the drooping boughs of the snowladen fir tree in the space under them he reached ground that was bare except for fallen needles and he had just enough room to slump with his back against the trunk the bark smelled sharply of resin except for that in the gathering darkness hearing the wind outside he had the sensation of being in a tent he passed out a smothering blackness surrounded him so absolute that he feared hed gone blind or was in hell immediately his pain jerked him fully awake muffled the shrieking wind seemed far away it was night the dense blanket of snow on the needled branches made the air around him feel heavy compressed he licked his dry cracked lips completely disoriented racked with pain he feared he was going to die in here he took off his right glove and mustered the strength to reach under the left side of his jacket there his sweater and his thermal underwear were soaked with a warm sticky liquid his gentle touch made him shudder the wound seemed as long as his hand as wide as a finger the deflected bullet had gouged a furrow along his side and kept going he wondered or was it still inside him had it hit only fat or ruptured the abdominal wall he had never felt so powerless and alone his feeling of isolation increased when he reached for the comfort of a camera and recalled that he had started out with four of them and not one of them remained but i had the fourth camera with me on the cliff didnt i take it off the strap and cram it into a pocket in dismay he pawed at the jacket but didnt feel the camera what he did feel were three cylinders of film the fourth camera and more important the film inside it were lost to him he fought to rouse his spirit hey i saved the other three rolls thats still a lot if i can get them out of here the sentence didnt want to be completed yes he asked himself if i can get them out of here are those photographs worth dying for this time he didnt hesitate are you kidding me the un inspection team is desperate to get its hands on evidence like this the film will prove that the atrocities committed here were much worse than anyone imagined that bastard ilkovic will finally have to pay for what he did maybe coltrane felt uneasy i dont understand oh the photos you took are shocking enough to get ilkovic convicted all right but what if the politicians become involved and declare an amnesty for the sake of peace in the region what if nothing changes are your pictures worth getting killed for coltrane didnt have an answer again he groped for the reassuring touch of a camera a homicide detective friend of his had once joked that coltrane felt about cameras the way police officers did about backup guns naked without one come to think of it the detective had continued joking cameras and guns both shoot people dont they but it wasnt the same at all coltrane insisted his kind of shooting didnt kill people it was supposed to make them immortal that was the reason he had become a photographer when he had been twelve he had found a trove of photographs of his dead mother and had fantasized that they kept her alive those pictures of his mother had been beautiful as shivers seized him and his consciousness faded into a place that was despairingly even darker he managed one last lucid thought then why have i been taking ugly pictures for such a long time hearing a rumble he woke in alarm his first panicked thought warned him he was about to be smothered by an avalanche but the moment he raised his head trying to move the pain that radiated from his left side almost made him pass out the rumble increased as his consciousness fought to clear itself he understood that he had to be wrong that the ridges here werent steep enough for avalanches besides the rumble seemed to come from below him rather than from above it didnt make sense what was causing the noise find out spots swirled in front of his eyes as he placed his hands on the ground barely aware of the fir needles under his knees he crawled from beneath the snowcovered boughs the glare of sunlight off drifts nearly blinding him the air was shockingly cold pinching his nostrils when he squinted below him he feared he was hallucinating unable to make himself believe that he was on a hill above a road that the rumble came from a convoy of tanks that had nato markings he wobbled like a tightrope walker struggling for balance as he waved his arms and waded as fast as he could down through snowdrifts which wasnt fast at all but it didnt matter because the lead tanks driver had seen him and was stopping soldiers jumping out as he fell and tumbled to the bottom the soldiers blurting german as they rushed to help him three days later against a un doctors orders he was on a plane home from hell to the city of angels two as coltrane twitched from a nightmare that was indistinguishable from the trauma of his wideawake memories he seemed to have been running forever he fell from the impact of the bullet that shattered his camera rolled desperately to avoid ilkovics line of fire and flinched as hands grabbed his shoulders pushing him a moan escaped him his eyes jerked open in a panic the hands continuing to press him down a gentle voice whispering ssshh its only me its jennifer uh sweat slicked him his chest heaved youre home youre safe uh you were having a nightmare i had to grab you before you rolled out of bed coltranes heart hammered so fast that he feared it would burst against his ribs his tongue felt dry and thick jennifer in the shadows of what he now recognized was his bedroom he peered up at her still disoriented he seemed to see her through an imaginary viewfinder framing her lovely oval face her light blue eyes and the dark worry behind them his gaze lingered on her appealing curved lips her smooth tan cheeks and her short blond hair that resembled corn silk his heartbeat no longer made his chest feel swollen at last he seemed to be getting enough air he eased back onto his pillow here jennifer reached for a glass of water on the bedside table adjusting a straw she placed it against his parched mouth he took several deep swallows luxuriating in the wonderful coolness ignoring the drops that rolled down his chin guess im the last person you expected to see huh jennifer asked coltrane didnt know what to say the last time he had seen her was six months ago when they had broken up daniel sent for me she said coltrane nodded the motion aggravating a headache daniel was a friend who lived in the town house next door when you showed up at his place this morning you really spooked him he took care of you during the day but hes working nights at the hospital and he needed somebody to watch you jennifer smiled awkwardly he phoned me at the magazine she hesitated then made a mock salute nurse nightingale reporting unless you can find somebody better i guess youre stuck with me i cant think of anybody better jennifers smile was now filled with pleasure can i get you anything daniel said i should give you tylenol for your fever and this antibiotic your wounds a little infected whatever the doctor ordered coltrane swallowed the pills then took several more sips of water his body seemed to absorb the fluid instantly how do you feel jennifer asked coltrane tilted his right hand from side to side as if to say not so good daniel told me what you told him there are a couple of blank parts you can fill them in later when you get your strength back thats all i want you to concentrate on getting better need tell me the bathroom put your arm around my shoulder ill help you stand when jennifer pulled off the covers coltrane realized that he was wearing only boxer shorts and a tshirt his shirt hiked up making him conscious of the bulk of the new bandage that daniel had taped over the stitches on his side there was dried blood below the bandage scrapes on his stomach and bruises on his legs coltrane leaned on her can you manage by yourself jennifer asked as they entered the bathroom should i stay here with you im fine but coltrane lost his footing and jennifer had to grab him he sank to the seat not my best profile im afraid just do what you have to im okay you can wait outside youre sure jennifer asked thanks as long as youre certain you wont fall on the floor coltrane nodded watching her start to leave the bathroom he whispered her name she looked back i mean it he said thanks ive brought two presents for you jennifer said the next evening but the first one doesnt count curious coltrane watched her bring her left hand from behind her back she set down a copy of southern california magazine a photograph of the windmill electrical generators outside palm springs on the cover the latest issue ive made a lot of improvements i dont know if youve been keeping up with it since i havent missed an issue her light blue eyes glittered even when ive been out of the country i had it forwarded it kept my memories warm on a lot of cold nights if this is the gift that doesnt matter i cant imagine what youve got behind your back in your other hand jennifer showed him a flat stiff object about eight by ten inches giftwrapped she watched intently as he shook it doesnt rattle feels like glass i wonder what she watched him pull open the wrapping but the discomfort on coltranes face at what he saw caused her anticipation to change to confusion your third newsweek cover she said it came out yesterday i thought youd like it framed coltrane somberly studied the stark blackandwhite image of the backhoe dropping bones into the pulverizing machine while dragan ilkovic watched with satisfaction thanks you dont sound as if you mean it it was very thoughtful of you then why arent i convinced the room filled with silence what you told daniel about how you got wounded jennifer said i already knew some of it from the cnn interview you did while you were in the hospital over there thats why i snuck out of the hospital and caught the first plane back to here after cnn tracked me down i knew it wouldnt be long before a lot of other journalists would be swarming around me i had no idea the un would release the photographs so quickly i couldnt bear talking about them you unplugged your phone it kept ringing i couldnt sleep a half a dozen tv talk shows asked me to be a guest people think youre a hero please with distaste coltrane set the framed newsweek cover aside i was lucky to survive youll get another pulitzer prize i hope not not for those photos it didnt take a genius to get those pictures only a damned fool who was willing to lie in a hole in the ground for a day and a half jennifer looked baffled ive never heard you talk this way before did the pictures make a difference was ilkovic charged with war crimes and arrested he disappeared nobody knows where to find him great the word sounded like a curse theyll get him sure i dont understand whats happened to you jennifer said you were always proud of scraping through tough spots i had a lot of chances to think while i was trying to get through the night without freezing to death i got to wondering if id ever taken any photographs that made people feel glad to be alive because theyd seen my work maybe its time i became a real photographer but there isnt anybody better im not a photographer stieglitz steichen strand weston adams berenice abbott randolph packard they were photographers they knew what a camera was for a somber moment lengthened jennifer interrupted it i brought some chinese food do you think you could eat it if i go downstairs and bring you a plate instead of answering coltrane caught her by surprise how have you been jennifer fine working hard the magazines doing well but what about you are you doing well its been lonely yes she seemed to hold her breath the same with me ive missed you jennifer her eyes misted she walked slowly toward him and knelt her face level with his stroking his beardstubbled cheek im sorry i needed too much from you i think i smothered you ill never act that way again it was my fault as much as yours no ive changed i promise we both have ignoring the tightness in his side coltrane leaned forward and kissed her coming events legendary photographer randolph packard will have a rare showing of his prints at the sunset gallery in laguna beach from to pm on friday november packard whose work documents the changes in southern california is generally considered to be one of the great innovators in modern photography he was born in coltrane couldnt get over it if he hadnt opened the copy of southern california jennifer had given him happening to scan its calendar section he wouldnt have known about packards opening until it was too late even then he barely had enough time suddenly realizing that today was the twentyfirst and that it was almost three fortunately he had already mustered the strength to get out of bed and clean himself up his sneakers jeans and denim shirt werent exactly what he would have chosen for what sounded like a formal reception but he didnt have time to change only to grab a sport coat a camera and a copy of one of packards collections then get to his car the effort exhausted him but he didnt think twice about its worth leaving los angeles driving south as fast as possible amid the smogshrouded traffic on the san diego freeway he felt as if hed been told that someone had risen from the dead good god how old would packard be in his nineties the bulk of his work had been done in the twenties and the thirties from then on his output had dwindled until by the fifties he had disappeared from public view as the southern california article had noted paraphrasing a quotation from f scott fitzgerald for randolph packard there wasnt a second act but his first act had certainly been remarkable the rumors about drugs and orgies about his frequent unexplained trips to mexico had rippled through californias artistic community and generated publicity for his work not that coltrane had needed the article to tell him any of this when he had first been learning about photography randolph packard had been one of his idols he owned every packard collection that had been published his work had been deeply influenced by packards theory that every effective photograph ought to tell the viewer something that merely looking at the subject of the photograph in its natural setting could not packards famous portraits of silentscreen movie stars for example rudolph valentino clara bow ramon novarro a lot of others many of whom nobody would remember if packard hadnt immortalized them each portrait presented its subject in a splendor of light but the actors didnt radiate the light instead they absorbed it the brilliance was so intense packard seemed to think of them as literally being stars but of a special sort sucking up energy until because of their egos and their frantic lifestyles they would either burst or collapse upon themselves and be consumed heading into the walltowall cities that made up orange county coltrane felt his anticipation swell he was reminded of when the county had literally been covered with oranges grove after grove of them and how packards classic sunbright photograph of the area had depicted more oranges on the ground than in the trees an abundance of ripeness on the verge of decay packard had also photographed laguna beach not the town which had been only a few cottages back in the twenties and thirties but the curve of sand along the ocean that area of the pacific coast highway was still as winding as it had been in packards day but now it had been overbuilt the same as everywhere else in southern california gas stations gift shops and restaurants jammed next to one another the crowded fourlane road felt like the narrow twolane it had replaced at dusk in late november the beach itself was almost deserted cold waves crashing onto the sand when packard had photographed the area he had made it seem an unoccupied paradise but if the viewer looked closely at packards most reproduced depiction of the beach horizon the telltale imperfection the poignant regret for time passing that was typical of packards work became evident distant smoke belching from a passing freighter coltrane managed to find a parking space on forest avenue across from the beach he slung his nikon singlelens reflex around his neck and took a deep breath surveying the lights of art galleries along the treecanopied street when he reached back into his car to get his copy of packards reflections of the city of angels he suddenly felt lightheaded and almost collapsed across the seat his side in pain he grabbed the steering wheel took another deep breath and straightened sweat chilled his face maybe this isnt such a good idea he told himself its a wonder i didnt faint driving down here i belong in bed not getting crushed by strangers at a cocktail party no he thought feeling much older than his thirtyfive years i need to start over the reception in the rustic looking sunset gallery had spilled out onto the street coltrane stepped past trendily dressed couples wearing expensive jewelry their makeup and hair perfect and ignored the looks they gave his sneakers the gallery was crammed with people who spoke with pseudobritish accents many of them had lips so tight they seemed to have lockjaw they sipped from flutes of champagne but coltrane had no interest in finding the bar he heard music playing from hidden speakers a cd of a string quartet it sounded like but he couldnt be sure the conversations were too loud all he cared about were packards photographs and even before he worked his way through the crowd it was obvious that the sheer number of them was astonishing protecting his side he struggled to the nearest wall of photographs and felt excitement build in him when he realized that he had never seen any of them before again and again a card next to a photograph indicated that each was from packards own collection their dates ranged from the fifties to the nineties making clear that packard hadnt given up photography in his later years he had simply chosen not to let the public see his work coltranes excitement changed to dismay when the force of the images hit him this second act of packards career emphasized the decay that he had only hinted at in his earlier work each photograph was devoted to blight a dead seagull trapped in an oil spill an emaciated child eating garbage a brush fire destroying a spindly multimilliondollar house perched ridiculously on a los angeles hilltop repelled coltrane forced his way to another wall oblivious to the annoyed looks people gave him as he shoved past the next pictures were even more disturbing policemen standing around a womans corpse in an alley a caged pit bull snarling at children who taunted it with sticks a man attacking another man during a riot the blackandwhite images had been printed to emphasize their shadows the bleakness chilling the only thing missing was a photograph of jumbled skeletons being clawed from the earth by a backhoe stumbling away wanting nothing more than to leave coltrane felt the back of his legs bump against an upright metal circle with spindles and nearly toppled backward over it catching his balance just in time sensing with embarrassment that what he had struck was a wheelchair he quickly turned im very sorry i didnt his apology froze in his throat when he recognized the chairs occupant randolph packard was wizened but he still bore an uncanny resemblance to photographs that had been taken of him in his prime even in a wheelchair he was tall his thinness emphasizing his height his trademark shock of hair over his forehead had receded becoming wispy and white but it was nonetheless recognizable the hypnotic eyes were darker the face narrower the nose more bladelike but despite being withered with liver spots his slack skin barely concealing his skull he was unmistakably packard this chairs taken thank you packard coughed as if he had sand caught in his throat i apologize i should have looked where i was going coltrane said are you hurt the truth never hurts tell me what you think of my photographs coltrane was taken by surprise theyre uh indescribable evidently impressive you dont make it sound like a compliment coltrane was determined to be tactful theyre technically perfect technically packard coughed more forcefully still unable to get the sand from his throat that camera around your neck is that a fashion statement dont tell me youre a photographer yes coltrane stiffened yes im a photographer oh well then since youre a photographer what dont you like about these photographs coltrane felt bile in his stomach theyre too bleak for my taste is that a fact actually if you want to talk about facts theyre ugly ugly coming here was important to me i needed hope not despair packard didnt say anything for a moment only steadied his wrinklerimmed eyes on coltrane then nodded well good for you i beg your pardon i asked for the truth youre the only person in this room who gave it to me what are you holding there one of your collections you brought it for an autograph that was my intention but now youre not sure thats right and youre really a photographer coltrane nodded then tell me something else thats true why did you become a photographer coltrane turned to leave i wont bother you any longer i asked you a question quick now dont think about it answer me why did you to stop time indeed packards sunken eyes assessed him whats your name mitchell coltrane mitchell packards gaze went inward then focused on him more tightly yes i know your work coltrane couldnt tell if that meant the same as stepping in dog shit tell me why you want to stop time packard demanded things fall apart and the center cannot hold i didnt know anybody read yeats anymore and people die how very true packard coughed again painfully at once an effusive colorfully dressed man burst from the crowd there you are randolph ive been looking everywhere he was in his forties overweight with a flushed face a saltandpepper mustache and several thousand dollars worth of designer labels some people came in you absolutely have to meet the man gripped the back of packards wheelchair excuse us coming through everyone just a moment packards frail whisper carried amazing force he motioned for coltrane to step close this is my card id like you to come for lunch tomorrow one oclock sharp bring the book ill sign it then and packard was gone well what did i expect coltrane asked himself struggling through the crowd to get out of the reception there were many mysteries about randolph packard but everything coltrane had read about him was clear about one thing his personality even to his most sympathetic biographer packard was haughty his overbearing attitude was variously explained as the consequence of having been spoiled by wealthy parents whose fortune he had inherited at the age of sixteen after the parents died in a boating accident or as the imperious manner of a genius whose sensibility was constantly being assaulted by those around him whatever its cause coltrane had definitely had a taste of it angry he escaped from the art gallery so distracted by his emotions that he didnt notice the change in the weather until he got to where hed parked his chevy blazer near the intersection of forest and the south coast highway at almost six oclock in late november darkness was natural but not this much darkness a remnant of the sunset ought to have been visible on the oceans horizon despite the glow from streetlights stars should have started to glitter but now the sky was absolutely black and the horizon was indistinguishable from the ink that had become the ocean a wind stung his cheeks flinging sand from the beach the first drops of rain pelted his windshield as he hurried to unlock his car and get in for about twenty minutes as he headed north along the slippery glistening back to los angeles the storm matched his mood then it seemed to cleanse him although the rainslowed traffic would normally have made him impatient he felt oddly content just to gaze past his flapping windshield wipers he put on one of his favorite tapes and listened to bobby darin sing heartbreakingly the gal that got away as he admired darins perfect phrasing it occurred to him that almost no one had ever spoken favorably about bobby darin as a human being because of a heart condition darin had known that the odds were he wouldnt live past his thirties feeling the pressure of limited time he had so devoted himself to his career that no one else had mattered selfcentered didnt begin to describe him nor did cruel talent it seemed wasnt any guarantee of noble character mulling over these issues coltrane made the obvious application to randolph packard maybe its not a good idea to meet one of your idols through the storm coltranes headlights revealed jennifers red bmw parked at the curb in front of his town house it troubled him he had left a message at jennifers office telling her he wouldnt be home why had she come over regardless worried that their problems might be starting again he pressed his remotecontrol garage opener steered into the single stall and shut off the engine after hours of listening to the cacophony of rain drumming on his roof he sat motionless wearily enjoying the comparative silence then he pressed the remote control again and got out of the car despite the rumble of the descending garage door he heard another door the one at the top of the stairs kitchen light spilled down mitch as jennifer appeared above him he saw her through an imaginary camera its lens intensifying her nimbuslike her blond hair seemed to radiate the light behind her she wore gray slacks and a crewneck navy sweater her lips had a touch of pale orange lipstick are you all right she took several steps down toward him didnt your assistant give you my message message jennifer looked confused no i was away from the office all afternoon by the time i had a chance to call in my assistant was gone coltranes shoulders relaxed it had just been a simple misunderstanding it wasnt going to be like before he gripped the railing and climbed to her i got worried when you werent here jennifer said then i finally noticed the open magazine on your kitchen table when i saw the article in the calendar section the time and date for the packard exhibit i figured out where youd gone if you ever decide to get out of the magazine business youd make an awfully good detective coltrane shut the kitchen door you wanted to know if im all right no he stroked her hair and kissed her her lipstick tasted of apricots i was a fool i should have stayed home with you the compliment made jennifers blue eyes seem as clear as the caribbean when the sun emerges from behind a cloud then something else he had said registered on her making her frown why did you call yourself a fool lets just say meeting randolph packard wasnt what id hoped it would be you have awfully high standards her remark puzzled him ive admired his work since i was old enough to tell a good photograph from a bad one then i dont know what more you could want from everything i hear things couldnt have gone better everything you hear coltrane creased his brow packard phoned fifteen minutes ago what youre kidding me he got your number from the magazine photographers directory he thought youd be back by now when i told him you werent he talked about you you made quite an impression on him coltrane felt a dizzying sense of unreality he said he hasnt met anybody as honest as you in a long time what on earth did you say to him coltrane sank onto a kitchen chair actually i insulted him jennifers mouth hung open i told him i thought his photographs at the exhibition were ugly you certainly know how to win friends and influence people believe me i wasnt exaggerating about his photographs theyre as ugly as the ones ive been taking and the ones you removed from your wall coltrane turned toward his living room during the day he had taken down all his framed photographs his time cover of an american soldier spooning food into a skeletal childs mouth in somalia his two newsweek covers one of which showed a widow keening holding her dead daughter in one arm and her dead husband in the other after a rocket attack in northern israel and his muchreprinted associated press photo of the first wave of american helicopters to invade panama these and other sensational highlights of his career were now stacked on a closet shelf it takes one shitty photographer to recognize another maybe thats why he wants to do a project with you jennifer said coltrane wasnt sure hed heard her correctly do a project with he says he knows your work and thinks its impressive youre making this up not at all but he says youll be putting in most of the effort hell supply the advice and the original photographs for a photo essay in southern california what are we talking about his famous series of la houses in the twenties and thirties coltrane straightened that series of twenty photographs was a masterpiece packards depiction of various styles of houses in widely separated areas of the notyetovergrown city not only had been hauntingly beautiful but had seemed to mourn the impending loss of the innocence it celebrated packard thinks they ought to be done again jennifer said go back to the same neighborhoods find the same spots where he set up his camera choose the same angles shoot whats there now he says hes been thinking about a continuation of the series for a long time but now he isnt well enough to do it all hes asking me to be is his assistant more even if he could take the photographs he says he wouldnt he agrees with your opinion of his recent work he cant see beauty anymore hes hoping if you take the photographs the same places all these years later maybe youll find the beauty he cant find ill be damned sometime in the night coltrane woke to find himself reaching for her his lips touched hers but as he continued to roll onto his injured side he winced from pain lie still she whispered let me do the work he felt her warmth when she leaned over him kissing his neck she trembled from the brush of his hands against her breasts floating flowing pain stopped so did time we should never have split up he said the bedside lamp was on they had just returned from the bathroom naked jennifer sat next to him on the bed her legs curled under her i didnt give you a choice she said his emerald eyes studied her i didnt pay enough attention to you she shook her head we both know the truth i crowded you until you had to back off she looked at her hands theres something i never told you coltrane frowned wondering what she was getting at this is hard for me to i was married once he turned his head in surprise ten years ago i found out later hed screwed my best friend the night before the wedding that was after i found out hed been screwing every woman he could all the time he was married to me which wasnt long just under a year why on earth didnt you tell me its not something im comfortable talking about all the story proves is that im a fool but why did he marry you if he didnt intend to be faithful he said he loved me jennifers tone was filled with selfmocking lord knows i loved him i think being married to me gave him the chance to play the field and have an excuse why he couldnt marry those other women i was compliant enough to give him a home and make his meals and not pester him when he said he had to work late and wouldnt be home i cant tell you how sorry i am not as much as i was the point is i had a hard time trusting men after that i kept suspecting that anybody who showed an interest in me was really trying to take advantage of me jennifer bit her lip i guess thats another way of saying i didnt believe i could be special enough to any man that hed never look at another woman so she shrugged fatalistically i overcompensate i wanted you to love me on an impossible level but i swear that wont happen again word of honor i wont make demands you should have told me about this before it helps me understand a lot of things thats why im telling you now i lost you once mitch i dont want to lose you again packards address was in newport beach coltranes thomas guide led him to a spanishstyle mansion partially concealed by a high stucco wall both the wall and the house were pale pink severely sunfaded although the clouds from friday nights storm lingered cloaking everything in gray driving through an open iron gate coltrane saw pools of water around cracks in the driveways blacktop shrubs needed trimming avocados rotted on the ground the overweight colorfully dressed man who had wheeled packard away at the reception answered the doorbell he looked as if hed had a hard night his red sport coat matched the flush of his heavy cheeks his grayandwhite mustache seemed to push down his mouth he was holding a halffinished glass of what coltrane assumed was a bloody mary im not convinced this is a good idea the man murmured coltrane couldnt tell if he meant drinking his lunch or inviting coltrane in the reception was very hard on him the man said i wouldnt have guessed he seemed to be in fine form because he was spirited thats when you know he feels most vulnerable the man shifted his bloody mary to his left hand and offered his right the hand was cold from the ice in the glass hed been holding duncan reynolds mitch coltrane i know a word to the wise watch him carefully i havent the faintest notion what hes up to this time when coltrane frowned duncan frowned in return something the matter i guess im not used to someones friend warning me about the other friend at least not the first time we have a conversation friend duncan tucked in his chin creating wrinkles in his puffy neck you think randolph and i are friends good god no im his assistant chief cook and bottle washer his private nurse from somewhere in the house a bell rang i wouldnt keep him waiting duncan said throughout this exchange the front door had remained open now when duncan shut it and coltrane followed him along a muffled corridor he realized how dark the interior was dense draperies covered the windows in several indistinct rooms he passed by comparison the last room had muted recessed lights that seemed almost bright the furniture was surprisingly sparse a few padded chairs a coffee table and a sofa all showing signs of wear there was nothing on the walls the draperies had been parted but not the lace curtains behind them past a wall of windows filtered gray daylight showed a strip of lawn littered with leaves beyond was a yacht moored at a dock both looking in need of maintenance even the water seemed dingy coltrane heard a subtle hissing sound at first he thought it came from a pump on a fish tank but when he finished taking in the room and focused on packard who sat in his wheelchair next to a fireplace coltrane saw plastic prongs in the old mans nostrils connected to a tube that led to a small oxygen tank at the back of the wheelchair packard seemed to be drowning in a pair of green silk pajamas and a matching robe his narrow face looked more shrunken than the previous evening his eyes filmy his white hair sparse his skin mottled with brown when he coughed the sand that had seemed wedged in his throat at the reception no longer bothered him his present problem was a lot of phlegm coltrane looked discreetly away while the old man used a handkerchief perhaps if i came back another time nonsense packard whispered hoarsely i asked you to lunch barely able to hear him coltrane stepped closer i rarely invite anyone to the house now coltrane was close enough that if he wanted to he could touch him there was something oddly intimate about packards forced whisper and i certainly dont go back on offers i make the old man cleared his throat with difficulty but im afraid my appetite isnt what it should be the oxygen continued its subtle hiss no doubt something i ate at the reception last night i hope you dont mind if i dont share the meal with you since youre not feeling well why dont we do this another time i wont hear of it duncan bring our young man something to eat is there anything you particularly enjoy a sandwich is fine whatever i was thinking of something a little more elaborate than a sandwich packard cocked his wizened head if the dom pérignon is properly chilled duncan would you bring it out now duncan saluted with his bloody mary and left the room became silent except for the hiss of oxygen the contrast between this conversation and the one the previous evening was more striking coltrane decided that packard not only had worn makeup at the reception but had been energized by some kind of drug the drug must have put him on edge that would explain why his present tone was so agreeably the opposite of the one he had used at the reception i see you brought the collection for me to sign which one is it reflections of the city of angels packard sounded oddly sad that has always been my favorite how on earth did you find a copy its very rare and very expensive i spent a lot of time haunting rarebook stores you certainly must have packard took the oversized book and the fountain pen coltrane offered him when he opened the cover he drew his spindly hand affectionately along a page i got older this paper the finest i could find remains the same as when the book was printed in a lifetime ago with a nostalgic shake of his head he uncapped the pen and managed the strength for a solid flourish of a signature there he looked mischievous as he returned the pen and the book now its even more rare and more expensive while youre holding that pen i wonder if youd return the favor and sign something for me coltrane didnt understand baffled he watched packard reach into a pouch on the side of the chair and bring out a copy of through a lens darkly coltranes only collection of photographs images from war zones you do know my work he said in amazement a pulitzer prizewinning photographer has a way of attracting my attention packard said youre very good thank you coltranes voice thickened coming from you that means a great deal he managed to control his hand when he signed the book but i wish id devoted my career to something besides war and pain ive been having a lot of second thoughts the day youre satisfied with your work is the day youll stop being an excellent photographer packard said the old man suddenly coughed the cough increased alarmingly is there anything i can no packard strained to speak through the handkerchief pressed to his mouth coltrane felt helpless wanting to pat him on the back but afraid the old man was so frail that he might injure him at last packard straightened its this weather the chill in the air i shouldnt have gone out last night then why did you the abrupt voice was duncans he entered with an ice bucket a champagne glass a white towel and the dom pérignon to remind myself of how blind people are packard said the only person who recognized the inferiority of my recent photographs is our young man here or maybe everyone else was being polite duncan popped the champagne open and poured the glass for coltrane that still makes mr coltrane the only credible person at the reception except me i always tell you what i think duncan set the bottle into the ice bucket placing the towel next to it and what are you thinking now that ill prepare lunch his lips barely revealing a smile duncan left coltrane felt the champagne bubbles touch the tip of his nose when he sipped i see you also brought packard gestured toward the nikon that hung from a strap on coltranes shoulder to stop time you said the change of subject threw coltrane off i asked you why you became a photographer that was your answer then you added things fall apart and people die yes who excuse me who died coltrane looked at the floor my question makes you uncomfortable yes at my age i find that it saves time packard paused to catch his breath if i ask new acquaintances to tell me the most important thing i need to know about them a lot of people dont like to be reminded of the most important thing about them coltrane said the oxygen hissed was it a sister the champagne suddenly had an acidic edge a brother coltrane set down the glass my mother i see and my father when you were young my own parents died when i was young not far from here in a boating accident off santa catalina yes when you were sixteen packard didnt seem surprised that coltrane knew any detail of his life my parents died when i was eleven coltrane said although really both of them were dead a long time before it just took several years to work it all out packard frowned my father beat my mother packard didnt move didnt speak if he had reacted in any way coltrane would have ended the subject right there but packard seemed to sense coltranes ambivalence the old mans presence was hypnotic as the silence lengthened except for the hiss of the oxygen coltrane found himself wanting to continue my father didnt beat my mother because he was a drunkard or because he was worried about his job or any of the other excuses you sometimes hear i never saw him take a drink he had his own successful business a chain of drycleaning shops that kept expanding every year maybe it was work pressures i didnt know anything about or maybe his father liked to beat his mother maybe thats why he did it maybe he thought it was normal for a while i thought it was normal i thought every kids father beat up coltrane felt taken back in time he blinked coming out of a trance and picked up the champagne regardless of how much the acid of his memories tainted it he took a long swallow he felt an odd need to keep explaining as if packard more than anyone else in the world would understand one night after my father had given my mother an especially thorough workover he did something hed never done before he started on me he knocked out one of my teeth the next morning he said he was really sorry and it wouldnt happen again and i should tell my teacher id fallen off my bike and that was how my face got messed up and honest to god he would make it up to me for hurting me then he drove off to work the minute his car disappeared around a corner my mother rushed me upstairs and helped me throw clothes into two suitcases then she filled two suitcases of her own and i remember all the while she was glancing frantically out the bedroom window afraid that my father might drive back coltrane studied the bubbles in his champagne glass they seemed to get larger again he was tugged back into the past she must have been planning it for a long time she kept the garage door closed while she put the suitcases in her car so the neighbors wouldnt see then she and i drove to the bank after that she drove to a bus station and made me wait there with the bags while she left the car somewhere else at a train station she later told me so my father would think that was how wed gotten out of town an hour later she came back to the bus station and for the next three years we were on the run stopping in towns across the country where my mother worked at any job she could find until she had enough money saved to keep running i later reconstructed the route from new haven connecticut to trenton new jersey to harrisburg pennsylvania to youngstown ohio to sedalia missouri to boulder colorado to flagstaff arizona and finally to los angeles very thirsty he finished the glass of champagne and poured another he might as well have been drinking water we kept changing our names my mother told me she looked for cashonly jobs like housekeeping that didnt force her to pay taxes and get her social security number recorded in a government computer she told me if we didnt leave a paper trail if we didnt try to get in touch with friends and relatives back home my father wouldnt be able to find us i still dont know how emotion tightened coltranes throat one afternoon after my mother picked me up from a library where she always told me to wait after school till she was done with work we went to get an ice cream cone just one we couldnt afford two then we took a bus to the trailer where we were living and when we went in we found my father sitting on a stool at the kitchen counter playing solitaire as calm as id ever seen him he got up sighed pulled out a gun said togetherness is next to godliness and shot my mother in the face just like that when my father made up his mind to do something he was unstoppable i felt as if somebody had slammed hands against my ears the inside of my head was ringing but somehow i thought i heard my mother moan as she fell maybe i was the one moaning i felt wet sticky stuff all over my face the next thing my father pointed the gun at me he gave me a funny little frown looked at my mothers body looked at me again shook his head and blew his brains out when coltrane lifted his glass to his lips he realized that it was empty once more they told me i didnt speak for a year coltrane braced himself to continue packards intensely sympathetic gaze was eerily compelling urging him on after my grandparents flew to los angeles to get me after they packed up the clothes and things that my mother and i had in the trailer after they took care of the bills and arranged for the bodies to be transported back to connecticut after all the legal technicalities were out of the way and i went to live with them in new haven i couldnt remember what my mother looked like i used to spend hours at a stretch hiding in the basement trying to remember her face but all that came to me was the image of her blood splattering when my fathers bullet hit her i desperately wanted to remember her voice but all i heard in my mind was the sound of the shot that was my reality not what was going on around me in my grandparents house i must have eaten and slept bathed and dressed and watched television and gone to school but the images and sounds i actually experienced were in my memory i had no idea of time passing eventually i found out it was a year later when i heard someone crying in a room above me while i hid in the cellar a fog seemed to clear as i crawled from behind the furnace and made my way upstairs following the sobs through the kitchen to the living room discovering that they belonged to my grandmother she was hunched forward on a chair her face in her hands sobbing so hard that tears dripped through her fingers and landed on the clear plastic sheets that protected photographs in an album lying open on the coffee table i came around her chair and peered down at the photographs one of them had been taken in blazing sunlight that made everything overbright and harsh i recognized a swing a slide and a teetertotter that someone had put up at the trailer park where my mother and i had lived i recognized a trailer in the background i studied a boy in the swing and a woman pushing him i leaned closer squinting at the womans long windblown sandcolored hair at her high slender neck and delicate face at her beaming smile the woman wore a brownandwhitecheckered shirt with its sleeves rolled up and its bottom hanging over her jeans the shirt and the jeans looked too big for her emphasizing how delicately thin she was pushing that laughing child she looked to be having the time of her life slowly i became aware that the sobbing had stopped when i turned i saw that my grandmother had lowered her hands and was staring at me her face raw from tears thats my mother i said the first time id spoken in a year thats what she looks like i remember now so you became a photographer to try to preserve the past packard asked the present that album and others my grandparents had showed my mother growing up and getting married then she was big with me then she was holding me and bathing me and raising me time was suspended she existed on the page mercifully i didnt find any photos of my father my grandmother told me that she had burned every image of him cursing him all the while he was dead but not my mother she was still alive in the photographs but she was more perfect in some than in others as i studied them endlessly i became frustrated some of the photos were slightly blurred others had too much or too little light some were too close others too far some didnt emphasize what i absolutely needed to see a glint in my mothers eyes or what she was doing with her hands i kept imagining better images i kept praying that they could have been made better and the next step was to start learning about photography youve heard the stories about photographers who go to primitive regions where the natives wont let the photographers take pictures of them because the natives are afraid the cameras will steal their souls i have no idea if those stories are true but if they are the natives are wrong the camera doesnt steal anything it gives immortality thats what i thought when i was a young man i wanted to take photographs of everybody i met to memorialize them with pity and love because one day they were going to die but not in my photographs as long as my photographs existed i thought so did those people wanted thought you keep using the past tense somewhere along the line i went wrong i started taking pictures that didnt celebrate living but fixated on dying i started documenting despair instead of hope coltrane shook his head sharply no more i want to glorify life then by all means packard coughed painfully i want you to photograph me when duncan brought in a tray of six different kinds of caviar translucent eggs of gold black gray brown graygreen and greenish black coltranes alreadytentative appetite deserted him emotion on top of the champagne had soured his stomach increasingly packard his eyes drooping his whisper more filled with phlegm didnt have the strength to continue the conversation so after finalizing the details of their project coltrane said goodbye the afternoon light remained dismal driving back to los angeles coltrane struggled against an overwhelming exhaustion he reached his apartment at but still wasnt hungry in fact he feared he was going to be sick he lay on his leather sofa tried to analyze what had just happened to him and sank into an agitated sleep at one point the phone rang but he was in too dark a place to answer or hear if anyone left a message did you phone me last night coltrane asked it was eleven sunday morning he sat with jennifer on the narrow balcony of her condominium overlooking the harbor in marina del rey the clouds continued to be gray the breeze was cool even wearing a sweater coltrane felt slightly shivery but he couldnt shake the sensation of being hungover and told himself that all he needed was fresh air to perk him up jennifer shook her head we agreed you were going to find out how you managed on your own so you didnt jennifer looked amused there was a time when i called you a little too often remember i was just wondering last night while i was asleep somebody phoned but didnt leave a message when i checked the machine this morning its light was flashing i had plenty of messages from earlier in the day more reporters and tv talk shows wanting an interview about those bosnia photographs but then at the end all i got was fifteen seconds of some kind of classical music and then click wasnt me jennifer said coltrane rubbed his forehead and fortified himself with a sip of steaming frenchroast coffee a reporter wouldnt have been shy about leaving a message you wonder if it was packard the thought occurred to me despite coltranes sunglasses the light seemed awfully intense he squinted toward a sailboat its motor chugging as it made its way along the crowded harbor toward the exit from the marina maybe its my virgo personality jennifer said what do you mean this is definitely a done deal right you and packard are going to collaborate for the magazine packard promised hed fedex you the prints and the signed permission forms tomorrow coltrane said but if it was packard who phoned you last night do you suppose he was planning to tell you hed changed his mind maybe you should phone him today and confirm the arrangement and make him worry im going to be a nuisance jennifer chewed her lower lip yeah sometimes i dont know when to leave well enough alone climbing the stairs from his garage entering his kitchen coltrane heard a voice call his name about to continue up to his darkroom on the second floor he tensed immediately changed direction and stared into the living room the front door was open light streaming in from the patio a redhaired man was setting a large cardboard box next to another one like coltrane he was in his midthirties his thinning hair emphasized the fullness of his face his pale skin contrasted with his freckles just in time the man said i signed for these boxes and brought them in for you daniel coltrane grinned ive been wanting to call you but i know youre working nights in the emergency ward i didnt want to wake you during the day i appreciate the thought this weeks been rough i guess i didnt make it any better when i hammered on your door wednesday morning its a good thing you did your stitches needed a little maintenance how are they fine seeings believing up with the sweater and the shirt coltrane sighed and did what he was told not bad daniel bent peering closely the antibiotic i prescribed must be working you had the start of an infection but the redness around the edges has almost disappeared now hows your fever gone youve got a hell of a constitution my friend i doubt id have lived through what you did coltrane shrugged make sure you finish the antibiotics keep drinking plenty of fluids in a couple of days ill take out the stitches daniel coltrane put a wealth of meaning into the next word thanks its nothing no its very definitely something youre always there when it counts what did you expect me to do tell you to go away that id just gotten home from the hospital and i needed to sleep youre a friend i hope you didnt mind my bringing in jennifer i couldnt think of anybody else i could count on to help mind not at all things are working out great admit it you missed having her around the three of us had a lot of good times if jennifer tried too hard its because she cared or i didnt try hard enough coltrane changed the subject tell me about these boxes a man from a limousine service was camped outside your door i noticed him when i was going out for some muchneeded exercise daniel patted the slight protrusion at the belly of his blue jogging suit the boxes must have gold in them or something they certainly weigh enough the delivery guy was reluctant to let me sign for them he only agreed when he saw i had a key to your town house a delivery on sunday the driver said the man who sent them was very insistent there isnt a label did the driver say who randolph packard packard why should that name mean something to me coltrane quickly explained as he opened one of the large boxes inside an envelope lay on top of a generous amount of bubble wrap he broke the seal finding a handwritten card i trust you know what to do with this baffled coltrane pulled away the bubble wrap his bewilderment changing to amazement when he discovered a tripod and a footsquare black box whose front and back were connected by bellows what is it daniel asked a camera ive never seen any camera that looks like a miniature accordion its called a view camera realizing the significance of what he was holding coltrane felt awestruck these days only studio photographers use them but in the old days in packards prime it was the standard for every serious photographer packard would have taken one with him everywhere how come it looks so weird i guess you dont know anything about fstops and shutter speeds coltrane said thank god just give me my point and shoot kodak and im a happy camper right coltrane chuckled you cant imagine what it was like to take pictures when a camera didnt come equipped with a builtin light meter and automatic focus and all the rest of the bells and whistles progress maybe but dont you sometimes get frustrated with the pictures those automatic cameras take they often look overexposed theres no texture to the image the colors are harsh theyre good enough for snapshots but if you want a firstrate photograph you have to go a different route you need to use a meter to judge the light as accurately as you can then you need to adjust the lens opening and the shutter speed so the correct amount of light strikes the negative this view camera has precise controls that allow you to do that its focusing is just as precise you expand or contract these bellows like an accordion pulling the lens closer or farther away from the view plate at the back until the image is perfectly crisp a camera this large takes an eightbyten negative you can print the image as an eightbyten transfer with none of the graininess you get when you enlarge an image from a dinky thirtyfivemillimeter negative you get an image so sharp and clear you wont be able to tolerate snapshots from an automatic camera looks awkward worse than you think hold this while i pull the tripod from the box coltrane expanded the tripods legs and locked them then secured the camera to the tripod he draped a black cloth over the back now stoop under there and look at the viewing screen daniel did so then quickly reappeared from the cloth rubbing his eyes in discomfort everythings upside down and reversed coltrane said the photographer has to imagine the way the image would look normally not only that the cameras heavy it uses negatives protected by a lightproof holder two negatives to a holder so if you want to take a hundred exposures you need fifty holders and theyre heavy and then of course you need various filters and lenses which you have to carry with you and which i assume are in the other box taking a view camera on a photo assignment can be like going on a safari youre sure its worth it right now i wouldnt have it any other way coltrane stared reverentially at the camera look at the scratches on it old he studied the manufacturers name imprinted on the metal rim at the back korona im not sure that companys still in business numbed coltrane sank onto the sofa struck by the implications this must be the same camera that packard used to photograph his famous series of la houses he thought in a way he had never imagined this assignment to recreate that series was going to be an education he had known that he would be literally following packards footsteps doing his best to find where packard had placed his camera trying to reproduce the same camera angles but coltrane had assumed that he would use contemporary cameras now he understood that modern equipment would skew the experiment drawing more attention to how photography had changed than to how the city had changed since the twenties the further implication was that by wanting coltrane to use the same camera he had packard was telling him to do everything possible to try to identify with packard to pretend to be packard only then would coltrane understand the decisions packard had made when photographing those houses the phone rang maybe its the old man coltrane thought hello youll never guess what a messenger just delivered jennifer said excitedly the prints and the signed permission forms this is very definitely a done deal and youll never guess what a messenger just delivered to me the view camera packard used what get over here youve got to see this camera hello duncans voice sounded thick as if hed been drinking its mitch coltrane no response coltrane pressed the phone harder to his ear wondering if there was something wrong with the connection duncan this is about the camera i cant get over how generous hes being is this a good time to talk to him id like to thank him and swear hell get everything back in perfect condition no im afraid this isnt a good time then ill call back when do you think he might be feeling randolph died two hours ago a chill started at coltranes feet and went all the way to his scalp no how yesterday he put up a good front his breathing got worse around three this morning even with the oxygen at its highest setting he still had to fight for air jesus i phoned for his doctor but randolph left strict instructions that he didnt want to go to a hospital all we could do was make him comfortable by early afternoon he was finally at peace the camera coltrane had difficulty getting his voice to work when did we discussed it last evening thats also when he signed the photopermission forms which i assume your editor has by now along with the prints the project can go forward as planned for some reason randolph thought it important that someone retrace his steps i wont let him down he didnt think you would youd be surprised how close he was beginning to feel toward you a fellow orphan is how he described you i want to be sure you understand randolph found it almost impossible to speak near the end but he managed an amazing effort to make me promise to tell you tell me the camera is yours what its not a loan its a gift i guess you could call it an inheritance so weighed down with grief coltrane brought packard back to life he couldnt help thinking that way as he worked in the darkroom a faint amber safelight over his head jennifer stood next to him watching somberly as he used tongs to slide a sheet of photographic paper into a tray of developing solution he stirred the solution briefly the sheet remained blank then the magic took place an image coming to life on the paper a blackandwhite picture of the old man gazing up jennifer wasnt able to speak for a moment its fabulous sorrow negated any tone of satisfaction that coltrane might have felt the odor of chemicals was bitter i took a dozen exposures but this is the one i knew i wanted the image showed packard looking shrunken in his pajamas and his housecoat sitting in his wheelchair the fireplace in the background the aperture setting coltrane had used had allowed him to keep that background in focus specifically part of a burntout log in the hearth the kind of symbolic detail that packard had liked to use in his early work his eyes jennifer said coltrane nodded the expression in them constantly changed from arrogance to impatience to irony to amusement to calculation but this particular expression was the one i wanted earlier when hed looked at the collection of his photos i brought for him to autograph his eyes became sad there wasnt a hint of pride in his reaction to what hed created instead the only thing the photographs seemed to do was remind him of the passage of time did you have any trouble getting him to hold the book in his lap not at all he told me i surrender myself so now we have a photograph of a fragile old man who happens to be a genius inspecting the contents of one of his books a photograph about a photographer and his photographs coltranes voice was filled with melancholy his photos stayed the same but he got older but now he stays the same in this photo i wonder what itll feel like going where packard did doing what he did trying to be him three approaching the beverly hills hotel coltrane steered left off sunset boulevard and headed up benedict canyon drive it was a little after eight wednesday morning the day after packards funeral determined to start the project he and jennifer had set out early they drove through the shade of towering palm trees past expensive homes concealed behind meticulously trimmed hedges and tall househugging shrubs the sky was clear and bright for a change the clouds having moved on dont keep me in suspense which house is first on the list jennifer asked falcon lair coltrane wore his typical work clothes leather hiking boots jeans and a navy sweatshirt in contrast jennifer had an orange sweatshirt with a southern california magazine logo her short blond hair was tucked beneath a baseball cap making her face look attractively boyish reminding coltrane of the movie actor she now mentioned rudolph valentino the sheik himself i never understood why he called the place falcon lair in the midtwenties valentinos second wife was trying to get the studio to let her supervise the production of one of his movies the picture was called the hooded falcon but she ran up costs so much that the studio canceled it to make her feel better valentino named the mansion they were building in honor of the aborted project they got divorced shortly afterward and what happened to valentino when his wife left him he threatened to blow his brains out instead he bought tons of antique furniture suits of armor and moorish screens crap like that it was more than falcon lair would hold but he managed to cram it all in there in the end he almost spent himself into bankruptcy he worried about his career until he died at the age of thirtyone from a bleeding ulcer packards much praised photograph of falcon lair had been taken from a neighboring hilltop it showed the thirteenroom mansion tiny in the distance surrounded by a high white wall perched on a flattened ridge looking so isolated that it bore an intriguing resemblance to a spanish monastery none of the many hills beyond it had any houses on it but tentaclelike roads predicted the invasion about to take place on the bottom left of the photograph amid exposed earth on one of the slopes a developers sign announced beverly terrace the implication was clear soon the area would be filled with comparable estates the remoteness that made the location attractive would be destroyed as if commenting on the impending invasion packard had managed to capture a bird of prey hovering in the foreground near the top of benedict canyon drive coltrane chose a secluded street to the left and headed higher into the wooded hills the neighborhood became increasingly deserted the more the houses looked expensive how do you know this is the way jennifer asked i dont monday i bought a contour map and tried to orient it with packards photo and a beverly hills street guide falcon lair is on one of those bluffs to the right so we have to go in the opposite direction to find the spot where packard took the photograph jennifer shook her head these streets werent here back then theres no way to tell which route packard used and all these trees cut off the view so we dont know where we are in relation to falcon lair six hours later dogged determination was all that kept them going this assignment needs an explorer not a photographer coltrane said as he steered onto yet another side street jennifer squirmed my rear end hurts i feel as if ive driven to vegas and back empty coffee cups along with scrunchedup junkfood wrappers littered the floor of the passenger seat from several bathroom trips to west hollywood i bet i put on ten pounds maybe getting me to do this project was packards idea of a practical joke coltrane reached the crest of what seemed the hundredth side street and pointed toward a walled estate on the left do you think this is where he took the photograph jennifer glanced from the estate toward the barely glimpsed view to the right lets give it a try anything to get out and see if my legs still work a breeze smelled sweet despite the recent rain coltrane heard a lawn sprinkler could be he studied the estate it was higher than the street in fact it was on the highest spot around from inside we might be able to see over the trees toward the opposite side of the canyon jennifer checked her watch ten after two the light will soon be perfect yeah maybe the day wont be a total waste maybe i can still get some shots the rhododendronlined driveway had a closed metal gate a smaller closed gate had a sidewalk leading onto the property an intercom was mounted on an ivycovered wall coltrane pushed the button hello a female voice sounding tinny came from the intercom maam im sorry to bother you but im a photographer for youre early coltrane exchanged a puzzled look with jennifer excuse me maam he said to the intercom youre not supposed to be here until saturday saturday for our daughters wedding im afraid theres been a misunderstanding my god dont tell me you cant be here for the wedding the woman said i dont know anything about that i work for southern california magazine and magazine but i dont want any magazines jennifer started to giggle maam im not selling magazines what i want to do is take some photographs of a house across photographs of our house my husband will go insane he hates anybody knowing anything about our private life the last movie he produced was about arab terrorists he says if they find out where we live theyll blow us up in our sleep jennifer bent over trying to stifle her laughter maam i have no intention of photographing your house i want to photograph rudolph valentinos house rudolph valentino youre not making sense for all i know youre a terrorist young man i can see you from the house if you dont leave right now im calling the police please let me explain the intercom had been making a slight buzzing sound now it went dead when coltrane turned to jennifer for moral support he found her slumped on the curb holding herself laughing only nineteen more houses to go she managed to say between guffaws at this rate youll be done by next summer maybe not a voice said jennifer stopped laughing they spun toward the gate where an attractive delicatelooking woman in her late twenties studied them she was tall and slim wearing tan slacks and a brown cardigan her arms were crossed a kerchief covered her hair are you really from southern california magazine jennifer stood and showed her best winning smile gesturing toward the logo on her sweatshirt cross my heart just a second the woman reached through the bars on the gate and pressed the intercom the tinny voice responded immediately young man i told you mother dont call the police these people seem all right im going to let them in but the woman took her finger off the intercoms button then pressed numbers on a keypad on the other side of the gate freeing an electronic lock youre serious about photographing a house across the canyon mr mitch coltrane this is my editor jennifer lane diane laramy they shook hands and stepped through the gate whats this about rudolph valentino coltrane explained the assignment as they climbed a smooth slanted lawn stopping with their backs to a lemon tree at the hills highest point and there it is jennifer sounded amazed she showed packards photograph to diane then pointed down toward a curving street of houses on an opposite but lower hill one sprawling redroofed structure stood slightly apart perched on an eroded slope solitary on a deadend road its walls were still white it still looked like a spanish monastery but there the similarity ended the invasion that packards photograph had predicted made falcon lair look besieged i was beginning to think this project couldnt be done coltrane said eerie diane said looking at that photograph and then at the house i feel as if im in the past and the present simultaneously thats the idea coltrane said he and jennifer crisscrossed the hill leaning this way and that all the while comparing their view of falcon lair to the perspective in packards photograph trying to find the exact spot where packard had set up his camera scraping his back against the lemon tree coltrane smiled well ill be yes right here let me see jennifer hurried to coltranes left bemused diane joined coltrane on his right he raised the photo so that it obscured the view then lowered it the falcon lair from the s replaced by the falcon lair of the present its like a weird kind of double exposure diane said this lemon tree wouldnt have been here then or the lawn jennifer added and obviously not your house and none of these other houses coltrane continued to raise and lower the photograph the effect hypnotic so many years ago someone stood exactly where im standing now and took that picture he died on sunday coltrane said diane suddenly shivered is something wrong coltrane asked no theres just a chill in the air but coltrane couldnt help wondering if diane had shivered for another reason her delicate features began to trouble him her skin was so translucent that he could see the hint of blue veins in her cheeks her eyes seemed sunken possibly because she had lost a lot of weight her slacks and cardigan hung on her her kerchief covered her head so completely that he didnt see any of her hair well coltrane felt awkward were taking up your time no problem diane said im enjoying this even so coltrane studied the sky the lights about as good as i can hope for id better get started when he and jennifer went back to the car to get the camera the tripod and the bags of equipment diane insisted on helping out of breath even though she carried only a small camera bag to the crest of the hill coltrane didnt have time to think about the implications he had only about two hours of effective light remaining and needed to hurry it took almost fifteen minutes to get the heavy camera secured on the tripod after that he used a light meter calculated the necessary shutter speed and aperture setting chose a lens poked his head beneath the black cloth at the rear of the camera used the bellows to adjust the focus and compared what he saw to packards photograph getting everything lined up was more difficult than he had anticipated after fortyfive minutes of concentrating on an upsidedown reversed image he felt lightheaded as if he were upside down he made twelve exposures but he wasnt satisfied framing the image to make its perspective identical to that in packards photograph wasnt going to produce a brilliant photograph he realized the result would merely be a visual trick he had to build on what packard had done to find a metaphor equivalent to the bird of prey hovering over falcon lair mitch coltrane rubbed the back of his neck mitch huh he turned toward jennifer you havent moved in the last ten minutes are you all right just thinking youve got only fortyfive minutes of light jennifer said fortyfive startled coltrane checked his watch he had lost more time then he realized yet again he poked his head beneath the black cloth at the rear of the camera earlier when he and jennifer had driven toward the estate coltrane had wondered not seriously if packard had been playing a practical joke on him by suggesting this project now that idea struck him as being very serious with one foot in the grave had packard been determined to show coltrane typical of all wouldbe packards that coltrane didnt have a hope of competing with him was this project the old mans way of proving one last time how superior he was mitch coltrane noticed slight movement on the focusing screen he heard a faroff echoing whumpwhumpwhump and peered up from the camera to search the sky seeing that the movement was a distant whirling speck a helicopter he inserted an eightbyteninch negative and grabbed the shutter release come on he whispered tensely he held his breath as the choppers glinting blades crossed the horizon now he squeezed the shutter release the camera clicked he breathed out packards bird of prey had symbolized valentinos bad ending and the impending invasion of the land now a helicopter and all it symbolized about the mechanization of the twentieth century had taken the falcons place if that picture turns out the way i hope coltrane watched the helicopter recede into the distance that was a onetime only chance even if another helicopter flies past the odds are itll never be in the same spot as packards falcon jennifer studied the sky youre losing the light faster than we expected there might be enough for a couple more a soft voice asked do you suppose puzzled coltrane looked at diane when youre finished taking pictures of the house diane hesitated yes could you take one of me of course it would be my pleasure youre sure im not imposing not at all you made us feel welcome id enjoy repaying the favor if you turn this way yes with the sunset on your face coltrane smiled itll be lovely shes dying coltrane said driving from the mansion somethings definitely wrong jennifer said in his rearview mirror coltrane saw diane standing in her driveway her arms crossed on her oversized sweater forlornly watching them head back toward benedict canyon drive then he rounded a corner and she disappeared studying her through the camera made it even more obvious coltrane said the hollows around her eyes i dont think she has any hair under that kerchief i think shes bald from chemotherapy i think getting married on saturday is her attempt to grab at life jennifer didnt say anything for a moment yes to grab at life it was after dark around six when they pulled into the garage beneath coltranes town house in westwood jennifers bmw was at the curb do you want to get something to eat she asked what id really like to do is go into the darkroom and develop these negatives the photographs of falcon lair turned out to be excellent most were a close match to the angle packard had used but close wouldnt do it for the exercise to work the match had to be perfect the one with the helicopter in place of the falcon did the trick all coltrane had to do was crop it a little and print a slight enlargement of the cropped area so that falcon lair was precisely the same size in both photos eerily the helicopter was almost exactly where the falcon had been by modifying the development period coltrane was able to get the same crisp blackandwhite definition that packard had when he glanced from packards photo to his own he had the odd sensation that he was looking at timelapse photography that both pictures had been taken by the same person who had made himself wait motionless in one spot for twothirds of a century staring at that relic from the past he couldnt help recalling that after valentinos death buster keaton had moved into the area and put up an italian villa john gilbert had built a mediterranean palace other movie stars their names no longer familiar had built their own mansions all lost and gone only falcon lair remained and would remain as long as packards photo and his own survived its a keeper jennifer put an arm around him but the photograph of falcon lair wasnt the treasure of the day that honor went to the image of diane he had done it in color the glow of sunset chased the wanness from dianes cheeks her face was raised yearningly her recessed eyes sad her gaunt features determined her frail shoulders braced as she smiled wistfully toward the sunset of her life that i want my name on coltrane said her braverys an inspiration packard would have been pleased to take that picture jennifer said while they worked in the darkroom they heard the phone ring on three different occasions each time it stopped after four rings the limit coltrane had set for the answering machine to engage its probably more reporters wanting an interview about those waratrocity photos i hope my fifteen minutes of notoriety soon stop he said but after he finished making the prints and went to the living room to press the play button on his answering machine he frowned when all he heard was mournful classical music jennifer stopped next to him the same as on saturday night coltrane nodded troubled and this time we know it wasnt packard repressing his misgivings about the phone calls coltrane left his apartment the next morning shortly after seven he brimmed with energy never having been this enthusiastic about any project first a few blocks away he stopped at a mailbox to drop in an envelope addressed to diane along with three copies of her photograph the package contained a copy of packards falcon lair photograph and coltranes parallel version of it his note read here are some mementos of our photographic adventure enjoy your honeymoon i wish you every happiness he watched the lid close on the mailbox to grab at life he thought with that he went to work there was a time he knew when pepper trees had grown on hollywood boulevard when beverly hills had bridle paths when streetcar tracks occupied the route that freeways now did when sherman oaks north hollywood burbank tarzana encino van nuys and all the other communities in the san fernando valley how coltrane loved the litany of their names were distinct villages separated by farmland each had a different architecture englishstyle cottages in one contrasting with missionstyle bungalows in another victorians in this area colonials in that the distinctness of each area was destroyed as the farmland shrank and the communities merged although sometimes driving from community to community if coltrane ignored where the borders met and concentrated only on the historical core of each area he could still see the contrast between one community and another randolph packard had managed to capture those differences he recorded a sense of welcoming space of sunbathed separateness as always in his photographs a detail here and there predicted the impending doom the tiny figures of surveyors on a field in the background for example or a halfcompleted skeleton of a building on a distant hill coltrane brooded about those changes as he took the into the smogfilled valley he imagined what it must have been like in packards youth to have a clear view of the nowhazeshrouded san gabriel mountains as he followed packards route trying to see with packards eyes he had the sensation of going back in time the trailer court was in glendale drab rows of dilapidated mobile homes overflowing dumpster bins at the end of each row gravel in front of each trailer no grass anywhere no trees just a few flower boxes here and there spindly marigolds and geraniums drooping over their rims coltrane drove down to the third row and turned left passing an elderly man wearing suspenders over a tshirt and carrying a basket of laundry toward a clothesline at the side of his trailer halfway along coltrane reached a small playground stopped the car got out and approached the playgrounds rusted waisthigh chainlink fence the swings and the teetertotter were tarnished and unpainted the ground was like concrete a thin black woman pushed a young boy in a swing the womans dark hair hung in half a dozen braids she wore sandals wrinkled shorts and a red pullover which although faded was the only bright spot in the trailer court as the boy stretched his legs to give more force to his upward momentum the soles of his running shoes were visible and their holes the woman narrowed her eyes toward coltrane then returned her attention to the boy hi coltrane said she didnt answer i used to live here he said the woman stayed silent every once in a while when im in the neighborhood i come back the woman shrugged my mother used to push me in those swings coltrane said you want something id like to take your picture why the woman tensed somebody once took a picture of me and my mother exactly where youre standing id like to feel what the photographer felt id like to try to take the same picture the woman looked baffled go back to what you were doing i wont bother you ill just take one picture and leave the womans gaze faltered as she struggled with her suspicion at last after another shrug she returned her attention to the boy and started pushing him again coltrane selected a fast shutter speed to avoid blur then peered through his viewfinder knowing that packards camera was too awkward for this situation he was using his nikon through the viewfinder in miniature but somehow intensified the woman pushed the boy went up in the air then swung back down the woman gave another push her body leaning into the motion the boy looked up as if his goal were the sky as he veered back down coltrane adjusted the focus he readied his finger on the shutter button there wasnt any question about the position he wanted them to be in he had studied that position thousands of times in the photograph that had made him want to be a photographer in sightings a book that packard had written about photography the master had devoted a chapter to his theory of anticipation once you see the elements of the image you want its too late to release the cameras shutter by the time you do those elements will have changed in that instant clouds will have shifted smiles will have weakened branches will have been nudged by a breeze it is the nature of life for things to be in motion even if they do not appear to be and the only way to capture the precise positioning of your subject as you desire it is to study your subject until you understand its dynamic and then to anticipate what your subject will do the photographers task is to project into the future in order to make the present timeless do it now coltrane thought he pressed the shutter button and in the ensuing millisecond as the camera clicked the woman and the boy achieved perfect balance through the viewfinder time seemed suspended coltrane sighed and lowered the camera the boy reached the limit of his upward glide hovered and began to descend time began again thanks coltrane said whats your name and address ill send you a couple of prints do i look that stupid you think im gonna tell you my name and address coltranes spirit sank he turned from the playground and studied the trailer behind him the three concrete steps to its entrance were cracked the screen had been torn from the bent aluminum door one of the windows had cardboard in it he crossed the gravel lane the bent door creaked when he opened it the metal door behind it shuddered when he knocked he waited not hearing any sound he knocked a second time but still didnt get a response when he knocked a third time he started to worry only to see the door open and a stooped wrinkled black woman with short silver hair frown out at him you the woman clutched a tattered housecoat to her chest where you been aint seen you in a couple of months i was away on several business trips out of the country got to thinkin somethin had happened to you well as a matter of fact it did is this a convenient time the same as before yes get it over with entering coltrane smelled ancient cooking odors he faced an oblong living room filled with tattered furniture to the left a folddown card table had a jigsaw puzzle on it farther to the left a counter separated the living room from the murky kitchen it seemed barely yesterday that he and his mother had stood where he now stood the door open behind him sunlight gleaming in when his father had turned from playing solitaire at the kitchen counter and raised the gun toward his mothers face coltrane heard the shot slam his ears he gaped at his mother falling at the blood around her on the floor he stared down for the longest time finally he raised his head and turned to the elderly woman thank you what do you get out of this im not sure coltrane gave the woman three hundred dollars real generous this time well im going through some changes i might not be back scholars analyzing packards contribution to photography had documented the location of each house in his series but coltrane never knew what he was going to find when he reached each address some of the houses no longer existed variously replaced by an apartment building a fourlane street and a supermarket others had been renovated their facades altered to the point where they werent recognizable a few had been maintained most had decayed but if finding them wasnt difficult locating the spot from which packard had photographed them turned out to be almost as arduous as figuring out the vantage point from which he had photographed falcon lair in the following two weeks each of coltranes setups in locations as various as arcadia whitley heights silver lake and venice turned out to have a story behind it some as poignant as his meeting with diane others comic or repulsive or ennobling and in two cases violent in culver city he lugged the view camera its tripod and its bags of equipment to the top of a warehouse that had not existed when packard took his photos in gardena he paid for permission to shoot from an upstairs bedroom window of an eightyyearold widows house other places he photographed from an alley a school yard the side of a freeway and the back of a pickup truck he escaped a pack of vicious dogs he saved the life of a drug addict who had overdosed in a drainage ditch he talked his way out of a confrontation with a street gang he met a blind novelist a onearmed songwriter and an aging actor who had once played a policeman on an ensemble tv show and was now an insurance salesman he took pictures of everything some nights he got home too late to call jennifer other nights he had so much work to do in the darkroom that he kept the conversation short ill tell you all about it when im finished im afraid ill jinx this if i talk about it or interrupt it i havent felt this involved in an awfully long time the projectll be done soon then well go away for a couple of days up to carmel anyplace you like each night when he checked his answering machine there was always at least one hangup call and that strange mournful music four in a city of imitation the house was unique designed by lloyd wright the son of frank lloyd wright it had been constructed in for a movie producer whose films were unoriginal but who knew enough to let an originalminded architect do his job in an area prone to earthquakes it was made from reinforced concrete its staggered three stories created a castle effect glinting windows dominated the upper rooms which were flanked by shrub and flowerfilled terraces pounded copper sheets displaying precolumbian designs that resembled arrowheads led up each corner and along the parapets in packards photograph of it but coltrane had no idea if the house still existed using his thomas guide and information from one of packards biographies he approached the area via a densely built narrow treelined street that curved up one of the numerous hills near the hollywood reservoir doubt made him uneasy but as he crested the hill peering over and down toward the middle of the congested area across from him he felt his heart beat faster when he recognized what he was looking for his breath was taken away this was one case where packards photograph didnt do justice to its subject for one thing the house had a presence a solidity an immediacy that the photograph even using tricks of perspective and shadows only hinted at for another packards photograph had been in black and white leaving coltrane unprepared for the greenish blue of the hammered copper trim along the corners or for the coral tint of its stucco and the red and yellow of the flowers on the terraces after so much effort trying to find the sites from which packard had photographed the other houses he had chanced upon the exact spot he needed for this house on his first try he couldnt get over it excitement swelling in him he got out of his blazer opened the back hatch and arranged his equipment waiting for a truck to pass he set up the view camera in the street he was amazed by how efficiently he was now able to handle it made the necessary adjustments to match the image with the perspective in packards photo inserted an eightbyteninch negative and took the picture his chest relaxed with satisfaction to make sure there hadnt been a mechanical failure he decided to take a dozen more exposures but basically he had gotten the job done and there wasnt any need to find details that commented on the difference between the past and the present because in this case there wasnt any difference although the neighborhood had become overgrown the house had been maintained exactly as it had once looked in packards photograph it was as beautiful as ever a horn sounded behind him he waved for a station wagon to squeeze around him then redirected his attention to the house below him after retrieving the exposed negative he decided to check that the camera hadnt shifted slightly and he stooped to peer beneath the black cloth concentrating on the upsidedown image on the focusing plate movement caught his attention someone coming out of the houses front door a portly man carrying a large cardboard box to a mercedes sedan then returning to the house the man wore a green sport coat and had a distinctive rolling gait no coltrane frowned it cant be he was waiting at the mercedes when duncan reynolds again came out of the front door carrying another cardboard box as heavy as the last time coltrane had seen him his face as ruddy duncan set down the box beside an azalea closed the door behind him picked up the box again and only then noticed coltrane at the curb duncan hesitated concealing his surprise then walked down a sloping concrete path to the street i dont suppose i need to ask what youre doing in the neighborhood want some help why not since youre here duncan his eyes a little bloodshot surrendered the box and unlocked the mercedess trunk when coltrane set the box inside next to three others he got a look past an open flap seeing binders of sleeveprotected photographs and negatives coltrane stepped back from the car so we know why im in the neighborhood im just taking care of the final details duncan said coltrane shook his head not understanding the movers were here earlier carting away the furniture but i didnt trust them to handle the photographic materials coltrane continued to look perplexed of course duncan gestured with realization you didnt know know this house belonged to randolph belonged to this was his after randolph photographed it he couldnt get it out of his mind he was so haunted by the unusual design that he bought it coltrane continued to feel amazed none of his biographers ever mentioned that well as you must have gathered by now randolph liked to keep many details about his life confidential he bought the house through an intermediary and put the title in the name of one of the corporations he inherited from his parents sometimes he came here to reminisce about his youth mostly though he used it as an office an archive and a darkroom would you like to see the inside a broad checkered skylight bathed the entryway in brilliance stairs led down and up the areas beyond as bright as the entryway coltrane had never been in a house that collected so much light following duncan he climbed the steps and faced a white room with a wall of windows that looked down on a garden the rooms lack of furnishings made its clean lines even more elegant bedroom and bathroom to the right duncan pointed through a corridor into another sunlit area dining room to the left note that its walls are draped with chromium beads original art deco design the kitchens beyond it as the stairs continued upward coltranes movements made a hushed echo the next level was equally sunlit a bathroom a bedroom and a study another balcony one final set of stairs and coltrane reached a single room with four walls of windows and a skylight a glass door in the middle of each wall led onto a flowerfilled terrace the master bedroom coltrane pivoted spellbound but i havent shown you the most important section duncan said curious coltrane followed him back down to the entryway from where they descended toward the lowest level in back past a darkroom windows looked out onto a narrow pool its water reflecting the houses coral stucco beyond was a flower garden but duncan paid no attention to the view and instead guided coltrane to the left toward a white door within a white wall when duncan pulled at a recessed latch he revealed not another room but another door and this one was metal he unlocked it this area used to be another bedroom randolph converted it into beyond the door was an area more murky than the darkroom a vault cool air spilled out making coltrane step back when duncan flicked a light switch a harsh glare exposed a windowless area that was filled with librarylike metal shelves all but one of which were empty this is where randolph stored all his important negatives and master prints for no reason coltrane could understand he didnt want to enter a separate air conditioner keeps the area cooled to a constant fiftyfive degrees duncans footsteps scraped as he walked along the concrete floor reluctant coltrane followed the cool air making him shiver the area is reinforced by steel to withstand earthquakes duncan said its insulated against fire and sealed against flood as a further precaution a halongas fireextinguisher system is recessed into the ceiling whats the matter with me coltrane thought theres plenty of space in here why do i feel smothered hearing a metallic click he turned to discover that the door had swung shut does the lock work from the inside as well as the out of course theres no danger of being trapped in here randolph thought of everything duncan reached the only shelf that wasnt empty i have only a few more boxes if youll give me a hand gladly in truth coltrane couldnt wait to get out he breathed normally only after he and duncan carried the boxes into the soulwarming light and duncan locked the darkness behind them the change was immediate again coltrane felt at one with the house outside at the curb he helped duncan put the boxes into the mercedes turning he peered toward the property and recalled the almostmystical quality of brightness in it except for the vault he reminded himself but the vault doesnt count he thought it was never intended to be part of the house so what happens now he asked duncan where are you taking those boxes ucla randolph established a special collection there for the past few days ive been making trips back and forth its timeconsuming maybe i could have trusted someone else to do the job but somehow it gave me a sense of peace and the house will go on the market duncan hesitated you know its odd randolph didnt particularly care for where he lived in newport beach you saw how badly maintained it was but here where he came only occasionally he kept this house in perfect shape its being put up for sale thats what the trustees of his estate have decided to do randolph willed the newport beach house to me but he made no provisions for this one duncan would you do me a favor that depends ask the trustees to delay putting the house on the market you want to buy a house jennifer asked in disbelief daniel looked astonished it was saturday in the afternoon they were in coltranes chevy blazer heading past christmas decorations on hollywood boulevard thats what all the mysterys about daniel asked youre taking us to look at a house you ought to feel complimented i wouldnt think of taking a drastic step like this without some input from the two of you but youre out of town a lot sometimes for months jennifer said maybe not anymore ill believe that when i see it when would you find time to look after a house i could hire people to maintain it coltrane steered left onto beachwood drive heading up into the tangle of streets in the hollywood hills but right now if you need to leave in a hurry all you have to do is lock your place and drive away daniel said no muss no fuss not to mention youve got me next door to come over and check on things and youve got jennifer why on earth do you want to complicate your life i was hoping to simplify it coltrane steered to the right heading up a eucalyptuslined zigzag road i want to put down roots then plant a tree daniel said im telling you this could be a mistake coltrane crested a hill excitement made him smile as the house appeared below him he had been afraid that upon returning to it he wouldnt feel the same magic but if anything it gripped him more strongly there he stopped in front the car became silent so what do you think neither jennifer nor daniel said a word well coltrane asked shit daniel said whats the matter its fantastic what about you jennifer she still didnt say anything jennifer its one of the houses packard photographed right why didnt you tell me i didnt want you to have preconceptions jennifer raised a hand to shield her eyes from the sun i wouldnt have believed it as impressive as it is in packards photograph he didnt do it justice then you understand why im tempted to buy it coltrane said the question that comes to mind is how have you got an oil well or something i dont know about exactly what i was thinking daniel said this is a major piece of real estate the asking price must be over a million and a half coltrane said how the what makes you think you can afford my fathers going to buy it for me they looked at him as if hed lost his mind your father jennifer asked the son of a bitch had twenty drycleaning shops coltrane said after he shot my mother and himself the shops were sold the proceeds were put in a trust account that my grandparents managed while they were raising me except for feeding and clothing me paying my medical bills and my college expenses the money was never used until i was twentyone i didnt even know the account existed i thought my grandparents were paying the bills if id known where the money was coming from several times i almost gave it away what stopped me were my grandparents they didnt want the money either but i kept worrying that if something terrible happened to them if they had catastrophic medical bills or i wanted to be in a position to pay them back for all the years and the love they put into raising me so i let the money stay in case the last thing i expected was to use it for myself coltrane tasted something bitter but finally the asshole who called himself my father is going to do something for me an emotional silence was broken by the stutter of a hardtostart lawn mower down the street okay jennifer said i can see youve got your mind made up why are the two of you being so negative they looked at each other daniel glanced down in embarrassment i guess we do sound negative the truth is i enjoy having you as a neighbor the last thing i want is for you to move but its not like id be moving to another city wed still see each other it wouldnt be the same though no coltrane felt a twinge of melancholy no it wouldnt all we want is whats best for you jennifer said dont you think you should at least check to make sure the house doesnt have structural damage from the last quake maybe its about to fall over or maybe its plumbing is all messed up or the house is sitting on a swamp coltrane chuckled i sort of planned on getting it inspected he pulled out a key that duncan had lent him would you like to see for yourself about the swamp the vault daniel said when they came out i know coltrane said but theres an easy way to fix the problem i dont see how rip the damned thing out restore the house to its original condition you sound as if ive made up my mind im going to buy it let me ask you something and then ill shut up jennifer said okay if you just happened to be driving along that street and the house had no association with packard and you noticed it was for sale would you have suddenly wanted to buy it coltrane thought a moment probably not so youre buying the place because packard photographed the house and made it famous coltrane hesitated i dont think so its because packard owned the house you want to identify with him that much coltrane didnt answer ive got something else i want to show you coltrane said they looked puzzled as they got out of his car in his garage but i confess im a little nervous about it lord i hope youre more enthusiastic about what jennifer asked you have to wait here until i get everything ready they looked even more puzzled when he disappeared upstairs two minutes later coltrane called down to the garage okay you can come up now he had put on a cd of miles daviss kind of blue he had glasses of chilled chardonnay ready when they reached the top of the stairs whats this all about daniel asked well i figured if i was going to have a showing i might as well set the mood showing as jennifer sipped the wine she peered into the living room and was momentarily frozen coltrane didnt need to explain what he wanted to show them was obvious everywhere on the walls the bookshelves the furniture any place he could hang them or set them eightbyteninch mounted photographs my god mitch thats why i didnt want to go out to dinner last night coltrane said i was working like crazy to finish the prints theyre words failed her coltranes updates of packards photos were eerily suggestive of the originals time warps he had called them as he worked on them he had done his best to replicate the texture of packards photographs down to the slightest shadows and subtlest streaks of light juxtaposed his images and packards evoked powerful emotions within the viewer creating the illusion of being in two time frames simultaneously jennifer and daniel seemed spellbound moving from photograph to photograph studying them while coltrane didnt say a word but merely sat on a stool at the entrance to the living room sipping wine studying them but the project was devoted to more than just packards houses interspersed among the time warps were other mounted photographs which beginning with the heartbreaking depiction of diane recorded the emotional encounters coltrane had experienced while retracing packards steps jennifer shook her head in wonder daniel looked at coltrane as if seeing him with new eyes this is the best stuff youve ever done jennifer said i have a hunch you wont mind talking about these pictures no coltrane said relief ebbing through him i wont mind talking about them at all well i was wrong about one thing jennifer said i thought this would be suitable for a feature in the magazine youve changed your mind definitely theres too much here and i dont want to leave anything out for the first time theres going to be a special issue i dont know what to say i do daniel said whered you put the wine coltrane laughed jennifer kissed him im so proud of you as she and daniel returned to the photographs coltrane noticed the red light blinking on his answering machine he pressed the play button his stomach tightened when a chorus sang mournful classical music again jennifer looked up from a photograph he had taken of the elderly black woman at the trailer court this is annoying i can think of less polite ways to put it coltrane said i wish i had one of those machines that shows the number of whoevers calling then i could phone the jerk back and play music to him except id have trouble finding music as weird as this verdi isnt what id call weird daniel didnt glance away from the photo of the young black woman pushing a boy in a swing coltrane had juxtaposed it with the faded photo of his mother pushing him in the same swing twentyfour years earlier verdi you ought to get more culture if you listened to something other than jazz if you went to those classical concerts i invited you to the music on your answering machine is by verdi italian thats why i cant understand what theyre singing well in this case what theyre singing isnt italian its latin let me hear the music again coltrane pressed the repeat button no doubt about it daniel said thats from the requiem the music for a funeral mass jennifer asked hear what theyre singing dies irae day of wrath thats definitely from the requiem coltrane gestured in frustration but why would anybody phone me every day and play music for a funeral a prankster with a sick sense of humor dies irae whats that mean something about a day daniel said if youre really curious i can go next door and get my copy of the requiem the liner notes have a translation it was a vinyl lp coltrane saw when daniel returned daniel was fond of lecturing that vinyl had a richer more lifelike sound than the cd format bernstein conducting domingo soloing this is one of the best just tell us what the latin means daniel right daniel looked mischievous as if he knew he was making them impatient it should be he unfolded the doubleplatter album and ran his index finger down the translation on the inside here dies irae the day of wrath the day of anger will dissolve the world in ashes how horrid a trembling there will be when the judge appears and all things are scattered daniel lowered the album well i guess a little fear of the lord is a good thing at a funeral keeps our priorities straight but theres no hidden message that i can figure out coltrane said what about you jennifer the only message i get out of it is that id better say my prayers more often we were right the first time its just a prankster with a weird sense of the phone rang hello verdis requiem blared at him again youre never home a thickly accented gravelly voice said coltranes skin tingled what who is this the judge mitch jennifer was alarmed by the look on coltranes face whats the matter now listen to me you sick bastard coltrane said into the phone quit calling me and therell come a time when youll wish with all your heart that the only thing i had done was phone you the voice sounded like pebbles being rattled in a cardboard cup jennifer is correct about saying her prayers more often coltranes scalp prickled how did you know she said the day of wrath will dissolve the world in ashes when i appear and all things are scattered coltranes entire body felt as if an electrical current had surged through him he spun to stare at the living room his alarmed expression making jennifer and daniel more startled youve got a microphone in here the voice chuckled its crustiness reminding coltrane of a boot stomping dried mud oh ive got much more than that in your apartment go up to your bedroom ive left you some souvenirs the connection was broken coltrane felt suspended between heartbeats abruptly he dropped the phone and raced toward the stairs in the kitchen mitch whats the matter who was that jennifers urgent questions overlapped with daniels their footsteps pounding on the stairs behind him he reached the upper corridor and ran past the door to his darkroom then the door to the bathroom at once slowing afraid of what he would find in his bedroom when he looked cautiously in what greeted him made him feel as if a hand was pressed against his chest and was shoving him backward the bedroom was arranged in a parody of the display he had set up for jennifer and daniel downstairs in the living room photographs were everywhere on the floor the bureau the bedside tables the bed itself eightbytens the same dimension as the photographs from packards view camera but even at a distance coltrane could tell that these photographs were too grainy to have been taken with a view camera they were blowups from a mm negative what they depicted though made up for their lack of detail jennifer and daniel crowded behind him whats going on daniel asked who was that on the phone coltrane didnt answer muscles compacting he entered stepping between photographs staring down then all around this is insane jennifer said image after image showed coltrane setting up the view camera taking photographs of the houses in packards series or of the people and places he had encountered as he followed packards route there was even a photograph of him and jennifer saying goodbye to diane in the rhododendronlined driveway of her parents estate another showed coltrane at the trailer court in glendale as he photographed the young black woman pushing the boy in the swing wherever he had gone in the last two weeks someone had been following him taking his picture when we said goodbye to diane i didnt notice anybody on the street taking pictures of us jennifer said with a telephoto lens the camera could have been a block away he turned toward the bed toward images of a backhoe dropping jumbled bones into a rock pulverizer while a bandylegged barrelchested beefyfaced man watched his huge hands braced on his hips his drooping mustache raised in a smile of satisfaction these are the photos i saw in newsweek daniel said no coltrane said you never saw these photos this set was never published fearing he might throw up he took a tentative step toward a dismaying object braced against the beds headboard all the photographs seemed to be arranged to draw attention to that spot they couldnt have been published the negatives were in a camera i lost on a cliff while i was trying to escape from this camera someone found it and developed the negatives he stared again at the photographs of the barrelchested man watching with delight as the rock pulverizer spewed out chunks of bones the freshly healed wound in his side throbbed dragan ilkovic coltrane said what did you say daniel asked fire seemed to shoot through coltranes nervous system we have to hurry jennifer grab all these photos daniel get the ones downstairs now it isnt safe in here we have to get out the crimson rays of sunset haloed six sweatslicked men playing basketball they dodged ducked and pivoted with amazingly deft precision throwing leaping dunking matching one anothers points four of the men were black all were approximately coltranes age midthirties they played with such concentration and enthusiasm that the past and the future didnt matter only now and only the game coltrane watched from concrete bleachers on the street side of one of the many basketball courts at muscle beach in venice behind him bicyclists and roller skaters floated by ahead the sunsettinted ocean silhouetted the players it was like watching expressionistic dancers on a stage a moment later the sun slipped a degree too low shadows deepened and the players faced one another bending forward hands on their knees chests heaving as the ball rebounded off the backboard missed the hoop and bounced among them cant hit a hoop i cant see never mind the hoop i cant see the ball hey you cant quit now were only two points from beating you next time bro its your turn to buy the beers its always my turn as the group headed past a palm tree toward the walkway one of the black men said go on without me theres a guy over here i have to talk to see you next week joking with one another comparing shots the group avoided two skateboarders and headed toward a café along the walkway coltrane stood from the empty bleachers and approached the black man reached into a gym bag pulled out a towel and dried the sweat on his face greg mitch they shook hands coltrane was six feet tall the man he had come to see was two inches taller they were both about the same weight two hundred pounds coltranes hair was curly and sandcolored long enough in back that it hung to his collar in contrast the man he spoke to had wiry dark hair cut close to his scalp both had strong attractive features but the black mans were broader and gave the impression of having been carved from ebony whereas coltranes seemed chipped from granite just happened to be passing by greg looped the towel around his neck and tugged his sweatshirt from his chest a cool december breeze gusted off the ocean and made coltrane shiver dont i wish i phoned your house your wife told me where youd be i get the feeling you didnt drop by to catch up on old times afraid not coltrane held up a box got something i want you to look at greg frowned at the box redirected his attention toward coltrane and sighed come on up to the house lois will be glad to see you again you can stay for supper i dont think thats a good idea oh the kind of trouble ive got you dont know what i might bring with me to your house gregs last name was bass he was a lieutenant in the los angeles police department coltrane had met him two years earlier when the la times sunday magazine had asked him to do a photo essay on the police departments threat management unit the only lawenforcement squad in the united states devoted exclusively to stalkers what had attracted the la times was that because of the clandestine nature of their harassment stalkers were sometimes described as invisible criminals the idea was that a photographer as inventive and accomplished as coltrane could perhaps make some stalkers very visible coltranes liaison at the threat management unit had turned out to be greg and over the course of the assignment they had developed a friendship coltrane earning gregs respect by being of considerable help to one of the many terrified women the threat management unit was trying to protect by lying in the bushes outside the womans home several nights in a row coltrane had managed to capture a picture of the womans heretoforeunknown harasser a man she had dated twice five years earlier as he dumped gasoline on the womans lawn at three in the morning the stalker had gone to prison for eighteen months since then coltrane had helped greg on three other cases they sat facing each other in the back booth of a tavern both of them sipped budweiser neither of them speaking while greg finished assessing the last photograph thought about them stacked them and put them back into the box so basically youre telling me that this guy thinks its cool to tie peoples hands behind their back with baling wire line them up facing a pit and shoot them in the back of the head so they topple forward into the pit and nobody has to move the bodies to bury them sounds like he and hitler would have been pals except that hitler was a nazi ilkovic came out of the communist system when bosnia was part of yugoslavia so stalin would probably be closer to his ideal politics as an excuse for mass murder greg shook his head ilkovic worked his way up through the communist system learned english and was trained to be a diplomat for a time he was stationed at the yugoslavian consulate in london as thugs go hes very sophisticated not to mention calculating as soon as the soviet system collapsed he went back to what is now bosnia and took advantage of the civil war he gained his power base by urging the serbs not to just win the war but to exterminate the enemy i suppose he figured that after the serbs killed all the muslims he could get them to eradicate the other ethnic group in the region the croats then the serbs would control all of bosnia and since he controlled the serbs meanwhile bosnia became his private killing field i bet he loved every minute of it dragan ilkovic quite a mouthful and youve got this bastard after you because you took pictures that linked him to war crimes and ruined his chances of controlling bosnias government its kind of hard to rule a country when youre in prison because of crimes against humanity coltrane said except he isnt in prison greg said hes here in los angeles looking to pay you back ambulance attendants hurried to push a young man on a gurney into the emergency ward the young man had an oxygen mask over his face his chest which wasnt moving was covered with blood coltrane got out of their way then followed through electronically controlled glass doors that hissed shut behind him two nurses and a physician rushed to the young man on the gurney guiding him into a cubicle tugging a curtain shut casting urgent shadows as other nurses and physicians worked on other patients in other cubicles and more patients huddled on benches along the walls can i help you sir coltrane turned toward a wearylooking bespectacled woman who wore a green hospital top and held a clipboard are you hurt do you need her voice dropped as she studied him and couldnt see anything obviously wrong im looking for dr gibson at that moment daniel his red hair emphasized by the greens he wore came out of a cubicle and walked quickly toward a counter in the middle of the area there i have to see him for a moment sir youll have to wait your turn there are patients ahead of you who daniel hearing his name daniel turned mitch frowning he came over what are you doing here i need to talk to you daniels frown deepened with puzzlement i just finished with a patient he cocked his head toward the approaching wail of an ambulance outside typically busy saturday night thisll have to be quick daniel guided him through a door and into a stairwell the door banged shut echoing i wont be home for the next couple of days maybe weeks coltrane said i wanted you to know so you wouldnt worry a photo shoot daniel sounded hopeful no the guy who broke into my apartment while we were out this afternoon i was afraid youd say that i just got finished talking to a friend whos with the lapd antistalking unit he says if this guy could plant a bug in my living room whats to stop him from planting a bomb im not supposed to go home not until this creep is caught but who knows how long where will you go im not sure if i need to reach you ill leave a message for you here at the hospital the reason i didnt leave a message this time daniel is that my friend also had some advice for you i wanted to give it to you in person daniel looked uneasy i dont think you should go back to your apartment coltrane said this guy can as easily break into your place as mine he might decide to pay you a visit and find out where ive gone but you havent told me where youre going he doesnt know that tell the hospital you need some time off take a lot of streets at random and watch for any headlights following you when youre sure youre safe get out of town maybe in a couple of days my friend will have caught him and you can come back but daniel listen to me no matter how much youre tempted dont stay with a friend daniel paled as he understood the implications i didnt do anything wrong coltrane said but i cant tell you how sorry i am that i put you at risk the stairwell door banged open doctor we need yes daniel hurried back to the din of the emergency ward jennifer he looked back what about im on my way to warn her when the headlights of a car veered off beverly glen boulevard onto knob hill drive coltrane watched from where his blazer was parked among other cars in the darkness at the side of the road in this secluded residential area of sherman oaks there was almost no traffic at p m even on a saturday this was only the third set of lights in the past fifteen minutes identifying jennifers bmw as it slowed on a curve and passed him coltrane redirected his attention toward the entrance to this street one minute became two then three after five minutes coltrane decided that if ilkovic had been following her other headlights would certainly have appeared by now picking up his car phone he pressed the numbers for jennifers car phone let it ring three times and broke the connection the signal to jennifer that it was safe for her to keep descending into the valley and wait for him at the sherman oaks recreation center he didnt speak on the car phone because greg had emphasized how easy it was for someone to use an audioscanner to overhear conversations on that type of phone the recreation centers arclit parking lot was almost deserted as coltrane pulled up next to jennifers bmw her blond hair was suddenly visible catching the glare of the security lights as she scrambled into his blazer she hugged him tightly youve got me scared to death whats going on why the pay phone why did you ask me to meet you here coltrane had called her at home in marina del rey and told her to go to a specific phone booth near the docks where he had gone earlier and noted the number when shed had enough time to get there he had called from another pay phone in the area telling her the route he wanted her to drive you think my phones tapped i assume mine is coltrane said hell my apartments bugged so why not my phone why not daniels why not yours coltrane summarized his conversation with greg were away from our homes so much getting in and bugging our phones wouldnt be hard to do its a logical thing for ilkovic to try to keep pressure on me by knowing everything im up to hating what he had to say next coltrane hesitated greg says that ilkovic might be tempted to use you to get at me jennifer looked at him sharply he thinks youre at risk he says you ought to stay away from your condo for a while what he says we ought to keep away from each other when ilkovic cant figure out where ive gone where youve gone im going to disappear jennifer when ilkovic cant figure out where hell probably follow you hoping that youll lead him to me or he might decide to do worse to force you to tell him what you know even if it isnt anything there isnt a choice youve got to disappear too jennifer pressed her hands against her stomach i thought i was scared driving over here but thats nothing compared with what im feeling now my god theres got to be a where do you plan to hide coltrane didnt answer im going with you jennifer said but you just heard me explain it makes more sense for both of us to disappear together that way we dont have to worry if hell be following me he wont be able to use me to get at you well both be safe while your friend tries to catch him im not sure that mitch this isnt about crowding you its about survival jennifer rushed into the airport while she bought tickets for america wests shuttle to las vegas coltrane left his car in the parking garage out of breath they met at the gate as the straggle of latenight passengers was boarding placing himself at the end of the line coltrane checked to make sure that no one followed them into the aircraft only after the jet pulled away from the terminal did he breathe easier i need a drink jennifer said me too but im afraid ill have to settle for coffee we need to be awake for quite awhile the jet arrived in vegas at they hurried to the america west counter and bought tickets on the next flight back to los angeles by the time they reached the gate the shuttle was already boarding lord i hope this fools him jennifer said i dont see why it wont work coltrane said if ilkovic did manage to follow us to the airport we know he didnt get on the plane with us he has no way of figuring out we caught the next flight back to la as far as hes concerned were in vegas and thats where he has to search for us but what about when we get to la jennifers usually bright eyes dimmed with exhaustion where will we hide a hotel thats the logical choice but coltrane had another idea although he didnt tell her their plane reached lax at a van took them to the avis lot where a weary clerk gave coltrane documents to sign a midsize car nothing flashy coltrane said a saturn all right perfect with so many saturns on the road nobody would notice another one the dashboard clock showed as they drove out of the lot the streetlights hurt coltranes eyes using la cienega boulevard he headed into the heart of the temporarily quiet city jennifer yawned what hotel are we going to use greg doesnt want us to go anyplace thats fancy where well attract attention when we check in without luggage i know a couple of quiet places in west hollywood jennifer yawned again as long as its got a decent bed well be a little while getting there why dont you close your eyes and go to sleep without traffic coltrane made good time reaching his destination at he got out of the car unlocked the front door and pressed buttons on an entryway monitor that disarmed the security system to the left he stepped into the singlestall garage and pressed a button that activated the door opener as the overhead motor rumbled and the door rose he returned to the car pausing when he saw that jennifer had wakened groggy she rubbed her eyes are we there is this the hotel yes but its not exactly a hotel jennifer concentrated to focus her vision gaping through the windshield when she realized what she was seeing the glare of the headlights revealed a house that resembled a castle its coralcolored stucco lovely even when harshly lit the edges of its parapets trimmed with green copper strips that glinted in the shape of precolumbian arrowheads here she asked in disbelief yes coltrane said packards house five but this is crazy jennifers voice echoed in the empty house we dont have a right to be here the neighbors will think we broke in theyll call the police this late i doubt anybody noticed but just in case we wont turn on the lights coltrane said tomorrow morning ill go around to the neighbors and explain that im buying the place that the estate let me move in a little early he paused on the entryways landing peering toward the darkness of the bottom floor the vault was down there and he had no intention of going in that direction upstairs a nightlight guided the way to the living room despite shadows the white walls and hardwood floor looked clean and pure myriad windows along the back wall enhancing a glow from streetlights and stars but suppose the neighbors dont believe you jennifer said suppose the estate gave them a number to call if anything seemed wrong the estate wont have a problem how can you be sure before i phoned you tonight i called packards assistant while the realtors getting the paperwork ready its okay for us to stay here thats how i got the code for the security system and we dont have to worry about ilkovic he doesnt know about this place but he followed you to all the houses you photographed not this one coltrane said when i saw the photographs he took of me something seemed missing later i realized what it was there wasnt any photograph of me at this house he didnt follow me that day you cant be sure his camera might not have been working that still doesnt make a difference even if he did follow me as far as he knows this is just one more house in packards series he has no way to tell im planning to buy it granted i went back there yesterday with you and daniel but we definitely know ilkovic didnt follow us then because while we were gone he was in my bedroom setting up his surprise he cant know im interested he doesnt have the slightest reason to suspect id hide here tonight clouds must have obscured the stars because the room became darker you feel that certain jennifer said otherwise i wouldnt have come you just cant keep away from this house hey its better than staying in a hotel is it what kind of hold does packard have on you even with sunlight streaming through the windows they managed to sleep until almost eleven jennifer stood awkwardly and rubbed her back ouch coltrane knew what she meant from sleeping on the hardwood floor his neck felt as if hed been karatechopped you really know how to show a girl a good time jennifer said rummaging through a bag of toiletries that coltrane had bought at a convenience store on the way from the airport she pulled out toothpaste a toothbrush and a bottle of shampoo salvation dont forget the doughnuts i bought if i werent so hungry i would really this would be paradise if only we had clean underwear her sarcasm made him chuckle some towels wouldnt hurt she added lets make a supply run down to hollywood boulevard first things first though id better speak to the neighbors in that case youre going to need this jennifer handed him shaving cream and a razor by early afternoon they returned with a fresh change of clothes a coffeemaker a few dishes and pans and enough food to last them a couple of days they scanned the street but didnt see anyone who aroused their suspicion they felt encouraged when they found that the alarm system was still engaged but they didnt relax until they had searched the house except for the vault which coltrane had locked after showing it to jennifer and daniel the previous day and which coltrane assured himself remained that way only then did they carry in their purchases coltrane had never been much for christmas decorations but saying that he might as well make the house a home he had bought a twofoottall artificial christmas tree that had ornaments attached to it he placed it in the middle of the living room and spread out two sleeping bags all the comforts he said they showered and put on jeans and pullovers they had bought then they made coffee and munched on bagels topped with smoked salmon sliced tomato cream cheese and capers im beginning to feel like a human being jennifer stretched dont move whats wrong that pose is too good to coltrane had kept his nikon and his photographs when he abandoned his blazer at the airport he snapped her picture beautiful i hate to say this then youd better not no youll want to hear it this house is beginning to appeal to me the space and the light jennifer nodded i imagine it with art deco furnishings that would have been the style when this place was built i wonder what it looked like when were you serious about wanting to rip out the vault and restore the house to its original design top of my list then maybe what are you thinking ill be right back jennifer said where are you going the garage when we carried the groceries in i noticed something coltrane raised his eyebrows with interest when she came back with a long cardboard tube this was on a shelf jennifer said whoever moved everything out of here was meticulous no junk left behind nothing except for this youre thinking it might not be junk when my parents bought an old victorian five years ago over on carroll avenue jennifer referred to an area near echo park that was famous for its victorians they found a tube like this in the garage coltrane didnt understand what she was getting at the tube contained the houses original blueprints jennifer explained youre not suggesting its a logical place to leave them for a new owner she opened the tube and upended it gently pulling out its contents coltrane stared at a set of tightly rolled sheets of thick bluetinted paper they were faded and smelled musty with age helping her spread them out on a clean section of the counter he marveled that the detail of the diagrams and notations was still visible by god he ran his finger down the top sheet stopping at a mattedoff section on the lower right side that indicated the name of the architect and the year the house had been built lloyd wright as much as i can tell jennifer studied the entrance to the vault then shifted her gaze to the blueprints there was a bedroom here thats what packards assistant said its dimensions were the same as the garage above it no that doesnt sound right coltrane said how come the garage has room for only one car typical of the thirties but the vault seems bigger almost the size of a double garage so the renovation was more like an addition jennifer said i could be wrong i felt a little queasy in there well i felt the same and ive never been claustrophobic the vault cant be that much bigger than the garage if we both felt hemmed in jennifer checked a detail on the blueprints the garage is fifteen feet square since we dont have the blueprint for the renovation i guess theres only one way to tell how much room was added pace it off have you got the key jennifer unlocked the door and pushed it open as cool air cascaded out the darkness made coltrane shiver ah if you dont mind ill wait out here since when have you been claustrophobic only when im in that vault reaching to the left jennifer flicked the light switch on the inside wall an oppressive overhead glare made coltrane squint seeming to reflect off the concrete floor revealing the stark gray metal library shelves one two jennifer entered pacing the vault definitely bigger she said when she came back the garage is fifteen feet wide but this is twentyfive closer to thirty coltrane said what do you mean he gestured toward a corridor next to the vault i paced it from the outside thirty are you sure we must have paced it differently probably we did but since my feet are longer than yours im the one who should have the lower number you should have needed more paces and have had the higher number were doing something wrong lets try it again this time you go in are you kidding me ive never seen you so timid shes right coltrane thought whats the matter with me i have to get over this ignoring pressure in his chest he braced himself the glare became harsher the temperature cooler the air thicker as he forced himself to enter the vault one two he restrained himself from walking fast its only a windowless room he told himself he breathed easier when he returned to jennifer in the welcoming light i got more or less what you did twentyfive feet then were still doing something wrong jennifer frowned i paced off the corridor and got what you did thirty feet how can a room be she spun in alarm somebodys in the house as the front door clicked shut coltrane rushed toward the stairs above him the landing creaked a figure appeared hands raised i didnt mean to startle you the man said coltrane faltered his heart no longer hammering as he took in the red jacket that duncan reynolds wore its just that we werent expecting visitors coltrane said duncan put a key in his jacket i was in the neighborhood so i thought id drop by and see how you were settling in id have phoned but there isnt a phone exactly i dont want to intrude if this is a wrong time not at all coltrane said i want you to meet my friend jennifer lane jennifer this is randolph packards assistant duncan reynolds they shook hands still calming herself jennifer smiled it must have been fascinating working for a genius fascinatings one word so is hairraising i finally decided to call it an adventure can i get you some coffee coltrane led him up to the living room duncan surveyed the sleeping bags next to the small artificial christmas tree this looks like an adventure about the coffee no thanks but something stronger would do nicely im afraid we didnt buy duncans face drooped but we did pick up some wine jennifer said duncan brightened forgive the pun but any port in a storm white or red whatever you have more of jennifer headed to the left toward the kitchen we found a set of blueprints in the garage coltrane said yes i put them there duncan said i discovered them when i was going through randolphs things at the newport beach house i decided to bring them here before they got mislaid you didnt happen to come across the blueprints for the renovation did you duncan shook his head no ive still got a lot of things to sort through why just curious theres a discrepancy that puzzles us come into the kitchen jennifer called excellent duncan said we can talk while you pour they crossed through the dining room its chromium beaddraped walls reflecting light and entered the sunbathed kitchen it had a butcherblock island in the middle where jennifer uncorked the wine paper cups will have to do its the only way to go when youre roughing it and i hope you like cabernet sauvignon i have what might be called an indiscriminate palate it all tastes good to me duncan sipped and nodded perfect you mentioned a discrepancy we were trying to figure out how much space had been added when the vault was installed coltrane said we kept getting conflicting numbers do you have any idea when the vault was put in duncan took another sip all i know is it was here when i came to work for randolph in was he living here then no if he ever lived in this house i never heard him say so but he certainly adored it with the exception of the vault he went to elaborate lengths to keep the property including the landscaping exactly the same as it had appeared when he took his photograph of it in too bad the furniture was gone by the time you saw the interior why jennifer asked it was the same furniture that was in the house when he photographed it you cant be serious coltrane leaned forward you mean imitations right the original furniture would have fallen apart by now not this furniture duncan wiped a purple drop from the edge of his mustache the furniture was designed by warren mcarthur a noted modernist of the thirties his work is characterized by shiny metal and glass the supports were tubular everything glinted of course the cushions eventually had to be replaced but randolph was careful to replicate the textured red fabric here and there he also had some mies van der rohe chrome tables you can understand why the furniture was removed those tables and sofas have considerable value christies is going to auction them i want you to bring them back coltrane said duncan almost spilled his wine bring them back i want to buy them but youre talking about an enormous price i want the house to be exactly as it was jennifer looked astounded and i think it would be great if you could get me more information about the houses history coltrane said you told me packard used this for an office a darkroom and an archive but who lived here before he owned it his biographers say it was designed for a film producer named winston case is that who packard bought it from or did somebody else own it in the meantime what about after he bought it did someone else live here then but it was all so long ago why should it matter coltrane didnt have an answer the last rays of sunset again outlined six basketball players on a court at muscle beach in venice the same court where coltrane had met greg the previous day almost exactly twentyfour hours ago coltrane thought seated with jennifer on the same level of the same concrete bleacher at the sideline an eerie sense of doubling overtook him greg ought to be here anytime now coltrane said an ocean breeze made jennifer shiver im surprised he didnt ask you to meet him at the police station he lives only a few blocks away i guess he figured it would be more convenient to meet down here the sun dipped into the ocean its crimson now so faint that the players stopped coltrane overheard their conversation gibes at one another plans to get a beer promises to meet next week déjà vu made him squirm the players headed along the walkway the sun eased below the horizon skateboarders became fewer as the temperature cooled streetlights struggled to dispel the darkness hes fifteen minutes late coltrane said maybe he got held up by a phone call greg has a thing about being on time ive never known him to keep me waiting another fifteen minutes passed it must be an awfully long phone call jennifer said so what do you think we should do i guess we dont have any choice except to stay here until is that him coltrane looked toward where jennifer pointed a heavyset man wearing sneakers jeans and a leather windbreaker stepped from behind a shadowy wall next to the court and approached them no uneasy coltrane stood does he look like ilkovic i cant tell in the dark at this distance he doesnt have a mustache but ilkovic might have shaved his they stepped from the bleachers he keeps coming in this direction jennifer said then why dont we walk in that direction they started past palm trees heading up the beach the man followed shit coltrane said they started to run wait the man called they ran faster mr coltrane stop lieutenant bass sent me they faltered as the man hurried to catch up coltrane turned straining to see in the shadows wondering if he was making a mistake his misgivings lessened when a streetlight revealed the badge the man pulled out i work with lieutenant bass in the threat management unit the man said tall he had a solidlooking body his chest shoulders and upper arms developed like a weight lifters his brown hair was trimmed to almost military shortness his matching brown eyes had a nononsense steadiness sergeant nolan coltrane shook hands with him not surprisingly nolans grip had force then introduced jennifer greg couldnt get here coltrane asked its complicated he didnt think it would be safe jennifer visibly tensed ive been watching you to see if anybody else is watching you nolan said and apprehensive coltrane glanced around it was hard to tell in the darkness but the beach seemed deserted for the first time nolans gaze lost its steadiness why dont we get out of the open we need a place to talk the restaurant had a cheery christmas atmosphere a tinselcovered tree in a corner strings of winking lights on the walls tiny wreaths around candles on the tables all of which were lost on coltrane as he and jennifer sat across from nolan again coltrane endured an intense overlapping of time as though he still sat across from greg the previous evening okay the good news first nolan said lieutenant bass contacted the fbi who in turn got in touch with the un warcrimes tribunal interpol got involved theyre trying to find how ilkovic left europe the fbis doing the same on this end to learn how he entered the country theyre checking the passenger manifests on all flights that came into this country from europe during a oneweek time frame from when you left bosnia to when you started getting the messages on your answering machine the un tribunal has asked various european nations to compare the names on those airline manifests to lists of sanctioned passport holders the fbis doing the same with passports issued by the united states if we can determine the alias ilkovic is using thatll take us a long way toward tracking him down assuming he keeps the name he traveled under coltrane said assuming nolan looked uncomfortable meanwhile an lapd bomb squad went through your town house behind your furnace they found enough plastic explosive to level half the block thats the good news jennifer murmured after the bomb was disabled a team of lapd electronicsurveillance specialists went through your home ilkovic had microphones in every room i hope you didnt discuss any secrets there coltrane felt as if a chunk of glass was wedged in his throat they also found microphones in your friends place next door nolan said and at your place ms lane jesus she said i dont know what you mean by good news coltrane said i havent heard any so far its very good where did ilkovic get the plastic explosive the microphones where did they come from every alphabetsoup agency you can think of is following those leads a lot of muscle is being flexed to give you help then if everythings so positive why do you look like you need root canal nolan glanced down at his hands then fixed his gaze on coltrane reluctantly continuing the reason lieutenant bass didnt meet you as planned is that you were followed when you went to talk to him yesterday what after you and he concluded your conversation and separated the person who followed you we have to assume it was ilkovic shifted his attention to lieutenant bass are you telling me something happened to greg no lieutenant bass stop calling him that please hes my friend call him greg hasnt been harmed nor has his family coltrane breathed out but last night his home was broken into what that doesnt mean it was ilkovic jennifer tried to sound hopeful it might have been a crackhead breaking in looking for something to steal to sell for drugs unfortunately we know for certain it was ilkovic nolan said the message left absolutely no doubt message coltrane felt pressure behind his ears nolan hesitated before i explain i want you to know how sorry i am about all this so is lieutenant bass greg he wants me to tell you hed have been here to talk to you himself but that would have compromised your safety now that youve disappeared theres too great a risk that ilkovic might be following greg in the hopes that greg will lead him to you sergeant nolan why dont you tell me what youre doing your damnedest not to coltrane had seldom seen anyone appear more uneasy the sergeant glanced down again seemed to muster his resolve looked up sighed and pulled out a walkman from his windbreaker pocket ilkovic left an audiotape on the coffee table in gregs living room coltrane reached but im not sure you want to listen to the copy we made nolan said i dont understand why wouldnt i want to sometime after midnight last night ilkovic went to the hospital where your friend worked oh my god jennifer whispered the nurses and physicians your friend worked with in the emergency ward say he went to the cafeteria to get something to eat around one am he never came back coltrane felt so great a tightness in his chest that he feared he might be having a heart attack the breakin at gregs house occurred around four am nolan said we know that because when he left he threw a lamp through a window so greg would be startled awake a little after four thats when greg found the tape from one until four jennifers voice was taut nolan seemed to be waiting for them to make conclusions thats how much time jennifer shook her head ilkovic had with its daniel on the tape coltranes stomach cramped i deeply regret having to tell you the bomb squad found his body in his living room when they went in to search his town house this morning coltranes mind swirled im going to pass out he thought jennifers hand found his and squeezed he held her feeling her tears mixing with his own after what seemed forever he eased away hardly aware that customers in the restaurant were staring at him because the only thing that occupied his attention was the walkman he reached for it i dont recommend that nolan said greg felt you had a right to hear it if you were determined to but i really dont i have to know the walkman had a set of small earphones hands shaking coltrane put them on he felt disturbingly remote from his body as if he was seeing everything through the reverse end of a telescope with a finger that didnt seem to belong to him he pressed the walkmans play button a scream made him flinch it was the most painridden sound he had ever heard daniel it stopped say a few words to your friend a guttural voice with a slavic accent ordered sounding amused daniels scream reached a new pitch of agony it dwindled and became strident breathing speak to him mitch daniel sounded pathetically weak i didnt tell him a thing you didnt betray him because you dont know anything the guttural voice said but you would have daniel shrieked again on and on communicating agony beyond endurance silence again coltrane had no doubt that he had just heard daniel dying photographer the guttural voice said ive got pictures of the party ill mail them to your home why dont you stop by and pick them up a click was followed by the hiss of blank tape tears streaming down his face coltrane removed the earphones jennifer took them and put them on her normally tan face ashen as she rewound the tape and pressed the play button coltranes throat felt paralyzed theres an echo it sounds like he strained to make his voice work like theyre in a cellar or something which your friends town house doesnt have although it does have a garage underneath nolan said but the garage showed no evidence that your friend was killed there youre talking about blood nolan spread his hands seeming to apologize there would have been a lot of it ilkovic used a knife jennifer yanked off the earphones and jabbed the walkmans stop button her eyes were dilated the black of their pupils so huge that the blue of her irises had almost disappeared ive never heard what kind of monster im not sure theres an answer to that question nolan said ive never dealt with anything like this you need to move to a safe site where we can protect you move a hotel were familiar with a place where we can control the environment and watch you around the clock you mean put us in a trap and make us targets coltrane said it wouldnt be like that at all security would be so tight ilkovic wouldnt have a chance of finding where you were yeah right im serious so am i coltrane said jennifer and i arent going to let ourselves be prisoners in a hotel then we can guard you where youre staying now if you think its more comfortable its safer coltrane said the reason its safer is that nobody knows where it is including the police suppose i told you where were staying what if ilkovic grabbed you what if he did to you what he did to daniel from what i heard on the tape i think ilkovic was right the only reason daniel didnt tell him where i was is that daniel didnt know after great pain a formal feeling comes coltrane remembered having read that in an english class when he was in college at usc a poem by emily dickinson it had impressed itself upon him because it had so perfectly described the emotion with which he most identified grief this is the hour of lead he felt like that now having struggled to maintain his survival instincts to get back to the sanctuary of packards house he had only enough energy left to make sure that the doors were locked and that he and jennifer were alone in shadows he sank onto one of the sleeping bags in the living room after a time he heard jennifer settle wearily next to him the house was so perfectly quiet that he heard her weeping hollowness overtook him he stared up at the murky ceiling absolutely emotionally exhausted but he knew that a further torture awaited him that no matter how much he craved the release he wouldnt be able to sleep he shivered as freezing persons recollect the snow first chill then stupor then the letting go but he couldnt manage to let go daniel he whispered daniel he awoke as exhausted as when sleep had finally overtaken him the faint light of dawn glowed through the windows turning onto his side toward jennifer he groggily noted that she wasnt there he assumed that she must have gone to the bathroom he closed his eyes but when he opened them again and the light was brighter and she still wasnt next to him he sat up worried various explanations occurred to him perhaps she had decided to lie down in another room then why hadnt she taken her sleeping bag with her perhaps she was showering then why didnt he hear the muted hiss of water when he stood his body ached grief racking it the hope that this had all been a nightmare and that daniel was still alive dwindled the more his troubled consciousness took control he glanced at his watch a little after seven perhaps shes getting something to eat in the kitchen he thought but when he checked she wasnt there perhaps she was using the tub instead of the shower in that case the water would already have been run sleeping he wouldnt have heard it but the bathroom on this floor wasnt occupied there was a bathroom on each of the two upper levels however he wondered if she had gone up to one of them to avoid making noise and waking him hopeful he climbed the steps to the next level failed to find her continued to the last level but he didnt find her there either he peered onto the flowerfilled terrace it too was deserted jennifer taking two steps at a time he hurried down to the entryway and stared anxiously toward the bottom level until now the silence in the house had seemed so profound that he had felt reluctant to call her name concerned that she might in fact be dozing somewhere and he would wake her jennifer he called again and again received no answer about to descend toward the vault he decided to look into the garage and see if the rented car was still there but when he raised a hand to press the numbers on the security systems keypad to deactivate the alarm so that he could open the garage door his hand froze because an illuminated message on the keypads display screen indicated ready to arm the security system had already been deactivated why where had jennifer gone breathing rapidly coltrane yanked open the garage door in the reverberating echo he saw that the saturn was where he had left it wild he stared down the steps toward the vault then charged lower fearful that jennifer had somehow become trapped in there but as he reached the bottom about to open the hidden white door that concealed the metal entrance to the vault another door caught his attention across the large open area at the bottom of the stairs one of the french doors that led out to the lap pool that door was open he hurried outside his nostrils tingling from the early mornings chill mist floated over the long narrow rosetinted pool he rushed along it afraid that he might find her facedown in the water oblivious to the glint of dew on flowers and shrubs he studied the ivycovered slope at the back and the privacy wall that capped it jennifer what she appeared around the far left corner his knees became weak with relief is something else wrong coltrane shook his head i couldnt find you i got worried sorry jennifer looked as fatigued as hed ever seen her her blond hair was lusterless i couldnt sleep i thought maybe if i went outside you look cold coltrane put an arm around her she leaned against him dont let ilkovic do this to you jennifer dont let him win she shrugged not that it matters i solved our little mystery coltrane didnt know what she meant the different numbers she shrugged again numbers twentyfive versus thirty at last he realized what she was talking about when we paced the inside and the outside of the vault theres a door around the side to a utility area hoping to distract her coltrane said show me flanked by welltended bushes a door was situated in the middle of the narrow side of the house to the left of the door a window provided an inside view of the corridor next to the vault coltrane understood inside when he had paced down to this window he had thought that the vault occupied the entire length of the corridor when in fact a small area with an outside entrance took up part of the space he opened the door seeing the shadowy outlines of a water heater and a furnaceairconditioning unit youre right mystery solved his voice was flat come on back inside its cold out here at am using a pay phone outside a convenience store in studio city coltrane called the threat management unit jennifer stood next to him in the phone booth her head against his so she could overhear the other end of the conversation now that she had showered and forced herself to eat a little her blue eyes had regained some of their brightness but not much coltrane thought not enough lieutenant bass or sergeant nolan please coltrane said he heard office noises in the background phones ringing people talking then a click and silence as the call was transferred outside the phone booth the rumble of traffic made him press the phone harder against his ear this is lieutenant bass a sonorous nononsense voice said recognizing it coltrane almost smiled pleased to be in touch with someone he trusted greg its mitch gregs voice quickened its bureaucratic flatness gone thank god i was hoping this would be you are you all right shaky no shit listen i cant tell you how sorry i am about your friend coltrane paused a renewed shock of grief jolting through him ilkovic is going to be even sorrier thats the way i want to hear you talk what about your family are they okay they werent hurt but are they okay hell no theyre scared to death ive moved them out of the house i sent them to stop coltrane said what not over the phone what are you talking about i dont trust it this guys too good with microphones youre not seriously suggesting ilkovic could figure out a way to get into the threat management office and there arent many people in your office on sunday he might have pretended to be a janitor are you willing to bet your familys life that he didnt greg didnt answer when he was in your home saturday night he had time to bug that phone too coltrane said did you use it to make arrangements about where to send your wife and kids for a moment all coltrane heard were the background noises in the office jesus greg said dont hang up click on hold coltrane listened to dead silence that stretched on and on and abruptly greg was back on the line ive got a team going out there to search for microphones your family if ilkovic did bug that phone you have to warn them coltrane said but not on this phone the son of a how can i get back to you if he can hear us you cant tell me the number to call greg do you remember when we first met i helped a woman identify a stalker yes you hid outside her house and photographed him pouring gasoline on her lawn in the middle of the night do you remember where she lived i can look it up theres a pizza hut two blocks east of her house coltrane said go to its pay phone give me an hour coltrane hung up and left the phone booth jennifer frowned at him something the matter where did you learn about hidden microphones she asked a couple of times when i was on assignment the cia and i crossed paths coltrane started with her down the exhausthazed street the cia the reference made jennifers eyes widen in beirut there was one operative in particular he showed an awful lot of interest in the photographs i was taking so i worked out a deal with him i promised id make him a better photographer than the agency had trained him to be and in return he had to teach me some of what he knew hold it this isnt the way back to the car where are we going into this sportinggoods store but what do you need in a twelvegauge pump shotgun coltrane carried the shotgun concealed by a leather sleeve back to where they had parked the saturn around the corner from the convenience store in five days after the federally mandated waiting period he planned to come back and pick up a beretta mm semiautomatic pistol that he had also purchased for now the shotgun would have to do he locked it and a box of buckshot in the trunk then headed toward the next block now where are we going jennifer asked down the street that pizza hut are you telling me thats the same yep gregs going to show up there in about thirtyfive minutes i need to get the number of its pay phone the phone turned out to be on the wall to the left just inside the front door a large window provided a view of the restaurants parking area a crowded intersection and a burger king diagonally across the intersection perfect five minutes later when they entered the burger king its air thick with the smell of charcoalcooked meat coltrane discovered that the arrangement was even more perfect than he had imagined standing at the pay phone which was near a window next to the front door he could see across the intersection to the pay phone in the pizza hut the next best thing to meeting in person coltrane said now comes the hard part the waiting all those times you went away on assignment you lived like this not always it depends on where i was sent im beginning to think i dont know you when the time comes watch the street if ilkovic follows greg theres a chance we can spot him and then maybe we can follow him coltrane glanced toward the menu on the wall behind the counter were going to need food in front of us so we dont appear to be loitering they each ordered a burger fries and coffee carrying their tray of food coltrane avoided a booth by the window and instead chose a table one row in less chance that theyd be seen from the street he positioned jennifer so that her back was to the window that way facing her he could appear to be talking to her but would actually be looking past her concentrating on the pizza hut eating slowly which wasnt difficult given the state of their appetites they tried to distract themselves with small talk it didnt work twenty minutes dwindled to fifteen then to ten with five minutes to go coltrane inwardly flinched when a kid with a ring in his nose dumped a tray of crushed wrappers and an empty paper cup into a trash receptacle then picked up the phone no five minutes became zero coltrane placed himself next to the kid hey do you mind im having an important conversation the kid said heres five bucks to have it somewhere else later the kid said into the phone he hung up grabbed the money shook his head as if he thought coltrane was a fool and walked out immediately coltrane picked up the phone shoved coins into it and pressed the numbers that he had written on a notepad on the other end the phone barely had a chance to ring mitch partially concealed coltrane peered across the street toward greg at the pay phone in the pizza hut while youre there why dont you order a medium pepperoni and mushroom for me yeah its definitely you that bastard did bug my home and you were right my office phone and my desk were bugged too if i get my hands on him you mean when dont you greg didnt respond for a moment interpol thinks he used a forged passport under the name of haris hasanovic to fly out of bosnia his route was from tuzla to hamburg to london after that misix got into the act they think he changed his name to radko hodzic but theres no record of anyone with that name applying for a bosnian passport the rest of the slovak countries came up blank as well so did germany the fbi established that radko hodzic arrived in los angeles two days after you did he would have needed ids for radko hodzic to rent a car or a hotel room the fbis checking that or else he switched back to being haris haranovic we thought of that too were checking it or he had a third set of documents and hes somebody else now mitch were trying our best but wheres he getting the electronicsurveillance equipment damn it what kind of explosive did he put behind my furnace where would he have gotten i told you were working as fast as we can a jarring crash made coltrane whirl when he saw that it had been caused by a tray of food that a nervouslooking woman with two pouting children had dropped he still had trouble controlling his breathing greg tell me how to have a nice day well keep trying to find out where he got the microphones and the explosives were also trying to find out where he got those photographs of you developed that many eightbyten enlargements arent common were hoping somebody will remember the order im getting that cold sinking feeling again coltrane said were also pursuing another angle a profiler from the fbi says somebody as twisted as ilkovic often feels compelled to go back to where he terrorized his victims its a compulsion to reexperience the thrill of what he did to them that would explain why he went back to the mass grave in bosnia where you took his picture coltrane stared harder at greg across the smoghazed trafficcluttered street so what does that mean hes going to go back to where he tortured daniel we dont know where that happened but we know where daniels going to be buried the statement made coltrane feel as if a fist had been driven into his stomach he tasted coffee french fries and chunks of hamburger and he fought the urge to throw up daniels funeral he had been so fixated on what had been done to his friend that he hadnt considered what would happen next daniels exwife went out of her mind when she found out hed been murdered greg said for being divorced she sure seems close to him they were talking about getting back together greg didnt say anything for a moment well shes making all the funeral arrangements the visiting hours are tomorrow evening a closed casket coltrane wanted to weep then wednesday afternoon at one therell be the funeral and the burial around twothirty the fbi profiler thinks ilkovic wont be able to resist coming around to relive his triumph all those grieving people itll give ilkovic a thrill to see how much power his actions have theres another reason ilkovic wont be able to resist going to daniels funeral coltrane said i was wondering if youd figure it out a sociopath like him will automatically assume i cant control my emotions enough to stay away hell want to be somewhere at the funeral because hell count on me to be there its his best chance to follow me coltrane mustered the strength to make a decision he absolutely did not want to make so lets give him what he wants are you saying what i think youre saying nobody im close to is safe who will he go after next my grandparents coltrane suddenly realized that he had to warn them im sick of letting him control me its time i controlled him wheres the funeral its too risky for you to fine dont tell me ill look it up in the newspaper st johns church in burbank daniels exwife lives over there the burials at everlasting gardens god i hate the names of cemeteries two days from now coltrane said does that give you and the fbi enough time to button down those areas without making it obvious to ilkovic its a lot of space to cover especially going from the church to the cemetery then lets forget about the church ill show up only at the cemetery itll be more believable to ilkovic by avoiding the church ill look as if im trying to be cautious and then what we cant cover every building that surrounds the cemetery suppose he decides to blow your head off at three hundred yards with a snipers rifle no coltrane said thats one thing im sure he wont do he loves to do his work up close and personal you still havent answered my question then what i let him follow me coltrane hung up returned to jennifer at the table and helped her study the intersection nobody attracts my attention she said i dont see anybody either in the distance greg remained at the pizza hut window the phone pressed to his ear hes making another call jennifer said pretending to i finally told greg i was where i could see him he did a good job of hiding his surprise and not staring in this direction he suggested he pretend to stay on the line a little longer to give us a longer chance of spotting ilkovic if hes around here good idea but it doesnt seem to be helping if ilkovic is in the area hes blending well coltrane said for all we know he shaved his mustache got his hair cut dyed it light brown bought a decent suit and looks like a businessman or he went in the opposite direction made himself scruffy and looks like hes homeless coltrane said in that case for a lot of people he would be invisible gregs hanging up ten seconds later greg came out of the pizza hut and headed around to the parking lot at the side of the restaurant i still dont see anybody who looks suspicious jennifer said lets see if anybody follows greg when he drives away in this traffic everybody will seem to be following him jennifer said even if we do see a car go after him we wont be able to get to our car in time to do anything about it we can try to get the plate number coltrane watched greg take out his key and unlock his car which disintegrated the fireball spewed across the parking lot at the same time the shock wave shattered windows in every direction the force of it threw coltrane and jennifer backward out of their chairs slamming them onto the floor glass spewing over them for a dazed instant his ears ringing but not enough to shut out the wail of children coltrane felt jolted back to when he had been photographing a violencetorn village in northern ireland and an ira bomb had blown a school bus apart straining to clear his mind he sensed jennifer squirming next to him and reached for her are you all right are you hurt dont know chunks of glass had cut jennifers hands and forehead greg coltrane moaned he struggled to his feet then helped jennifer up greg he said with greater force turning toward the glassless windows the intersection was in chaos cars had slammed into one another horns blared drivers peered around in a daze pedestrians lay motionless on the sidewalk beyond in the restaurants parking lot the explosion that had devastated gregs car had blown apart other cars igniting their fuel tanks sending numerous fireballs roaring into the sky black greasy smoke topped the area like a curse greg coltrane said a third time the word coming out as a sob he struggled around a table lurching trying to go through a gaping window have to get to the parking lot have to help greg someone grabbed coltranes shoulders dragging him backward what are you doing jennifer blurted you cant show yourself my friend needs wavering coltrane saw the astounded expression in jennifers eyes and realized that he must sound insane save greg how in gods name was he going to do that when his friend was in a million pieces oh jesus somebody help me a woman screamed coltrane spun toward the farleft corner of the burger king seeing the panic of a grayhaired woman who knelt beside a young girl with a sixinch shard of glass embedded in her right arm blood spurted help me he couldnt count how many times in how many languages he had heard that wail in northern israel after a shiite muslim rocket barrage in chechnya after a russian artillery assault on a rebel village how many times had he taken photographs of victims as doctors and nurses raced across bloodcovered streets help me and how many times had he hurried toward the victims hoping that one of the doctors would understand his desperate english and tell him what to do if he couldnt help greg he was going to help somebody by god in a rush he untied a kerchief from the womans neck and twisted it around the girls arm above the embedded glass the girl who had been trying to stand sank back onto the glasscovered floor hold the kerchief tightly jennifer he knelt beside the girl gripped the shard and pulled it free the girl turned instantly pale blood continued to gush twist the kerchief tighter approaching sirens wailed she needs a pressure bandage the girl had a sweater tied around her waist coltrane tugged it free wrapped the sleeve around the wound and used his belt to secure it tightly the sweater which was blue turned pink but it didnt turn crimson the belts pressure on it was partially sealing the wound thatll buy some time you have to get her to a hospital coltrane told the woman outside the sirens wailed to a stop take her to one of those ambulances hurry even as coltrane said that it became obvious that the woman was in no condition to carry the girl outside but no matter how determined he was to make sure the girl was safe he didnt dare risk carrying her out there himself ilkovic might spot him alarmed by how pale the girl was watching her tremble he realized that the child was going into shock no dont move her we have to lay her flat prop her feet on that overturned chair keep them above her head somebody cover her with something a man in a windbreaker stared you coltrane said take off your jacket cover her in a daze the man complied as other sirens wailed coltrane spun toward a young woman in a jogging suit get to one of those ambulances bring help the direction broke the womans paralysis she scrambled toward the littered sidewalk the moment coltrane saw the woman speak urgently to an ambulance attendant he stepped away we have to get out of here he told jennifer through the back jennifer stared at him as if she had never seen him before where did you get paramedic training coltrane sped around a corner saw a gas station and steered toward a pay phone next to the rest rooms at the side jennifer persisted this isnt the first time youve had to before she could finish her sentence coltrane skidded the car to a stop and jumped out after hurrying to the phone booth he shoved in coins and pressed numbers threat management unit an authoritative voice said give me sergeant nolan this is an emergency im afraid he isnt wait a minute he just walked in coltrane gripped the phone tighter sergeant nolan here gregs dead what im telling you who is this coltrane slow down what are you i made an appointment to talk to him on a pay phone at a pizza hut in century city he told me ilkovic must have followed him while greg was in the restaurant the bastard slipped a bomb under his car it took out half a block hes dead jesus mary and joseph go to gregs house coltrane couldnt stop feeling breathless the sudden change of topic startled nolan what for what are you talking about greg sent a surveillance team over there to look for microphones i need to talk to you we can trust that phone the instant coltrane broke the connection he pulled out a credit card and placed a longdistance call to new haven connecticut to his grandparents although the sky threatened rain and the temperature was in the fifties he sweated as he listened to the phone ring it rang again pick it up coltrane thought it rang a third time a fourth come on come on he thought urgently hello an elderly male voice said grandpa its mitch i you have reached the number for ida and fred the frail voice said were away from the phone at the moment please leave a brief message and well call you back beep grandpa its mitch he said quickly as soon as you hear this take grandma and leave the house go to the police ask them to contact sergeant nolan at the threat management unit of the los angeles police department hell explain whats happening i dont want to scare you grandpa but theres a very dangerous man after me and youre going to need protection dont trust anybody you dont know except the police make sure they help you beep the machine had reached the end of the time limit for the message coltrane hung up and stood tensely motionless in the phone booth debating whether to call back and leave a further message but he didnt know what he would accomplish other than to frighten his grandparents even more than he already had maybe thats a good thing he thought being afraid of ilkovic is a survival skill mitch jennifers voice surprised him he turned youve been staring at the phone for two minutes now are you waiting for someone to call back are you okay first daniel now greg how many others are going to die because theyre close to me as the garage door rumbled shut coltrane got out of the saturn unlocked the trunk and took out the pumpaction shotgun along with the box of buckshot jennifer stepped back from the weapon youre going to have to feel comfortable with this coltrane said youre going to have to learn how to use it jennifer continued to look uneasy it was midafternoon coltrane had driven around the valley taking an erratic route that would have required ilkovic to stay close and make his presence obvious amid the chaos of the explosions aftermath with rescue workers arriving victims being taken away and onlookers milling he didnt think it likely that ilkovic would have managed to see jennifer and him leave the back of the burger king and follow them to the car but coltrane couldnt take anything for granted the first two times he had phoned gregs house someone from the electronicsurveillance team had answered on the third try he had gotten nolan and as alternating surges of grief and anger swept through him he had bitterly told nolan the plan that he and greg had worked out nothings changed im still going through with it i cant sanction this its too dangerous weve already lost greg dont add yourself to the body count well sanctioned or not im going to show up at that cemetery wednesday afternoon so are you going to make sure i have backup or arent you yes thats all i ask give me the cooperation greg would have given i want to give you something else police protection until wednesday hey if i had accepted police protection if id been with greg both of us would have gotten blown up staying on my own is working out fine phone me tomorrow at ten be careful after what happened to greg it had hurt coltrane to say gregs name you be careful taking care was exactly what coltrane was doing now after prying the lid off the box of buckshot he pushed three shells into the slot on the side of the pumpaction shotgun telling jennifer to stay behind him he checked every section of the house including the vault even though the intrusion detector gave no indication that anyone had entered finally he returned with jennifer to the living room and unloaded the shotgun so that he could show her how the weapon worked without any danger that it might go off he held up one of the thumbsized red plastic shells this contains gunpowder and hundreds of lead pellets depending on what you want to shoot but i dont want to shoot anything the pellets come in different sizes the ones in this shell are called buckshot theyre large about the size of bbs when the shell goes off the pellets spew out the barrel and spread into a thirtyinch pattern mitch you might as well save your breath im not so as long as youre aiming in ilkovics general direction you have a damned good chance of hitting him with one of these at close range the pellets would really chew him up now to hold the shotgun jennifer shook her head forcefully i really dont see that grip underneath the barrel put your left hand there then put your right hand here at the thin part of the stock just behind the trigger guard raise the butt of the stock to your shoulder mitch youre not listening to me cradle the stock against the meaty part of your shoulder raise the gun and aim along will you stop coltrane looked at her in surprise how many times do i have to tell you im not going near that thing youre telling me that if ilkovic broke in here you wouldnt defend yourself i dont want to think about it but what if guns scare me to death im not exactly crazy about them either coltrane said then how come you know so godawful much about them coltrane tried to calm himself when the soviets invaded afghanistan i met an arms dealer in west pakistan who smuggled weapons to the afghans i crossed the border with him but not before he insisted i learn about some of his weapons so i could help protect the convoy if there was trouble jennifer stared three days later he was killed in a soviet gunship attack the rest of us buried him under rocks and moved on the photograph of that rock pile and his sons staring at it was reprinted in the new york times it was the start of my career and did you ever have to use any of those weapons coltrane looked away did you what difference does it make it does yes coltrane said i had to use some of those weapons jennifer shuddered i feel like im in a blizzard i dont want to hear any more then you shouldnt have asked now it was jennifers turn to look away remember you had a choice to be on your own but you insisted on hiding with me great jennifer said this is something else we can curse ilkovic for hes got us arguing about guns although their sleeping bags lay next to each other coltrane felt a disquieting sense that he and jennifer slept apart not that he was able to get much sleep preoccupied he lay awake in the darkness staring toward the ceiling he kept thinking of the last thing jennifer had said to him before emotional exhaustion forced them to lie down hiding with you in this house i could almost pretend that were in a secret magical place where ilkovic cant get to us but seeing that gun on the floor next to you reminds me that there isnt any magical place thinking of all the pain and despair he had photographed coltrane quietly agreed it was yet another reason to curse ilkovic after having worked so hard to turn his back on the direction in which his career had been taking him coltrane again found himself enmired in bleakness street smarts and survival skills that he had hoped never again to use were depressingly familiar ilkovic had dragged him back and for that and for daniel and greg and the tension between jennifer and himself and his fears about his grandparents ilkovic was going to pay the silence smothered him his cheeks felt warm he had never associated grief with a fever but now that he thought about it grief was one of the worst illnesses anybody could suffer before he realized what he was doing he stood approached the murky stairway and descended toward the bottom level not bothering to look toward the entrance to the vault he passed the corridor that separated the vault from the darkroom and reached the french doors that led outside to the pool the illumination of stars and the moon made glints on the still water he saw the vague outlines of the nearest shrubs and flowers his cheeks feeling warmer he reached to open one of the doors to let the night air cool him and at once stopped himself remembering that he had to disarm the security system before he went outside besides what if ilkovic had somehow tracked him here it would be foolish to expose himself by leaving the house and what about jennifer what if she woke up and couldnt find him all too vividly he remembered what that dismaying emotion had been like this morning when jennifer had gotten up earlier than he did and he had frantically searched the house at last discovering that she was outside in the back garden i solved our little mystery the different numbers twentyfive versus thirty she had said distractedly it had taken him a moment before he understood what she was talking about when we paced the inside and the outside of the vault theres a door around the side to a utility area yes mystery solved the missing five feet were easily accounted for taken up by an area devoted to a water heater and a furnaceair conditioner its amazing how we ignore the obvious coltrane thought glancing behind him toward the corridor that paralleled the vault it was also amazing how an emotionravaged mind sought distractions there was something about that utility area a thought struggled to surface then sank back into the roiling depths of his subconscious he shook his head unable to clear it glancing at the luminous dial on his watch he saw that the time was ten after two you need to try to sleep youve got only a day to figure out the details of what to do if ilkovic follows you from the cemetery on wednesday his hand cramping on the shotgun coltrane stepped back from the wall of windows and the glasspaneled door about to turn to go upstairs to jennifer he paused as the thought that had struggled to surface made another attempt something about the utility area yes it was deep enough to account for the fivefoot difference between the inside and the outside of the vault but what about how wide was the thought broke free the utility area doesnt stretch all the way along that section of the house he realized when i looked inside it was only about eight feet from left to right but the vaults fifteen feet wide if the utility area takes up eight feet of that whats in the remaining seven feet of the strip along that side coltranes cheeks became cold blood draining from them there wasnt another door on the outside wall that meant if there was a sevenbyfivefoot area farther along the only way to get into it would have to be jesus it was the first time coltrane had ever wanted to enter the vault pulling the key from his jeans coltrane approached the vaults entrance as he opened the outside door exposing the blackness of the metal door he set the shotgun against the wall and inserted the key into the metal doors lock for something so heavy the door swung open smoothly requiring almost no effort for him to push it he reached in to the left brushed his hand against the wall found the light switch and flicked it squinting from the harshness of the overhead lights again the chill of the place overwhelmed him the rows of gray metal library shelves had never seemed bleaker the concrete walls and floor seemed to shrink overcoming the sensation of being squeezed he picked up the shotgun and entered the vault his gaze never wavered from the left section of the opposite wall but he couldnt get there directly he had to walk straight ahead until he reached the last row of shelves then turn left and proceed to the area that held his attention the wall was lined with shelves facing them positioning himself in the middle he glanced to the right behind those shelves and that section of the wall was the utility area but what was behind the shelves and the section of the wall on the left again he set down the shotgun he leaned close to the shelves on the left section of the wall the metal frame that supported them was bolted to the concrete behind them he tugged at the shelves but had no effect they remained firmly in place he ran his hands along the back edges of the shelves crouching then stretching he checked above and below them also along the sides wherever they met the concrete it wont be something difficult he told himself packard was in a wheelchair the old man didnt have the strength for anything complicated or awkward it would have to be at wheelchair height coltrane touched a slight projection of metal at the back of the right side of the shelves something easy he thought he pulled down on the wedge of metal but it didnt budge something simple and he pulled up on the wedge of metal it immediately responded clever he heard the click of metal of a latch being released yes this time when he pulled at the shelves they did budge not a lot not enough to move forward but enough to indicate that they were no longer secured to the wall what else do i have to he shifted to the left side of the shelves crouched at wheelchair height reached to the back where the side met the concrete and touched a corresponding wedge of metal when he pulled it upward another latch snicked free and now the shelves moved smoothly forward seeming to float no matter how rapidly coltrane breathed he couldnt seem to get enough air he stepped to the right out of the way and continued to pull on the shelves their outward movement so smooth that even an aged man in a wheelchair could have controlled them viewing that section of the wall from the side he saw that what had appeared to be solid concrete was actually a concretelike stucco attached to a partition of oak on the left large foldout hinges at the top bottom and middle made the false wall capable of being moved in and out he stepped inside the radiant woman facing him made his heart stop despite her alluring features he almost recoiled in surprise at finding her except that he couldnt his legs were powerless her hypnotic gaze paralyzed him for a startling instant he thought that she had been hiding behind the wall but the face was too composed showing no reaction at having been discovered nerves quivering he stepped into the chamber so drawn that he overcame his fear of being enclosed what he was looking at was an amazingly lifesized photograph of a womans face it hung on the chambers back wall exactly where the womans face would have been if she had actually been standing there indirect light from the vault dispelled many but not all of the shadows in the chamber so that the area where the womans body would have been was partially obscured creating the illusion that her body was in fact there although the photograph was in black and white the absence of color seemed lifelike because of the womans extremely dark hair and dusky features either she spent a lot of time in the sun coltrane thought or there was an ethnic influence possibly hispanic certainly the white lace shawl she wore reminded coltrane of similar garments he had seen in mexico her dark eyes were riveted on where the camera would have been on where coltranes eyes now studied her with the effect that he felt she was peering into him her lush hair hung thickly around her shoulders with such a sheen that it gave off light regardless of how black it was her lips were full their arousing curves parted in a smile the glint from which seemed to shoot from the photograph the combination of her features was typical of classic beauty large eyes high cheekbones a smooth broad forehead an angular jawline a narrow chin she sparkled and smoldered but as captivated as he was by her image he was equally captivated by the medium in which she was presented he had seldom seen a blackandwhite portrait that demonstrated such perfect control of its essential elements of the juxtaposition of darkness and light the technique required more than just a careful positioning of the subject and a precise calculation of light afterward the real work was in the developing process dodging and burning underexposing some portions of the print while overexposing others making the image rather than simply taking a picture coltrane knew of only one photographer who had absolute mastery of this technique even if he hadnt found this photograph in this particular location coltrane would have known at once who had created it randolph packard a noise made him spin startled he grabbed the shotgun about to raise it then immediately checked himself when he saw jennifer at the entrance to the vault thats one of the reasons i dont like guns she said you werent in danger i would have looked before i aimed glad to hear it jennifers eyes were still puffy from sleep when i woke up and didnt find you i got worried this is the last place i expected you to be believe me im surprised but not as surprised as i am by this coltrane pointed our little mystery wasnt as solved as we thought as jennifer approached she ran a hand through her short sleeptousled hair and maybe its not such a little mystery after all coltrane said then explained how he had found the chamber fascinated he watched her peer inside my god she whispered from the side coltrane could see that her eyelids came fully open shes the most beautiful yes who why and a hundred other questions the only thing i know for sure is packard took that photograph the style is unmistakable jennifer appeared not to have heard she raised a hand toward the photograph held it an inch away from the womans face then lowered it this is fabulous i dont understand why he hid it not just it coltrane said look over here to the right metal shelves rose to the ceiling look at all the boxes each was about two inches deep grabbing one coltrane carried it from the shadows toward the lights in the vault in a rush he set the box on a shelf and opened the lid inhaling audibly when he found the womans sultry face peering up at him in another pose how many coltrane flipped through the rest of the eightbyteninch photographs in the box there must be at least a hundred every one of them shows her jennifer brought out another box this one holds sixteenbytwenties she set it on a shelf next to him tugged the lid open and lifted a hand to her chest overwhelmed mitch get over here youve got to see this coltrane quickly joined her the top image twice as large as the ones he had flipped through in the first box gave him his first fullbody view of the woman she was on a deserted beach stepping out of the ocean so that the water came just below her knees one leg ahead of the other her movement languid even though it was fixed in time her bathing suit was dazzlingly white against her tan skin a onepiece costume that was modest by contemporary standards its bottom line level with the top of her thighs its upper line almost to her collarbone inchwide straps hitched over her shoulders but for all its modesty the suit had an arousing effect clinging to her supple body the smooth wet material emphasizing the curves of her hips waist and breasts those curves seemed an extension of the undulation of the waves from which she emerged water glistened on her silken face arms and legs she didnt wear a bathing cap her midnightcolored hair drenched by the ocean was pulled back close to her scalp the contrast with the lush appearance of her hair in the other photographs reinforcing the classical beauty of her high cheeks but what most attracted coltranes attention what mesmerized him in this photograph as in the others was the womans soulinvading gaze jennifer sorted through the other photographs in the box showing coltrane additional images of the woman on the beach the scene changed the woman was on the rim of a cliff with the ocean below her sunlight was full on her face but the other details of the photograph suggested an oncoming storm the waves in the background were tempestuous wind gusted at her hair sweeping it back it also gusted at the white cotton dress she wore blowing it against her body molding the soft pliant fabric to her legs stomach and breasts the scene changed yet again the woman was in a luxuriant garden oblivious to the flowers around her gazing pensively toward something on the right while a fountain bubbled behind her in wonder coltrane glanced back into the chamber toward the numerous boxes there must be his calculations filled him with an emotion that was almost like fear thousands of photographs and every one so far is a masterpiece jennifer said prints of this quality dont just get churned out they take meticulous care sometimes a day for each one coltrane knew that she wasnt exaggerating packard had been legendary for insisting that photographers who didnt develop their own prints were contemptible he had been known to spend a day on one print alone and if the result had even the slightest blemish some faint imperfection that only he would have realized was there he tore the print to shreds and started over everybody thought his output dwindled coltrane said but if anything it increased unimaginably all of the same amazingly beautiful woman packard certainly didnt lack ego coltrane said he went out of his way to let everybody know how great he was when he had a photograph that satisfied even his standards he bragged about it these are among the best images he ever produced instead of showering them upon the world why the hell did he build a secret room and hide them did packard ever use this model in any of the photographs he made public jennifer asked no i have no idea who on earth she is was jennifer corrected take another look at that bathing suit that style hasnt been in fashion since my guess is the forties more probably the thirties how old does she seem to you about twentyfive lets split the difference between decades and say the photograph was taken in do the math shed be in her eighties now assuming shes still alive which the odds are against even if she is still alive she wont be the woman in that photograph that woman exists only in these prints immortality coltrane said the irony wasnt lost on him im not sure ill be alive beyond wednesday and here i am wondering about a woman in photographs taken a lifetime ago he steadied his gaze on the womans whoever you are thank you for a little while i forgot about ilkovic six i have to put myself in ilkovics place coltrane thought if im going to get through this alive i have to imagine what id do in his situation in the dark lying next to jennifer he couldnt get his mind to shut off he strained to fix his imagination on the womans haunting face but it melted into a fleshless skull which swiftly became ilkovics bigboned features terror overcame him he kept worrying about his grandparents he kept wondering how he was going to survive on wednesday maybe nolans right maybe its foolish to offer myself as bait at once a part of him said but the cemeterys one of the few places where ilkovic is likely to show up he wont be able to resist the pleasure of watching daniels mourners hell be hoping to see one mourner in particular me the police and the fbi will have a chance to catch him but what if they fail i have to think like ilkovic is he just going to show up on wednesday and wander around of course not hell assume the police are there hell change his appearance or hide or watch from a distance and whats the safest way for him to figure out where to hide the answer felt like an electrical jolt in a rush coltrane sat up my god hell want to get to the cemetery a day ahead of time so he can scope it out and make sure he protects himself a day ahead of time meant today threat management unit a crisp voice said give me sergeant nolan its urgent whos calling coltrane quickly gave his name he and jennifer were at a pay phone on hollywood boulevard well well just the man i want to talk to i beg your pardon this is fbi special agent james mccoy the voice became crisper i want you and your friend to report here at once why whats the were taking you into protective custody but i already told sergeant nolan i think were safer on our own when he offered protection he was making a suggestion in my case im giving you an order you remind me of my father he liked to give me orders the special agent seemed not to have heard were going to guard you around the clock sure right and how long is that going to last until we catch ilkovic three months six months a year i certainly hope well have caught him in a matter of days is that a fact and how many leads do you have the special agent didnt answer youve got one lead youre hoping hell show up at the cemetery on wednesday the special agent still didnt respond and if im not there coltrane said hell never tip his hand hell go to ground and wait until the bureau runs out of money and patience guarding us and puts us back on the street im afraid i dont agree with your assessment well since its not your life at risk i dont much care what you agree with in that case you leave me no choice theres been a new development you need to know about whats happened its better if i inform you about it in person rather than on the phone tell me now it would be more humane if we discussed this in person humane its about your grandparents the threat management office hadnt changed much since coltrane had last been there two years earlier an additional desk a couple of new computers but it could have been painted scarlet instead of white and have had a pool table instead of filing cabinets for all he noticed when he stormed into the room two detectives their jackets draped over the back of their chairs peered up from monitors they were studying a third man his blue suit coat neatly buttoned crossed the room mr coltrane i want to see sergeant nolan the rigidly postured man was slender with thin lips and narrow eyes he held out his hand im special agent mccoy he glanced toward jennifer who was standing behind coltrane coltrane didnt shake hands i said i want to see sergeant nolan mccoy reached for his shoulder why dont we go over to the federal building and stay away from me mr coltrane i realize youre under a lot of stress but get your hand off me or ill break it the room became still the two detectives braced themselves to stand mccoys mouth hung open in surprise as coltranes face reddened jennifer stepped between them footsteps sounded in the corridor nolan appeared at the entrance to the office his tan blazer slightly oversize to compensate for his weight lifters shoulders getting acquainted mccoy stood straighter more like threatening a federal officer you implied something terrible had happened to my grandparents you refused to tell me over the phone you forced me to risk my life by coming here i hardly think coming to the police qualifies as risking your life mccoy said if it was just a ploy to get me here if theres nothing wrong with my grandparents time out gentlemen did something happen to my grandparents yes nolan glanced toward the floor i keep giving you bad news im sorry coltrane felt as if a cold knife had pierced his heart did you phone the new haven police department yesterday evening mccoy asked coltrane directed his answer toward nolan i called my grandparents several times but i kept getting their answering machine so i got worried and asked the new haven police to send a patrol car over to their house to make sure everything was okay your call was logged just after eight p m eastern time mccoy continued not you him coltrane pointed toward nolan if im going to hear something terrible about my grandparents i want it to be from somebody i know there was a major freeway accident in new haven shortly after your call nolan said most patrol cars were called in to sort out the confusion by the time a car was free to go to your grandparents house it was after eleven at night quit stalling and tell me they found newspapers for friday saturday sunday and monday on the front porch the mail hadnt been picked up either nolan paused uncomfortable they broke in and searched the house your grandparents were in the basement coltrane could barely ask the next question dead yes how nolan clearly didnt want to say it ilkovic hanged them coltrane wanted to scream the reason were sure it was ilkovic nolan said is that federal express tried to deliver a package to your town house yesterday when there was nobody to receive it the driver delivered it to a secondary address that the sender had specified secondary here it arrived at the station in midafternoon but because it was addressed to you it went from office to office after an all clear from the bomb squad until someone in the threat management unit recognized your name coltrane sounded hoarse whats in the package a videotape the room became smaller coltrane glanced from nolan to mccoy to jennifer to nolan he felt as if he was spinning videotape like the audiotape of jennifers voice trailed off i want to see it coltrane said no jennifer said take their word for what happened i have to see it what will that accomplish jennifer asked you know how devastated you felt when you heard daniel on the audiotape thats exactly what ilkovic wants dont give him the satisfaction shes right mccoy said why dont you sit down nolan said can i get you a cup of coffee or let me understand this coltrane said are you telling me you refuse to show me the tape no but then where is it the group exchanged glances mccoy shrugged fatalistically a man ought to know what he wants nolan shook his head in frustration he opened a desk drawer and removed a videocassette theres a room down the hall that has a tv and a video player coltrane waited for him to lead the way but i want to emphasize nolan said that you dont think this is a good idea coltrane said fine now lets go jennifer held back youre not coming no i understand coltrane said as she sank into a chair he placed a hand on her shoulder and squeezed reassuringly take it easy i wont be long he considered her another moment his emotions in chaos then followed nolan and mccoy out of the office in the corridor nolan said you might be wrong about how soon youre going to be back i dont understand ilkovic set this tape for a sixhour recording speed so all six hours are full the shadowy room was narrow it had no windows the tv was a battered nineteeninch with a video player on a shelf underneath it as nolan put the tape into the player coltrane shifted a metal chair in front of the screen solemn mccoy shut the door although the image recorded on slow speed was grainy it struck coltrane with horrifying vividness the yellow glare of an overhead bulb in his grandparents basement how well coltrane remembered the time he had spent down there in his youth showed his grandmother and grandfather standing on tiptoes on a bench their hands were secured behind their backs their mouths were covered with duct tape their aged eyes bulged from panic and from the rope that was tied around each neck secured to a rafter in the ceiling coltranes grandfather was wearing pajamas his grandmother a housecoat both had slippers their bare heels angled upward as they braced themselves on their toes my grandmother has asthma coltrane could hardly speak that duct tape on her mouth must be agony look at her chest heave a guttural voice with a slavic accent spoke from behind the camera are we comfortable are the ropes too tight i hope i havent cut off your circulation coltranes grandfather strained to speak through the duct tape please the guttural voice said my instructions were clear dont make any unnecessary motions coltranes grandfather stopped trying to speak he closed his eyes and seemed to concentrate on controlling his breathing good the voice said now im going to have to be rude and leave you alone for a moment i havent had breakfast im sure you wont mind if i go upstairs and make a plate of those waffles you didnt have a chance to eat blueberries are my favorite id bring you some but youre occupied wood creaked the sound diminishing as if someone was climbing stairs coltranes grandfather and grandmother exchanged looks of desperation and other emotions determination to survive sorrow for what the other was suffering most of all love the image blurred tasting salt coltrane realized that he was crying he wiped his shirt sleeve across his eyes one of the most effortful things he had ever done but not as hard as the effort his grandparents were making to stand on their toes their posture wasnt exaggerated they werent in the extreme stance of ballet dancers on their toes the space between their heels and the bench they stood on was only about an inch and a half nonetheless coltrane inwardly cringed at the thought of the effort they would have to make to stand in that position for any length of time especially because each had arthritis wood creaked but this time the sound grew louder someone returning down the stairs coltranes grandfather and grandmother tensed there the guttural voice said i hope you didnt get into mischief while i was gone coltrane identified the sounds of a plate being set onto something then a knife and fork scraping on it food being cut i cant recall when i ate waffles this delicious the voice said youre a lucky man to have a wife whos such a good cook from behind the duct tape on his mouth coltranes grandfather made a sound that might have been please six hours of torturing them like this coltranes emotions tore him apart im afraid so nolan said i told you this would be rough i think it would be best if i turned it off give me the remote control coltrane aimed it toward the video player and pushed a button that fastforwarded the tape while still allowing him to see the image the picture quality became more grainy streaks ran through it but coltrane was still able to see his grandparents what disturbed him was that normally when a tape was fastforwarded the motions of the people on the screen became frantic and jerky in this case there was virtually no movement at all his grandparents were struggling to stand perfectly still on their toes the counter on the tape machine showed that the elapsed time was fortysix minutes coltrane released the button on the remote control the picture returned to normal if that word could possibly be applied to what coltrane was seeing at first nothing seemed to have changed but as he looked closer concentrating on his grandparents feet he could see that their heels were lower the effort of standing in that position combined with the pain of arthritis had weakened his grandparents they were lowering their weight and as they did the rope that stretched from their necks to the rafter became tighter not taut not yet ilkovic had made sure to leave enough slack that the process would be prolonged in dismay coltrane fastforwarded the tape again except for the increased grain and the streaks nothing seemed to change on the screen at an elapsed time of one hour and fortyeight minutes he again released the button now his grandparents were standing flat on their feet and the rope was tighter and their breathing was more labored but by comparison with the fastforwarded image everything seemed to be in torturous slow motion coltrane could barely imagine what the passage of time must have felt like to his grandparents an eternity the force of the rope made their eyes bulge their faces which had been gray with fear were now red from the pressure around their throats mr coltrane i really think mccoy started to say shut up coltrane pressed the fastforward button when the indicator on the tape machine showed two hours and fiftyone minutes he returned the tape to normal speed and saw a urine stain on his grandfathers pajamas mccoy left the room on the tape the guttural voice said well accidents happen their knees began sagging after three more fastforwards coltrane saw his grandmothers chest stop moving at an elapsed time of his grandfather managed to last until four fortynine photographer the guttural voice said this is nothing compared to what im going to do to you coltranes scream brought mccoy rushing back into the room im going to kill him coltrane screamed im going to get my hands around his throat and other officers rushed in by then coltrane had hurled the remote control at the television screen and was trying to pick up the tv so he could throw it across the room hes going to be at the cemetery today coltrane quivered from the rage that consumed him his voice was strained his vocal cords raw hell need to check out the area before he risks showing up there to look for me tomorrow nolan and mccoy glanced at each other then we have a second chance to grab him mccoy said we have a team at the cemetery right now now coltrane said theyre inspecting it so we know where to place our men tomorrow no get your men away from there what dont you understand if ilkovic sees your men there today hell realize youre anticipating him to be there tomorrow hell back off and go to ground god only knows when hell decide to make another move but theres no other way for us to do this we have to be able to protect you tomorrow nolan said not tomorrow its going to be today what the hell are you talking about call your men off coltrane said what time is it jesus one oclock it might be too late when is daniels funeral tomorrow the same time as now nolan said which means the burial will be around twothirty nerves in turmoil coltrane rushed to stand if i hurry i can get there by then i still dont understand what youre talking about mccoy said ilkovic will want to check out the area today at the same time the burial will happen tomorrow coltrane said it doesnt make any sense for him to see what its like at ten in the morning if the patterns in the area are likely to be different by midafternoon if i can get there by twothirty theres a good chance hell see me its still the same deal mccoy said when he tries to follow you we grab him nothings changed except that weve moved the schedule up twentyfour hours its not the same deal coltrane said if you were ilkovic would you try to follow your target if you saw lawenforcement officers in the area but hows ilkovic going to know who they are nolan raised his hands frustrated theyre not wearing uniforms theyre not going around staring at everybody these men are trained to blend in they look like theyre mourners they look like theyre groundskeepers ilkovic isnt going to spot them the way they look isnt what bothers me coltrane said what do you mean ilkovic is an electronics freak he likes to play with microphones he doesnt need to see your men all he needs to do is listen to them listen your men have to stay in contact with one another right coltrane asked theyre wearing miniature earphones theyve got buttonsized microphones on their sleeves or their lapels of course mccoy said well how hard do you think it would be for someone as clever as ilkovic to get his hands on one of those units set it to the same frequency and overhear what youre planning hes right nolan murmured tell them to turn the damned things off and get out of there coltrane said now then how are we going to protect you mccoy demanded youll be waiting somewhere else where i lead him you have to promise me nolan said if you have even the slightest suspicion that ilkovic knows what youre trying to do get away from there they were hurrying through the police buildings parking garage therell be unmarked cars two blocks in every direction nolan said thats as far back as we can put them and still hope to give you backup for god sake dont take any chances drive straight to where well be waiting for him i still dont like this mccoy said endangering a civilian im volunteering coltrane said but it isnt bureau policy mccoy said i dont have time to clear this with my superiors i want to go on record this isnt sanctioned by the fbi im glad you told me that coltrane stopped where hed parked his car for a while i was beginning to think id misjudged you that you werent the selfserving jerk i first thought you were mccoys eyes widened coltrane turned to jennifer take sergeant nolan and the swat team to packards house explain the layout they wont have time to size up everything on their own before i get back there i hope to heaven ilkovic doesnt move against you before then jennifer said be careful count on it coltrane kissed her just keep reminding yourself by tonight this will all be over hugging herself jennifer glanced toward the police cars in the garage ive forgotten what it feels like to be safe nolan handed him a walkietalkie take this just in case if you need backup in a hurry it wont matter if ilkovic can overhear coltrane was setting out from downtown los angeles when he glanced at the saturns dashboard clock and saw that the time was he realized that he had less than an hour to get to the valley all he could do was hope that the golden state freeway wouldnt be congested his thoughts in a frenzy he accessed the freeway relieved when he saw that traffic was moving easily now that he was on his own he couldnt get over his eagerness instead of being afraid he was filled with anticipation for a moment it puzzled him do you miss dodging bullets in places like bosnia and chechyna so much that you cant wait to put yourself in danger again what i cant wait for is this to end in fact im going to make sure it ends im going to kill him there coltrane thought ive put it in words again what he had screamed after seeing the videotape of what ilkovic had done to his grandparents was exactly what he hoped to do nolan and mccoy had seemed to think that he was exaggerating that he was merely venting his rage they had cautioned him about losing control they had warned him about taking the law into his hands and he had told them yes that he was sorry for overreacting it had all been a lie he couldnt recall ever having been so seized by an emotion not fear he was absolutely released from fear the rage within him as he watched the tape of what ilkovic had done to his grandparents negated his fear it made him feel liberated eager he was so eager that he trembled for what ilkovic had done to daniel greg and his grandparents he was going to make ilkovic pay he was going to trick ilkovic into following him he was going to make ilkovic think he had taken coltrane by surprise he was going to see the big smile on ilkovics face then the frown of confusion when ilkovic realized that coltrane had caught him by surprise it wasnt until coltrane heard the roar of arriving and departing jets that he realized everlasting gardens was near the commotion of the burbank airport as he steered through the cemeterys entrance he became viscerally aware of entering ilkovics territory the hairs on his neck bristled like antenna his survival instincts possessing him to get even with ilkovic he warned himself he had to be as cautious as he had ever been in any of the war zones he had photographed he couldnt take anything for granted driving past tombstones noticing mourners gathered around a casket at an open grave site seeing groundskeepers trimming hedges and mowing grass he wondered if nolan had kept his end of the bargain he thought about the officers who had come here to check the cemetery in preparation for tomorrows surveillance what if some of them hadnt left what if ilkovic had seen them and snuck away and coltrane was wasting his time or what if they had left and it was ilkovic who was pretending to be one of those mourners one thing was certain coltrane couldnt make it obvious that he was searching the area the result would be the same as if ilkovic realized that there were police officers in the area he would suspect a trap and leave it had to seem the most natural thing in the world that coltrane would be at this cemetery today and coltrane knew exactly what his reason for coming here would be he followed a lane around the treed cemetery eventually coming back to where he had entered making it seem that he was trying to orient himself which was actually the truth he passed a solemnlooking building that resembled a church but that didnt have any symbols and would be suitable for services in any religion or perhaps its a mausoleum coltrane thought when he felt that the movement was natural he glanced around appearing to assess his surroundings all the while alert for anyone who paid attention to him no one did his muscles tight coltrane stopped at a building that reminded him of a cottage it had sheds and a threestall garage in back the open doors revealing large riding lawn mowers and other maintenance equipment he locked his car and again glanced around in apparent assessment of his surroundings still no one unusual sprinklers watered a section of the cemetery casting a fragrance in his direction as a jet roared overhead he opened a screen door and knocked on a wooden one he knocked again then studied a sign that read office hours he tried the knob the door wasnt locked easing it open he peered into a compact welllit office and asked anybody here apparently not hello he called what in gods name am i doing he thought for all i know ilkovic is in there he stepped quickly back into the sunlit air only to jolt against someone he spun startled it wasnt ilkovic the dignified grayhaired man was tall and thin he wore a somber suit and touched coltranes arm im sorry its not your fault coltrane tried not to seem uneasy i wasnt looking where i was going i just stepped out of the office for a moment is there something i can help you with yes im looking for a grave site the somber man nodded its always wise to plan ahead step into my office and ill explain our services excuse me coltrane suddenly realized that he had misunderstood that the man was actually asking him if he had come here to buy a grave site no what i meant was a friend of mine is going to be buried here tomorrow ah the man now realized that he had misunderstood i cant come to the burial coltrane said but i thought if i found out where his plot was i could drop by later and pay my respects without having to ask someone from his family to come and show me where he is of course the man said please accept my condolences about your friend thank you coltrane said believe me it wasnt his time if youll tell me what your friends name is the man started toward his office daniel gibson oh the man stopped is something the matter not at all but i dont need to look up your friends name in my records earlier this morning someone else asked me where his plot is i distinctly remember the location someone else yes a phone call like you he said he was a friend who couldnt attend the burial but wanted to know where the grave would be so he could pay his respects later i think i might know him did he happen to have an eastern european accent slavic the man thought a moment i really cant remember i was too busy concentrating on the deceaseds name and his plot number sure maybe ill see him here later possibly one never knows your friends grave site is the longlegged man walked onto the lane and pointed toward the middle of the cemetery toward activity beyond various gravestones two lanes over our maintenance staff is preparing it across the distance coltrane saw the descending claw of a yellow backhoe and heard the rumble of an engine you might want to reconsider going over there we discourage the bereaved from seeing this part of the procedure it might seem unfeeling but it has to be done coltrane said exactly i understand practicality coltrane said thanks for your concern if theres anything else i can do for you ill definitely remember how helpful you were as the man stepped into the cottagelike building and closed the door coltrane stared beyond the various grave markers toward the rumbling backhoe in the distance he got in his car and tried not to glance around as he drove down the lane his stomach churned his palms sweated making his grip slick on the steering wheel had it been ilkovic who phoned wanting to know the location of daniels grave ilkovic would need that information he would have to find out which section of the cemetery to watch around this time tomorrow daniels hearse would arrive his mourners would walk along this lane and gather among the tombstones directing their mournful gazes toward the coffin supported on braces above the open grave of course the mourners wouldnt actually see the open grave coltrane thought as he stopped his car near the clank and rumble of the backhoe there would be a sash of some sort covering the pit probably it would be colored green just as imitation grass would cover the nearby pile of earth that now grew larger as the backhoe deposited another clawful coltranes tear ducts ached as he got out of the car and locked it come on ilkovic get a good look at me i know youre here its twothirty its dressrehearsal time you want to find out where the best view is for tomorrow i bet youre surprised to see me here youre looking sharply around to find out if anybody else is with me like the police youre ready to run at the first sign of trouble but youre hesitating because you dont see anybody whos a threat and you cant believe your luck that i showed up and you wonder what im doing here but in a minute itll be obvious and then you really wont believe how lucky you are the workman on the backhoe glanced with puzzlement toward coltrane as he maneuvered the machines controls and the claw dropped back into the gravesized trench digging up more earth a bitter cloud of exhaust floated from the engine irritating coltranes throat he had never felt so exposed and threatened totally certain that ilkovic was somewhere close watching him but at the same time absolutely confident that for as long as he stood next to daniels grave he was safe ilkovic didnt want to shoot him he wanted to torture him for that ilkovic needed privacy and leisure he certainly isnt going to try to rush up grab me and drag me to his car coltrane thought not in plain sight not when i have a chance of fighting back hell watch and follow hell make his move when he has every advantage but hes still suspicious wondering if he should run coltrane folded his hands in prayer so immersed in sorrow that it took him a moment to realize that his gesture was exactly what was required to make ilkovic understand why he had supposedly come here ilkovic would conclude that coltrane feared it would be too risky to show up at the cemetery the next day that he felt compelled to come a day early to pay his respects and participate in his own private ceremony when he lowered his gaze from the sky the backhoes claw slammed into the trench again gouging up earth unnerved coltrane seemed to be back in his gravelike pit on the slope above the mass grave in bosnia staring through a telephoto lens at an identical yellow backhoe except that it wasnt gouging up earth but skulls and teeth and rib cages and shattered leg bones the overlapping of the past on the present was so powerful that he shuddered and feared for his sanity he watched the backhoe drop its burden a welter of bones onto a pile of earth it was only a pile of earth and the trench was apparently now deep enough for the driver didnt drop the claw back into the trench instead he directed it into a neutral position and drove from the grave rumbling along the lane later coltrane knew someone would come around with a winch to lower a concrete sleeve into the grave to shore up the sides and prevent earth from falling in eyes stinging coltrane stepped between other graves plucked up a few blades of grass and came back dropping the blades into the grave watching them flutter to the bottom i wont forget you daniel when he stepped away he made no attempt to look around as he returned to the car either ilkovic was here or he wasnt either ilkovic would follow or he wouldnt unlocking his car he had the sense that events were controlling him not the other way around when he got in and started the car he was surprised to see that the dashboard clock showed he had been standing there grieving far longer than he had thought i cant let that happen again i cant let myself lose track of time like that i have to pay attention to what im doing but then in a sense that was exactly what had happened he had been paying attention to his grief now it was time to pay attention to his rage the plan he and nolan had agreed upon was that he would lead ilkovic to packards house where nolan and a swat team would be waiting jennifer would come out of the house as coltrane arrived ilkovic would see the two of them and conclude that coltrane hadnt wanted jennifer to go with him to the cemetery that hed needed to be alone with jennifers absence explained and with coltranes hiding place now discovered ilkovic would take time to reconnoiter the area to assure himself that the police werent around they would be in the house but ilkovic wouldnt know that until it was too late he would plan his entry onto the property presumably through the back he would make his move at night after the house lights had been turned off and his targets had plenty of time to drift off to sleep as soon as he was in the house the police would spring their trap its a perfectly feasible plan coltrane thought as he drove across the valley it was simple it had the merit of surprise it had only one flaw ilkovic might be captured instead of killed the un tribunal might sentence him to life imprisonment instead of having him executed thats not good enough i know another way coltrane thought he accessed the san diego freeway and drove south grateful for the congested traffic needing a reason to drive slowly so that ilkovic wouldnt have trouble keeping him in sight he exited onto sunset boulevard where traffic was only slightly less congested and headed toward the pacific coast highway there he proceeded north he had always enjoyed this drive the majesty of the palisades on his right the allure of the ocean on his left the glinting waves the gliding sailboats but not this time the only thing that occupied his attention was a plan that he rehearsed past malibu just when he began to fear that he wouldnt find the road he was looking for he saw it on the right next to a weathered wooden sign that read maynard ranch the road hadnt changed since the first time he had used it three months previously it was unpaved and narrow and it led him up into the santa monica mountains since the cemetery everything around him had seemed out of focus in a haze but now his perception sharpened he had the sensation of seeing everything with the intensity of peering through a zoom lens every detail of his surroundings seemed magnified he was struck by an overwhelming sense of the buckthorn greasewood and other scrub brush on the hills into which he drove december rains had caused the chaparral to turn green in contrast with the sand color of the desert soil and under other circumstances he would have stopped to photograph the differences in color and texture but as he bitterly reminded himself in place of a camera he had brought a shotgun near the highway there had been service stations restaurants and motels along the base of the hills there were occasional dilapidated ranch houses but once the road twisted up into the hills he had the impression of entering another time of experiencing the solitary beauty of what southern california had been like years ago just before steering over a ridge that cut off his view of the sloping land behind him coltrane checked his rearview mirror and thought he saw the dust of a following car it was hard to be sure the dust might merely have been nudged up by a breeze or it might have been the remnants of dust that he himself had raised or if the dust had been raised by someone elses car there was no certainty that the car belonged to ilkovic someone who lived in one of the ranch houses might be returning home from an errand but coltrane didnt think so soon he told himself this is going to end soon he kept seeing a mental image of his grandparents standing on tiptoes on the bench with their arms tied behind them duct tape across their lips and a noose around their necks he kept remembering the way his grandfather struggled to plead through the duct tape and how his asthmatic grandmothers chest heaved he had never wanted to get even with someone so much the road made a dogleg turn to the right taking him higher and deeper into the brushcovered hills but coltrane knew that shortly the landscape would change from a faint december green to an appalling blackness the section of hills that he drove through had escaped a raging brush fire three months earlier a valley on the other side of these hills hadnt been so lucky once owned by the western star ken maynard and used as the location for numerous cowboy movies in the thirties and forties as well as several western tv series including rawhide during the late fifties and early sixties the area had been devastated by the fire which destroyed a replica of a western town that had doubled countlessly as tombstone dodge city and abilene and along whose streets everyone from randolph scott to gary cooper had walked coltrane knew about the place because just after the fire premiere magazine had asked him to go there and take photographs of the destroyed set which the editor planned to juxtapose with stills from the famous movies that the set had been used in with a fondness for some of the classics in which the valley and its set had been featured coltrane had turned down an important assignment in the philippines he had walked the ashcovered land climbed burntover bluffs and studied debrisfilled streambeds identifying many of the vistas with scenes he recalled from favorite movies the area fit all of his requirements it was remote it was abandoned equally important it was familiar once he photographed a place it became part of him as the road crested a ridge and the valley lay below him spindly black skeletons of scrub brush punctuated the thick black ash that stretched in all directions with the scorched timbers of the town in the distance it was as thorough a wasteland as many war zones he had photographed minus the corpses he thought but if he had his way there would definitely be one corpse here by nightfall just make sure the corpse isnt yours coltrane thought at the bottom of the slope the ash made the road hard to distinguish he did his best to follow it sometimes jouncing over rocks at the side the ash wasnt powdery rain had dissolved it into a paste which hardened when the sun came out crusty like dried black mud it made a crunching sound as he drove over it glancing at his rearview mirror he saw the tracks that his tires had made then his rearview mirror showed him something else the bluff behind him where a car appeared stopping as its driver surveyed the barren landscape through which coltrane proceeded that barrenness was another reason coltrane had selected the area there was only one set of tracks heading toward the blackened town and those tracks belonged to coltrane if other people were in the area a team of policemen for example their presence would be easily detectable because there was no place to conceal them their movements would have left scars in the ash giving them away ilkovic would at first be on guard but as the sterile nature of the site became manifest to him his confidence would return the car tiny in coltranes rearview mirror started down the slope coltrane tried to put himself in ilkovics place what would ilkovic be thinking for certain hed wonder what coltrane was doing here it wouldnt take him long to suspect that coltrane might have lead him here but for what purpose to invite a confrontation apparently ilkovic found that notion appealing otherwise he wouldnt be descending into the valley following coltranes tire marks through the ash coltrane slowed letting the car a dark sedan gain on him ahead the road dipped into a deep trough then crossed a shallow stream the site for innumerable movie ambushes from those movies and from photographs that coltrane had taken of the area he knew that his car would be out of sight in the trough he wanted ilkovic to think that he was lying in wait for him down there what he intended to do though was something else the instant he reached the bottom of the embankment he rushed from the car opened the back door and grabbed his shotgun from where he had hidden it under a sleeping bag before leaving packards house he raced toward a gully where another stream joined this one at a right angle that second stream paralleled the road along which he had driven its bed was low enough that if he stooped he couldnt be seen as he ran along it breathing hard sweating stretching his legs to their maximum he charged along avoiding a channel of water so that he wouldnt make a splashing noise that would alert ilkovic if his windows were open ilkovic would be wondering why coltranes car hadnt reappeared ilkovic would be slowing then stopping waiting until he knew where coltranes car had gone he wouldnt go forward again unless he assured himself that he wouldnt be entering a trap meanwhile coltrane sprinted closer so close that he could now hear ilkovics car the faint drone of its motor flash floods had scoured the gully free of ash there wasnt any crust that his footsteps could break and cause noise the only sounds he made were his labored breathing which he struggled to restrain and the brittle but subdued scrape of his shoes over gravel and rocks which lessened when he reduced his pace hearing ilkovics car thirty yards to his left the engine stopped a door opened footsteps crunched on the ash ilkovic had evidently decided to circle the trough where coltranes car had disappeared he was coming at it from an angle which was leading him toward the gully in which coltrane aimed the pumpaction shotgun the footsteps crunched closer coltranes finger tightened on the shotguns trigger lining up the sights focusing along the barrel toward the sound of ilkovics approaching footsteps coltrane had an unholy sensation that he was concentrating through a viewfinder about to press a shutter button when a face appeared above him so startling that coltrane was barely able to jerk the barrel away recognizing the surprised lean thinlipped features of fbi special agent james mccoy jesus christ mccoy gaped at the shotgun barrel and lurched back his feet slipped from under him his momentum throwing him to the ashy ground he landed with a groan damn it put that thing down by the time coltrane scrambled to the top of the gully mccoy was squirming to sit up his blue suit was covered with black ash he stood awkwardly and swatted at his clothes belatedly realizing that he was only spreading the grit he stared at his hands which were totally black his face was smudged he recoiled when he saw that coltrane still held the shotgun i told you put that thing down his surprise deepening coltrane obeyed look at this suit mccoy said look what youve done to what are you doing here what are you doing here as if it isnt obvious mccoy stepped angrily closer you might have fooled nolan and your girlfriend but this selfserving jerk as you called me didnt believe for a second that you were going to try to make ilkovic follow you back to the house where you were hiding coltrane didnt flinch not to the house mccoy emphasized somewhere else i saw that look in your eye i could tell you had something else in mind in case you havent noticed you wandered a little off track about ninety minutes from where youre supposed to be meeting nolan in the hollywood hills you were at the cemetery hell yes you were so convinced ilkovic was going to be there i thought id be criminally stupid if i didnt show up on the chance id spot him the police surveillance team were never called off did you really think wed let you go in there without support mccoy demanded for sure that would have been criminally stupid coltrane was sickened you ruined my chance hey he wasnt there coltrane he never showed up wed have seen him did you at least tell your surveillance team to shut off their radios listen to me pay attention youre a civilian you dont tell lawenforcement officers what to do answer me did they shut off their radios yes for all the good it then theres still a chance to do what this entire operations a mess thanks to you if there was ever a chance to trap ilkovic today you blew it when you didnt go back to where nolan had a team waiting at the house no you blew it when you followed me here if ilkovic sees you hell suspect a trap and back off hey i know my job i watched for anybody else following you nobody zilch both of us took a ride in the country for nothing ilkovic isnt mccoys blacksmudged blue suit suddenly had red on it the next instant coltrane realized that the red was blood bursting from mccoys right shoulder the echo of a gunshot rolled over them about the same time that mccoys face turned gray as the special agent groaned and dropped coltrane grabbed him before his face would have struck a rock he tugged him backward at once a second bullet ricocheted close to mccoy dirt and ash flying the gunshot echoing frantic coltrane felt his right shoe slip over the gullys rim he dropped to his knees lowered himself into the streambed and dragged mccoy down out of sight after him a surge of adrenaline made his hands and feet turn numb as blood rushed to his chest and muscles how bad are you hit dont know mccoy lay among rocks beside the trickling stream he shuddered as if he was freezing dont feel anything youre going into shock did you figure that out mccoy shuddered harder all by yourself coltrane stared toward blood pulsing from a jagged exit hole in mccoys right shoulder i have to stop the bleeding another bulletin but how am i going to do it coltrane thought he had reached the limit of his firstaid abilities when he had used a tourniquet and a pressure bandage to stop the young girls arm from bleeding after the explosion that killed greg this wound was much worse he tried to remember every makeshift treatment he had ever seen a battlefield doctor use on a wounded soldier in a frenzy he groped in mccoys pockets and found a handkerchief he also found a key chain pocketknife which he used to cut wide patches from the bottom of mccoys suit coat mccoy groaned when coltrane tilted him to press a half dozen of these makeshift bandages against the entrance wound in the back of his shoulder coltrane set a similar wedge of cloth in front against the exit wound rushing he pulled off mccoys belt cinched it around his shoulder and tightened it the pressure made mccoy groan again we have to get out of here coltrane said still more bulletins my cars about a hundred yards down this gully do you think you can stand mccoy winced one way to find out i have to do something first coltrane turned toward the gullys rim his stomach was so gripped with fear he was sure he was going to throw up what he did instead the fiercest he had ever moved was scurry up the slope dive over the top grab the shotgun where he had set it down and roll back into the gully as he dropped from sight a richocheting bullet sprayed dirt across the back of his neck the gunshot echoed coltrane rolled to a painful stop bumping his right side against a rock next to mccoy sounds like a rifle the special agent murmured it also sounds closer struggling coltrane put an arm around mccoys waist and gripped his uninjured left arm lifting with a gasp mccoy braced his legs and stood leaning heavily against coltrane hang on to me coltrane said i need a hand free to hold the shotgun they staggered along the gully mccoys legs buckled but he cursed himself and stayed upright lurching farther along the stream the saturn came into view staggering toward it coltrane scanned the top of the embankment down which he had driven ilkovic might have reached here by now he thought furiously he might suddenly appear aiming at us have to hurry coltrane leaned the shotgun against the car yanked open the back door and eased mccoy inside cold mccoy said stretch out on the backseat ill cover you with this sleeping bag prop your feet up against the door keep them higher than your head my fault coltrane grabbed the shotgun and aimed toward the top of the embankment my fault mccoy repeated i shouldnt have no its my fault coltrane shoved the shotgun into the front seat scrambled behind the steering wheel rammed the car into gear and roared out of the trough the car bucked as it reached the crest causing mccoy to scream in pain coltrane stomped his foot on the accelerator racing along the barely defined road toward the charred ruins of the western town throwing up a cloud of ash that he hoped would give them cover i should never have tried this i should never have come here the rage that had brought coltrane here was now the faintest of memories his obsession with revenge had completely drained from him in its place was an overpowering fear that surged through every portion of his body it completely controlled him who did i think i was going up against ilkovic what was i thinking the dust cloud of ash that the saturn threw up behind it didnt provide as much cover as coltrane had hoped a chunk burst from the rear window as safety glass disintegrated into pellets a bullet slammed through the passenger seat and walloped into the lower part of the dashboard mccoy moaned sweating coltrane pressed the accelerator harder the car sped to the crest of an incline and soared from the road slamming down coltranes stomach dropping mccoy groaning from the impact toppling onto the floor the chassis screeched as coltrane fought to control his steering another bullet burst through the remnant of the rear window it struck closer to coltrane shattering the radio mccoy coltrane shouted to the back dont worry about me drive the saturn left the road again crashed down veered regained its traction and sped closer to the charred remnants of the movie set needing to concentrate on his driving coltrane nonetheless risked a glance at the rearview mirror seeing only a cloud of black dust behind him he heard a metallic whack a bullet striking the saturns trunk or the gas tank coltrane thought the more shots ilkovic fires mccoys voice was strained someone will hear he gasped for a breath maybe call the police i dont think so coltrane said the saturn jolting over a bump as he urged the car closer to the scorched ruin this used to be a movie set for westerns westerns the few people who live in the area used to hear shots in this valley all the time theyll probably think another movies being made were screwed the road curved to the left as coltrane changed direction he felt chillingly exposed the dust cloud no longer providing concealment from where ilkovic was shooting abruptly the saturn lurched as if it had struck another bump but instead of jouncing off the ground it leaned the steering felt mushy distraught coltrane struggled to keep the car on the road i think he shot the front left tire the saturns back end fishtailed then leaned more sharply to the left as another jolt shook the car this time from the rear left tire im afraid were going to coltrane couldnt control the car he stomped on the brake pedal fighting the steering wheel feeling the saturn tilt even farther to the left with a savage leftward twist on the steering he forced the front wheels into a ninetydegree angle with the car held his breath as the back end swung to the right felt time stop as the car threatened to crash onto its side and breathed out as the car slammed down flat the car was turned sideways on the road the drivers door faced the direction from which ilkovic had been shooting move coltrane thought a welter of impulses rocketing along his nerves he grabbed the shotgun slid across the passenger seat shoved that door open and leapt onto the ashcovered road the saturn giving him cover a bullet blew a hole in the drivers window safety glass exploding into pellets that sprayed him as he huddled next to the car sweat streamed down his face and stuck his shirt to his chest his hands wouldnt stop shaking mccoy groaned from where he had fallen onto the back floor coughing from black dust that drifted over him coltrane yanked open the rear door and peered apprehensively inside mccoys blue suit coat was soaked crimson his lips were thinner his face narrower squeezed by pain his face was more slick with sweat than coltranes his eyes were scrunched shut at first coltrane thought he had passed out but then mccoy squirmed awkwardly onto his uninjured left side slowly opened his eyes and with effort tilted his head toward coltrane i think you missed a few bumps mccoy said youre going to feel more of them i have to get you out of there a bullet burst through the far side window hurling glass over mccoy yeah get me out of here mccoy said coltrane gripped his uninjured arm and shoulder pulling as mccoy shoved against the floor with his feet doing what he could to help as gently as possible coltrane lowered him to the ashy road mccoy whimpered sorry thirsty the nearest waters back at the stream where you got shot id probably throw it up anyhow a bullet shattered the remnants of the drivers window he took out two tires with two shots coltrane said that good a marksman if he wanted to he could have killed you back at the stream occurred to me or he could have shot me instead of the tires toying with us mccoy said save your strength coltrane hadnt shut the front passenger door when he leapt out glancing inside he felt his heart swell as he saw the walkietalkie that nolan had given him at police headquarters he grabbed it i dont know what kind of range this thing has his voice shook he was almost afraid to hope but we might be able to contact the state police with this thing mccoy nodded guarded optimism showing through his pain coltrane examined the walkietalkie it was black the size of a cellular telephone he pressed a switch marked on off held the unit to his ear and heard a reassuring hiss this must be set to the frequency nolans men are using otherwise he wouldnt have given it to me mccoy spoke with difficulty but that doesnt mean coltrane knew the nervousmaking thought that mccoy was struggling to complete right it doesnt mean its set to a frequency the police up here are using his pulse lurched as a bullet shattered more of the back window it took him a moment to realize the implication the back window with the car sideways on the road ilkovic had been shooting at the side windows he must have changed position he was circling finger unsteady coltrane held down the talk button can anybody hear me please if you hear me answer this is a police emergency an fbi agent has been shot we need help shaking coltrane took his finger off the talk button the release automatically switching the unit to its receive mode he pressed the unit tensely against his ears his spirit sank when he heard only static lousy mccoy murmured what technique supposed to say do you read me mccoy groaned and over his face was alarmingly pale and youre supposed to save your strength coltrane again pressed the talk button does anybody read me this is an emergency an fbi agent has been shot we need help over there you go mccoy murmured but nobodys answering disheartened coltrane listened to the relentless static maybe were too far into the hills maybe those bluffs cut off the signal to photographer i can barely hear you a guttural voice crackled faintly from the walkietalkie coltrane felt as if a fist was squeezing his heart there must be something wrong with your radio the faint deep slavic voice said your signals so weak no one outside this valley will receive it how the hell coltranes voice dropped immediately he knew the answer he must have a police scanner in the car hes using i warned you photographer the gravelly voice was almost a whisper coltrane had to press the walkietalkie hard against his ear what i did to your doctor friend what i did to your grandparents that was quick compared to what im going to do to you listen to me you bastard but coltrane had forgotten to press the talk button ilkovic couldnt hear him besides ilkovic had not yet released the talk button on his own unit his gruff voice continued to whisper ive been promising myself this pleasure for a long time ill be sure to take pictures furious coltrane pressed the transmit button my friends didnt do anything to you my grandparents didnt you didnt need to kill them suddenly his voice box didnt want to work he seemed to have been struck mute straining to listen for ilkovics response nothing the button mccoy groaned youve still got your finger on as if the button was on fire coltrane released it photographer you didnt say over ilkovic taunted you son of a bitch coltrane thought no your friends didnt do anything to hurt me ilkovic said your grandparents didnt but you did didnt you its your fault for prying and meddling and taking pictures of things that arent your concern his voice sounds mccoy took a painful breath struggling to complete his agitated thought louder my god he must be coming closer coltrane glanced frantically around the car we cant stay here were protected only on one side we have to his vision focused on the charred ruins down the road behind him he had intended to drive past them and up into the hills on the valleys far side the road continued beyond them to where coltrane had no idea but he had hoped to find a town or a highway now the only town available to him was a jumble of fallen burnedout timbers fifty yards away the distance could as easily have been fifty miles mccoy do you think you can stand again no choice in alarm coltrane saw a pool of blood when he gripped mccoys uninjured left shoulder and worked to lift him despite his trim body mccoy seemed heavier his body less responsive here coltrane shoved the walkietalkie into a pocket in mccoys suit coat hang on coltrane grabbed the shotgun i hope youre good at the fiftyyard dash it was more like a fiftyyard crawl mccoy wavered coltrane lost his balance under mccoys awkward weight the two of them collapsed on their knees the sudden awkward movement preventing one of them from getting hit as a bullet zipped past at shoulder level sounding like a bumblebee the gunshot echoing but coltrane was absolutely certain that whomever the bullet would have struck would not have been killed ilkovic had been vividly clear about his determination to prolong this that might work in our favor coltrane thought leave me mccoy said no save yourself not without you coltrane said their first effort had taken them about ten yards they staggered another five before mccoy collapsed again sprawling onto the ashy road coltrane tried his best to absorb mccoys fall another bullet zipped over their heads photographer the guttural voice came faintly eerily from the walkietalkie in mccoys pocket i see you come on coltrane urged mccoy dragging him to his feet he cant aim a rifle if hes holding a radio staggering they managed another ten yards before a bullet nicked the left elbow of coltranes denim shirt he felt its hot tug and pushed mccoy flat hes shooting lower coltrane said photographer the gravelly voice said in a singsong imitation of a child playing a game of hideandseek i see you i aimed slightly to your left but you twisted in that direction i hope i didnt hit you did i is it serious i dont want to spoil this coltrane groped along his left arm feeling the nick in his shirt fearing he would touch blood he became weak with relief when he didnt find any the weakness lasted barely a second only until ilkovics deep voice again sounded from the walkietalkie in mccoys pocket answer me photographer how bad are you hit describe the pain coltrane tugged mccoy forward urged him upright and lurched forward with him they were halfway to the jumble of scorched timbers twothirds closer the collapsed buildings loomed filling coltranes frantic vision he had the disorienting sensation of seeing them through a lens the illusion ended when mccoy stumbled and took coltrane with him toppling forward coltrane tried to cushion mccoy as they fell over a tangle of blackened beams and crashed among scorched boards he feared he would cough his lungs out from the thick layer of ash into which he landed feeling smothered he thrashed to get onto his back he coughed deeper his eyes stung watering panicked he saw mccoy facedown in a pile of ash and grabbed him twisting him directing his sootcovered face to the sky each time mccoy coughed he groaned shuddering from pain his blood was stark against the blackness they were in a charcoal filled crater that was formed by the collapsed walls of an incinerated building the shotgun coltrane thought where is it i dropped it groping among the brittle burnt ruins he saw an unscorched chunk of wood protruding from a blackened pile and grabbed the shotguns stock tugging it free he squirmed in a frenzy toward the craters rim peering warily above it ready to shoot if he saw ilkovic coming mccoy coughed behind him straining to say something arrel what barrel ash in it coltranes stomach convulsed when he realized what mccoy was trying to tell him the shotgun had fallen barrelfirst among the burnt timbers ash and chunks of grit would have been wedged up the barrel if coltrane pulled the trigger the plug might be tight enough to make the weapon backfire imagining an explosion of buckshot into his face he hurriedly reversed the weapon and tensed when he saw that the barrel was indeed jammed hands shaking he opened the pocketknife he had taken from mccoy and shoved the blade into the plugged barrel only to flinch when he realized what am i doing im staring down the barrel of a loaded gun desperate he put on the safety catch but he still felt nervous about peering down the barrel and he racked the pump slide under the barrel ejecting shells without firing them now he told himself after peering urgently toward the valley to make sure ilkovic wasnt in view he raised the pocketknife to free the jammed grit from the barrel a ballpoint pen appeared before him mccoys left hand trembling as he offered it coltrane understood the plastic pen would go deeper as he pried a thumbsized chunk of charcoal from the barrel he marveled at mccoys determination the wounded man shakily withdrew his revolver from the shoulder holster under his suit coat and aimed it toward the valley coltrane was equally shaky staring intermittently toward the wasteland beyond where they had abandoned the car he freed the barrel wiped each shell before he shoved it into the weapon and pushed the safety catch to the off position feeling a surge of triumph he aimed toward his unseen target pump it mccoy forced himself to say what you need to rack a shell into coltranes surge of triumph dissipated in its place he felt a dismaying humility he had forgotten that after loading the shotgun he had to work its pump to insert a shell into the firing chamber otherwise the weapon was useless right pulling toward him on the handgrip beneath the barrel coltrane heard the satisfying snick of a shell being seated in the firing chamber good to have you along wouldnt have missed it coltrane aimed toward the wasteland reminding himself that a shotgun was a shortdistance weapon ilkovic would have to come within fifty yards before coltranes gun would be effective in the meantime ilkovics rifle gave him the advantage where is he coltrane demanded maybe with tremendous effort mccoy finished his sentence coming behind us a shadow loomed but when coltrane whirled he saw only a continuation of the wasteland the shadow had been caused by clouds dark clouds throughout his effort to reach the scant cover the ruin provided coltrane had paid no attention to the roiling clouds drifting from the west the ground not the sky had been what concerned him but now the sky was definitely a concern it was going to rain hearing something scrape behind him he whirled again and again he saw nothing the sound had been caused by a breeze against two charred boards the breeze turned into a wind the clouds darkened the storm will keep us from seeing him coltrane kept glancing nervously toward the area behind him do you have the strength to watch this side while i watch over there no mccoys barely audible answer made coltranes scalp prickle dizzy mccoy lowered his head feel strange mccoy dropped his revolver and sank onto his chest alarmed coltrane saw that the belt had slipped off mccoys shoulder the bloodsoaked pressure bandages had fallen loose grabbing the knife he cut off the left sleeve on mccoys coat slashed it apart at fourinch intervals made two equal wads of the bandages and eased them against mccoys entrance and exit wounds he found the belt where it had slipped down mccoys right arm breathing hard he again cinched it tightly around mccoys right shoulder pressing the bandages against the wounds hoping to stop the blood mccoy made no response his only movement was from his chest as it raspingly took in air dont die on me coltrane said ill get you out of here i promise sporadic drops of water pelted coltranes face get you out of here coltrane thought how the drizzle intensified staring toward the dimming wasteland coltrane watched the drops hit the ash raising puffs apart from that and the seething of the clouds he detected no other movement photographer ilkovic said coltrane whirled although an agitated part of him knew that he was only hearing a voice crackle from the walkietalkie its too bad you didnt bring rain gear ilkovic said this morning you should have listened to the weather report as i did a military surplus shop sold me an excellent camouflage rain slicker i know that getting wet will be only a minor discomfort for you compared to what i intend to do but every little bit counts the deep raspy voice was louder than it had been during ilkovics last transmission he was getting closer but from which direction the drizzle became a downpour soaked his clothes sticking to him his hair pasted to his scalp and his neck coltrane peered around uselessly his vision so severely reduced that a gray wavering curtain seemed to surround him he couldnt see twenty feet away from him ilkovic could be anywhere immediately a corollary occurred to him but if i cant see ilkovic he cant see me mccoys car while ilkovic stalks toward these ruins i can head for the car i can get help as the warmth of hope fought the chill of the rain coltrane braced his legs to crawl out of the crater then stopped instantly no i cant leave mccoy but i cant take him with me ive got to move as fast as i can coltrane surveyed the crater squinting toward a jumble of charred beams behind him to his left they seemed to be a collapsed section of the roof dragging mccoy toward them he came close enough to see a hollow underneath fearful that ilkovic would find him as he worked he tugged at one of the beams and created an opening despite his efforts to be gentle he was dismayed by mccoys moan as he shoved the unconscious man into the hollow he rearranged the beams protecting mccoy from the rain blocking him from view there were two things he did before shoving mccoy in there he removed mccoys car key from his pants and the walkietalkie from his coat careful to shut if off slipping in the muck that the rain created black from head to toe he returned to the rim of the crater where he grabbed mccoys revolver mindful of the mistake that he had made with the shotgun he took care that the revolvers hammer wasnt cocked before he shoved the weapon under his belt try to think the way mccoy would he told himself he picked up the pocketknife folded its blade and put the knife in his jeans he gripped the shotgun in one hand the walkietalkie in the other and concentrated on the downpour the slime of ash on him was so greasy that it wouldnt wash off he imagined he looked as if hed risen from hell unable to detect any motion beyond the gray curtain of water he told himself that he might as well die trying to do something instead of hiding he crept from the ruins then he ran unable to tell if he shivered from fear or the cold rain lancing against him his wet clothes sticking to his skin he felt exposed naked his rib cage tightened in anticipation of a bullet that would blast his chest but a frantic part of his mind tried to assure him that ilkovic wouldnt shoot him in so vital a spot the impact would probably be in an arm or a leg disabling him rather than killing him so that ilkovic could have his fun thats some consolation coltrane told himself dont think about it move but as he tried to hurry through the cloak of the storm his mind wouldnt stop working he kept wondering if hed made a good choice by heading straight from the ruins in the direction from which he had come maybe he should have snuck away on an angle but wouldnt ilkovic be more likely to suspect that hed try something indirect perhaps heading straight out from the ruins was so obvious that it wasnt obvious at all for that matter would ilkovic even suspect that coltrane would abandon mccoy and try to sneak away the possible guesses and counterguesses were maddening a dark shape loomed before him coltrane dropped the walkietalkie and aimed the shotgun or tried to rain blurred his vision his waterheavy eyelids blinked repeatedly as he struggled to peer along the barrel if his first shot didnt hit ilkovic he would give away his position and make himself a target he had only one chance to the shape wasnt moving the shape didnt resemble a man its my car coltrane realized but that didnt mean ilkovic wasnt hiding behind it retrieving the walkietalkie coltrane backed away simultaneously veering to his right wanting to take a wide arc around the disabled vehicle when he was far enough away that he couldnt see it anymore he increased speed once more running in a crouch the air became darker this time of year sunset was around five soon it would be night and if this storm keeps on i wont be able to see a thing coltrane thought he raced harder knowing that he would eventually reach the gully that bisected the valley a noise louder than the rain the rush of water along the streambed alerted him that he was getting closer he stopped as the sound from the streambed intensified peering down he saw whitecapped water churning along the gully not a flash flood but if the storm persisted the stream could easily turn into one even at its present strength the flow of water looked dangerous the problem was that to get to where mccoys car was on the other side coltrane would eventually have to cross it but not here the bank was too steep the channel too narrow the water would have too much strength concerned that the bank might give way he stepped back then hurried along it although wary of ilkovic he couldnt keep glancing around him he had to concentrate on the stream he had to find a shallow section where he could cross but as he searched he couldnt help thinking of mccoy back at the ruin will he stay alive long enough for me to bring help maybe i shouldnt have left him what if ilkovic searches the ruins and finds where i hid him what if coltrane tripped over a rock and landed on his shoulder no rolling through a thick layer of mud he banged against another rock and shivered from the chill of a puddle he spat out gritty water he restrained the impulse to cough almost choking on fluid in his throat he had no idea how much noise he had made when he fell but he knew without doubt that he couldnt risk making further noise especially something so distinctive as a deep lungclearing cough distraught that he had dropped the shotgun and the walkietalkie he crawled pawing among the muddy puddles through which he had rolled what if i cant find his left hand trembled when he grasped the walkietalkie his right knee grazed the shotgun had they been damaged when they fell had the mud clogged them in the darkening rain he brushed them off he fingered mud from the shotguns barrel as for the firing mechanism he had no way to check it keep moving if the stream gets higher stumbling along the gully he reached where it curved ahead in the shadows the embankment was less pronounced puddles filled what seemed to be wheel tracks coming out of it coltrane tingled as he told himself that he had reached where the road descended into the trough and then rose from the stream he started down near the bottom the churning stream tugged at his calves he waded farther determined feeling the rushing water strengthen he lost his footing regained it willed his legs to move harder felt the mushy ground tilt upward and reached the other side he had only a hundred yards to go before he would reach mccoys car his pulse swelling his veins he anticipated the excitement of scrambling into mccoys car starting it and fleeing back to the pacific coast highway to get help by the time ilkovic realized what was happening it would be too late for him to do anything if i can find a police car quickly enough coltrane told himself the authorities might even be able to trap ilkovic in the valley hurry but just before he crested the slippery embankment his body moved less willingly a dark suspicion holding him back from the distance of the ruins it had seemed a good idea to come here but now that coltrane was actually close doubts seized him wasnt mccoys car an obvious target wouldnt ilkovic assume that if coltrane got the chance he would head for it the only means of escape rather than risk getting shot stalking toward the ruins wouldnt ilkovic want to wait at mccoys car and shoot coltrane when he stalked toward the vehicle he felt paralyzed unable to decide what to do he wouldnt accomplish anything by returning to the ruins but he couldnt stay where he was a sense of déjà vu again possessed him he was taken back to when he had driven into this valley hidden his car in this trough and crept toward mccoys car although at the time he had thought that it was ilkovics car he had followed a stream that connected with this one at a right angle that other stream paralleled the road on which mccoys car was parked the stream and the road were thirty yards away from each other retreating from the crest of the trough heading to the right coltrane approached the other stream as he had done earlier with the major differences that now dusk was setting in and the streams gully was swollen with rain this time he couldnt hurry along the bottom he had to ease up the side and shift along the muddy incline he unbuttoned his soaked shirt shoved the walkietalkie under it and rebuttoned the shirt with his left hand free he could now better balance himself and hold the shotgun as he proceeded cautiously along the side of the gully the rising stream licked at his mudcaked sneakers his feet felt cold the tips of his fingers numb inching higher to get away from the stream reaching the limit of where he could crouch and still not be seen from mccoys car he counted his steps trying to calculate when he had gone a hundred yards just to be certain he went a little farther but his mounting sense of urgency finally compelled him to stop and peer over the top of the gully he couldnt see the car as the rain increased and the air became grayer he wiped water from his eyes and stared harder but he still couldnt see it is it farther away than i guessed did i go too far easing over the rim pressing himself flat he crawled through mud using his elbows for traction keeping his hands and the shotgun they held out of the water the revolver under his belt and the walkietalkie under his shirt gouged against his stomach but he hardly noticed the pain too intent on what was before him after squirming forward for what he estimated was ten yards he saw a vague hulking shape in the wavering curtain of the storm mccoys car to his left he had indeed gone past it while he made his way along the gully adjusting his direction trying not to make noise in the mud he crawled toward it he stopped as the vehicle became more distinct he was about fifteen yards from the cars leftrear fender there wasnt any sign of ilkovic behind the car or on this side but that didnt mean he wasnt on the other side changing direction coltrane kept a distance and warily maneuvered around the back of the vehicle all the while he strained to see beneath it if ilkovic was hiding on the other side his legs might be visible through the gap underneath but the myriad splashes of rain made it impossible for coltrane to see anything that close to the ground cautious he reached a place where he had a view of the opposite side of the car still no sign of ilkovic coltrane dared to hope but what if ilkovic is inside the car i cant just keep lying in the rain mccoy needs help rising to a crouch he braced himself to run toward the car when he reached the rear window he planned to aim the shotgun and blast the backseat spraying it with buckshot if ilkovic was inside that would be his likely hiding place if he wasnt in the car the blast from the shotgun would bring him running but not before coltrane could rush into the car start it and escape mustering his nerve coltrane couldnt help worrying that the car wouldnt be able to get traction in the mud he never got the chance to find out the car burst into flames it didnt so much explode as erupt fire spewing from the gas tank engulfing the car with a grotesque whooshing sound a wall of heat struck coltrane and thrust him backward the flames so powerful that the storm was powerless to extinguish them no coltranes mind wailed stumbling farther back he turned his singed face from the fire desperate for the rain to cool his skin the flames turned dusk into day the fire exposed him he had to race for cover to reach the protection of the gully scrambling into it almost sliding into the raging stream he pressed his stomach against the mud and peered over the gullys rim from somewhere beyond the fire and the curtain of rain ilkovics laughter rumbled toward him photographer did you honestly think id let you get away with something so obvious do you think im that stupid where is he coltrane thought desperately the cars metal hissed as rain poured through the flames did you think this would end so easily ilkovic shouted you have no idea how many ways i can prolong this by the time im finished youre going to beg me to kill you coltrane concentrated to hear where the shouts were coming from ilkovic seemed to be moving from the area behind the burning car to somewhere on the right the cars metal hissed more loudly the rain subduing the flames i tried to reach you on your walkietalkie have you switched it off coltrane felt it pressing against his stomach turn it back on photographer so we dont have to shout at each other but im not the one whos shouting coltrane thought whats he up to is he trying to distract me except for the impact of the rain the rush of the stream behind him and the diminishing hiss of the car as the flames lessened coltrane heard nothing ilkovics last shout had come from the right is he trying to trick me into thinking hes headed in that direction now that he quit shouting is he going to reverse direction and come at me from the left the flames were completely out smoke from the gutted car contributed to the deepening dusk the stench of gasoline melted plastic and scorched metal flared coltranes nostrils which direction will he use coltrane repeated to himself right or left fear made him feel so helpless that he could understand why an animal caught in the glare of swiftly approaching headlights didnt flee from the tire that crushed it which way he demanded he aimed quickly to the left and then the right i cant just wait here until he makes his move choosing what he hoped was the least likely direction in which ilkovic would expect him to go coltrane squirmed from the gully and headed straight ahead toward the cover of the burnedout car toward the camouflage of its smoke the closer he got the more he felt the lingering heat from the extinguished fire the smoke had been dispersed somewhat by the rain but not enough to stop irritating his nostrils as he entered it he tried to keep his face down and breathe shallowly throughout the walkietalkie continued to gouge at his stomach stopping near the gutted car he unbuttoned his shirt pulled out the walkietalkie and switched it on a faint crackle told him that the battering it had received hadnt damaged it he pressed the transmit button ilkovic lets end this facetoface lets do it now he released the transmit button set the walkietalkie near the gutted car and backed away photographer ilkovics guttural voice crackled from the walkietalkie you keep forgetting to say over coltrane continued to crawl away you want me to break your body with my fists is that the punishment you think you deserve your lack of imagination disappoints me i have so many more inventive methods in mind coltrane was far enough that he could no longer see the walkietalkie in the gathering gloom the staticridden voice was almost ghostly at once it fell silent coltrane slithered into a depression filled with water the ground had been so seared by the brush fire that it had formed a nonabsorbent shell the rain was filling it immersing himself in the greasy pool he allowed only his arms and head to be exposed resting the shotgun on a rock he aimed toward where he had left the walkietalkie static crackled ilkovic can use that sound to figure out where im hiding thats why he wanted me to keep the walkietalkie on coltrane eased his right index finger into the shotguns trigger guard static crackled he must be pressing the transmit button on and off creating noise without giving his own position away by speaking coltrane braced his finger against the shotguns trigger from the force of the rain the smoke had now completely dispersed but the burnedout car remained obscured the storm darkening the wind intensifying as the pool in which coltrane lay deepened he ignored the pressure of the rising water and focused his attention on where he had set the walkietalkie near the gutted car every murky detail appeared magnified soon ilkovics shadowy figure would creep into view and static crackled thats it ilkovic keep listening for that sound get closer surprise me where you think im hiding next to the car the shock of surprise was total from behind powerful hands grabbed him yanking him from the pool coltrane was so overwhelmed that his finger jerked on the shotguns trigger discharging the weapon spewing a blast of buckshot harmlessly into the storm the hands which had grabbed his shoulders released him for the fraction of an instant ilkovic needed to reach under coltranes armpits and across his chest the hands grasping each other muscular arms squeezing against coltranes rib cage coltranes feet were off the ground he struggled to breathe the fierce noise of the shot had battered his eardrums a terrible ringing in them added to his confusion but he was still able to hear ilkovics labored grunting as he squeezed harder against coltranes chest is that what you had in mind photographer ilkovic murmured against coltranes right ear his breath so close that coltrane felt it on his skin coltrane fought for air his vision became gray spots of red dancing this is only the start ilkovic murmured intimately against coltranes neck ill take you close to death a hundred times before you finally bore me grunting harder he increased the pressure against coltranes ribs im going to pass out coltrane thought in dismay he had kept his grip on the shotgun but the weapon was useless unless he worked the pump to eject the used shell and chamber a fresh one he tried he didnt have the leverage his arms no longer had the strength even if he did manage to pump a fresh shell into the firing chamber he wouldnt be able to aim at ilkovic behind him dropping the shotgun coltrane gripped his hands over ilkovics and strained to pry them free but ilkovics thick fingers were like steel bands welded together coltrane couldnt budge them more red dots swirled in his vision as ilkovics relentless arms tightened no coltrane jerked his head back as hard as he could hoping that the rear of his skull would strike ilkovics face with enough force to stun him and make him loosen his grip but coltrane was the one who was stunned instead of striking flesh and bone his skull hit something metallic that had two round surfaces its sharp edges gouging his scalp he moaned in pain a mask his panicked thoughts werent able to identify the object as his strength drained he kicked his heels behind him toward ilkovics legs but they hit a slippery rubber rain slicker that ilkovic was wearing the impact absorbed mccoys revolver frenzied coltrane drew it from beneath his belt feeling the mud that covered it hoping that it wouldnt be jammed that it wouldnt backfire he raised it aimed it over his left shoulder and felt it fly from his awkward grasp as ilkovic released his left hand and yanked the weapon away throwing it into the mud throughout ilkovics right arm was so powerful that he continued to maintain his suffocating grip on coltranes chest but not completely for an instant while ilkovics left hand was occupied with the revolver the pressure lessened just enough for coltrane to manage a gasp of air it was one of the most purifying sensations he had ever known erasing the spots in his vision clearing his thoughts enough for him to remember he had another weapon as ilkovics left arm snapped back into position around coltranes chest coltrane lowered his left hand fumbled in his jeans pocket took out mccoys knife used his weakening right hand to open the blade and mustered his remaining energy to stab the backs of ilkovics interlocked hands again and again the blade slashed and tore and shredded hot liquid spewed over coltranes plunging fist ilkovic screamed releasing his grip he stumbled back wailing coltrane dropped to the mud landing on his knees he gasped to fill his lungs his crushed ribs didnt want to respond he couldnt inhale fast enough to replenish his strength howling ilkovic grasped his mangled hands and cursed at last coltrane was able to see him but the top of ilkovics face was covered not with a mask but with a device that resembled the eyes of a giant insect nightvision goggles ilkovic had been using them to track coltrane in the gathering gloom with the hood of his camouflage rain slicker pulled up over his head and with the huge twin lenses of the goggles projecting from beneath the hoods drooping folds ilkovic looked monstrous furious he charged coltrane dove to the side a moment before ilkovics heavysoled shoe would have collided with his groin rolling through the mud coltrane tried to keep the knifes blade away from his own body the weapon suddenly feeling puny against the massive force raging toward him coltranes photographs had shown how imposingly solid ilkovic looked but in person he exuded a raw power that was awesome as ilkovic kicked again coltrane scrambled to avoid the blow feeling the rush of ilkovics shoe barely miss him he almost tripped over the shotgun grabbed it spun and found ilkovic straightening from where he had picked up mccoys revolver coltrane aimed the shotgun and pulled the trigger nothing happened you didnt pump a shell into the chamber photographer ilkovic aimed toward coltranes left shoulder helpless coltrane watched him pull the trigger but the revolver was jammed with mud instead of firing it blew apart ilkovic stood as if paralyzed staring through his grotesque goggles at his explosionmangled hand mouth stretched open in a silent wail he looked dumbfounded coltrane moved as deliberately as if he had been adjusting the focus and shutter speed of a camera prior to taking a photograph he racked a shell into the chamber checked that the shotguns barrel wasnt clogged aimed and blew ilkovics head off seven a chaos of emotions threatened to tear coltrane apart relief horror triumph dismay victory revulsion sinking to his knees staring down in shock toward the headless torso that had been ilkovic he had a terrible sense that the corpse was actually that of his father but this time his father hadnt blown his brains out coltrane had done it for him thank god he murmured tears mixed with the rain on his cheeks thank god immediately fear reinvaded him he had to get help for mccoy but with mccoys car destroyed there wasnt any way to drive back to the pacific coast highway he would have to do it on foot ten miles away along a mudslogged road it would take hours mccoy would bleed to death by then despite his exhaustion coltrane struggled to his feet but no sooner did he start to run toward the stormobscured hills than he lurched to a halt a sudden thought seizing him there was a way to drive for help he had forgotten there was another vehicle ilkovics if he could find where coltrane stared toward the headless corpse something rose in his throat as he took one hesitant step after another stooping afraid that ilkovics mangled hands would thrust up and clutch his throat coltrane trembled and pulled up ilkovics rain slicker he had been convinced that the worst was over that there couldnt be anything more horrifying than what he had just endured but now he realized how wrong he had been touching ilkovics warm corpse fumbling in his pants pockets feeling his spongy flesh beneath his wet garment coltrane became so lightheaded his mind reeling that he feared he was going to pass out his quivering fingers brushed against a set of keys he tightened his grip and pulled his hand free squeezing the keys rigidly in his palm lest he lose them as he slumped onto his hips fighting not to throw up slowly he wiped his mouth and straightened find the car he urged himself where would ilkovic have left it coltrane had heard mccoy drive into the valley but he hadnt heard ilkovics car did that mean ilkovic had left it on the ridge above the valley the trajectory of his bullets had indicated that at the start he was shooting from up there had he abandoned his vehicle and come down on foot go coltrane inwardly shouted you have to get help for mccoy running through the dark rain doing his best to follow the road he felt the muddy ground angle upward his lungs heaving his legs straining the effort of his ordeal had so drained him that he wavered as he reached the top where would ilkovic have left the car not on the ridge not where coltrane could have seen it from below farther beyond the ridge near the road ilkovic wouldnt have wanted to get too far from his escape route coltrane slammed into the hood of the vehicle before he saw it the startling impact shocked him backward his knees thighs and lower abdomen in pain but he didnt have time to let his further injuries slow him down his thoughts were totally on mccoy grabbing the drivers door of what he now recognized was a dark van he tugged cursed when the door didnt budge fumbled to unlock it and finally scrambled up behind the steering wheel it took his shaking right hand three tries to fit the key into the ignition switch starting the van putting it into gear he warned himself to go slowly dont get stuck in the mud he put on the headlights and made a slow gentle turn praying as he felt the tires slip in the wet earth but they gained traction and he exhaled when the van completed its arc starting back through the hills toward the pacific coast highway he pawed at the levers on the steering wheel and found how to activate the windshield wipers throughout he was conscious of a terrible odor but with so many activities occupying his attention it was only when he was on his way that the rank stench in the van fully struck him it reminded him of rotten meat and he suddenly knew his soul frozen that the rear of the van was where ilkovic had butchered daniel police radios squawked the headlights of numerous emergency vehicles pierced the night gloom of the valley their crisscross pattern creating a sense of being in a maze the storm had diminished to a drizzle its din no longer muffling the drone of idling police cars although coltrane had warned the state trooper whose cruiser he had nearly run off the highway that the stream would be too high and fast for an ambulance to get across the officer had radioed for one regardless now its white outline haloed by the glare of headlights stayed fifty yards behind mccoys gutted car amid the other emergency vehicles all of them trying to remain far enough away that they wouldnt contaminate the crime scene on the opposite side of the stream across which coltrane had again made his way no matter the risk a medevac helicopter hovered its whirling rotors creating a highpitched whine its searchlights aimed toward the charred ruins of the western town those lights forced coltrane to shield his eyes as he sat in a puddle among jumbled scorched timbers cradling mccoys listless body where he had pulled it gently from its makeshift hiding place mccoys body was cold coltrane wrapped his arms around him desperate to warm him youre going to be all right theyre going to take care of you mccoy made no response his only motion was a slight rise and fall of his chest dont die on me mccoy youve got help now youre going to be fine the young state policeman who had at first tried to keep coltrane from entering the swollen stream and who had in the end followed him waved to the helicopter motioning for it to set down next to the ruins the reflection of the choppers searchlights gleamed off the red cross on the side of the white fuselage coltrane hugged mccoy doing his best to transfer his body heat the medevac attendants jumped out stooped to avoid the whirling rotors and ran toward the ruins mud splashing their white uniforms in less than two minutes while coltrane described the gunshot they rigged up an iv line and an oxygen mask as much as coltrane was eager for mccoy to be rushed to a hospital he felt an odd sense of separation when the attendants eased mccoy onto a stretcher and hurried with him to the chopper the noise of the rotors changed from a whine to a roar as the chopper lifted off coltrane stared upward waiting until the choppers searchlights were extinguished and he could barely hear the receding whumpwhumpwhump before he turned to the state policeman who told him yet again that there were many people with an awful lot of questions for him by then the police had rigged safety lines across the swollen stream allowing investigators to cross toward the ruins the peripheral glare from their flashlights revealed their stark wet faces their annoyance about their useless rain gear changing to bewilderment and then astonishment as coltrane explained what had happened a part of him warned that he ought to wait until he had the advice of an attorney but he told himself that he didnt have anything to hide requesting an attorney would only make it seem that he did have something to hide if coltranes original plan had worked and he had managed to ambush ilkovic that would have been another matter he knew but mccoys presence had changed everything coltrane couldnt imagine any lawenforcement officer or district attorney wanting to arrest and prosecute someone who had risked his life defending a wounded fbi agent so their amazement growing coltrane walked them through it showing them his disabled car and the tires that ilkovic had shot out he showed them where he had hidden mccoy among the charred timbers he took them back to and across the stream to where mccoy had been shot and where ilkovic had later set off an incendiary device in mccoys car all the while the investigators were trying to preserve the crime scene keeping a distance from the alreadyexisting foot marks in the mud as cameras flashed repeatedly coltrane couldnt help thinking that everything was twisted around he should be taking the photographs he shouldnt be the reason the photographs were being taken who was he a state police lieutenant pointed toward the body dragan ilkovic coltrane explained about bosnia about daniel greg and coltranes grandparents this guy killed an lapd detective i hope his fingerprints are on record somewhere one of the medical examiners team said in the background its going to be hard as hell to identify him without a then the photographers were finished and somebody set down planks so the investigators could get closer to ilkovics body without making new tracks in the mud coltrane wasnt sure when nolan and jennifer had arrived as he turned from answering more questions he suddenly saw them making their way through the glare of headlights and flashlights he prepared to start reexplaining but the first thing nolan did was introduce himself to the officer in charge and the first thing jennifer did was peer from coltrane toward ilkovics corpse and take a shocked step backward at once nolan was gripping coltranes arm tugging him away nolans burly shoulders were rigid with anger looks like you got a little lost forgot where the house was where you were supposed to meet us just what the hell are you doing here there was a slight change of plan coltrane said you led ilkovic out here to try to kill him did i you think a grand jurys going to believe you didnt set this up coltrane shrugged wearily youre right i did come out here to kill him you admit it but then mccoy showed up and we talked about it and he convinced me i was wrong but i never got the chance to leave because thats when ilkovic shot mccoy after that it was selfdefense nolan stared at him for the longest while thats your story thats my story you better hope mccoy pulls through to verify what you just told me i hope he pulls through no matter what just the right tone of sincerity it might work i think you might actually get away with this im not getting away with anything coltrane said that son of a bitch shot mccoy if not for me mccoy would have died out here if not for you my friend mccoy wouldnt have been here at all coltrane didnt have an answer for that the state police lieutenant interrupted were going to have to take you back to headquarters and get your statement coltrane nodded can i have a minute to talk to he pointed toward jennifer who was glancing around in dismay totally disoriented the lieutenant didnt look happy i dont want you talking to anybody who isnt associated with this investigation not until were finished if shes involved in this youre not the only one who wants to talk to her the next thing coltrane was getting into one cruiser and a policeman was escorting jennifer to another the vehicles followed by nolans struggled up the muddy slope tires slipping drizzle glistening in the gleam of headlights at am after five hours of questions the state police finally told coltrane that he could go home but keep us informed about anyplace you might be and dont leave the los angeles area they had replaced coltranes soaked filthy bloodcovered clothes with a pair of coveralls ill get these back to you he said youll have plenty of opportunity youll be seeing us often enough outside the interrogation room coltrane found jennifer on a wooden bench in the hallway her short blond hair still wet from the rain was pressed against her head her discouraged gaze was directed toward the graytiled floor she glanced up and barely nodded as he came out ready to go he asked yeah they told me it would be okay dejected jennifer stood sergeant nolans around here somewhere he said hed give us a ride back to los angeles mitch what why in gods name did you nolan came down the hallway most of the hour drive back was in silence youre lucky they told me theyre probably going to buy what youre selling nolan finally said im not selling anything as long as mccoy backs you up which youre lucky about also because the word from the hospital is that hes going to pull through thank heaven coltrane thought of course youll still have to convince the grand jury nolan said but for the time being youve got a break from the state police not you and i though were not finished if i wasnt so tired id take you over to the threat management office right now tomorrow youre going to come over and explain to me why you think youre so damned much better than me that you can jerk me around im sorry that wasnt my intention save it for tomorrow theres something i have to do first after that im all yours something you have to do put it off believe me theres nothing more important than yes there is daniels funeral the car became silent again yeah go to the funeral nolan said ill see you there gregs is the day after ill see you there too not that theres anything left of greg to bury my grandparents funeral will probably be the day after that maybe we ought to give you a medal for shooting the son of a bitch they drove another mile in silence where do i drop you your place or packards nolan asked the airport nolan visibly tensed youre not supposed to leave the area the america west parking garage i left my car there saturday night in the middle of the night the access to the airport was almost deserted nolan stopped outside the parking garage coltrane opened his door ill meet you at your office at four i know you will coltrane waited for jennifer to get out with him she didnt something the matter coltrane asked sergeant since were in the neighborhood would you take me to my apartment in marina del rey nolan frowned toward her and then at coltrane at almost am coltranes street was quiet his westwood town house in darkness his headlights reflected off puddles reluctant to be closed in by the garage he parked at the curb and climbed the wet steps to his concrete patio the air was cool enough to make him shiver he kept telling himself that ilkovic was really dead that the police had checked his town house for explosives that he had nothing to be afraid of all the same as he inserted his key in the front door he felt uneasy he reached inside and flicked a light switch illuminating the living room before he entered the furniture was in disarray from the bomb squads search but the disorder that troubled him was the empty bottle of chardonnay on the coffee table as well as three wineglasses two of them halffull on the counter next to the telephone they were from saturday afternoon when he had celebrated with jennifer and daniel showing them his photographs just before ilkovics phone call had forced them to set down their glasses saturday afternoon it seemed impossible that daniel had been killed since then coltrane locked the door and stepped hesitantly toward one of the wineglasses the one that was empty remembering that daniel had finished his before he and jennifer finished theirs the oncesparkly glass had a film of dried liquid reverentially coltrane picked it up careful not to touch daniels faintly visible fingerprints he stared at them for the longest time at last he set down the glass went to a cupboard in the kitchen pulled out a bottle of wild turkey and drank three long swallows straight from the bottles mouth gasping he set it down the fire in his throat and stomach not strong enough to distract him from his emotions he climbed the stairs to his bedroom which was also in disarray because of the bomb squad after stripping off the coveralls he went into the bathroom and took the longest shower he could ever recall repeatedly soaping his hair and body rinsing soaping scouring himself trying to rid himself of the lingering feel of death despite the bruises on his legs chest and arms he toweled himself roughly until his skin was raw he had come here to get extra clothes and other things he would need for packards house but all of a sudden he felt too exhausted to go there he stripped the covers from the bed intensely aware that ilkovic had been in this room and touched them he dragged a sheet and blanket from a hallway closet and spread them over the bare mattress he programmed his bedside clock to wake him at am turned off the lights crawled wearily between the sheet and the blanket and tried to sleep the jangle of the telephone roused him from a restless anxious semiconsciousness in which arms seemed to squeeze his chest and rain had the color of blood dazed he directed his bleary vision toward the bedside clock a little after six he decided it must be jennifer or nolan or the state police hello mr coltrane coltrane didnt recognize the voice who wants to know im a reporter for the la times id like to no sooner had coltrane hung up than the phone rang again the next reporter was from the associated press coltrane unplugged the phone in the bedroom but the phone downstairs rang almost immediately and by the time coltrane got downstairs to unplug that one he heard a mans voice on the answering machine identifying himself as a reporter for newsweek asking him to describe details about coltrane pulled the plug he knew what was coming fighting his cramped muscles and his exhaustion he hurried upstairs put on a navy blazer and gray slacks packed two suitcases with clothes slung a camera bag over his shoulder and managed to get outside to drive away a few seconds before a tv news truck sped past him in his rearview mirror he saw it pull up in front of his town house there were three tv news trucks at the church in burbank when he got there a little before one keeping a distance from each other identicallooking attractive sterneyed women wearing business suits spoke into microphones their backs to the church while cameramen recorded the mourners filing in coltrane couldnt help wondering if any photographs he had taken had ever interfered with someones grief now he knew what it felt like to be on the other side after parking his car in a lot behind the church he debated whether to risk going in then decided that the tv news team couldnt know what he looked like to the best of his knowledge no photograph of him had ever been published so he took the chance jennifer was already in the church when he entered she wore a black dress and veil the latter didnt quite conceal how weary her features were sitting next to her apparently surprising her coltrane nodded she nodded somberly back looked as if she was about to say something then turned toward the pallbearers carrying daniels coffin down the center aisle toward the altar daniels exwife supported by an elderly man who might have been her father sobbed and followed the coffin her footsteps unsteady after the coffin was set on a bier and daniels exwife took her place in a front pew a priest accompanied by altar boys came out to begin the mass for the dead coltrane couldnt help remembering the mournful classical music that ilkovic had repeatedly left on his answering machine verdis requiem the day of wrath the day of anger will dissolve the world in ashes how horrid a trembling there will be when the judge appears and all things are scattered well ilkovic damn you youre the one being judged now the priest gave a eulogy in which he alluded to miltons paradise lost and how one of the hardest acts of faith was to justify gods ways to human beings when something this incomprehensible occurs we find ourselves powerless and adrift what kind of god would permit such savagery what kind of universe presents the conditions in which something this horrid can happen we are tested to our utmost limits tested the priest emphasized if we are to persevere we must not turn our backs on god we must not turn our backs on the world what we must hate and turn our backs on is the evil that we were put on earth to overcome turn our backs coltrane thought i dont think so daniel i got even for you after the service coltrane accompanied jennifer from the church can you wait here a minute he went over to daniels exwife embraced her and explained how sorry he was perhaps on medication she didnt seem to hear nolan who evidently had been in the back of the church watched from the side of the steps after exchanging glances with him coltrane made his way back through the mourners most of whom he recognized from various times when he had visited daniel at the hospital are you okay he asked jennifer no im sorry coltrane said for what you didnt kill daniel for what you had to go through what im sorry about jennifer said is that you didnt tell me what you were planning to do you shut me out i didnt want to put you in danger you still shut me out you didnt trust me enough to tell me what you were doing you treated me like a stranger but youre a stranger i would never have believed you were capable of coltrane glanced away selfconscious im a stranger to myself jennifer said what do you mean that argument we had about guns now that ilkovic is dead i feel like a coward i dont understand i wish id had the chance to blow the bastards head off coltrane was shocked ive never been this confused jennifer said coltrane touched her arm after we go to the grave site do you want to get some lunch and talk about it no you want a little time alone yes these past few days weve been together a lot sometimes its possible to have too much of a good thing different huh me wanting to be alone coltrane spread his hands in a gesture of futility abruptly he was distracted by a commotion at the edge of the crowd evidently someone had identified him to the news teams because they were swarming in his direction pursued by cameramen he barely reached the parking lot ahead of them fifteen minutes from the cemetery coltrane swerved into yet another narrow alley checking his rearview mirror satisfying himself that the tv news trucks no longer followed him he drove to where he had waited throughout the morning until it was time to go to daniels funeral to where he felt confident that the news teams wouldnt be able to find him because ilkovic hadnt been able to find him there in the maze of streets in the hollywood hills cresting a treelined slope he peered down at his sanctuary after everything he had been through the houses castlelike appearance made him feel secure the greentinted copper on the garage door reminded him even more of a fortress as did the two upper levels each with a parapet because the garage doors remote control was in the disabled rental car that he had abandoned the night before he parked at the curb it was an odd sensation to feel free to leave his vehicle in the open and not be afraid that someone would try to kill him exhausted he secured the front door behind him peered up the stairs toward the sunbright living room then moved in the opposite direction down toward the vault it was where he had gone when he had arrived earlier where he had spent the morning waiting to go to daniels funeral after what he had been through the vault no longer seemed repellent indeed he wondered why it had ever seemed that way to begin with needing something to occupy him he knew without doubt what that something would be determined to shut out his nightmares he unlocked the vault and passed the gray metal shelves reaching the far left corner the glaring overhead lights no longer seemed harsh the fiftyfivedegree air no longer made him shiver the concrete walls no longer seemed to close in on him he reached toward the back of the shelving freed the catches on each side and pulled out the wall again the incredibly beautiful face gazed out at him the vaults light spilled into the hidden chamber casting a glow over the picture making the woman seem alive he stepped closer admiring the perfect geometry of her face the elegant chin curved lips high cheeks and almondshaped eyes her lush black hair framed her features alluringly her brilliant white shawl made her dark eyes magical his mouth dry coltrane picked up one of the boxes and carried it out to the shelves after removing the lid he carefully took out one eightbyten photograph after another studying them setting them along the shelves picking up new ones he lingered over a closeup in which her eyes gazed so directly into his that she gave the allusion of being in the present he couldnt tell what filled him with greater awe packards genius or his subject he had never seen any woman so entrancing mitch the voice came from beyond the vault coltrane flinched mitch its duncan reynolds in a rush coltrane crossed toward the open door mitch he heard duncan coming down the steps and he left the vault closing the door a moment before duncan could have peered in that was when coltrane realized he had no intention of telling duncan about the photographs i saw your car outside duncan put away his key im surprised i caught up to you i brought this for you but i expected id have to leave it here rather than be able to give it to you in person wondering about the box he was handed coltrane tried not to look uneasy about his departure from the vault he didnt want duncan to suspect that he was hiding something a telephone with a builtin answering machine the service is still hooked up now i wont have so hard a time getting in touch with you about the details of buying this house well ive been a little busy coltrane said so i found out when i turned on the television this morning you certainly did a good job of hiding your nerves when i met you here on sunday are you hurt cuts and bruises the television news made it seem like a nightmare and you seemed like a hero more like a damned fool i almost got myself killed i dont want to think about it yes the strain shows on your face im sorry for intruding ive got the purchase agreements for the house and the furniture we can talk about them another time duncan opened his briefcase handing him documents you asked me to find out more about the history of the place yes coltrane leaned forward i did a title search and learned that in addition to the movie producer who first owned the property winston case coltrane remembered the name from a biography about packard that included background about some of the houses he had photographed thats right he owned the property from until the year randolph photographed it then from until it was owned by a woman named rebecca chance who i dont know anything about her shes a name on a document she was the only other owner in the fall of randolph took possession of the house buying it through a corporation owned by a corporation owned by a corporation that randolph inherited from his parents that sort of secrecy was customary with him he used the same method to purchase an estate in mexico for example and was equally concerned about maintaining his privacy there as far as this house is concerned to my knowledge he never actually lived here and no one else ever occupied it thats correct which explains its superb condition since no one was here to wear it down it didnt require much repair with the exception of the installation of the vault and the darkroom the house remains the same as when it was built in the thirties exactly thats why im buying it in photography when unfocused rays of light reflect off an object and strike a negative they create overlapping blurs known as circles of confusion that was how coltrane felt trapped in circles of confusion what are you doing he asked himself as he drove through frustratingly dense traffic toward the police administration building in downtown la his mind no matter how weary wouldnt let him have any peace do you think that if you put yourself in a time frame that goes back far enough youll be able to feel as if nobody you love has died he thought of the most important object in his life the photograph of his mother pushing him in the swing at the trailer park it was impossible to count the hours that he had spent both as a child and an adult staring at that photograph projecting himself into it imagining that he was there always the effort had been frustrating because the woman and the boy in that picture remained frozen in time whereas he continued to get older he wasnt a participant he was an observer he and that boy were no longer the same and yet the woman was always his mother do you think that if you live in packards house the way it was in the thirties youll trick yourself into feeling remote from the present less traumatized by what ilkovic did to your grandparents and daniel and greg your problems wont go away theyll be the same in the past as the present but the past will raise different problems intruding on the present have you any idea how i can find information about a woman who lived in los angeles in the thirties coltrane asked nolan wasnt prepared for a change in topic she owned the house im buying coltrane explained im trying to find out some history about the property havent you been listening to me nolan asked youre barely going to scrape through this and stay out of prison if i were you id keep my mind on what to tell the grand jury if i keep thinking about ilkovic ill go crazy well youre not going to get much of a break from talking about him the state police want you to drive back up there they want another hearttoheart at sixthirty nolan glanced at his watch which gives you ninety minutes theyre working late youre a popular guy coltrane rubbed his raw eyes and stood the library has city directories nolan said what for the thirties she owned the house how long from until follow her through the directories where did she move after she left the house youre buying see if shes in the listing same thing with the phone book eventually shell disappear from the listings either because she moved to another city or she died if she died therell most likely be an obituary in the la times of course itll take awhile for you to check all the copies of the newspaper for the year when she no longer appears in the listings but if its important to you the house has a colorful past id like to know more about it coltrane said with all the problems you have its better than thinking about the last few days cant argue there what you need is a private investigator nolan pulled a business card from a drawer try this guy hell need whatever youve got on her including a photograph i dont have one coltrane lied returning to packards house near midnight he was so exhausted he could barely keep his eyes open a glance in his rearview mirror showed him that his second lengthy conversation with the state police had etched deep fatigue lines into his face as had his insistence that if they had more questions they were going to have to wait he was leaving the next day to go to connecticut for his grandparents funeral he put the car in the garage locked the houses front door behind him and finally took halting weary steps into the living room there he accomplished the monumental task of removing the gray slacks and navy blazer that he had worn to daniels funeral so long ago this morning tired to the point of dizziness he sank onto his sleeping bag but his mind wouldnt let him rest halfformed nightmares made him twitch the mangled hands of ilkovics headless corpse seemed to reach up to choke him jerking awake he strained to see the luminous dial on his watch and exhaled in despair when he discovered that the time was only twentyfive after three just keep lying here he told himself close your eyes youll soon be asleep again but his ravaged nervous system refused to obey before he left for new haven he had to make plane reservations and contact his lawyer about the documents that duncan had given him he had to arrange for his accountant to send escrow checks he had to he got up and proceeded through darkness into the dining room and then the kitchen after turning on a light beneath one of the counters he found the documents where he had set them next to the stove he read them and felt that they were straightforward had it not been that he wanted to be certain of gaining unquestioned title to the property he would have signed them right away without bothering to wait for his lawyers opinion negotiation wasnt an issue at all costs he intended to gain possession of this house next to the refrigerator a blinking red light caught his attention the combination telephoneanswering machine duncan had given him coltrane hoped that it was jennifer who had called he regretted the way their conversation had ended at the funeral he wanted to settle their differences but then he realized that jennifer couldnt possibly know the phone number here it wasnt listed he himself hadnt known until duncan gave it to him at the end of todays conversation coltrane pressed the play button for a moment he had the irrational fear that verdis requiem would start playing that ilkovics guttural voice would again threaten him that last night hadnt happened that his waking nightmare hadnt really ended but what he heard instead was almost as troubling no message at all just silence then a click only a wrong number he told himself sure he poured water into a glass but instead of drinking it he found himself leaving the kitchen that was how he perceived his action he didnt choose to leave so much as he discovered that he was doing so the moment he started however he knew where he was going it took him no time at all to unlock the vault pull out the section of shelves and enter the hidden chamber after duncans visit he had been careful to put the photographs back and close the wall lest duncan perhaps wondering about what coltrane had been doing in the vault might come back to satisfy his curiosity again coltrane removed the box and took out photograph after photograph arranging them on shelves admiring the woman when he finally put them away and left the vault he was surprised to find that the sun had been up for several hours new haven was a foot of snow a bitingly cold wind and a funeral to which almost no one came because most of coltranes grandparents friends had died before them after listening to the ministers final prayers he put his gloved hands on each of the coffins and whispered goodbye back at his grandparents house he began the long heartsinking process of disposing of the accumulation of a lifetime the telephone rang as he sorted through a shoe box full of receipts how are you feeling jennifer asked about what youd expect snow lancing against the living room window made coltrane look in that direction i thought id call to try to cheer you up im glad you did coltrane thought he heard jennifer exhale in what might have been nervous relief a lot of memories to deal with i bet jennifer said coltrane slumped into his grandfathers rocking chair i lived here until i was eighteen until i moved out to los angeles to go to college last night i slept upstairs in my old bedroom the furnitures still the same in fact its even in the same position the only spot i havent i keep wanting to go down to where i used to hide in the basement when i was a kid where i used to think about my mother but i cant bring myself to look at where he could hardly say it ilkovic killed them are you going to sell the house no i ran into some seniors who were friends of my grandparents one old couple had their rent raised and they cant afford to live in their apartment anymore im going to let them stay here for free they said they didnt want charity so i told them theyd be doing me a favor that i needed somebody to take care of the place nice well coltrane looked at the big christmas tree in the corner of the living room its that time of year will you be back for the holiday i dont think i can manage by then oh jennifers voice dropped i was hoping im still having trouble about i dont want to have anything hanging between us im sorry about what i said after daniels funeral theres nothing wrong with wanting some time to yourself but i could have picked a better time to say it im still confused but youre not the only one maybe im ready to talk about it now well do that when i get back coltrane said yes not on the phone not on the phone have a good holiday same to you at least as good as you can mitch i havent forgotten about the special edition of the magazine the photographs are still at packards house when you come back ill make sure you get them the snow lanced harder against the front window as coltrane hung up he walked to the window and watched dusk thicken cars struggled through deepening drifts his photographs they had completely slipped from his mind it was a measure of how severely things had changed a week ago he had been elated about the new direction that his life was taking he had felt reborn and now he could barely recall the sense of renewal that had made him excited out of habit he had brought a camera with him but it remained in one of his suitcases along with shirts that he hadnt unpacked going into the front hallway smelling must he started up the oak staircase the banister felt wobbly or maybe i am he thought in his bedroom he opened his suitcase took out his camera set it aside and removed a large manila envelope that he had reinforced with stiff cardboard to make sure that it didnt bend the envelope contained a dozen photographs from the chamber in packards vault he spread them out on the bed and stared down at them directing his gaze from left to right dizzily returning to the first he began again and again the haunting woman looked back at him she was an actress it was four days after christmas coltrane was back in los angeles sitting in the uncluttered office of the private investigator he had hired before going to new haven the mans name was roberto rodriguez short and slender with silver sideburns wearing spectacles and a conservative suit he looked more like an attorney than a private detective this is a photocopy of the police file you can keep it police file coltrane worked to steady his right hand as he opened the file a faint blotched image on a xerox of a photograph peered up at him making him tingle as imprecise as it was the image left no doubt that lush dark hair those expressive lips and almondshaped eyes he was looking at the woman in packards photographs he turned the page and frowned at typescript that was hard to read faded by age and what incomplete portions of characters suggested was an overused typewriter ribbon missing persons department the complaint was filed by her agent back in rodriguez said she had a fiveyear contract with universal nothing major she certainly wasnt a star although judging from the photo i used to make that xerox she could have been when she didnt show up for the start of a picture the studio grumbled to her agent and the agent realized that he hadnt heard from her in over three months which tells you how close they were and there isnt an and she was never found coltrane felt a sinking sensation but how could randolph packard have purchased the house from her if she was never located who knows maybe after a year she was assumed dead and her parents got permission to put it on the market somewhere in that file theres a summary of a telephone interview with them the detective in charge of the investigation wanted to know if she had ever shown up where they lived in texas they claimed they hadnt seen her in four years which tells you how close the family was coltrane turned more pages shaking his head baffled the detective notes that the family didnt have a phone the interview took place at the local police station rodriguez said add the abundance of aints and double negatives and you get the impression of a downonhisluck undereducated farmer but his last name isnt chance its chavez the daughters first name isnt rebecca its juanita she changed her name to disguise her hispanic origins i love old movies i love to read about them rodriguez said back in the twenties and thirties you get male stars with ethnic names rudolph valentino and ramon novarro come to mind the studios played up their sultry appearance but i cant think of more than a few female stars im talking major who didnt have a whitebread appearance and name that doesnt mean they were whitebread several of them had ethnic backgrounds but they hid it had to rita hayworths a good example she didnt become famous until the forties but her career started in the thirties she was hispanic her real name was margarita cansino she had dark hair and a widows peak that made her look very spanish at a time when there was a growing prejudice against mexicans so she dyed her hair auburn and plucked out her widows peak to make her hairline look symmetrical she added some voice lessons to get rid of her accent changed her name and managed to assimilate herself it looks to me like rebecca chance did the same here the reference librarian a petite young woman in braids escorted coltrane into a spartan room that had several microfilm machines when youre finished please bring the film back to my desk thanks coltrane said it had been years since he had used this kind of machine but his familiarity with it soon came back after attaching the roll to a spindle on the right at the bottom he fed the film through the machine and linked it to a spindle on the left by twisting a knob he could forward the film past the light that projected and magnified the small print onto the screen the roll was for all the issues of the la times that had been published during the last quarter of which according to the police report coltrane had brought with him was when rebecca chance born juanita chavez had disappeared specifically during the second week of october the missing persons report had been filed on october tenth two days after she failed to show up for work that meant coltrane had only nine issues of the newspaper to spin through before he got to the period of time that interested him but to give himself some context and to avoid missing any seemingly innocent reference to her earlier he made an effort not to speed ahead but rather to take his time and do the job right the headline for the october first issue was about franklin roosevelt and the presidents efforts to deal with the depression a related story described the worsening economic conditions in los angeles international news about fears of a war in europe were next to a report of a local fire in which five children and two adults had burned to death if you werent in a bad mood when you woke up coltrane thought you would be after reading all this as the machines fan whirred preventing the heat of the bulb from burning the microfilm coltrane spooled further on he paid close attention to the entertainment section in each issue but failed to find any mention of rebecca chance even when he got to october tenth the day the police had been told that she was missing he still didnt find any mention of her was the studio keeping her disappearance quiet in order to avoid a scandal if so what kind of scandal on page eighteen two days later october twelfth he finally found it actress missing a story only six inches long that basically summarized what was in the police report she had failed to report for work at universal the studio had grumbled to her agent the agent had tried to phone her and then had gone to her home where no one answered a neighbor said that he hadnt seen any sign of activity in the house including lights for at least a week when police searched the house they found nothing that appeared to have been disturbed or missing an assistant director at the studio said that she was always on time and knew her lines it wasnt like her to fail to be punctual there werent any gaps in her clothes closet to indicate that she had packed and gone on an unannounced trip foul play was suspected a photograph accompanied the article and coltrane had the impression that the article might not have been printed at all if rebecca chance hadnt been so beautiful although the photograph obviously a studio still didnt do her the justice that coltrane knew was possible he had trouble taking his eyes away from it the tone of the article wasnt reverential it didnt treat her as a star that the small piece was buried in the middle of the newspaper reinforced the impression that this was being considered more a crime story than a showbusiness one upandcoming and promising were the words used to describe her at the end of the article coltrane wrote down two titles the films she had most recently appeared in jamaica wind and the trailblazer finishing the issue for october twelfth he continued to the next day and the day after that on page twenty of the latter rebeccas photograph another studio still immediately caught his attention it too couldnt compare to packards amazing depictions of her nonetheless her gaze held his own when he finally broke away and read the article he learned that the only hint of progress in the investigation was that an actress friend at universal had told the police about crank phone calls and obsessive fan mail rebecca had complained about the calls and the letters all seemed to have come from the same person and they were all about the same thing vows of eternal love the eternal part sounded creepy the actress friend said rebecca had apparently thrown the letters away when the police went back to search her house again they couldnt find them the police were speaking to other actresses who might have received similar letters other than that there werent any leads coltrane leaned back in his rigid wooden chair and rubbed his forehead the copy of the police report that rodriguez had given him made no mention of an overinsistent fan did that mean the file was incomplete or did it mean that the police had put no credence in the story the actress friend had told perhaps the actress friend hadnt been such a close friend after all perhaps her only motivation had been to get her name in the newspaper if the police discounted her claims would they have mentioned them in their report this wasnt the only discrepancy coltrane had noted the first article had listed rebeccas age as twentytwo while the missing persons file had given her age as twentyfive a figure supplied by her parents at the same time it had not mentioned rebecca chances real name ohio and not texas was now her home state all of this suggested to coltrane that the newspaper hadnt gotten a look at the police report but had received its information through an intermediary what seemed to coltrane like a studio publicist who was protecting the studios investment in her persisting in its whitebread image of her the effort had worked coltrane scanned the bold print at the start of every article in every issue on the microfilm continuing through to the end of the year feeling an odd sense of time overlapping when he reached december twentyninth the same date as when he now examined the microfilm there were no further references to the disappearance of rebecca chance he rubbed his eyes which felt as if sand had fallen into them stretching his arms he glanced at his watch and blinked with shock a few minutes before six oclock he had been here seven hours jamaica wind yes the trailblazer coltrane nodded never heard of them the purplehaired clerk was about twenty videotapes crammed the shelves behind him im not surprised they never heard of them over at tower video either but they told me that if anybody would know how to get a copy of them itd be you the clerk who also had a ring through his left nostril straightened a little his pride engaged he pulled leonard maltins movie and video guide from beneath the counter and started to leaf through it they had a copy of maltins book over at tower coltrane said these movies arent in it coltrane shook his head well if maltin doesnt list them its a pretty good sign these things have never been shown on tv except maybe since that edition of the book came out coltrane said and maltin himself admits that his book doesnt include every minor film that ever had only a couple of showings at midnight forty years ago the clerk who was wearing an edward scissorhands tshirt pulled another reference book from beneath the desk this one was called a worldwide filmography it was oversized battered and thick he looked through the pages jamaica wind yep it exists i never doubted that universal right guy kibbee william gargan beulah bondi walter catlett rebecca chance coltrane felt his pulse increase sounds like a remake of rain the clerk said what this is almost the same cast as rain but without joan crawford you really do know your movies the clerk who wore a mickey mouse wristwatch straightened with greater pride i try but i have to tell you i never heard of this actress here at the end rebecca chance she had a short career what else was she in that other movie im trying to find the trailblazer lets have a look the clerk flipped to near the back of the book yep same company same year bruce cabot hugh buckler heather angel tully marshall and the clerk made a drumroll with his hands rebecca chance now were getting somewhere the picture was directed by george b seitz who a couple of years later seitz did the last of the mohicans matter of fact some of these actors were in that movie you continue to amaze me in this case its not so amazing the clerk pointed toward a row of film posters above the shelves of videos on the opposite side of the long room one of them tinted orange faded announced the last of the mohicans starring randolph scott scott incredibly young was seen in profile he held a flintlock rifle and wore a buckskin jacket as well as a coonskin cap two indians fought each other in the background at the bottom bold letters proclaimed directed by george bseitz a friend of mines a george b seitz fanatic he gave me that poster to put up personally i dont get whats so special about seitzs work hes sure not orson welles but my friends an expert hes the guy to ask the frail distinguishedlooking whitehaired elderly gentleman had a vandyke beard and a cane bundled in a thick brown cardigan sweater he was waiting at the metal gate of his home in sherman oaks when coltrane parked in front the expansive tudor house was high in the hills the glinting lights of the valley spread out below i didnt realize how late it was coltrane said after he shook hands and introduced himself a cool breeze tugged at his hair if id thought about it i never would have let the guy in the video store call you the elderly man made a think nothing of it gesture his voice was reedy sidney knows i dont go to bed until two or three in the morning anybody who wants to talk about the work of george b seitz is welcome anytime actually seitz isnt why im here the elderly man looked confused what im really interested in is an actress he directed in the trailblazer which actress rebecca chance the elderly man nodded you know about her coltrane asked about her not in the least coltrane felt something deflate inside him i guess ive bothered you for nothing im sorry i wont take up any more of your time but ive seen her work coltrane froze in the act of turning toward his car you came to talk to me about the trailblazer dont you think it would be more satisfying if you watched it watched it i dont have every picture seitz made many of the silents were on film stock that disintegrated before they could be preserved although i do have copies of the most famous ones such as the perils of pauline which he wrote before he became a director the sound pictures he directed are another matter from black magic in to andy hardys blonde trouble in the year seitz died ive managed to track down a print of every film seitz made the dignified gentleman who introduced himself as vincent toler escorted coltrane into his house the living room of which had a screen behind retractable oak panels at one end and a projection room adjacent to the opposite end the two rooms linked via a space behind an andrew wyeth painting that slid to the side toler coltrane learned was a widower a retired neurosurgeon who lived alone he had hated being a neurosurgeon he explained i never wanted to enter medicine but my father who was a doctor bullied me into doing so what i really wanted was to work in the movies in what capacity i had no idea i just knew that was what i loved but my father wouldnt hear of it and i wasnt brave enough to stand up to him after toler retired he had happened to see an andy hardy movie on the american movie classics channel had remembered the delight with which he had watched it as a boy had reexperienced the same delight and had noticed when viewing the movie on its next amc showing that the director was george b seitz that name had meant nothing to him but when he asked the clerk at a video store he frequented the same video store to which coltrane had gone to find other movies that seitz had directed toler had been delighted to discover that seitz had directed almost all the andy hardy movies and many other movies that toler recalled fondly from his youth i started collecting videos but some of seitzs movies werent available on video so the next step was toler indicated the reel of film that he was attaching to the projector its been an interesting hobby you could say that im collecting my youth as he finished setting up toler explained that seitz had invented the cliffhanger serial in and had eventually switched to feature films in making westerns mysteries crime melodramas and comedies he was a professional his pictures were on schedule and underbudget more important he knew how to entertain settling into a plush chair coltrane was surprised that his anticipation of seeing rebecca chance move and speak was making him uneasy after toler turned off the lights and then turned on the projector tinny epical music evocative of rivers plains and mountains obscured the projectors whir simultaneously a beam of light hit the screen showing a brilliant blackandwhite image of a hand that opened a book and revealed the title the trailblazer with seitzs directed by credit below the title coltrane gripped the upholstered arms of his chair as the cast list appeared there wasnt any separate card for the star rather all the actors names appeared together on a list with the stars name at the top rebecca chances was the sixth name down seeing it made coltrane lean forward writers cameraman as the hand continued to turn pages the music built to a dramatic peak and all at once coltrane was startled by the last of the credits produced by winston case coltrane said in shock you recognize the name toler asked from the darkness behind coltrane good lord coltrane thought rebecca chance hadnt only bought cases house she had worked with him they were connected do you know anything about him not a lot this is the only picture he produced for seitz what about rebecca chance was she in any other of seitzs movies no while they spoke the screen showed a wagon train making its way across a prairie a lean tall man in buckskin bruce cabot was leading the pioneers the vista was impressive as was the multilayered sound track the creak of wagon wheels the plod of hooves the jangle of harnesses the dramatic use of sound was amazing given the limitations of recording devices then in use but coltrane didnt care about that all he did care about as he watched intently scanning the crowd of pioneers was a glimpse of i did a little research on case tolers disembodied voice said he started producing in just as sound was coming in except for the trailblazer and one other film he wasnt associated with anything ive heard of that other picture wouldnt be jamaica wind would it how did you know thats the other picture im looking for rebecca chance is in that one also coltrane kept staring at the wagon train it entered a canyon where cabot frowned toward smoke rising from a hollow he told the wagon train to wait while he and one of the pioneers investigated but youve never seen her act toler asked ive only seen stills what made you interested in her avoiding the question coltrane asked when does she appear soon in the hollow cabot galloped to the burning wreckage of a conestoga wagon he found a dead dog with an arrow through it dismounted next to a middleaged man and woman who were sprawled on the ground and checked to see if they were still alive his scowl toward their heads which were discreetly out of camera view made clear that they had been scalped the pioneer who had come with him heard a noise pulled out his handgun crept toward a stream and shouted for cabot to come running movement behind reeds against the bank of the stream revealed a terrified figure emerging from a hiding place the figure was a woman and coltrane became even more attentive trying to identify rebecca chances features but despite her disheveled hair and grimy face it was instantly clear that she wasnt rebecca i keep forgetting shes only a supporting player but she has an important part toler said after the woman had been helped to the wagon train and cared for introducing herself as mary beecham coltrane understood there had been someone else in their party she told cabot sobbing her sister amy the indians who had attacked their wagon had taken her with them because the attack had happened only a few hours earlier there was still a chance to get amy back if a rescue party set out immediately but that would leave the wagon train undermanned and vulnerable the pioneers had to make a moral choice whether to forget about amy look after themselves and keep going or whether to jeopardize the good of the many for the possible good of one person cabots doeeyed looks at mary made clear that he had fallen instantly in love with her he told the pioneers that they could do what they wanted but that he was going to rescue marys sister coltrane had the strong suspicion that cabot was motivated less by wanting to rescue amy than he was by wanting to impress mary in a dramatically staged scene cabot galloped off with six men following the raiding partys tracks while the wagon train proceeded in a different direction coltrane felt lightheaded as the scene shifted and he saw rebecca secured by a rope stumbling next to the raiding party who jeered at her from their horses she too had disheveled hair and grimy features but nothing could obscure her riveting beauty her blouse had been torn revealing more of her right shoulder almost to her upper breast than he had realized was permitted by censors back then similarly her skirt was torn up to her knees exposing her stockings the tantalizing sight of which seemed more sensual than bare flesh would have been the animal quality suggested by her lush tangled hair the insolence in her dark eyes the defiance in her full lips made for as erotic a combination as he had ever seen my god he whispered yes toler said she could have been a star but i never saw her in another movie this was her last she disappeared coltrane watched awestruck as a member of the raiding party tugged the rope and made her stumble a movement that she accomplished with the grace of a dancer while still making it look like a stumble in fact all of her actions had similar grace her body had a sensual fluidness that caused every gesture no matter how trivial to be impossible to look away from when she spoke coltrane wasnt prepared for how wonderfully fullthroated and sonorous her voice was whatever hispanic accent she had brought to hollywood she had worked hard to eliminate she had recreated herself and yet there remained the slightest hint of the origins she was trying to disguise coltrane was so enthralled that he had trouble concentrating when other actors were featured in the story bruce cabot pursued the raiding party overcoming brush fires thunderstorms swollen rivers buffalo stampedes avalanches and ambushes in his determined effort to save the sister of the woman he loved the structure of the film was obviously indebted to the cliffhanger serials that seitz had directed in his youth meanwhile the wagon train overcame similar obstacles a young man had taken over bruce cabots role as expedition leader and was proving himself to be such a hero that mary praying for cabot to come back with her sister had fallen in love with cabots substitute seitz crosscut between the two sets of adventures to build suspense as to whether rebeccas character was still alive her screen time was reduced after an indian angered by her insolence grabbed her long black hair and wielded a knife to cut it off watching cabot scale a cliff and race through a forest coltrane waited with mounting frustration for rebecca to reappear and when she finally did the indian was hurling her off a cliff into a river the fight between cabot and the indian was suspenseful but all coltrane cared about was another glimpse of rebecca who made him inhale sharply when he saw her wading from the river her wet clothes sticking to her her soaked dark hair slicked back against her head and hanging down her back every curve of her body was emphasized it was as if she were one with the water her body gathering substance as she emerged from it retaining the fluid grace of the waves she was venus rising from the water with her head tilted back every magnificent detail of her face was pronounced and if it had earlier seemed questionable that bruce cabot would instantly fall in love with mary beecham there was no strain of credulity at all when he triumphed over the indian and hurried to help rebecca only to see her wading from the sensuous waters and to be overcome with attraction in the end he brought rebecca back to the wagon train where he announced that he and rebecca were going to be married but rebeccas sister had a surprise of her own she was going to be married to the man who had taken bruce cabots place hugs and kisses a good laugh all around no hint whatsoever of the sexual complexities embedded in the story as the camera panned to the snowcapped mountains the music reached a crescendo the end appeared the screen went black in the darkness coltrane heard the camera whirring he heard a chair creak as vincent stood in the darkness presumably to go into the projection room and shut off the machine you said rebecca chance disappeared after making this movie vincents disembodied voice asked coltrane was so enraptured by what he had seen that he had to force himself to speak thats right when i told you i didnt know much about winston case i neglected to tell you all of what i did know vincent said oh this was his last picture too he disappeared after producing it coltrane returned to packards house at two in the morning his circles of confusion not only had come back but were more severe than ever his mind was filled with a welter of overlapping blurs surely the police would have known that rebecca chance wasnt the only person associated with the trailblazer to disappear why hadnt winston cases disappearance also been noted in the newspaper the two incidents would have reinforced each other and made a good story had the studio covered it up or had winston cases disappearance been merely a retreat from the movie business which would have been the same as vanishing from the face of the earth as far as hollywood was concerned in his kitchen the red light on his answering machine was blinking uneasy he pressed the play button mitch are you im beginning to worry jennifer sounded as if shed just walked swiftly from somewhere or was having trouble restraining her emotions have we got a problem duncan reynolds phoned me at the magazine to ask when he could expect the issue that features your collaboration with packard he happened to mention that youd talked to him from new haven the day before and that youd be back in los angeles last night that was certainly news to me without him i wouldnt even have known that you have a telephone and an answering machine over there and what your number is if you dont want to see me fine i have no intention of crowding you but whatevers going on we still have to work together i need those photographs you dont have to bring them over just fedex them but for heavens sake do something i apologize coltrane said the next morning jennifer motioned him toward a chair in front of her desk then closed the door to her office things have been a little hectic he continued i had to meet with nolan then i went to see mccoy in the hospital jennifers stern blue eyes assessed him how is he in pain but feisty as ever if he keeps improving his doctors going to release him in a couple of days good she said flatly and it looks as if the district attorney isnt going to make trouble for me excellent jennifer said without inflection and sometime during the rest of the day couldnt you have found a chance to let me know about all these good things that were happening well maybe im not looking at this properly maybe i was foolish to think that it wasnt just you but the two of us who ran from ilkovic that i had a right to hear what you just told me as it happens i already know about mccoy because i went to see him and i know about the district attorney because i phoned nolan coltrane raised his hands in a gesture of defeat i could have done this better in new haven i got so involved in my memories about my grandparents that i felt too low to talk to anybody when i got back ive been trying to sort some things out and here are the photographs he set the portfolio on the desk thank you i feel as if somebody else took them but the fact is you did and theyre wonderful a lot of terrible things have happened mitch but that doesnt mean you have to turn your back on the good things coltrane sighed look i know i was wrong not to keep in touch i dont want any tension between us what do you say we go to dinner tonight well have that talk we said we were going to have and maybe ill show you a surprise as coltrane headed up a shadowy treelined curving street in sherman oaks jennifer looked at him baffled where are we going to the movies up here its an outoftheway theater well you did say this was going to be a surprise i might as well lie back and enjoy the ride thats the spirit dinner had been at a place called the natural food café lowfat foods no pesticides no preservatives a welcome change from coltranes recent fastfood dietary assaults on his body the grilled salmon wild rice and steamed vegetables had tasted wholesome and soothing his conversation with jennifer had also been soothing a lot of issues having been settled his confusion about himself her confusion about him when i saw you that night covered with mud and ashes and what looked like blood when i saw what you had done to ilkovic i couldnt i felt as if i didnt know you anymore i didnt know myself and then i couldnt get over that youd misled me that you hadnt told me what you were planning to do im not sure i realized what i was planning until i was actually doing it theres a lot to be confused about he touched her hand the best thing i can suggest is that we share our confusion and try to move on together jennifer studied him for the longest time yes he stopped in front of the tudor house on the street above the glinting valley as jennifer got out of the car tightening her shawl against a chill evening breeze she shook her head what are we doing here vincent toler wearing a blue cashmere pullover emerged from the house his cane clicking on the concrete walkway jennifer looked increasingly bewildered good evening mitch the elderly man sounded cheerful good evening vincent and this is jennifer vincent offered his wizened hand welcome jennifer shook his hand not sure what was going on thank you vincent toler i understand youre a movie fan jennifer turned toward coltrane her eyes twinkling with amusement you mean we really are going to see a movie youre coming with us vincent no the two of you are coming with me jennifer immediately looked baffled again as vincent guided them toward the house i collect old movies vincent explained last night mitchell watched the trailblazer with me im beginning to understand over dinner i heard about jennifer looked at coltrane so this is where you saw it why didnt you tell me i didnt want to be predictable and boring youre definitely not that they entered vincents living room which he explained had been converted into a screening area for a oncefamous director who had owned the house in the fifties what was his name jennifer asked when vincent told her she shook her head i dont think i ever heard of him his specialty was comedies his sense of humor fell out of fashion sic transit gloria vincents tone was filled with melancholy at least george b seitz died before he fell out of fashion mitch told me how much he enjoyed the trailblazer he made me wish id seen it with him now that i know the movie were going to watch i cant wait oh vincent said his vandyke beard emphasized the drop of his chin i hope im not going to disappoint you disappoint me you wont be seeing the trailblazer coltrane frowned we wont but i thought i know many collectors of vintage films i made some phone calls this morning and managed to track down the other movie youre interested in youre kidding coltrane sat forward youre telling me you actually found a copy of jamaica wind the projector whirred the screen glinted with a blackandwhite drawing of palm trees and south seas music started playing beneath the title the directors name appeared never heard of this man either jennifer said for good reason im told in the darkness vincent came back from the projection booth the collector friend who loaned me these reels says that this director didnt have a quarter of the skills that seitz had apparently not jennifer said hawaiian music in jamaica god help us coltrane gripped his chair when rebecca chances name appeared cameraman screenwriters produced by winston case jennifer sounded surprised wasnt he the first owner of packards house coltrane kept his gaze fixed on the screen rebecca bought it from him and packard bought it from her and took thousands of pictures of her jennifer said what on earth was going on im hoping this movie will help us find out when coltrane had developed his prints updating packards series about la houses he had gone over each of them with a magnifying glass searching for the slightest imperfection in the darkroom process a bubble in the emulsion a water spot his concentration had been intense but it didnt equal the intensity with which he now stared at the images before him vincent was right the direction of jamaica wind was clumsy compared with seitzs work on the trailblazer coltrane didnt care the movies faults didnt matter rebecca chance was in this movie that was what mattered the plot was about english pirates fighting to unseat a corrupt british governorgeneral the lean dashing mustached hero alternated sword fighting with kissing the heroine the daughter of the governorgenerals aide this is terrible jennifer said coltrane concentrated harder on the screen look at that beach jennifer said it obviously isnt in jamaica it looks more like santa monica i think i see the curve of malibu in the background the camera kept whirring images glinting but wait a minute jennifer said now its a different beach that tropical foliage isnt just a bunch of ferns and palm trees they stuck in the ground theyre real where do you suppose i bet they went down to mexico there she is coltrane sat up rebecca chance emerged from a cluster of vines and totally dominated the screen she turned a piece of junk into a work of art she made the directors clumsiness become insignificant coltrane felt as if a hand pressed upon his chest but the sensation wasnt threatening it was stimulating rebecca chance wore a flowerpatterned sarong that exposed about the same amount of cleavage as the heroines but the heroine looked like a boy compared to her rebeccas lush dark hair hung down to her bare shoulders her left leg was exposed to her exquisite knee her feet were splendidly bare it turned out that she too was in love with the hero and was spying for him a chase through a tropical forest reached a climax when rebecca found herself trapped on a cliff above the sea and escaped by making a spectacular dive into the ocean later when she waded from the ocean coltrane inwardly gasped at the parallel between this scene and the scene in the trailblazer where she was thrown from a cliff and waded from a river both scenes were similar to some of the photographs that packard had taken of her rising from the ocean the same erotic association with water and waves in the end she was killed when she showed the hero and his men an underwater passage into the fortress the hero and his men displayed appropriate grief and anger pressed on with their assault defeated the governorgeneral and freed his prisoners one of whom was the heroine hugs and kisses sad words about rebeccas passing homilies about freedom music up fade out what junk jennifer said what a beautiful woman coltrane whispered im sorry mitch i didnt hear you i said she has incredible screen presence no question she could have been a star as coltrane continued to stare at the blank screen vincent turned on the lights then excused himself ill go make some coffee the moment he was out of earshot jennifer told coltrane but we didnt learn anything to help us understand why packard took so many pictures of her then hid them we didnt learn that but we did learn something did you recognize the cliff she dove from should i have its the same cliff she stood on when packard photographed her coltrane said one cliffs pretty much the same as no this one has a distinct rock formation farther along its edge it reminds me of a cat arching its back i didnt notice any rock formation in any of the photographs of her on the cliff i guess ive had more time to study them jennifer frowned you saw a similar rock formation on the cliff in this movie you watched it that closely to make sure ill ask vincent to replay the scene yes jennifer said without enthusiasm by all means ask him to replay it i had a good time coltrane said to go to dinner he had picked jennifer up at the southern california offices on melrose now he stopped next to jennifers bmw in the almostdeserted parking area behind the building im glad we finally had a chance to talk we need to talk more she said i know what you mean what ilkovic put us through i dont think well ever get over the person i had in mind was rebecca chance we need to talk more about your interest in her how about tomorrow night coltrane asked new years eve i was wondering if you were going to suggest doing anything an appropriate night the end of the past the start of the future but what about the present they studied each other coltrane leaned close kissing her gently on the lips feeling the brush of his skin against hers when he eased back he gazed into her eyes assessing her reaction wondering if hed done the right thing thats something else we havent done in a long time jennifer said when he kissed her a second time her mouth opened her tongue found his with her body against him he felt a tingle flood through him anything special youd like to do tomorrow night he asked more of what were doing now that can be arranged maybe ill even distract you from rebecca chance jealous of her you talked an awful lot about her tonight jennifer said the photographs of her dont make you curious the only person im curious about is you they kissed again hungrily jennifer broke away breathless what time tomorrow im suddenly thinking about right now cant jennifer inhaled the end of the year or not i have an eight oclock breakfast with my most important advertiser i have to look alert six tomorrow night coltrane asked come over to my place ill make my famous marinara sauce which place is that i dont understand your town house or oh coltrane realized what she was getting at packards the furnitures going to be delivered tomorrow i thought youd like to see it yes and no packards house has unpleasant associations for me thats another reason we have to use new years eve to put the past behind us coltrane waited until jennifer got into her car and drove away her red taillights disappearing around a corner he thought for a moment then picked up his car phone and pressed numbers vincent im sorry to call you this late but i remembered that you told me you didnt go to bed until two or three in the morning i was wondering if youd do me a favor id be glad to pay for any expenses it involves i dont care what it costs before you return jamaica wind to your collector friend would you ask him if we could take it to a duplicating studio and have it transferred onto videotape it would be a way of protecting the movie also would you mind doing the same with your copy of the trailblazer id very much like to have copies of them eight stieglitz when coltrane returned to packards house he went straight to the vault and for the first time ignored the lifesize face of rebecca chance gazing at him from the darkness of her sanctuary he was too compelled pivoting toward the shelves on the right he picked up stack after stack of boxes and carried them out to the shelves in the vault stieglitz he thought again driving home he had been unable to stop marveling about how unique it was for a photographer of packards genius to have devoted so much of his output to a single person indeed he could think of only one other photographer who had done so the most influential in the medium alfred stieglitz who during and had obsessively taken pictures of his lover and eventual wife the painter georgia okeeffe these photographs and others taken in later years amounted to more than three hundred although there were rumors that after stieglitzs death okeeffe had prevented the release of many others perhaps even destroying them randolph packard had been infamous for his arrogance but he had been humble in his appreciation of genius and like every other great photographer during stieglitzs lifetime he had made a pilgrimage to new york to learn from the master packards first meeting with stieglitz had been at stieglitzs celebrated gallery an american place in two years before he took the photograph of rebecca chances house and twelve years after stieglitz had taken the bulk of his passionate photographs of georgia okeeffe had stieglitz shown packard the okeeffe portraits had the idea of a pictorial monument to rebecca chance occurred to packard because of stieglitzs influence if so some of the photographs would have been pausing only long enough to verify that the humped rock formation in the photographs of rebecca on the cliff was in fact the same as the formation on the cliff she had leapt from in jamaica wind coltrane hurriedly set aside the boxes he had previously looked at each night when he had responded helplessly to the urge to come down here he had been eager to sort through the entire collection but had never gotten past three of the boxes to have rushed through such an abundance of beauty would have been gluttony but now rushing was exactly what coltrane did opening box after box sorting through their contents as quickly as he could without risking damage to the images the late hour and the glare of the overhead lights made his head pound his hands trembled with apprehension that he was wrong with anticipation that he was right his emotions twisted and tugged five boxes eight twelve their contents occupied shelf after shelf photographs of rebecca chance on horseback on a sailboat on a diving board a forest path a garden terrace a stone staircase a sunbathed balcony fifteen eighteen of rebecca chance in evening clothes in slacks and a blouse in jodhpurs a swimming suit a gardening dress a flowerpatterned skirt a white top and an even whiter shawl the full impact of the amount of photographs that packard had taken of rebecca chance was stunning these many pictures no wonder packard hadnt produced many new photographs he wouldnt have had the opportunity developing so many photographs and packard always developed his own work would have taken a lifetime although coltrane was fervently convinced that his logic was correct his hands trembled with despondency as he reached the final box and fumbled to lift its lid expecting disappointment as a consequence he wasnt prepared the first nude photograph rendered him powerless his legs became rigid his body turned to stone his breathing stopped the most arousing photograph he had ever seen showed rebecca chance naked and yet covered draped with the chromium beads that hung on the walls of the dining room upstairs she leaned with her customary natural grace against the blackness of the wall beyond the beads she was angled slightly to the left her head and body almost in profile but not quite both of her eyes visible directed unashamedly toward the camera light came from the left contributing a sheen to her lush black hair making her dusky skin seem to glow and her dark eyes seem to have something burning within them at the same time the light reflected off the strings of chromium beads causing them to gleam with the simultaneous evocation of ice and fire the image had so tactile an illusion that coltrane could feel those coldhot beads on his own skin they seemed to caress him all the while promising to move and expose more of rebecca chances magnificent body the gleaming beads contrasting with the large dark nipples that projected from among them as well as with the even darker silken pubic hair past which they dangled coltranes penis hardened the unwilled motion broke his paralysis causing strength to return to his legs his hands frozen in the act of setting the boxs lid to the side resumed their activity trembling as he placed the lid on the shelf his breath returned air coursing into him filling his lungs reducing the lightheadedness that had increasingly overtaken him while he stared at the picture but his dizziness was only partially abated for he felt he was falling into the photograph his erection became harder conscious of his body as much as he was of hers he thought i was right stieglitz had shown the way of the hundreds of photographs that stieglitz had taken of georgia okeeffe an astonishing number of them were the most meticulous loving nude shots that any man had ever taken of any woman sometimes it seemed that stieglitz had commemorated every inch of okeeffes body her expressive hands yes and her breasts and her eyes but also her elbows and knees the cleft in her hips and the soles of her feet the curve of her shoulder blades parts of her that to coltranes knowledge had never been the subject of a closeup portrait but that stieglitzs amazingly intimate photographs evoked one critic had been almost frightened by the power of stieglitzs portraits of okeeffe describing them as primal implying that stieglitz thought of okeeffe as the great earth mother but in packards naked depiction of rebecca chance she wasnt the mother but the lover of us all coltrane thought overwhelmed he turned to the other photographs in the box finding more nude portraits each more candid and beautiful than the one before none was as artistically staged as the one he had first seen but each was a work of art because rebecca chance was a work of art her unclothed body its smooth curves indentations and ridges was mysterious at the same time daunting so powerful in its frank presentation of sexual womanhood that it caused coltrane to react not only with desire but also with awe rebecca chance didnt pose so much as present herself before the camera allowing herself to be photographed gazing unabashedly into the lens she was so at home with her female nature that coltrane had to fight feeling embarrassed about his sexual reaction to her he examined more photographs and came to a remarkable sequence in which packard had done what stieglitz only hinted at with georgia okeeffe photographing literally every inch of rebecca chances body her ears the top of her head the nape of her neck the area beneath her arms the inside of her thighs the backs of her knees there was no area so commonplace or private that packard had not taken a picture of in closeup what made the sequence so moving was the devotion with which packard had recorded the separate parts of the object of his obsession as if in the thoroughness of his subdivision of her he could multiply her beauty coltrane reached the last of the nude photographs and felt emotionally exhausted bracing himself against a shelf he closed his eyes inhaled deeply and mustered the energy to begin putting all the photographs back into their boxes his hands felt numb his heart pounded despite his closed eyes he continued to see rebecca chance naked gazing at him raising his eyelids he took one more look at the final nude photograph before him then managed to put all of them away upstairs on the sleeping bag next to the increasingly patheticlooking artificial christmas tree in the living room coltrane fell into a black doze almost immediately on previous nights ilkovic had haunted his dreams turning them into nightmares but tonight it was rebecca chances arms that reached for him her naked body pressing against him careful the paunchy foreman told the two young men who were working with him they all wore blue shirts that had the same logo as was on the side of the blue semitruck pacific movers they opened the back of the truck the right and left hatches slamming against each side after securing the hatches they pulled out a ramp from a slot beneath the truck the ramp making a scraping sound that grated against coltranes nerves while the workers hooked the ramp into place coltrane walked toward the open rear and saw stacks of furniture hidden by generous amounts of protective blankets careful the paunchy foreman repeated and now coltrane realized that the man was talking to him not his young coworkers youd better stay out of the way sometimes stuff falls or one of these guys might trip i hope not the last thing we want is a client to get hurt im not worried about me dont let anything happen to the furniture no problem there ive been doing this for twenty years but the young men obviously hadnt they looked barely older than twenty uneasy coltrane backed away watching them mount the ramp and begin undraping blankets from the first layer of furniture his chest felt warm when he saw a glimmer of metal he was suddenly looking at a chair but he had never seen any furniture like it so simple and yet so aesthetically pleasing the chairs legs and sides were composed of steel tubes the gray hue of which was polished to a sheen the seat and back had clean straight lines black suede over a padded reinforcing material it invited being touched which coltrane almost did as one of the young men carried the chair past him at the bottom of the ramp the second young man followed with another chair where do you want them the foreman asked looking up from a clipboard in the dining room coltrane led the way into the house in the living room the miniature christmas tree and the sleeping bags were no longer in evidence the dining rooms to the left nice house thanks ive never seen anything like it the foreman turned to the young men okay put the chairs against the dining room wall so they wont get in the way hold it those walls are covered with strings of chromium beads coltrane said i definitely havent seen anything like that and so it went the young men unloading furniture while the foreman didnt do anything but make check marks on his clipboard then follow his helpers into the house to be certain that nothing was damaged four more dining room chairs then the dining table itself glasstopped rectangular with rounded corners a steel frame supporting the glass top and steel legs the foreman used a soft cloth to wipe smudges of dust from the glass top not a scratch he looked at coltrane for confirmation the living room furniture was framed by aluminum tubes that were coated a shiny black the tubes were arranged horizontally eight inches apart forming low cages with high backs the effect was vaguely industrial a glorification of mechanization that had been prevalent back in the late twenties and early thirties but the design was so harmonious that it felt liberating thick wide cushions were set into the frames and against the backs the material was red satin three chairs and an lshaped sofa filled the living room glasstopped side tables coffee tables and wall tables filled more of the space as did a chromium cabinet so much glass and polished metal made the living room gleam standing in a corner telling the young men where he wanted them to set the pieces coltrane began to feel tugged toward the past oddly though the past seemed the present the furniture had been designed so long ago that it seemed new and fresh mister ive been hauling furniture half my life the foreman said i gotta tell you this stuff is definitely different but do you like it whats not to like the junk i sometimes have to deliver but this is solid look at the sweat on these kids faces from lifting all this metal nothing flimsy here no danger of this stuff falling apart style reminds me of a real old movie i saw on cable the other night it had furniture like this im not a dressup kind of guy but being here makes me feel we ought to be wearing tuxedos and drinking martinis hey he turned to his helpers were supposed to be movers lets get a move on coltrane turned to watch them go for more furniture and he wasnt prepared to find that duncan reynolds had come through the open front door duncan looked more surprised than coltrane was in fact he seemed startled his usually florid face was pale emphasizing the numerous colors on his sport coat his mouth hung open duncan whats the matter are you all right i came to see your reaction when the furniture was eyes wide duncan surveyed the living room to find out if you were satisfied with shocked he pointed toward the sofa then the chairs then the end tables how did whats wrong nothing thats the problem nothings wrong everythings just as i remember it exactly as i remember it but that cant how could you possibly have what are you talking about the furnitures in the same places where randolph preferred it twentyfive years ago a few months after i started working for him the day he first showed me this house the furniture was positioned exactly as it is now randolph told me it had been that way when he bought it that he had never varied it that he never wanted it to be varied it never was until it was taken away to be auctioned and now youve arranged it so it looks precisely as when i first saw it i almost expect to see randolph stroll upstairs from working in the darkroom how did how could you have known where to i had help from some photographs duncans mystification deepened ive been doing research coltrane said duncan stepped nearer anxious for an explanation i figured a house designed by lloyd wright would have attracted attention when it was built yesterday i went to the library to see what i could learn about it the reference librarian showed me a yearly subject index for every article that was published in every major magazine so i started in when this house was built i looked under lloyd wrights name in the index and i got a reference to him right away an article about him in an architectural magazine that isnt published anymore but was fairly trendy back in the thirties architectural views excellent library that we have in la the periodical department has every issue of that magazine on microfilm so i had a look turns out this house received a lot of attention when it was built the article had an analysis of lloyd wrights design it also had photographs interiors as well as exteriors each room including the furniture coltrane gestured toward the living room all i did was imitate the arrangement of the furniture as it was shown in the photographs you dont suppose randolph took the photographs thats what i wondered coltrane said but i didnt have to look at each photograph for more than a second to decide that the images were so uncomposed and poorly lit that they couldnt possibly be his work i strained my eyes a little trying to read the fine print on the microfilm the photo credit went to someone whose name i didnt recognize duncan calmed himself for a moment i thought you might have discovered some randolph packard photographs that no one knew about wouldnt that have been something if i had coming through the overweight supervisor led the way for his two young assistants who were carrying more black metal tubes i dont know what this is but im guessing its a bed frame kingsize or regular when we get all these pieces assembled im betting its a king master bedroom top floor you heard the man the foreman said to his helpers the troop disappeared trudging upward duncan watched in a daze duncan uh what duncan turned blinking the other day you mentioned that randolph owned an estate in mexico duncans face didnt change expression but something in his eyes did becoming wary you said that randolph used various shell corporations when he was buying property so that no one would know the true buyer you said randolph bought this house that way and a place in mexico now that i think about it i suppose i did mention something about that i was wondering where the estate was duncans gaze remained guarded what makes you ask just curious randolph had such a unique way of viewing things i thought the hacienda might be as dramatic as this house it might be worth going down to mexico to have a look duncan answered too quickly i wouldnt know from upstairs coltrane heard the faint clang of metal tubes being bolted together careful he heard the foreman say you wouldnt know if id find it interesting to visit the estate coltrane asked i wouldnt know where it is i was never there duncan looked up the stairs toward the metallic sounds randolph never told me some place in baja california i think he might have mentioned thats too bad sorry i cant be more helpful it probably doesnt matter for all i know it isnt as unique as this house or it hasnt been preserved the way this place has did randolph still own it when he died duncan looked away years ago he mentioned something about selling a property in mexico well coltrane said it was just a thought careful the foreman repeated id like to speak to mr blaine coltrane said into the telephone may i tell him whos calling the receptionist replied coltrane gave his name ive been having some discussions with him about the estate of a deceased client of his randolph packard the receptionists voice came to attention randolph packard im buying a house he owned and i need some further information i know its new years eve afternoon coltrane tried to sound selfdeprecating he chuckled or whatever today is called the receptionist sounded amused yes ive been having the same problem anyway mr blaine probably has a ton of work he still needs to finish but i was hoping he could spare a few minutes for me in death as in life packards name got results twenty seconds later an unctuous baritone was on the line mr coltrane i trust that your arrangements are proceeding satisfactorily totally in fact im so pleased that i was wondering if another property mr packard owned might be available for sale if youre referring to the house in newport beach it was given to his assistant youd have to speak with him about that no i was thinking of a property in mexico mexico i believe its in baja california the baritone sounded confused no im not familiar with it coltrane glanced down in disappointment his suspicions having proven groundless i guess it must have been sold years ago the only property im familiar with that randolph packard owned in mexico isnt in baja excuse me its on the western main coast of mexico much farther south than baja below acapulco in fact near a town called i cant remember it in spanish but in english its very distinctive the spine of the cat what thats the name of the town espalda del gato coltrane asked im impressed your spanish is very good i spent a lot of time in spanishspeaking countries if theres a way for me to see the place if its still in mr packards name maybe id be interested in buying it also coltrane said i cant help you with that its out of my hands the hacienda was a bequest in mr packards will the title was transferred a week ago coltrane couldnt hide his frustration to whom can you tell me against my advice mr packard didnt transfer all of his assets to a trust the hacienda in mexico was one of the items that he neglected to include if he had included it the bequest could have been handled privately without involving a california court but because the hacienda was included in a will it has to go through probate itll be a matter of public record i could put you through the inconvenience of going to the court house i dont see why thats necessary however mr packard gave the mexican property to someone named natasha adler natasha adler i have no association with the woman i cant tell you a thing about her do you have her address and phone number that information was not included in the will i had to hire a private investigator to find her im afraid id be violating her privacy if i told you where she lived damn it coltrane thought now if theres nothing else i can help you with blaine said maybe one thing the baritone had a hint of impatience in his voice yes would you mind telling me the name of the investigator you used cheers cheers coltrane and jennifer clicked glasses of absolut and tonic jennifer sipped from hers and wrinkled her nose its like with champagne the bubbles are ticklish maybe you need more vodka and less tonic coltrane said then the rest of me would be ticklish jennifer wore a black armani dress the hem of which came up just above the knee its top ended where her breasts began pearl earrings and a matching necklace couldnt compete with her smile taking another sip she surveyed the living room i expected the furniture to look striking but not this much its really i dont know what word to use fantastic i feel as if im in that wing of the museum of modern art the one where they have furniture thats considered art does that mean you feel the house has changed enough for you to give it another chance you dont still associate it with ilkovic it feels different now good as if im in the s thats the illusion i want to create i want this to be a haven from the present it seems to me that the presents still here though before coltrane could ask what she meant she added is it safe to sit on this stuff of course coltrane laughed tentatively jennifer lowered herself onto the red velvet cushion of a black tubeenclosed chair so far so good it didnt collapse the man in charge of the crew who delivered it assured me that this stuff was made to last it certainly has after all these years its as shiny as new jennifer took a long sip of vodka and tonic youre certain duncan lied to you about the place in mexico it wasnt so much what he said he told me he had a vague memory that it had been sold some time ago that maybe it was in baja no big deal but there was a nervous look behind his eyes maybe he just needed a drink not everythings a mystery i phoned the private investigator packards attorney uses i got lucky and caught him in for five hundred dollars he looked in his files and told me that natasha adler the woman who inherited the estate lives up in malibu her numbers unlisted but he gave me that too jennifer raised her glass to her lips the drink did nothing to relax her increasingly troubled expression i dont see what you hope to accomplish id like to know why packard gave it to her maybe she was a friend or a business acquaintance fine but if she knows the estate maybe she can tell me something about it such as whether parts of jamaica wind were filmed there and whether shes ever heard of rebecca chance jennifer shook her head arent you curious coltrane asked professionally sure those photographs are a major discovery its important to learn when they were taken who the subject was what sort of relationship packard had with her that information doesnt make the photographs any more brilliant than they already are but as a magazine publisher i can tell you human interest adds incalculable monetary value that raises the question of when youre going to tell packards estate about them without being specific i did some checking with an attorney as i understand it you have a claim to own the photographs but the right to reproduce them belongs to packards trustees youre going to have to come to an arrangement with them when im ready coltrane bit his lower lip you said professionally excuse me you told me that professionally you were interested in the photographs you emphasized the word implying i suppose that you werent interested personally not the way you are the way you talk about rebecca chance its like shes a living breathing person last night you asked me if i was jealous of her maybe i am a little its almost as if what youre falling in love with her coltrane didnt comment jennifer finished her drink time for a refill you bet its new years eve after all and if were not going to starve id better start the marinara sauce coltrane walked with her through the dining room and into the kitchen a smaller version of the glasstopped steelrimmed dining table was against a wall i guess i shouldnt be too hard on duncan about possibly lying to me i wasnt exactly honest with him either oh coltrane refilled jennifers glass adding a lime wedge and ice cubes i told him i knew how the furniture was supposed to be arranged because i had seen the layout in an old architectural magazine not true then if you didnt find out from a magazine the photographs we found in the vault by now ive had a chance to go through all of them it turns out that several of the pictures of rebecca chance were taken in this house and as you might expect from anything packard did those photographs are as clear and crisp as can be i had no trouble using them as a guide to arrange the tables and chairs and things jennifer studied him i also found some interesting photos of a different sort coltrane said jennifer studied him harder nudes the moment coltrane said it he wished that he hadnt nudes jennifer said flatly you know the type of thing stieglitz took of georgia okeeffe yes i know exactly the type you mean show them to me crossing the vault jennifer said no shivers anymore coltrane furrowed his brow in puzzlement this vault used to give you the creeps jennifer said it made you claustrophobic oh that well i guess ive been coming down here enough that i got used to it yes you definitely did get used to it its cool enough in here to give me the shivers jennifer rubbed her bare arms here coltrane took off his sport coat and draped it around her shoulders thanks better his hands lingered on her shoulders much jennifer turned to him spreading her palms against his shirt his nipples reacted a gentle kiss lengthened becoming forceful they held each other so where are these nude photographs jennifer asked you havent changed your mind maybe ive got a kinky streak taking his arms from around her coltrane released the catches that held the wall in place when he pulled the section free jennifer stared at rebecca chances lifesize features the harsh light from the vault dispelled the darkness of the chamber the photographs eyes reflected the illumination shes much more beautiful here than in the movie i saw jennifer said coltrane had left the box containing the nude photographs on top of the others he carried it out to one of the shelves and took off the lid stepping forward jennifer stared down at the image of rebecca chance in the dining room upstairs the strings of chromium beads draped over her naked body slowly she turned to the next photograph and the next the room was so still that the only sounds coltrane heard were the subtle scrape of the photographs and jennifers tense breathing she kept turning the pictures at last she was finished well her nipples jennifer said coltrane had no idea what reaction to have expected from her but this certainly was not one that he could have predicted the nipples and the aureoles around them jennifer said i dont understand mine are different from hers coltrane found himself blushing i wasnt trying to imply that that hers are more attractive than mine they are rebecca chance was an astonishingly beautiful woman she was blessed by nature but thats not what im getting at my nipples are small the width of the tip of my little finger rebecca chances are as wide as the tip of my index finger the aureoles around my breasts arent pronounced the way rebecca chances are and i could get my nipples and aureoles to start looking like hers however youre talking about surgery if i got pregnant coltranes heartbeat lurched you think she was pregnant i suspect it was her first time i dont see any stretch marks to indicate that she previously had had a baby id say she was about three months along still able to keep her stomach flat but she couldnt keep her breasts from getting fuller and the nipples larger as the photographs progressed the glow on her face and the luster on her skin make me think that some powerful hormones had started to kick in pregnant coltrane said with wonder then looked with new eyes at the photographs so the obvious questions are who was the father was he packard and assuming that the child was born whatever happened to it coltrane arched his back and tilted his head upward a surge of pleasure seizing his body moving slowly he tried not to disrupt the delicate balance between immediate need and exquisite postponement jennifer kissed him thrusting against him dont hold back moving faster he felt her urgent rhythm match his own climaxing he felt as if the present stretched on forever too soon time became separate moments and he eased out of jennifer settling next to her neither moved streetlights glinted through the bedrooms open blinds a breeze made tree branches sway casting wavering shadows across the darkened room she turned onto her side facing him its been a long time too long well have to catch up the spirit is willing but the flesh might be weak ill see what i can do to put some strength back into it some food might help too if i dont start making that marinara sauce pretty soon no jennifer touched his cheek lie there awhile longer its a great way to end what in other respects was an awfully bad year coltrane said in one respect it wasnt such a bad year you took some wonderful photographs you found a new direction for your work coltrane shrugged your work still doesnt seem important to you not compared to everything that happened they lapsed into silence jennifer was the first to speak when you were making love to me did it occur to you that rebecca chance and randolph packard might have made love in this bed no it did to me i imagined that she and i had changed places did the nude photographs of her excite you a little did they make you more eager to have sex i suppose jennifer lowered her hand from his face and drew it along his body fondling him like this excites you yes good when jennifer kissed him he tasted the salt of a tear on her cheek because i cant compete with her mitch im not a goddess im only a woman although the morning was bright and the sky clear a cold breeze at least by southern california standards made coltrane retreat from the patio outside his bedroom brrr he said cinching his robe tighter turning toward jennifer who still lay in his bed i was hoping we could have coffee out there but im afraid it would have to be iced coffee its nicer in here anyhow jennifer said she raised the covers giving him a glimpse of her breasts her inwardcurved tummy and her lightcolored pubic hair gesturing for him to crawl under and join her thats the best offer ive had all day and the days young yet jennifer said youre going to wear me out as long as i didnt wear this guy out she pointed toward the erection that he showed when he slipped off his robe since when did you like talking dirty he eased under the covers feeling her warmth you call that talking dirty at the very least id call it suggestive and what do you call this im a little distracted at the moment maybe the word will come to me if you do it again something better come and the days young yet jennifer had said but she was wrong about implying that there would be more opportunities in the day for them to make love for after they collapsed into each others arms after they nestled against each other got up to take turns showering and finally dressed jennifer told him that she was expected at her parents house around one oclock you remember from last year jennifer said its a tradition i always go over and help dad watch his marathon of new years day football games you want to come with me he and mom will be glad to see you and therell be more than enough food you seemed to enjoy yourself last time i did it was fun but im afraid im going to have to beg off oh jennifers voice was frail with disappointment yes i promised gregs widow that id come over and spend some time with her and the kids oh the inflection was now one of understanding i didnt know youd spoken with her i guess it slipped my mind ive never met her but please tell her im very sorry about her husband i will that coffee you mentioned would sure taste good right now the kitchen was a mess from the marinara and meatball dinner that coltrane had made the dishes having been left in the sink while they finished a bottle of champagne and watched a tv celebrity narrate the countdown in times square coltrane had only a dim memory of the two of them stumbling up to his bedroom ouch jennifer said surveying the damage im going to need that coffee to brace myself to help with this forget it coltrane said come on well go out for breakfast when they got back at twelvethirty they lingered in front of the house if your visit with gregs widow ends early come over to my parents jennifer said i will coltrane said wish them a happy new year for me jennifer looked uncertain about something would you do me a favor what get a camera and take my picture take your picture its a new year jennifer said a new beginning it would make me happy to see you taking photographs again if it would make you happy it would make me happy a minute later he was back with his nikon positioning jennifer against the ivylooking greenish blue copper trim on the corner of the house the background makes you look even more blond coltrane said in fact you look radiant as her eyes brightened the way he had hoped they would in response to his compliment coltrane snapped the picture nine greg s widow turned out to have a house full of company her parents her sister friends from where she worked at an insurance company friends from the police department not to mention neighbors paying their respects they came and went although gregs widow looked as if she hadnt been getting much sleep she was making an effort to cook a turkey for the holiday but it was clear that there wouldnt be enough to feed everyone and coltrane stayed only an hour leaving well before dinner hollow he decided not to return to packards house but instead to take jennifer up on her offer and go over to her parents historic victorian near echo park the quickest way to get there from venice was to take the santa monica freeway east until it merged with the golden state freeway eventually reaching the east end of sunset boulevard which wasnt far from echo park he was surprised then when he went in the opposite direction taking the santa monica freeway west to the pacific coast highway he finally admitted to himself that his destination was malibu when coltrane had first arrived in los angeles seventeen years earlier feeling a compulsion to learn as much as he could about the area he had been intrigued to learn that malibu for him the name had mythic overtones was actually many different places the commune where upperechelon showbusiness personalities lived within a guarded gated community the beachfront where narrow twostory town houses abutted one another for what seemed miles a narrow road in front the ocean in back a long string of gas stations motels and quickfood restaurants along the pch and farther north where the ocean and the highway diverged a rustic community of expensive homes on large wooded lots reached by mazelike meandering roads that for the most part did not have an ocean view coltrane could smell the salt breeze he had the sensation of being near water apart from that he could have been in an exclusive section of the san fernando valley it was along one of these meandering roads that coltrane now drove pausing occasionally to check a map that he had bought at a service station on the pacific coast highway before turning off it he continued west or as much as he could in that general direction sometimes having to retreat because of errors he made due to unmarked streets other times reaching a dead end where the map made it seem that the road he was on connected with another in frustration he finally stopped where a wall of scrub brush blocked his way a path led through it as much as he could tell the road he wanted lay beyond it glancing at his watch seeing that the time was already almost three oclock and that he was close to wasting the day he calculated that it might take him another twenty minutes to backtrack and get over to the road he wanted that was assuming the road would be marked and he wouldnt have more difficulty finding it why bother when his destination was practically before him jennifers request that he take her photograph had produced the effect she intended responding to old habits he had brought his camera with him now he slung it around his neck after getting out of his car and locking it he buttoned his sport coat against the increasing chill of the day and pushed his way through the crackling branches of the scrub brush he heard the pounding of surf before he saw the ocean below him he was on a steep ridge that looked down on the road he wanted a line of impressive homes hugging the coast no one in sight in contrast with malibus famous beaches the shoreline here was almost entirely gray rock intrigued by the whitecaps hitting those rocks as well as by the red tile roofs on some of the homes coltrane raised his camera chose a fast shutter speed to freeze the waves and took several photographs then he made his way carefully down a zigzag path on the bluff some of which had been eroded by the recent heavy rains he grasped an exposed tree root to help lower himself clawed at clumps of grass dug his heels firmly into the soft soil and finally reached the bottom where concrete barriers had been put up to protect against mud slides the surf pounded louder and yet he was terribly conscious of the noise of his breathing its just from the exertion of coming down the slope he told himself sure when he reached a missionstyle home he saw that the number on the mailbox was but he was looking for so he proceeded farther along too preoccupied to pay attention to the creecreecree of seagulls floating overhead yesterday after he had obtained natasha adlers address and telephone number from the private investigator that packards attorney used he had called that number and been frustrated when a computerized voice had told him that the number was no longer in service had the investigator given him the wrong information or had natasha adler moved maybe shes living in the estate in mexico now coltrane thought continuing along the road he passed another missionstyle home then a spanish colonial but his gaze was directed toward a house farther along which his count of the remaining mailboxes told him was the address he wanted it was substantial sprawling modernistic an assemblage of twostory allwhite blocks silhouetted against the stark blue sky tinted by the lowering sun struck by the geometry of the image he again raised his camera the contrast of light and shadow might be hard to capture he knew so he adjusted his exposure to favor the middle shadows of the image and took the photograph as a precaution he made two further exposures the first favoring darker elements of the image the second favoring lighter ones the technique known as bracketing would give him a choice of contrasts having pressed the shutter button a final time he lowered the camera and felt as if he had been away for a moment it was a feeling that he hadnt experienced since the day he had come upon packards house and taken the last photographs in his update on packards series he began to realize how truly numbed he had been by the intervening horrors a new year a new start he thought recalling jennifers encouragement before they had separated earlier in the day then what am i doing here like most malibu shoreline homes the house was close to the road on the right a tall metal fence enclosed a small garden on the left a red porsche was parked in the short driveway the closed doors of a twocar garage beyond it otherwise no vehicles were in sight at least someones home coltrane thought he verified that the number on the mailbox was what he wanted and now what he asked himself are you going to knock on the door in the middle of the afternoon on new years day thatll certainly make an impression he peered through the metal fence toward the front windows looking for movement in the house some indication that a family gathering was in progress the windows were blank eyes the rooms were still maybe i wouldnt be interrupting anything he thought maybe knocking on the door wouldnt be as inappropriate as i first thought if i come back and knock on the door tomorrow or the day after ill still be intruding barely aware of the ornate shrubs in the garden he approached the front door instead of knocking he pushed the doorbell and heard it ring hollowly inside after waiting a moment he pushed it again the echoing doorbell making the place seem deserted he rang it a third time holding it a little longer someone has to be home he thought otherwise why would the porsche be in the driveway whoever lives here wouldnt have gone on a trip and left an expensive sports car in the open he switched from ringing the bell to knocking on the door but still no one answered maybe a couple are making love in there he thought maybe if i keep ringing this bell and they finally do open the door theyll be very explicit about how much ive annoyed them im here to get some questions answered not to antagonize the person i need to answer those questions selfconscious he hesitated his finger an inch away from the doorbell yeah tomorrows better except maybe no one will answer the door then either if only the phone was in service retreating to the road coltrane scanned the front windows to see if anyone was peering out at him and finally he decided to give up i should have gone with jennifer he thought but as he prepared to walk back the way he had come he suddenly realized that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for the presence of the car and the failure of anyone to come to the door when he rang the bell whoevers here is outside walking along the ocean he moved toward the left side of the house intending to use the space between this house and the next to give him access to the shore a wall blocked his way on the right side a similar wall stopped him his excitement changing to frustration he noticed that all the other homes had barriers preventing outsiders from intruding on the beach when he walked past the remaining properties he discovered a fence that went down to the waterline the creecreecree of the gulls became more pronounced the crash of waves intensified as he stepped around the end of the fence his shoes getting wet its one thing to ring a doorbell and disturb someone on new years day but its quite another if i come across someone taking a walk he thought it would be natural for us to say hello it wouldnt seem as intrusive for me to explain who i am and to ask a few questions approaching the rear of the house he saw a white deck perched over shelves of uneven gray rock that led down to the ocean stretching in both directions the shelves of rock glistened as the spray from waves drifted over them but no one walked along those rocks the shore was deserted coltrane shook his head forced to admit that for today at least he truly had wasted his time he began to turn to go back to the road then stopped as movement among the rocks attracted his attention narrowing his eyes against the glare of the lowering sun how could the sun be so bright and the air so shiveringly cool he thought he was hallucinating for the movement wasnt just among the rocks it was the rocks one of them was rising from the others his skin prickled he shivered harder but no longer from the cold the gray hump of rock rose higher emerging from the shelf what am i seeing coltrane asked himself compelled to step forward at once something equally startling happened for as the hump of rock rose high enough to detach itself from the shelf coltrane saw that the rock had an oval of white within the gray a face gray arms detached themselves one of them reaching up toward what had become a head and neck a gray hand pulled at the gray on the head and to coltranes amazement peeled it off as if it were skin revealing lush dark hair that clung wetly to the head of an amazingly beautiful woman what he had been seeing coltrane realized was a woman in a wet suit emerging from the ocean the gray rubber of the suit was the same color as the shelves of rock rising from the waves she had seemed to be born from them immediately he raised his camera opened the aperture so that the waves would be indistinct behind her and pressed the button as the woman emerged from the ocean her pose was so familiar that he felt he had to be hallucinating he took another photograph then another each time stepping closer noticing him the woman paused one leg in front of the other the knee slightly bent about to transfer her weight from her back leg to her front she wasnt wearing a scuba tank or a mask she hadnt been diving only swimming using the insulation of the wet suit to keep her warm in the cold water her hands were covered with gray rubber gloves one of which she had used to peel off the cowl of her suit with the other gloved hand she now brushed back her wet hair and coltrane had seen that pose before also he pressed the shutter button again catching her in midmotion if it hadnt been for the wet suit coltrane would have been shaken by the most powerful déjà vu he had ever experienced even with the wet suit the parallels were so striking that coltrane didnt know if he could keep his hands steady as he continued taking photographs the suit clung to the woman like skin its wet slickness enhanced the sinuous movement of her legs the fluid motion of her body the sensuous contours of her hips her waist her breasts her he lowered the camera his dazed mind demanding to know how it was possible that he could be looking at rebecca chance as he took another step a look of fear crossed the womans face she stumbled backward lost her balance and slipped to her knees in the waves no he told her you dont need to be afraid im not here to hurt you he raised his hands causing her to raise her own gloved hands as if to protect herself please he said i didnt mean to startle you all i want is to ask you some questions im not going to hurt you the slap of waves against the rocks wasnt loud enough to mute the sudden noises behind him doors banging open shouting shoes scrabbling over rocks pivoting to look behind him coltrane was astonished to see a half dozen men racing toward him two from the house two from hiding places under the deck one from shrubs on each side of the house stop right there one of them yelled his face twisted with anger dont move as fast as he could coltrane turned and ran you son of a bitch stay where you are or ill coltrane didnt hear the rest the noise of the waves and his frenzied breathing blocking it out his shoes slipped on the wet rocks but he managed not to fall as he strained to increase speed all the while hearing barked curses behind him without warning ahead of him a man lunged from the side of another house shoving out a hand yelling at coltrane to stop just when it seemed that he and the man would collide coltrane changed direction veering around him charging away from the shore but two of the men racing behind him had anticipated that move and were running parallel to him ready to grab him he changed direction yet again hurrying back toward the shore the man who had appeared from the side of the house had assumed that coltrane would continue to rush inland as a consequence the man had left his strategic position and was racing inland as well coltrane outmaneuvered him continuing to charge along the shore damn it someone yelled coltrane avoided a difficult shelf of rock and felt something twist in his stomach when he saw that the shore curved inward to avoid the waves facing him he would have to go inland again his pursuers racing closer he hurried around the half circle of the shore as one of the men darted at him from the side coltrane recalled how he had used his cameras to defend himself in bosnia he pulled the camera from around his neck gripped its cord and reached back to swing the camera toward the head of the attacking man hey the man lurched back simultaneously coltrane lurched also the backward motion of his arm causing him to lose his balance his feet slipped out from under him the next thing all he saw was the sky as his body arched backward the shock of cold water took the remainder of his breath away not that it mattered he couldnt breathe anyhow he was submerged in a hollow among the rocks flailing to reach the surface the current of a wave gripped him thrashing with coldcramped arms he heard a roaring in his ears when he broke through the surface the sun was almost blinding buffeted by another wave he gasped and fought to inhale swallowing water he coughed and tasted salt then struggled against the weight of his waterfilled shoes and soaked clothes and pawed toward a shelf of rock let him drown a man said peering up through waterbleared eyes he saw the men standing along the shore just beyond the reach of the waves their faces as craggy as the shelves of rock they wore sneakers jeans and windbreakers and looked like the only thing they had wanted for christmas was a renewal of their exerciseclub memberships yeah lets do the world a favor another said sure a third said he ran he fell we couldnt get him out before he drowned but think about the lousy paperwork coltranes right hand gripped the shelf of rock a wave thrust him toward it but as quickly tugged him away his numbed hand lost its hold the paperworks worth it the first man said can you think of any better way to spend new years than watch this prick drown not me the fourth man said aching from the cold coltrane got another grip on the rocks and strained to pull himself up a wave knocked him against the shelf making him groan but despite the undertow he mustered the strength to grip the shelf harder pulling himself higher hold it the first man stepped forward and pressed the sole of his sneaker against the back of coltranes right hand coltrane winced you didnt ask may i the man said what do you think carl the second man turned toward someone approaching do we let this jerk drown or pull his sorry ass out coltrane struggled as another wave splashed over him his numbness worsening he coughed and fought for air despite the bleariness in his saltirritated eyes he peered helplessly upward and managed to get a look at the person joining them a man in sneakers jeans and a windbreaker similar to what the others wore a man whose brown hair was trimmed to almostmilitary shortness and whose matching brown eyes had a nononsense steadiness showing no reaction as he gazed down at coltrane pull him out what kind a fun is that at least lets watch him splash around a little longer no pull him out this isnt the guy we want how can you be sure i know him what hes a photographer named mitch coltrane he lives in los angeles and believe me he was otherwise occupied when all of this started weve got the wrong man the man who pressed his sneaker against coltranes hand took a quick step backward coltrane strained to get out of the water the newcomer quickly grabbed him raising him dripping from the waves are you all right the man who had saved him asked frozen coltranes teeth chattered i didnt know your first name was carl thats because i wanted you to think that my first name was sergeant what are you doing here thats exactly what i was going to ask you nolan said and i cant wait to hear your answer you can see where we would have gotten the wrong idea the first man gestured apologetically a blanket wrapped around him coltrane didnt respond only kept shivering as he sat in a white wooden chair in an allwhite living room the back wall was composed entirely of glass providing a panoramic view of the ocean the lateafternoon sun blazed in but didnt warm him you were peeking in her windows the second man said give me a break i was checking the house from the road trying to see if it looked like anybody was at home and taking pictures of the place the third man said im a professional photographer thats what i do take pictures including of a woman you claim youve never seen before while youre trespassing the fourth man asked yeah how come you were sneaking up on the house sneaking up coltrane asked i suppose youre going to tell us you walked all the way here from la wheres your car anger raised coltranes temperature as he told them where he had left his car okay okay that explains why you were on foot but you werent just sightseeing you didnt just happen to pick this house what are you doing here i could have hit my head and been killed you threatened to let me drown im not answering any more questions until i find out who you are and what the hells going on the group lapsed into an uncomfortable silence for the first time since entering the house nolan spoke he had been standing in the background shaking his head unhappily i think you already have a pretty good idea who the rest of these men are the same as you police officers not quite the same in deference to the allwhite decor nolan and everyone else had taken off their shoes his socks whispered on the thick walltowall carpet malibu doesnt have a police department walt and lyle here are with the local sheriffs department pete and sam are with the state police the rest of these men are lapd and how did you get involved coltrane asked since when do la policemen work in malibu they dont nolan said unless its their day off and theyre here unofficially doing somebody a favor me the first man said nolan had introduced him as walt im the one he was doing a favor its a stalker situation nolan gestured wearily having dealt with crimes of this sort too many times before the woman living here has been harassed for the past three weeks by someone who seems to know everything she does until a while ago he phoned her constantly even though she changed her number five times and none of them was ever listed he still managed to find out what the new ones were and keep calling her finally she had the phone taken out of service that explains the computerized voice i heard when i tried to call yesterday so you did try to call the second man lyle said i was going to ask you why you didnt phone instead of paying an unexpected visit on new years day you still think im lying just crossing the ts meanwhile nolan interrupted she started getting photographs coltrane straightened the men studied him he had never been looked at so directly photographs coltrane understood so when i showed up with a camera and started taking her picture you assumed the photographs she receives there are hundreds have been taken wherever she goes nolan said no matter what she does somebody manages to shoot pictures of her coltrane felt a return of the bonecold sensation of having been in the water except that in this case he was frozen because he remembered how violated he had felt when he learned that ilkovic had followed and photographed him and that doesnt include the bouquets of flowers that are delivered to her a half dozen times a day not always when shes at home shes been getting them at restaurants at her dentists once even at her gynecologists a note read thinking of you nolan said love letters on the windshield of her car specialdelivery proposals of marriage so naturally she got worried enough to call the sheriffs department walt said he had a brush cut a squarish face a sandcolored mustache and a slight scar above his right eyebrow im the one who came out and interviewed her were not a big department we dont have a lot of staff and resources but thats what we were going to need i knew because right away it was obvious that the complainant needed surveillance and not just in malibu we might care about jurisdictions but the guy were after is free to roam as he pleases the complainant has business in los angeles she goes there often so i decided to call the lapd threat management unit and see if they had any advice which is where i come in nolan said walt and i went to the police academy together for a time he was with the lapd robbery division but eventually he moved up here for the peace and quiet walt said as if peace and quiet were not what he had found he asked for me nolan said and we discussed the obvious problem which is that strictly speaking this ardent admirer hadnt broken the law coltrane cocked his head in confusion the problem is that in addition to a pattern of harassment there has to be an element of threat nolan said to you or me it might be common sense that someone who pesters a woman night and day with professions of love is trying to intimidate her but the district attorneys office might not see it that way they might worry that a jury will figure this guy is more a nuisance than a threat i once had a case where a stalker sent chocolates to a woman all the time boxes and boxes phoned her constantly wrote hundreds of letters she felt threatened and wanted him stopped a restraining order didnt do any good so i arrested him and the case actually went to trial but the jury couldnt decide if he was guilty of anything this happened around valentines day one woman on the jury later said she thought sending all those chocolates was quaint honest to god anyway after the hung jury the guy showed up at the womans house one night and shot her in the head said he got tired of waiting for her to marry him said if he couldnt have her nobody would hows that for true love but in this case we got lucky lyle said if you want to call a threat lucky walt added the ardent admirer sent our complainant a funeral wreath with a ribbon across it that read till death do us part thats not the most explicit threat i ever heard of but the tenpound heart that came with the wreath certainly was it turned out to be a bulls it had an arrow through it and a note attached to the arrow be mine youre wounding my heart dont make me wound yours tender dont you think and enough to make a jury put him away coltrane said maybe not for long but hey the complainant would breathe easier for a while at least hell maybe this jerk would use the time to reconsider how he shows affection you dont have any idea who he is no and neither does the complainant the obvious temptation is to suspect hes someone she knows but thats not always the way these things work he might be someone she met five years ago and doesnt remember maybe hes a clerk at the bank she uses sometimes it takes only one look for a creep like this to get fixated on someone we do know he orders the flowers by sending a letter of instructions along with cash to various flower shops the wreath and the bulls heart were delivered by a parcel service the return address on the packages was bogus while the phone was still working the guy frequently left his voice on the complainants answering machine but she doesnt recognize it the best tactic we could think of walt said was to try to entrap him lyle explained further before the complainant had her phone disconnected we told her to tell this guy when he called that it was time to put up or shut up that shed be waiting for him here this afternoon she made certain he understood how angry she was with him and that she wanted to see him facetoface to guarantee he got the point that she wanted nothing at all to do with him it was an ultimatum we hoped he couldnt refuse nolan said especially because when the phone was disconnected yesterday the creep had no way to get in touch with her to try to renegotiate the terms of the meeting then we sent for the cavalry walt said lyle and i are officially on duty these other guys are friends helping out on new years day im impressed coltrane said friends wouldnt normally give up new years day to the complainants generous one of the other men said the rest of the group looked at the man as if he had said too much theres nothing wrong with it walt said when were off duty she hires us to be her protection one or the other of us goes into la with her speaking of one of the state troopers glanced around nervously where is tash the group tensed jesus walt snapped to attention what happened to her the last time i saw her she was coming out of the water and we were chasing i needed to get into something dry a voice said from above on coltranes right he turned toward a stairway seeing a bare foot appear on the landing the voice was fullthroated making coltrane think of similarvoiced actresses in films from the thirties and forties in his memory they were always in a sparkling evening gown standing next to a piano in a nightclub exchanging repartee with a handsome hero in a white dinner jacket but the woman who descended the white carpeting on the stairway wasnt wearing an evening gown she wore a cotton sweatsuit the raspberry color of which enhanced her tan face dark eyes and even darker hair although the exercise suit was oversized a dramatic opposite to the tight wet suit she had worn a little while ago her present outfit was nonetheless almost as revealing the loose seat suggested the trim firmness of the hips it concealed the similarly loose top moved up and down in the front and suggested that the woman had not put on a bra everyone watched as she reached the bottom coltrane had the sense that the men liked to see her bare feet touch the plush carpeting but his own attention was directed toward her face the broad forehead high cheekbones almondshaped eyes slender nose curved lips angular chin and narrow jaw that were the elements of classical beauty and that rebecca chance had been blessed with but a catalog of her features couldnt communicate the animation of those features even in a sweatsuit this woman had come down the stairs with the same fluid ease that rebecca chance had shown descending a staircase wearing a sarong in jamaica wind her hair still wet from having been in the ocean was pushed back clinging to her head the way rebecca chance had pushed it back as she waded out of a river in the trailblazer that pose coming out of the river had been the same as the pose in randolph packards photographs of rebecca chance stepping out of the ocean the same pose that this woman had assumed as she came out of the ocean onto the rocks not long ago coltranes mind was aswirl hello she approached coltrane her gaze locked intimately on his as she held out her hand im tash adler and im sorry about the misunderstanding coltrane felt a spark when their hands touched only static electricity from the carpet he told himself and yet i hope you arent hurt no im fine coltrane suddenly felt foolish holding the blanket around him a little cold is all he eased the blanket off him nothing serious he repressed another shiver his wet clothes clinging to him tash its short for natasha you should get into something dry before you catch pneumonia the concern in her voice made him feel that at that particular moment he was the most important person in the world to her but where am i going to find dry clothes for you i dont think youll fit into one of my bathrobes the fact was she was only about three inches shorter than coltranes sixfoot height and he might indeed have fitted into one of her bathrobes i know tash said why dont you go into the bathroom down the hall take off your wet clothes and give them to me ill put them in the dryer i itll take only fifteen minutes tash said well leave the door ajar so you can be part of the conversation and not feel youre in limbo ill make a pot of strong hot coffee for everybody and hand a cup in to you coltranes face felt warm only partly because his cheeks were losing their numbness from the cold water sure this way tash gripped his arm the feeling intimate guiding him past the white stairway down a white corridor to the open door of a white bathroom a white kitchen was farther along the corridor ill wait tash said selfconscious coltrane entered the bathroom and shut the door for a moment his automatic impulse was to lock it but he stopped himself imagining how ridiculous the snap of the lock would sound as if he was afraid she would barge in on him while he was undressing he peeled off his wet sport coat shirt pants and socks took his belt wallet keys and comb from his pants hesitated then decided that he didnt want her to have to deal with his underwear even as things were he didnt feel comfortable that she would have to touch his wet clothes he solved the problem by wrapping them in a towel despite the underwear he kept on he didnt think he had ever felt quite so naked as when he stood behind the door and opened it a foot peering out at her im sorry to put you through the inconvenience he said nonsense tashs eyes crinkled with amusement im hoping that if im nice to you you wont sue me coltrane couldnt help smiling be back in a jiff she carried his towelwrapped clothes down the corridor coltrane took another towel from the rack dried himself then sponged the towel against his wet underwear that done he combed his hair folded his sport coat over the toilet seat rubbed his arms to try to get warmth into them and was surprised to hear tashs voice behind him maybe this will fit you after all turning he saw her hand projecting through the gap he had left in the doorway she was offering a white terrycloth bathrobe thanks but im sure ill be fine coltrane said instead of replying tash leaned in far enough to drape the bathrobe over the side of the tub her head turned away from him the next thing her arm was gone and her footsteps receded along the hallway coltrane looked at the robe a long time before picking it up and putting it on tash was right although a little snug it did fit him the fragrance on it was possibly from perfume and not laundry soap even with the door ajar coltrane couldnt hear what tash and the men were talking about in the living room their voices blended an echo distorted them frustrated he waited tensing as heavy footsteps came along the corridor whatll it look like if one of those guys comes in and sees me crammed into this robe he wondered do you want a beer instead of the coffee nolans voice asked yeah with a straw nolan chuckled by the time he returned handing a budweiser into the bathroom coltrane had gotten out of the robe and hung it on a hook nolan had indeed put a straw into the open can of beer coltrane shook his head in amusement took out the straw tilted the can to his lips and drank half of it the indistinguishable voices in the living room filled him with increasing frustration the hands on his watch didnt seem to move to distract himself he looked for a magazine didnt find any and examined the pump containers of hand soap and lotion that were on the counter curious he reached to open the medicine cabinet all done tash startled him turning in embarrassment he saw her hand offering him dried clothes through the gap in the door thanks when coltrane took them their hands happened to brush he felt another crackle of electricity sorry she said from the other side of the door the air must be dry in here or something i didnt mean to shock you i barely noticed i did ive been doing it a lot lately i even took off my socks so i wouldnt generate static no difference it makes me selfconscious theres no need to be its in my nature to give off static electricity to be selfconscious see you in a few minutes right coltrane looked at the side of his hand where the crackling sensation lingered as quickly as possible he slipped into his pants shirt and socks enjoying their warmth grateful to be dressed again he tried to look natural when he entered the living room the men looking up at him from the sofa and various chairs walt and lyle the two officers officially on duty were drinking coffee the others each had a beer tash leaned against a wall holding a glass of white wine the crimson of the soontoset sun filled the white room the combination of colors so intriguing that coltrane wished he still had his camera an object on the coffee table caught his attention my nikon i thought id lost it in the water no you dropped it on the rocks walt said in all the commotion i didnt have a chance to go back and get it until a few minutes ago i owe you this camera and i have been through a lot coltrane examined it unhappy to see that the lens was shattered and the body more scratched than it had previously been but it didnt appear that the case had been cracked the negative of the images he had taken of tash might not have been exposed to light even so with its lens cracked the camera was temporarily useless to him we told you ours now you tell us yours nolan said excuse me your story you didnt just happen to show up here why did you come so youre still not sure about me coltrane thought my timing wasnt the greatest i hope this doesnt sound presumptuous he looked at tash im curious about you inherited some property recently from a man named randolph packard tash straightened against the wall thats right except for nolan the men looked puzzled by the reference coltrane told them who packard was i met him toward the end of november coltrane said to tash in fact i collaborated on a project with him although he died before i could get much input from him not that it mattered from the beginning of my career he had tremendous influence on me and especially lately i guess you could say he changed my life anyway i decided to buy a house he owned when i heard about another property he owned one in mexico i was tempted to buy it also but then i discovered that the property had been given to you so i coltranes sentence hung in the air you came here to ask me if id be interested in selling it sounding almost relieved tash leaned away from the wall something like that coltrane said thats what this is all about walt sounded annoyed you came here to buy real estate basically coltrane lied well for god sake one of the state policemen said i waited around to hear that i was sure there had to be a fancy explanation for the coincidence sorry shaking their heads several men stood ive got to be going one of the state troopers said me too lyle said my wifes got a pot roast in the oven theres no point in all of us hanging around anymore the man we were trying to catch was probably studying the house when we tipped our hand too soon because of he gestured toward coltrane yeah walt sounded disgusted the creeps long gone by now we started our surveillance in the middle of the night presumably before he started his own surveillance weariness strained his face but now that he knows we were waiting for him well have a hard time setting another trap the good news is tonight will probably be quiet you guys go ahead enjoy whats left of your new years ill hold down the fort no thats all right tash said you go ahead too but as you said tonight will probably be quiet cross fingers that whoever it is left the area for now the sheriffs department has more people to protect than just me but not all of them need protecting walt said i dont feel comfortable leaving you alone i appreciate your concern tash said i wont be alone though walt looked puzzled mr coltrane is going to stay for a while were going to discuss real estate coltrane must have looked surprised if thats convenient tash said to him perhaps you have somewhere else you need to be i just thought that since you came all this way to talk to me no coltrane said no theres nowhere else i have to be the time was just after five in the afternoon the air turning from crimson to gray the breeze increasing becoming cooler as the men stepped outside the front door and put on their sneakers tash opened the twin garage doors revealing two large fourwheeldrive vehicles an explorer and a mountaineer as some of the men got into them tash eased into her porsche and backed it out of the driveway allowing the mountaineer that she had been blocking to get out of the garage the moment the stall was free she pulled into it coltrane couldnt help noticing that for the brief time she was away the men who hadnt yet gotten into the vehicles stopped talking and watched her remember if you have even the slightest hint of trouble dont think twice call us lyle told her dont worry im a coward at heart when im by myself i dont go anywhere without carrying the phone coltrane frowned phone but i thought it was out of service it is walt said were talking about a cellular phone i bought for tash and had activated in my name whoever this creep is he keeps managing to find out the new numbers she gets in her name but so far he doesnt know anything about this number good idea coltrane said lets hope it stays a good idea tash if you need anything let me know she touched his arm in a gesture of thanks while you guys are still here coltrane said they looked at him wondering what he was leading up to can you wait another few minutes while i get my car i dont want to stumble around looking for it after dark this way tash wont be alone while im gone yeah i can stick around a little longer lyle said and ill make it quicker by driving you to your car nolan motioned for coltrane to follow him to the garage and the explorer that remained in the stall next to tashs porsche one of the policemen was in the passenger seat another policeman and one of the state troopers was in the back while nolan got behind the steering wheel coltrane climbed into the back he saw walt and lyle talking to tash in front of the house while nolan left the garage reached the road and drove away our cars are parked behind a service station on the highway the policeman in the front seat explained that way it didnt look like we were having a convention at tashs place while we were waiting for him to show up you set it up well too bad the wrong guy showed up uncomfortable coltrane changed the subject im on a street on that bluff you certainly had yourself lost nolan said by the time coltrane got back it was dark lights glowed warmly in the house the officers in the mountaineer had gotten out and joined walt and lyle speaking with tash in her front hallway tash smiled at coltrane in welcome just as a precaution lyle told him better put your car in the garage where nothing will happen to it right then walt lyle and the others said goodbye and drove away as the gleam of taillights receded the road became dark except for the pinpoints of lights in a house farther along finally coltrane and tash were alone she broke the silence would you like another beer sounds good coltrane had all kinds of questions but he didnt want to overwhelm her take it slow and easy he thought she locked the front door then opened the inside garage door and pressed a button that closed each stall after that she secured the inside garage door too before i get you that beer would you help me walk the picket line you know check the security officer coltrane reporting for duty he hoped it sounded like a joke which apparently it did because she looked amused as she started down the hallway carl and the others already locked up but i feel more comfortable if i doublecheck she said past the stairway they entered the living room and crossed to the sliding glass doors that led onto the deck there tash tried to open the door definitely secure pensive she looked out past the white deck toward the darkness on the rocks and the whitecaps on the waves in the black ocean i used to love sitting out there even when its cold like this watching the waves hit the shore listening to them sometimes i can see a freighter on the horizon its lights moving heading to mysterious places so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past she turned to him surprised you know gatsby coltrane shrugged when i was at usc one of my photography instructors insisted i take a few literature classes for some reason the great gatsby really stayed with me that final image randolph packard had an image like that in one of his photographs the lights of a freighter on the horizon heading to mysterious places tash echoed she had sounded melancholy but now she mocked herself probably only to long beach anyway for a while those nights are over she pressed a button on the wall to the right a faint rumble puzzled coltrane until he saw metal shutters descending blocking off the allglass wall at the back of the living room it makes me feel like im in a castle tash said except im lowering the shutters instead of raising the drawbridge coltrane followed her into the kitchen where she turned on an overhead light that reflected off white countertops creating a pleasant luster after confirming that a side door was locked she leaned against a counter stared down shook her head then roused herself almost forgot that beer there were several in the refrigerator presumably for the men helping her coltrane thought dont bother about a glass the can is fine he said you sure she poured chablis into a glass and touched it against the beer can she had given him cheers cheers it doesnt seem much like new years does it i have a friend who keeps emphasizing that its a matter of attitude coltrane said that we should think of it as a chance for a new beginning yeah troubled tash sipped her wine the question is a new beginning of what the start of the really bad times i dont think thats the attitude my friend had in mind leaning against the counter opposite her coltrane had a dizzying sense of unreality tash adler even spoke like rebecca chance her fullthroated voice and engaging cadences the same as rebecca chances in the trailblazer and jamaica wind she seemed to be in her midtwenties the same age rebecca chance had been when she disappeared is something the matter tash asked youre looking at me as if have i got something caught in my teeth he laughed not at all sorry i didnt mean to stare its a photographers habit i cant help imagining how i would take someones picture is that what you want to do take my photograph theres something about the way youre leaning against that counter oh she looked puzzled coltrane realized that a compliment about her looks might sound as if he was coming on to her the last thing he wanted was to alienate her the raspberry of the exercise suit youre wearing is the only bright color in the room otherwise everythings white well not totally those knives in that container have black handles so do the handles on that toaster and the knobs on the stove i added those touches of black deliberately tash said without contrast white isnt effective thats what intrigued me your suit makes this room a blackandwhite photograph in color tash considered him youre very observant coltrane made a modest gesture it comes from taking a lot of photographs no i suspect taking photographs didnt make you observant the other way around but i also suspect you often see more than you ever wanted to not everythings beautiful coltrane remembered sighting through his telephoto lens as ilkovic directed his men to grind up the bones of the corpses that the backhoe had dredged up from the mass grave in bosnia yes not everythings beautiful i need to ask you something coltrane inwardly came to attention the reason i asked you to stay coltrane waited i didnt want to talk about this in front of the others tash said you seem to know an awful lot about randolph packard since my late teens ive been trying to learn everything i can about him then maybe you could tell me something do you have any idea at all why he would have included me in his will it took coltrane several seconds to recover you dont know i was absolutely mystified when his attorney got in touch with me sure i know who randolph packard was but for the life of me i cant figure out why he would have given me that estate in mexico its like he picked my name out of a hat or something totally unexpected i asked his attorney whats his name blaine yes i asked blaine if he knew why packard had chosen me but blaine told me he hadnt the faintest idea from what blaine told me that seems to be the truth i didnt know who besides blaine to ask tash said and by then i was deep in this mess with whoever she gestured toward a wall and whatever lurked beyond it ive had a lot of things on my mind so when out of nowhere i heard you mention packard and the estate in mexico you could have knocked me over i have to be honest about something tashs dark eyes narrowed as if she was afraid of what he was going to say i havent been entirely open with you coltrane said she looked more uneasy the reason i came here wasnt just to find out if youd be interested in selling the mexican estate ive never seen it who knows how itll strike me if i ever do see it what i really came here for was to ask you the same question you asked me why randolph packard gave me the mexican estate yes tash shook her head in exhaustion please i have all the mysteries i can handle but maybe the answer to mine will help solve one of yours have you ever heard of an upandcoming movie actress in the thirties named rebecca chance baffled tash considered the name no im not surprised she disappeared before she had the chance to become a star but what does she have to do with she was being stalked the same pattern of letters gifts and phone calls then one day she vanished if youre trying to frighten me even more than i already am no coltrane said im trying to help you figure out why randolph packard put you in his will packard was desperately in love with her rebecca chance yes coltrane paused struck anew by the alluring features of the woman across from him and the uncanny situation in which he found himself and rebecca chance looked so much like you you look so much like her you might as well be the same woman what in gods name are you talking about coltrane hesitated he told her everything photographs and movies that rebecca chance was featured in but youre right to zero in on the photographs theyre whats truly important because packard took them because he hid them and rebecca chance is identical to me so much so that i thought i was hallucinating when i first saw you this is i cant she stared at him show them to me coltrane blinked in surprise what i want to see the photographs but i dont have them with me i can come back tomorrow and bring now i want to see them take me to them tashs emotion was so intense that for several moments coltrane wasnt able to move or speak he found himself saying hesitantly all right sure if thats what you ill just need a second upstairs well be going into la you dont have to worry about driving me back ill follow you i wouldnt mind driving you back its just that a misgiving nagged at him it had nothing to do with showing tash the photographs if anybody had the right to see them it seemed to him that she did his uneasiness came from another source something to do with the parallel between rebecca chances stalker and tash adlers stalker and mine with a shudder he realized that in order to help tash he had to be as cautious now as he had been when ilkovic was hunting him he had to put himself in her place to imagine that he was the person in danger its better if i drive you coltrane said tash paused on her way from the kitchen she looked mystified if someone is watching your house hell follow you when you follow me and he wouldnt have much trouble a porsche isnt inconspicuous thats what walt said tash sounded disheartened get rid of the porsche or at least rent something bland until this jerk is in prison ive already reduced my movements until im practically living in a box she shook her head stubbornly im not going to let that bastard take anything more away from me but you dont have to drive the porsche what am i going to do run behind you and bark at your tires it sounded so unexpectedly humorous they stared at each other and found themselves laughing god it feels good to do that tash said i cant remember the last time i truly laughed it made her radiant honestly coltrane said i think i should drive you but if hes out there hell still see the two of us in your car hell still follow not if you get in my car while the garage door is down you lie on the back floor until were a distance away since he wont know youre with me hell stay and watch the house have you got any timers for the lights as the garage door descended coltrane removed his hand from the remote control he had taken from the porsche and continued backing onto the murky road he turned on his headlights only after the door was sufficiently low that illumination into the garage wouldnt reveal that tash wasnt in there and wasnt pressing the control on the wall to lower the door so far so good coltrane thought but he knew that a couple of other tactics were required to make the ruse convincing pausing at the foot of the driveway he turned on his cars interior lights and consulted a map as if figuring out how to get back to the highway anyone watching the house would see that he was alone next he shut off the interior lights and tapped his horn twice two short blasts evidently saying goodbye as he proceeded along the road his headlights probing the darkness he glanced at his rearview mirror and saw a lamp go off in a window the timer worked perfectly he said it looks like im still at home and turning off a few lights tash asked from where she hid on the back floor yep and there goes the second one coltrane said watching his rearview mirror inspired tashs voice came muffled from the back not to be immodest but i agree even so stay down for a while i want to watch for any headlights that start following us is this coltrane waited but tash didnt finish her question what maybe you dont want to talk about it how can i know until you tell me is this what you had to do when you were running from dragan ilkovic the reference caught coltrane unawares blunting the satisfaction he had felt in getting tash out of the house how did you know about me and ilkovic while you were in the bathroom waiting to get your clothes dried carl nolan told me it felt odd to be having a conversation with someone coltrane couldnt see he made an effort not to tilt his head in tashs direction and ruin the illusion that he was alone i knew about what had happened at that movie ranch tashs voice continued below and behind him at the time there wasnt much else in the newspapers or on the television news but when i met you your name didnt register i didnt make the connection thats encouraging i hate to think that every time i introduce myself to someone new ill always be remembered as the man who shot ilkovic i prefer to be known for my photographs not for killing someone even if he did deserve it im sorry for asking you to talk about it no its fine i cant pretend it didnt happen i used to check for headlights behind me all the time i used to drive around the block and down narrow alleys and oneway streets anyplace that would make it unusual for someone to stay behind me but the timers on the lamps all that business in the garage they werent anything id tried before its reassuring to know youre inventive yeah but its not something im overjoyed to find out im inventive at keep staying down coltrane steered onto the pacific coast highway and checked for any headlights that emerged onto the highway after him so far so good lets hope tashs muffled voice said when you found out what i had done to ilkovic did it change the way you looked at me no why not as you put it he deserved to be killed that he did coltrane sighed bleakly that he did people you know did change the way they related to you one in particular powerful emotions can be frightening coming from the darkness tashs disembodied voice sounded more faint almost childlike do you have nightmares yes i thought theyd go away but they havent i keep dreaming that ilkovic isnt dead that hes still coming for me i imagine his hands i have nightmares too tash said someones reaching for me but i cant see his face since i dont know what he looks like its natural that hed be faceless i suppose but its worse than that its almost as if he doesnt have a head then you understand thats in my nightmare also coltrane said thisll sound odd but im glad what youre the first person ive been able to talk to about what im feeling and know that you understand walt lyle carl and the others i try to explain how alone and afraid i feel and they tell me they know what i mean but they dont know how can they possibly theyre big men with badges and guns their lives are in control theyre not being stalked were in a limited club not you not any longer but its reassuring to know that you survived i feel safe with you i hope i dont let you down again coltrane checked his rearview mirror i didnt see any cars pull onto the highway after us i think its okay now for you to sit up since im feeling safe coltrane wondered what she meant to say why dont i stay down out of sight until we get to your place its a long drive coltrane said it wont be if we keep talking the way we are tell me about your photographs all clear coltrane said as his garage door rumbled shut ouch tash said im going to need a couple of aerobics classes to get my back into shape after this she rose massaged her spine and got out of the car but it was obvious that she wasnt that creaky an upward stretch of her arms accentuated her trim body she had changed from her loosefitting sweatsuit to a pair of blue slacks a gray turtleneck sweater and a jacket whose color resembled the raspberry tint of what she had previously been wearing obviously a favorite color it added a depth to her dark eyes and hair when she stretched she turned modestly away so as not to emphasize her breasts in front of him coltrane assumed no matter that upward stretch and a slight twist this way and then that were a pleasure to behold her body assuming the dancers grace she had exhibited when he first saw her although coltrane continued to have the uncanny feeling that he had first seen her long before that watching in wonder he suddenly found himself in darkness what happened tash asked in surprise the garage openers overhead light is supposed to stay on for a minute after the door goes down but its been cutting out much sooner ill go over and turn on the switch footsteps scraping on concrete he inched through the darkness and approached where he estimated the door to the house was reaching blindly he touched the door and groped toward the switch on the right all at once flinching from a shock seeing a spark as a hand brushed past his and reached for the same switch oh my god tash said im sorry whoa you really do give off static electricity i thought you were having trouble finding the switch i was looking in that direction when the lights went off so i figured it would be easier for me to i really am sorry when coltrane turned on the light he discovered he was startlingly close to her again her beauty amazed him her subtle perfume filled his nostrils trying not to look flustered he unlocked the door to the house and opened it guiding her in can i get you something he hoped that she wouldnt notice that his voice was slightly unsteady more wine coffee something to eat its close to dinnertime i could make some the photographs tash ignored the house and its unique furnishings fixing her gaze on him of course theyre the reason youre here after all he led the way downstairs unlocked the vault and pushed open its metal door cool air cascaded over them tash hugged herself thats the way i felt at first coltrane said youll get used to it will i tash looked around at the austere shelves and blinked from the overhead glare crossing the vault with her he had never felt so aware of being alone with a woman en route he had explained how he had happened to find the chamber but she still wasnt prepared when he freed the catches and pulled out the section of shelves and she certainly wasnt prepared when she entered the chamber and came facetoface with her lookalike it might have been the garish overhead lights that caused what happened next but more likely coltrane thought it was blood draining from tashs face that made her look abruptly pale she wavered afraid that she was going to collapse coltrane reached to catch her then stopped the impulse when she regained her composure standing rigidly still he could only imagine the turmoil she must be suffering for his part as he looked from tash toward the wall before her and the lifesized features of rebecca chance he suffered a sanitythreatening unbalance the photograph was tash tash was the photograph but it wasnt and she wasnt the face in the photograph was almost twothirds of a century old i tash swallowed as if something blocked her throat her voice thickened how on earth is this possible thats what i was hoping youd tell me with palpable effort she turned from the photograph and you say there are other photographs thousands of them i was so absorbed by them that i never took the time to count them show me the distress in her eyes frightened him are you sure you want to go through with this this is more unsettling for you than i expected perhaps you should i want to see them yes coltrane felt powerless whatever you want he picked up the top box suddenly remembered what was in it set it aside and picked up the next one carrying it out to one of the shelves tash followed stepping so close that he felt her shoulder against him as he opened the lid rebecca chance stepped out of waves onto a beach just as tash had stepped out of waves a few hours earlier coltrane felt the air that tashs forced breathing displaced in her need to look at them she would probably have pushed him aside if he hadnt stepped out of the way then the echo of his sideways movement dwindled and the only sound in the vault was the smooth slide of photographs being hurriedly turned one after the other after the other totally preoccupied by them tash was equally oblivious to him it gave him a chance to indulge his need to admire her whats in the first box excuse me tash had reached the last photograph in the box so quickly and pivoted toward him so unexpectedly that he had been caught staring at her you set a box aside before you picked up this one did i i dont remember i why didnt you want me to look inside it no special reason the photographs in this one are more interesting is all i tash reentered the vault before he could take a step to prevent her she came determinedly back into view carrying another box and coltrane had no doubt which box it was the previous evening after he had shown jennifer the nudes of rebecca chance he had put the box on top of the others rather than at the bottom where he had found it tash narrowed her eyes as if she suspected he had tried to betray her then she opened the lid and straightened at the sight of rebecca chances naked body the glistening chromium beads draped over her tash didnt seem able to move slowly with a manifest effort of will she turned to the next photograph and the next because there werent any clothes the thirties style of which would have identified the period during which the photographs had been taken these images could as easily have been taken now and could as easily have been of tash if that was how tash looked naked again she seemed paralyzed but this time when she finally moved it was to look at coltrane you were trying to protect my modesty something like that i wasnt sure how comfortable youd feel with me in the room while you looked at photographs of a naked woman especially when that woman looks just like you tash studied him i thought it would be sort of like looking at myself she asked its an awfully personal situation thank you for respecting my feelings coltrane nodded selfconscious she touched his hand show me whats in the other boxes you keep emphasizing this rock formation why do you think its important tash asked because it reminds me of a cat arching its back coltrane said so the estate packard gave you in his will is located near a town south of acapulco called espalda del gato i know the name was in the documents packards attorney sent me hows your spanish i see what you mean spine of the cat but that doesnt prove the rock formation were looking at has anything to do with the village its more likely a coincidence and this cliff along the ocean isnt anywhere near the estate i inherited for all we know this cliff is in southern california but it isnt coltrane said the other night i saw a movie rebecca chance was in its called jamaica wind and some parts of it were filmed on what is recognizably the santa monica beach with the cliff behind it but then all of a sudden the location switches to a lush semitropical cliffrimmed area along an ocean that description fits acapulco tash said the movie has several cliff scenes that show the same rock formation a cat arching its back youre not exaggerating i swear theyre the same a friend of mine who has access to jamaica wind is arranging to have a videotape made for me when you see that tape youll understand why im so sure other photographs in this box show rebecca chance in semitropical gardens similar to the ones in the movie let me understand this youre saying that these photographs were taken in the same area where the movie was shot and possibly at the same time more than that im saying i think the movie was shot at espalda del gato on the estate packard gave to you but why would in the early thirties it wasnt common for movies to be shot on remote locations was it not at all coltrane said the production companies liked to stay close to los angeles taking a movie crew to acapulco would have been prohibitively expensive then why packard was an immensely wealthy man from a fortune he inherited at sixteen when his parents died these photographs make it obvious how fixated he was on rebecca chance his total devotion to her cant be mistaken suppose he became impatient with the limited ambitions of a movie she was being featured in jamaica wind yes suppose he decided to become a secret financier for it what if he hoped that an expensively mounted picture would attract more attention and boost her chances of becoming a star lets assume he paid to transport a film crew to his mexican estate and while he and rebecca chance were there packard took some of these photographs i dont know thats a lot of what ifs but its the only explanation that makes sense to me coltrane said its a tempting theory ill give you that plus it has the appeal of being romantic tash rubbed the back of her neck exhausted but it still doesnt give me the answers i want why do rebecca chance and i theres another name i havent mentioned hes connected to this in a way i havent been able to figure out he produced rebecca chances final two movies then he disappeared not long after she did have you ever heard of anyone named winston case tashs mouth opened in shock you know the name coltrane asked the dark of her eyes widened winston case yes he was my grandfather coltrane was so stunned that he was sure he hadnt heard correctly your grandfather thats the name my mother told me i never met him so i have to take her word for it the name when i was a child i noticed that a lot of my friends had grandparents but i didnt know what that meant i asked my mother if i had grandparents and she said yes everybody had grandparents but that mine werent with us any longer naturally i wondered what she meant and she finally found a way to explain to me without disturbing me that they were dead winston case tash nodded i memorized the name so i could tell it to my friends to prove to them i once had grandparents too but maybe you misremembered no as i got older i asked my mother what he was like the name she referred to was always the same winston case and who was your grandmother esmeralda gutiérrez did your mother ever describe winston case as having been a film producer according to her he was a carpenter she remembered the family moving around a lot as he went from job to job although i guess the word family makes it sound bigger than it was there were only the three of them where did this happen coltrane asked in mexico an american working as an itinerant carpenter in mexico why not well for starters as an american citizen he could have brought his wife and daughter into the united states without any immigration problems given the difference in the standard of living he could have taken better care of them here in the depression youve got a point coltrane said but surely if winston case had the money to produce films he could have managed to hang on to enough resources to be comfortable during the depression he wouldnt have had to go to mexico and become a manual laborer then maybe were not talking about the same winston case the coincidence is too much for me to accept theres got to be a connection between does your mother live in los angeles i need to ask her about my mothers dead oh she died from lung cancer three years ago coltrane didnt speak for a moment im very sorry he felt as if a door in his mind had been shut he struggled to open another one yes abruptly he reached for the box of nude photographs what are you doing tash asked he hurriedly opened the box and sorted through the naked images until he came to the first waistup shot rebecca chances breasts were prominent im not comfortable with this tash said does she look pregnant to you i have a friend whos convinced that he glanced at tash and saw embarrassment and confusion in her eyes i know this is awkward weve just barely met and i promise im doing this for a reason please trust me my friend pointed out that rebecca chances breasts arent the same in every photograph they get fuller the nipples get larger that made my friend think that rebecca chance was pregnant when some of these pictures were taken she was in great shape to begin with and she watched her weight and she was far enough along for the hormones to be kicking in but not far enough along for her to be demonstrably pregnant in other ways maybe thats true hell my friends a woman but she isnt a doctor what do i know about this sort of thing but suppose its true what if could the reason you look so much like rebecca chance be that im her granddaughter tashs voice was a strained whisper look at the pictures again can you think of another explanation i dont know what to tash hugged herself take me out of here before coltrane knew what he was doing he put an arm around her yes youve been through a lot lets get you upstairs where its warm coltranes need to help was so great that unusual for him he didnt take the time to put the photographs back into the chamber and secure its entrance his arm still around her feeling her shiver he walked with her from the vault immediately as they stepped outside a jangling sound startled them from tashs purse coltrane had picked it up as they started across the vault tash was so preoccupied that she didnt at first seem to recognize the shrill insistence of her cellular telephone dont tell me he found out this number tash said the phone rang again would you like me to answer it for you coltrane asked the phone rang a third time no tash said if he hears a mans voice it might make him do something more extreme the phone persisted then dont answer it at all coltrane said but what if its apprehensive tash reached for the bag fumbled inside it pulled out the phone opened it with an unsteady hand and pressed the talk button hello her voice was tentative but as she listened she visibly relaxed walt thank heaven i was afraid itd be no im fine i went out mitch had something he needed to show me about the estate i inherited we drove into los angeles youve been trying to call me for the past hour but i had the phone with me all the time it never rang i dont know why it her dark eyes focused on the open door to the vault wait a minute i was in a storage area that had a lot of concrete around it it must have shut out the signal slow down walt whats wrong you sound jesus tensing again she listened harder he did what were you hurt was anybody she stared at the wall across from her but her eyes seemed so black with despair that coltrane had the sense she wasnt seeing anything except nightmarish visions in her mind i dont know what to do thats kind of you to offer but i cant go back there tonight i didnt bring my car mitch would have to drive me all the way to your place and rather than have him do it ill check into a hotel around here yes im sure of course i feel safe with him let me talk to him coltrane said i dont know the address here i wasnt looking when i need to ask him something coltrane held out his hand just a second walt tash gave him the phone coltrane felt the heat from her hand on it he smelled her lingering fragrance its mitch coltrane a dead silence was followed by walts husky voice saying the son of a bitch poured gasoline through the metal bars in front of tashs house and set fire to the garden coltrane tensed the fumes were everywhere if i hadnt stopped by to see if everything was okay the house would have been destroyed walt said i phoned the fire department and used a garden hose to wet down the house until help arrived it was damned close for a while gasoline that tells you something walt asked i once helped put a stalker in jail by taking his photograph while he poured gasoline on a womans lawn well too bad you didnt stay here instead of driving to los angeles you might have gotten his picture walt said sarcastically coltrane ignored it whats your address walt asked ill come get tash and make sure she spends the night somewhere safe are you using a cellular phone as a matter of fact yes what difference does it a couple of years ago in beirut a man who knows about these things told me never to say anything important on cellular phones its too easy to eavesdrop on conversations over them ill bring tash back tomorrow morning but thinking of ilkovic reminds me of something else did you ever have tashs house checked for hidden microphones what ilkovic specialized in planting bugs that was how he anticipated my movements by overhearing my conversations coltrane said do you suppose this jerk knows all about tashs movements because he planted bugs in her house that would be one way for him to learn her new telephone numbers when the service person told her what they were she wasnt the only one listening more dead silence christ you didnt check for bugs coltrane asked im sure as hell going to and after that ill bring tash back he gave the phone to her but tash didnt raise it to her ear she just kept staring at coltrane microphones you honestly think there might be tash are you there walt asked faintly from the phone slowly she raised it walt i dont feel up to talking right now but thanks for everything im really grateful no stay there ill be fine ill talk to you tomorrow she pressed a button on the phone and put the phone back into her bag neither spoke for a moment microphones in my house its a possibility it has to be checked but the house has an alarm system how would he get in to plant the microphones before this started did you have any maintenance work done around the house the carpeting was put in recently you dont suppose coltrane spread his hands jesus i feel so violated ive been there i know what you mean do you think he set the fire to pay me back for trying to trap him today or did he figure out i drove away with you and he was jealous i was sure he couldnt have known you were in the car coltrane said but what is it im a little late wondering about the possibility of hidden microphones if your house is bugged he would have overheard us planning how to hide you in the car im sorry i might have made a mistake im not into blaming people you did your best tash controlled a shudder on the positive side he couldnt have followed us and at the same time have started the fire so we know im safe for now she looked at him can you recommend a hotel in the area one she waited for the name right here coltrane said theres a guest bedroom ive got plenty of spare toothbrushes if i can fit into one of your robes i know you can fit into one of mine i couldnt impose why not because you barely know me tash shrugged in the last few hours id say wed gotten to know each other fairly well coltrane locked the door to the vault after going through those photographs i suppose youre right they started up the stairs look i made a killer marinara sauce last night coltrane said there was plenty left over i can cook up more pasta and another shrill noise startled them they froze at the top of the stairs into the living room but this time the sound wasnt from the phone in tashs purse it came from the doorbell coltrane frowned who would that be are you expecting anyone no sometimes randolph packards assistant drops by but he has a key and he usually just lets himself in maybe hes decided to be polite and ring the doorbell with the second jangle of the doorbell tash looked more uneasy itll be fine no one knows youre here coltrane said but he himself did not feel assured he went to the door looked through its peephole and felt something inside him contract when he saw who it was oh no he thought he was tempted not to open it but he couldnt be certain that his and tashs voice hadnt carried faintly to the person on the other side preparing himself he gripped the dead bolts knob turned it opened the door and tried not to look selfconscious when he smiled at jennifer hey what a surprise coltrane said surprise jennifer looked confused she still wore her black armani dress the same pearl earrings and necklace highlighted it glinting from the outdoor lights you didnt get the message i left on your answering machine i just came in awhile ago i havent had a chance to listen to my messages coltrane remained at the partially opened door what have you got there she held a cardboard box that contained several tupperware bowls each covered with a plastic lid new years dinner there was plenty of food left over at my parents house and i wasnt sure how much you would have gotten to eat when you visited gregs widow this afternoon so i thought id bring you a care package that was really thoughtful but its getting heavy youd better move out of the way so i can bring it in ah sure im so surprised to here let me help coltrane reached to take the box from her his movement opened the door wider causing jennifers previous look of confusion to become one of concern as she glanced past him oh i beg your pardon i didnt know you had company tash had remained standing at the top of the living room stairs well a couple of things happened today and coltrane didnt know how to get out of the sentence jennifer id like you to meet tash adler hello jennifer had trouble saying the word tash this is my friend jennifer lane pleased to meet you smiling tash came down the stairs by then coltrane had overcome his awkwardness enough to finish taking the box from jennifer her hands were free but she waited a moment before she gripped the hand tash offered you look awfully familiar jennifer said then frowned toward coltrane i dont understand familiar tash looked puzzled jennifer knows about the photographs coltrane explained youve seen them tash asked yes all of them yes jennifer said despite tashs tan the embarrassment that colored her cheeks was obvious it was almost as if she felt the nude photos were of her and not of rebecca chance tash adler jennifer searched her memory are you the person who inherited randolph packards estate in mexico yes how did you know jennifers been helping me do my research coltrane said he felt awkward standing between the two women holding the box of tupperware containers jennifer after i visited gregs widow my curiosity got the better of me i went up to malibu to see if i could find where tash lived youve certainly had an eventful day i brought tash back here to see the photographs and try to figure out why she looked so much like rebecca chance jennifer couldnt take her eyes away from tash and did you come up with any answers were beginning to suspect she might have been my grandmother tash said there you are mitch im impressed by the progress youre making jennifer looked uncomfortable in the doorway but why are we standing here coltrane made room come in and well no thats all right jennifer said too quickly i just wanted to stop by and leave this food i wasnt planning on staying i have a lot of things to do at the office tomorrow i planned on getting an early start cant you come in for a little while at least coltrane asked i was going to open a bottle of wine and yes tash said stay and well talk its awfully nice of you to bring the food im sure mitch is glad not to have to eat leftovers he was going to reheat some marinara sauce he made yesterday oh i dont know jennifers voice sounded a little choked he makes great marinara sauce she backed away i really have to be going it was a pleasure to meet you tash ill talk to you later mitch but happy new year happy new year conscious of the heavy box of tupperware in his hands coltrane watched jennifer walk to the curb get in her bmw and drive away she didnt look back only after her headlights vanished over the hill did coltrane nudge the door shut lock this for me will you sure tash said i have the uneasy feeling i got in the way of something are the two of you its complicated were trying to see if we can work things out again he climbed the stairs toward the living room this misunderstanding couldnt have helped any tash followed is she the friend you mentioned the one who emphasized that this was the time of year to concentrate on new beginnings im afraid so coltrane felt terrible about what had happened i suspect this wasnt the kind of beginning she had in mind ill call her first thing tomorrow when they entered the dining room tash faltered these strings of beads on the walls yes theyre unusual arent they but tash shook her head baffled they were in one of the photographs downstairs one of the nudes rebecca chance used to own this house what after she disappeared randolph packard bought the place and kept it exactly as it was when she lived here what in gods name is going on thats what i was hoping youd be able to tell me never mind the wine tash said abruptly have you got any scotch worried about her manner coltrane poured it do you want ice or no tash grabbed the glass and took two quick swallows she closed her eyes then opened them now you can add ice and water are you okay no coltrane waited im scared coltrane nodded but i dont know what scares me more the man whos stalking me or the photographs you showed me im even afraid of this house why on earth it makes me feel like im being dragged back in time rebecca chance is here i can sense her i also feel randolph packard but he loved her theres nothing to be afraid of hold me what ive never felt so alone and scared please hold me momentarily coltrane found it impossible to move hoping that his trembling wouldnt betray him he moved close stopped facetoface with her and put his arms around her he did it gently not pressing himself against her simply holding her closing his eyes he felt her head sink against his left shoulder he smelled sun and salt water in her hair he tried to control his breathing as she raised her own arms and put them around his back then he couldnt subdue his trembling any longer but it didnt matter because tash was trembling also holding him tighter they were pressed against each other he felt the rise and fall of her chest he started to become erect afraid that she would notice then her shoulders heaved and all at once she made a sound that might have been a sob as his erection diminished she gently pushed away from him wiped a tear from her right cheek and gave him the saddest smile he had ever seen thank you there were a lot of times when i felt alone and afraid coltrane said anytime you need a shoulder its strange i met you only this afternoon but already i feel youre a friend same here tash leaned to kiss him on the cheek but her stomach rumbled and she looked down abashed unexpectedly she laughed so did coltrane thats twice tash said twice that i laughed today thanks to you her stomach rumbled again and she laughed again wed better get some food into you coltrane said tashs smile was no longer sad as they heated food on the stove and in the microwave coltrane made a decision about an idea that he had been debating have you got walts phone number tash looked up from gravy she was stirring two one at the sheriffs station and the other at his home i have them memorized in case i need him in a hurry this late hes probably off duty give me his home number why i think i know a way to trap the man whos stalking you tash looked mystified after she told him the number and he picked up the phone for the first time he noticed the flashing red light on the answering machine presumably the message that jennifer had said she left continuing to feel terrible about the misunderstanding he pressed numbers three rings later a recognizable male voice answered it sounded a little huskier perhaps because of alcohol whats up this is mitch coltrane again swell immediately a possible implication hit walt why has something happened to tash shes fine thats not why im calling are you on a cellular phone no good theres less chance of anybody eavesdropping when we spoke earlier you said you were going to tashs house tomorrow to search for hidden microphones at the stove tash watched him more confused you should have mentioned those microphones when nobody else was with you walt said you made me sound as if i didnt know my job that wasnt my intention and what about now i dont understand is tash listening now no shes in the bathroom coltrane lied so what about the microphones ive got an idea im still working out ideally it would be better if you didnt search for the microphones but in case somebody used a scanner to eavesdrop on the cellular phone you had earlier you have to do what you said you were going to do otherwise hell get suspicious what are you talking about if you do find hidden microphones dont disconnect them all coltrane said leave a few as if you hadnt found them are you telling me how to do my job again listen to me the plan im trying to put together wont work unless whoevers after tash overhears her talking about her travel schedule for the next few days another trap not quite i havent thought all of it through yet coltrane said when i see you tomorrow well talk about it when you see me tomorrow walt asked wow thatll certainly give me a reason to wake up cheery coltrane set down the phone why did you lie that i was in the bathroom tash asked walts manly feelings get hurt if i make suggestions when youre around he means well tash said oh i dont doubt hes determined to help tash studied him youve got me curious about this plan you mentioned a couple of years ago i did a photo assignment for the lapd threat management unit i hid outside the house of a woman who was being stalked in the middle of the night i managed to take a photograph of a man pouring gasoline on her lawn the reference to gasoline made tash wince yes you mentioned that when you spoke to walt earlier the woman was able to identify the man from the photograph coltrane said he was someone shed dated twice several years before my photograph put him in jail and suppose there are microphones hidden in your house if hes been overhearing you talk about your schedule that explains how hes been able to follow you so closely and get pictures of you wherever you go so tomorrow youll talk about your schedule one more time to someone on the phone or to walt at your house or whomever coltrane said then youll go about your business and well hope that he takes the bait because this time therell be another photographer wherever you go coltrane pointed at himself ill stay back far enough to take pictures of anybody in the area with emphasis on people with cameras after a couple of locations if the same face shows up in the photographs and if i recognize that face coltrane nodded the police will put the bastard in jail and you can sleep peacefully for a change if only tashs shoulders slowly relaxed i want that to happen so much she touched his arm thank you youve given me a reason to hope a bubbling sound made them turn toward the stove good lord the gravy the tension was broken as ordinary life interrupted coltrane took pleasure from mundane chores carrying bowls from the oven and setting them on heatresistant pads tash arranged place settings be back in a moment she left the kitchen hearing the bathroom door click shut coltrane couldnt keep from glancing toward the flashing red light on his answering machine he set down a bottle of fumé blanc that hed been opening and pressed the play button its me jennifers voice said still at my parents just a little cleanup left ill be heading out in a little while in case you get back before i talk to you again dont make anything for supper moms put together a ton of leftovers for you ill take a chance that youll be home and drive by water ran in the bathroom as the door opened coltrane pressed the stop button did i hear someone talking tash asked just checking my messages anything you have to deal with not tonight in that case are you ready tash ate heartily but thinking of jennifer coltrane felt so dispirited it was all he could do to get through his meal daniel greg and his grandparents stood before him while ilkovics headless corpse came up behind them about to scream coltrane jerked awake sweating he stared at the shadows of windblown trees rippling across the dark ceiling then he jerked a second time realizing that one of the shadows was from something moving in his bedroom but before he could roll out of bed and try to defend himself his sleepclouded mind cleared enough for him to understand that the shadow at the top of the stairs leading into his bedroom belonged to tash she wore a white robe he had given her part of it obscured by her dark hair hanging over her shoulders her face invisible did i scare you no not you coltrane wiped a hand across his clammy forehead i was having a nightmare i know you were moaning i heard you all the way in the guest bedroom downstairs i came to see if youre okay thanks coltranes rushing heart rate slowly subsided ill be fine now sorry to wake you you didnt tash paused i was already awake another pause i had a nightmare too how bad very bad somewhere between fright and terror yeah that definitely qualifies as a nightmare lord i hope this isnt a pattern for the new year why should the new year be any different from the old coltrane propped himself up on his elbows i promise you my plans going to work the police will catch this guy the new year will be different isnt it nice to think so why dont i make us some coffee no tash said im going to try to get back to sleep i hope it happens for you it almost never does maybe this time will be different im afraid to sleep alone in the darkness the white robe moved toward the bed coltrane felt the covers being pulled back pressure on the side of the bed tashs warmth then she pulled the covers over both of them and they were together so tired she said close your eyes try to sleep he touched her shoulder to calm her and was shocked again static electricity shot off her off her bare skin making him realize that she had dropped the robe before he could restrain himself he kissed her lightly not even when ilkovic had stalked him at the maynard ranch had he felt so terrified dizzy from his hammering heartbeat he became even dizzier when her mouth opened her tongue finding his his mind aswirl he cupped a hand over a breast feeling its nipple harden under his palm she moaned her arms encircling him his lightheadedness intensified he had never felt skin so smooth pubic hair so silken his sensations whirling he touched her moistness and groaned as she dug her fingernails into his chest he flicked his tongue across her nipples with frightening need she put her hand on his penis thrust herself up and guided him into her wrapping her legs around his waist at once her urgency abated gently she rocked he whimpered he had never felt anything so smooth and moist and tight and sweet then he couldnt hold back his short thrusts became longer she moaned in unison with him their hips locked in a frenzy she screamed as she came and his own release was so powerful that he felt it go all the way to the top of his head which seemed to have exploded they lay in silence that static electricity you give off i saw sparks in the darkness coltrane said i felt sparks ive never experienced anything like yes he drew a hand along her smooth thigh along her flat stomach over each of her breasts he had the sensation of worshiping now it was his turn to say yes youve chased away the nightmares ill always chase them away coltrane said he suddenly remembered that randolph packard and rebecca chance had probably made love in this very room on this very bed so long ago and now he had made love here with rebecca chances lookalike possibly with her granddaughter not alone tash murmured thats right coltrane said you wont be alone any longer she sighed snuggling against him her weight settling her body relaxing soon she drifted off to sleep her breathing slow steady and faint but coltrane didnt sleep for a long while he was unable to adjust to her presence next to him to the heartswelling reality of what they had done ten he awoke with a rising fear that it had all been a dream that tash wouldnt be lying next to him but she was her eyes flickering slowly open focusing warmly on him hi her smile was welcoming hi she touched his cheek sleep well when i got myself calmed down she chuckled and you coltrane asked how did you sleep for the first time in a long while im not waking up more exhausted than when i went to bed heaven knows i ought to feel exhausted after the workout we gave ourselves maybe we need a massage therapist tash stretched her breasts lifting her naked body shifting next to him oh i think any aches weve got we can make feel better by ourselves yes everything is going to be fine coltrane thought he had worried that she would wake up with remorse telling him that it had all been a mistake that they had to pretend it had never happened and just be friends although she regretted that being friends would be almost impossible after what they had done and maybe it would be better if they didnt see each other again but tash was so at ease with their being in bed together that he felt joyous what about you she asked have you got any aches that need feeling better one show me here coltrane said oh yes i can see why that would ache what do you suppose we should do about it well theres a remedy the natives in bora bora practice youve been there no but i took a correspondence course in their customs of course theres nothing like handson experience what i learned is that when this kind of ache comes up theres a particular spot that has to be massaged smart natives not there whatever are you thinking of i past there behind it shall i explain what they discovered absolutely as long as you keep ive got nothing else on my mind behind your testicles yes im listening in the crutch of your legs theres a cord that leads from yes i feel it your prostate to your testicles and when i draw my index finger back and forth along that cord so gently with the flat of my finger are you sure im not boring you definitely not because if i am boring you no please keep when i trace my index finger along this cord youll notice that it gets larger yes and that your testicles compact yes and that the more i stroke this cord your penis gets harder your cord gets more swollen your testicles get whats the matter the cat got your tongue tash asked somethings got something else of me but the aches getting worse then the treatment isnt working id better stop no the treatments going to work im sure of it i think it is too but i suddenly realized that i forgot the most important part i have to position myself like this and lower myself down onto you like this and yes afterward he lay spent so relaxed that he didnt move until a few minutes after tash went into the shower a highpitched noise made him turn toward tashs purse she had carried it up from the downstairs bedroom and left it on a chair outside the bathroom door the cellular phone in the purse was making its unpleasant sound again hello whos this a husky voice asked coltrane what the good morning walt whats wrong with tashs phone last night i tried for an hour to reach her now ive been trying for another hour nobody answers shes supposed to keep the phone with her wherever she goes and she has i dont understand why it didnt then coltrane realized until a while ago her purse was in another part of the house i guess we didnt hear it house shes at your place i thought you were taking her to a hotel change of plan put her on i cant why not shes in the shower walt didnt say anything for a moment his voice was thicker when he spoke again you were right about microphones being in her house i just got back to the station after the tech crew finished its search there were bugs in every room the sobs been listening to every word she said and everything you and the other men said when you were over there planning how to trap him we look like fools walt said did you do what i suggested did you leave some of the microphones i dont know what you think youre did you one in the living room thatll be enough but whats this about ill explain when we get there two hours the sheriffs station the bathroom door swung open tash came out with a towel wrapped around her her wet hair combed close to her head her features sculpted she raised her eyebrows is it walt coltrane nodded tash took the phone good morning she said into it her voice was wonderful she walked around coltrane and pressed herself against his bare back no it was a very quiet night i went to bed early i slept like the dead the day after new years the beverly center was teeming with shoppers the cavernous multistoried building reverberated with the rumbling echo of innumerable voices and footsteps coltrane was surprised he had expected the place to be semideserted everyone tired of shopping for christmas but maybe people were returning unwanted presents or looking for sales whatever the reason for their presence they made it both easier and harder for him to accomplish his task easier because he had expected to have trouble concealing himself while he took photographs of tashs progress through the mall whereas the crowd gave him all the cover he needed harder because the crowd also gave cover to his quarry to anyone who followed tash showing undue interest in her and taking her picture he was on the third level of the massive shopping center peering over a railing down toward the escalator that carried a steady stream of shoppers from the first level to the second and third he was by no means the only one at the railing otherwise he would never have dared show himself across from him several people drank coffee at a starbucks concession to his right a group of teenagers leaned over shouting down to friends to his left a middleaged man leaned the other way his back against the railing sipping an orange julius while he waited for his wife to return from a dress shop that she had entered a few minutes after coltrane got into position potted plants pillars and directional displays added further visual clutter as did the continuous chaotic movement of shoppers just behind coltrane anyone who suspected this might be a trap would take an awfully long while to spot coltrane and by then coltrane or at least his camera would have spotted him he glanced at his watch almost two oclock any moment now he thought and lifted his camera from a shopping bag adjusting its zoom lens as if on cue tash stepped onto the escalator that led up from the first level to the second coltrane hadnt expected to have any trouble seeing her her magnetic presence would have distinguished her in any crowd nonetheless he was amazed by how immediately he noticed her by contrast the two men with her were relatively inconspicuous one in front the other in back walts partner lyle and one of the state troopers whom coltrane had met the previous afternoon both had the day off and had accepted the chance to earn more extra money as her bodyguards they wore casual clothes and slightly oversized windbreakers that concealed the handguns they carried their presence reassuring coltrane returned his attention to tash planning todays strategy the group had debated whether she should wear something attentiongetting to make her easier for him to spot but they had dismissed the idea as one that would be likely to make her stalker suspicious obviously a woman afraid of being followed wouldnt want to be conspicuous unless she was trying to bait a trap accordingly they had agreed that she would wear something attractive without being ostentatious camel slacks a dark blue blazer an ecru silk blouse and modest silver earrings but as coltrane looked down at her from the railing of the third level he now realized that it was impossible for her not to attract attention even from a distance her beauty was manifest with her hand on the railing of the escalator her body turned sideways she looked like a fashion model as faces on the opposite descending escalator pivoted in her direction coltrane started snapping pictures it wasnt likely that anyone on the descending escalator would be the man he was hunting but coltrane didnt want to take chances there was no way of telling what he might inadvertently capture in the background three shots later he raised his aim and got pictures of the crowd on both sides of where the escalator came up to the second level because he and tash had verbally rehearsed her movements coltrane knew that she would turn toward the right as a consequence he moved simultaneously with her but in the opposite direction to the left farther along the railing able to snap several photographs of her shifting through the crowd below and across from him a little farther along he caught her entering a clothing boutique even with a zoom lens it was hard to tell from this distance whether anyone gave her more than the usual admiring glances no one seemed to be photographing her but because he was looking mostly through the viewfinder he couldnt be sure the magnified photographs would tell the story he changed position heading to the right this time to the store above the clothing store that she had entered from that vantage point he could look across the huge open space between levels he could peer down toward the stores opposite the one that tash had entered he could see if anyone showed unusual interest in that store staying back from the railing so he wouldnt be obvious he made sure to change angles getting as wide a variety of shots as possible once more he checked his watch a half hour had passed as he and tash had planned it was time for her to be coming out so he shifted to the side opposite the door that she and her two bodyguards would be coming through he caught photographs of the crowd on each side of anyone who might be watching aware that she and her bodyguards would now head toward the down escalator he reached a spot where he could take photographs of anyone watching from the first level as she and her escorts descended the escalator from the second level at the bottom they moved out of his sight heading along a corridor of stores toward an elevator that would take them to the parking garage but by hurrying to the escalator and taking it three steps at a time down to the second level coltrane was able to get tash in sight again and photograph the shoppers in the corridor below him she entered the elevator its doors closed his camera clicked on the last exposure as the rewind motor whirred he lowered the camera his back muscles slowly relaxed but his tension was the result of exhilaration working a camera after so long had given him a rush as had the clandestine nature of the photographs he was taking the idea that he was trying to trap someone who wouldnt know that he was being photographed he wondered if that was the same kind of rush that the stalker got the power of observing without being observed of capturing someones soul without the targets being aware that the theft had occurred suddenly chilled he remembered the vulnerability and nakedness he had suffered when he found the photographs that dragan ilkovic had taken of him as soon as the cameras rewind motor finished whirring he quickly removed the exposed film and put in a new roll all the while he calculated he had to hurry to his car and get to tashs next destination another clothing boutique this one on the third street pedestrian shopping area in santa monica after that she would go to a similar store in westwood and finally all the way down to yet another clothing boutique at the south coast plaza in orange county she owned all of them he had learned she also owned three more in san diego and four in san francisco i have other investments too she had said while they drove to the malibu sheriffs station that morning i try to stay out of their daytoday affairs but periodically i drop in just to let the managers know big sister is watching in the case of the clothing boutiques my interest is greater so i pay visits more often this afternoon and this evening would be a good time to make my rounds do you ever phone your managers to alert them when youre coming always granted it gives them a chance to hide anything that might be wrong but it also makes me seem less adversarial than if i showed up unannounced trying to catch them at something i dont want the managers to be afraid of me i want them to work hard for me this morning after you get back to your house why dont you use the phone to make appointments at the various stores for this afternoon add enough time between stops so i can get to each one ahead of you but what i say will be transmitted through the hidden microphone walt left in the house hell know my timetable exactly coltrane had said and well know his with the first phase completed coltrane got on the escalator down to the beverly centers bottom level the time was twentyfive to three depending on traffic tash needed only a half hour to get to the store in santa monica but since the plan required him to arrive ahead of her she had added another half hour to the timetable making a appointment with the manager tashs stalker who had presumably overheard the telephone conversation wouldnt expect her until then meanwhile coltrane would be able to arrive in time to start shooting various angles of the crowd of course tashs stalker might decide not to show up at any of the a hand shoved him from behind with such force that coltrane lurched forward on the escalator and almost lost his balance startled he grabbed the railing to keep from falling and spun toward the person who had shoved him hey watch where youre twice as startled he found himself facetoface with carl nolan the sergeant and he were about the same height six feet but nolan was on a step higher than coltrane and seemed to tower his weight lifters shoulders looking broader than usual nolan jabbed him again harder jolting coltranes right shoulder almost falling coltrane gripped the railing harder what are you keep your hands off her people on the escalator couldnt help noticing as distracted as coltrane was he sensed their agitation for gods sake have you lost your mind nolan jabbed him a third time stay away from her if you dont stop youre missing the point nolan gripped coltranes right arm with a force that made coltrane wince this is about you stopping coltrane suddenly felt off balance the escalator no longer moving with equal abruptness he realized that hed reached the bottom the people whod gotten off ahead of him scattered nolan tightened his grip on coltranes arm youre not going to make a fuss were going to walk calmly over to that elevator were going to find a nice quiet spot in the parking garage where we can chat nolan squeezed so hard that he cut off the circulation in coltranes arm whatever you want right thats a good beginning whatever i want shoppers farther along hadnt noticed what was happening moving coltrane steadily through the crowd nolan reached the elevator and pushed a button when the doors opened nolan shoved him inside for a moment they bumped together and coltrane felt nolans handgun in its shoulder holster under his windbreaker the doors rumbled shut the elevator descending take it easy coltrane said i dont know what this is about but nolans eyes were wide with fury i already told you what this is about you stopping an elderly couple in the elevator looked nervous the doors opened and nolan tugged coltrane into the parking garage along a row of cars nolan glanced around to see if anyone was nearby then shoved coltrane between two minivans until coltranes back was against a concrete wall the minivans blocked them from view youre never going near tash again carl think about what youre doing youre risking your job you cant assault me youll lose your badge whos going to tell you that i did this nolan punched coltrane in the stomach as air wheezed out of him coltrane doubled over and sank to his knees his hands locked tightly to his stomach or that i did this nolan rocketed the heel of the palm of his hand against the side of coltranes head it knocked coltrane to the floor answer me whos going to tell sprawled on the concrete coltrane didnt know which hurt worse his stomach or his head if youd let us bring you in and protect you greg would still be alive if youd done what you were supposed to mccoy wouldnt be in the hospital you treated me like a fool and kept me waiting at your place while you went off to be a hero you had to show me you were smarter than me that you knew better than anybody how to handle ilkovic when coltrane tried to stand nolan used the heel of his palm to slam his forehead and knock him onto the floor again the martialarts move protected nolans hand while carrying power and not leaving a mark oh ive tried to be a good sport and hide my feelings i tried to tell myself im being too harsh that you got the job done on ilkovic that you paid him back for greg hell i almost had myself convinced but then you showed up at tashs yesterday and made me and the other guys look like idiots the next thing i know shes asking you to stay and the next thing after that youre taking her to your house and the next thing after that she spends the night with you now if that isnt fast work i dont know what is carl shut up while im talking to you the way this is going to work youre never going to tell anyone about this conversation and youre never going to see tash again his vision blurry coltrane peered up at him you and tash i told you to shut up whats going on a male voice demanded coltrane shifted his gaze as nolan pivoted toward the front of the minivans a uniformed security guard studied them nervously he was in his early thirties tensefaced railthin compared to nolan and shorter he drew a walkietalkie from a holster on his belt i had a complaint about a disturbance his voice was unsteady break it up lapd nolan already had his police wallet out of his windbreaker opening it showing his badge i just apprehended a suspect he tried to get away the security guard narrowed his eyes and assessed the badge lapd he looked relieved i wasnt sure what was do you need any help ive got everything under control nolan said you can go back to what you were doing ill handle this right the guard stepped back i wont get in the way nolan waited until the guards footsteps receded to a faint echo followed by the thump of a door closing he pointed rigidly at coltrane that was smart of you not to contradict me keeping a careful distance coltrane wavered to his feet his head throbbed why would i this doesnt involve anybody but you and me thats where youre wrong it involves you and me and tash dont go near her again or ill put you in the hospital is that plain enough for you totally then we understand each other nolan turned and walked away propped against the concrete wall coltrane held his stomach his chest heaved he fought the impulse to be sick he listened to nolans heavy footsteps heard them stop heard a car door an engine and tires squealing slowly he pushed away from the wall his chest continued to heave no longer because his breath had been knocked out but because of anger is there something you forgot to tell me about carl nolan coltrane demanded it was ten to four he was using a pay phone at the outdoor pedestrian mall on third street in santa monica despite his injuries he had managed to get to the mall before tash arrived he had photographed the crowd from as many angles as he could without drawing attention to himself from a discreet position he had watched tash and her escorts approach the clothing boutique and enter he had crossed the promenade and gotten shots of the crowd on the opposite side with all of his obligations taken care of he had then done what he had been determined to do since nolan had delivered his final warning and stormed away phone tash at the store and find out what in gods name was going on mitch what are you talking about tashs voice was taut with confusion nolan seems to think that you and he are an item he did his best to beat the hell out of me to prove his point he what oh my god down the mall from the store coltrane warily studied the crowd for all i know hes in the neighborhood and hes going to beat the hell out of me again to make sure the lesson sticks so if it isnt too damned much trouble would you mind telling me whats going on this is terrible i never imagined hed are you hurt not as much as im confused do you have a relationship with him no its complicated i cant talk about this on the phone well youre going to have to talk to me about him sometime i will soon i promise could he be your stalker carl no he cant be i didnt meet him until a week after i started getting the letters and phone calls he didnt know me until then he couldnt have started this then maybe hes continuing it making himself indispensable maybe hes the one who bugged your house and started the fire last night no coltrane immediately corrected himself if nolan did those things he wouldnt be stupid enough to come at me and risk drawing suspicion but if he isnt your stalker and he didnt plant the microphones how did he know i was going to be at the beverly center walt told him walt after you dropped me off at the sheriffs station carl phoned and asked to be brought uptodate walt explained the plan we were trying theres nothing mysterious about how carl knew where youd be its not like he had to be listening to the microphone in my living room i was sure head pounding coltrane couldnt resist going back to the same insistent question why does he think im interfering with something you have going with him please tash sounded selfconscious there are people here we have to meet so i can explain its not what youre thinking im not sure what im thinking its innocent youre going to have to take my word until we see each other when you wont be done at the south coast plaza until maybe eight oclock that means you wont get home until around eleven i need to develop the photographs so you can study them and see if you recognize anybody thats going to take until why dont you save time and come to my house love to your bodyguards can leave you there and hold it does carl know where you live yes coltrane remembered nolans long wait at packards house while he himself had gone to the maynard ranch instead of leading ilkovic to the trap that nolan had prepared he might watch your house in case i show up tash said i dont want any more trouble because of me i can deal with its my problem tash insisted ill take care of it ill phone him as soon as i get home tonight ill settle this believe me he wont bother you again when you finish talking to him phone me i want to know what this is all about i promise youll understand everything tash hesitated i cant wait to see you frustrated coltrane listened to the click as she hung up slowly he replaced the receiver he took a deep breath trying to clear his mind tash and her escorts would soon be coming out of the shop he had to be ready to photograph the crowd as she appeared and walked toward the parking lot he couldnt allow himself to be distracted preoccupied he worked in packards darkroom filling the time until tash would phone him having purchased the necessary equipment and chemicals on his way back from the south coast plaza he processed the negatives that he had taken at the clothing boutiques the next step that of making eightbyten enlargements would be not only timeconsuming but tedious these were snapshots after all not composed artistic images there wasnt any creative challenge in developing them or stimulation in debating how to manipulate and crop them for the maximum aesthetic impact just get the job done he told himself in this case a onehour photoprocessing company would probably have done as well but following randolph packards example coltrane had never used a photoprocessing company in his career besides there was always the chance that the film he surrendered would be lost or damaged somehow and he was too impatient to see the results of todays effort to take that risk not to mention be forced to have tash go through todays dangerous charade for a second time his thought about packard made him imagine the countless times that packard had come into this darkroom and done what coltrane was now doing transferring prints from the developing tray to a tray filled with chemicals that stopped the development process he gently agitated the stopping solution careful to rotate the prints from top to bottom to make sure that the stopping chemicals touched them evenly then he shifted the prints to a tray filled with chemicals that fixed the image on the paper making it permanent he repeated the process of agitation and rotation finally placing the prints in a tray filled with slowly running water that would wash the chemicals from them he imagined packard standing in this same spot lovingly developing the photographs that he had taken of rebecca chance indeed he could almost sense packard within him as he gave in to the irresistible urge to make prints from a different negative entirely from the film that had been in the camera that he had taken to tashs house the previous day had packard felt what he now felt as he made an enlargement and carried the eightbyteninch photographic paper to the developing tray holding his breath as he gently agitated the solution had packard exhaled as rebecca chances features appeared before him just as tashs identical features now came to life before coltrane the alluring posture of the two women as they emerged from the ocean was identical true tash wore a formfitting divers suit whereas rebecca chance had a more revealing wet clinging bathing suit but for all that they were the same just as coltrane felt eerily that he and packard were the same both loving the same woman making love to the same woman in the same bed the phone rang its jangle startling despite his anticipation coltrane had become so absorbed in tashs image that he had stopped thinking about when she would call he jerked his head toward the phone that he had brought from the kitchen and plugged into a jack in the darkroom as much as he wanted to grab it he couldnt bear letting tashs image be ruined by keeping it too long in the chemicals quickly he removed it from the fixing solution shook fluid off it and set the print in the washing tray by then the phone had rung two more times in a rush he picked it up ive been waiting for your call how did it go he asked the person on the other end didnt answer right away the voice was faint somehow i suspect im not the one whose call youve been waiting for jennifer i told myself i wasnt going to do this coltrane felt a weight in his stomach how are you she swallowed as if trying to suppress emotion how do you think i meant to phone you today but you didnt jennifer said i couldnt something interfered i can imagine i wanted to explain about the misunderstanding last night oh jennifers voice was strained what misunderstanding is that why i was with tash instead of with you at your parents house im not sure there was a misunderstanding i think i understood very well we have to talk i dont like the sound of that jennifer get it over with talk i or maybe this isnt a good time maybe im interrupting something no im alone then why dont you let me in im using a car phone im outside your house jennifer looked small in the darkness in place of last nights armani dress she was wearing faded jeans an orange southern california magazine sweatshirt and a matching baseball cap the same outfit she had worn the day she set out with coltrane to find rudolph valentinos falcoln lair the memory made him ache hi hi youre sure its safe to come in jennifers eyes looked red as if shed been crying the coast is clear she entered uneasily the way she peered around made it seem that everything was strange to her the house unfamiliar can i get you something yeah a little arsenic sounds good coltrane didnt know what to say to that and used the motion of closing and locking the door to mask his awkwardness ill settle for scotch coltrane couldnt help remembering that scotch was what tash had wanted the previous night reaching the kitchen seemed to take forever but at least it was motion at least it too masked his awkwardness as did preparing her drink youre not going to have one with me jennifer asked no ive got a lot of work to do in the darkroom and i dont want to get sleepy this is tough enough as it is im not sure i can get through this if you make me drink alone coltranes heart went out to her of course why not lets have a drink together he got out another glass poured the scotch added ice and put in some water more motions for which he was grateful he raised his glass and clicked it against hers cheers i wouldnt go that far maybe heres mud in your eye but definitely not cheers jennifer took a long swallow made a face as if the drink was too strong and looked at him she was standing exactly where tash had stood the previous night talk im not sure how to begin as long as its the truth however you tell it will be fine ill make it easy for you the way you looked at her last night are you in love with her coltrane glanced at his hands jennifer nodded in discouragement you fell in love with rebecca chances photographs then you fell in love with rebecca chances lookalike its more complicated than that of course youre a complicated man is she really rebecca chances granddaughter is that why she looks so uncannily like her thats my suspicion coltrane said thats what im trying to find out jennifer took another long swallow and shuddered well as i told you on new years eve i cant compete with a woman whos that beautiful not with a ghost really you should have called me today you should have put me out of my misery i never meant to i had a good reason for not calling you make me believe you werent planning to dump me without bothering to let me know i can i show you some photographs i dont think i could bear to look at more pictures of her its not what you think coltrane said these are different trust me youll understand what i mean when you look at them trust you jennifer said hollowly coltrane entered the darkroom ahead of jennifer before she could see the print of tash in the divers suit he used tongs to turn the print upside down in the washing tray he hoped that she hadnt noticed what he was doing that her attention was directed toward where he pointed toward prints that were attached by clamps to a nylon cord drying he turned on the overhead lights crowd scenes jennifer sounded puzzled those were taken at the beverly center but jennifer turned to him more confused why would you take them so many the compositions are clumsy chaotic i wasnt trying for an aesthetic arrangement i just shot what i saw is this some new direction youre taking i hope not these cant compare with the photographs you took after you met packard before all the trouble started its a different kind of project different jennifer looked back at the enlargements walking along paying closer attention oh she had finally seen tash among the chaos even in a crowd she stands out jennifer sounded puzzled but she doesnt seem aware shes being photographed its almost as if frowning she faced him again you were following her actually ive been ahead of her i dont know what youre talking about its going to take awhile to explain when he finished jennifer shook her head in dismay ilkovic wasnt enough for you you have to get yourself involved in a similar situation its not the same this time im not the one being stalked unless you count nolan the way you describe him hes been dealing with stalkers so long that he became one nolan will calm down once tash makes him understand theres nothing between them but why did he think there was something between them in the first place i dont know yet coltrane said tash told me shes going to explain jennifer took one more look at the photographs then another look at him i give up i wont waste any more of your time weve been through a lot together i want to make sure everythings right between us that isnt going to happen mitch just because i want some closure on this that doesnt mean everythings going to be right between us and dont you dare say i hope we can still be friends coltrane nodded she owns more stores in san francisco and san diego jennifer said and that doesnt count the other investments she didnt specify shes not only rich shes dropdead gorgeous you certainly got lucky coltrane shrugged awkward how did she get the money i dont know her mother died a couple of years ago maybe it was an inheritance how did her mother get so much money i have no idea coltrane said i didnt feel it was any of my business well the two of you are certainly going to have a lot to talk about i wont say i hope it works out for you because thats not the way i feel jennifer hesitated mustering the strength to continue but i will say this i hope you dont get hurt she blinked unsettled jennifer id better go home a tear trickled down her cheek they walked upstairs to the front door goodbye im sorry coltrane said not as much as i am jennifer wiped away another tear and stepped outside it took her two tries to tell him as soon as the special edition of the magazine is ready youll get the first copy they really are great photographs mitch her voice broke regardless of everything thats happened im proud that i was in your life when you took them coltranes throat felt squeezed lingering in the open doorway he watched her walk to the curb and get into her car as on the previous night she didnt look back when she drove away only after her headlights started to climb the hill away from his house did he move to step back into the house but he stopped himself noticing her headlights pass a car parked near the murky crest it was hard to tell in the night and at a distance but the vehicle might have been an explorer the kind of car nolan drove someone was behind the steering wheel looking in coltranes direction jennifers headlights disappeared over the hill the car became barely visible nolan coltranes stomach muscles were still sore from where he had been punched angry he wanted to storm up the hill and find out if that was nolan watching the house but his fury was displaced by a despondency about jennifer that made him too weary for a confrontation he wished that there had been another way he had never wanted to hurt her i bet thats something else jennifer would have been annoyed to hear me tell her he thought he stepped back into the house and locked the door if it was nolan out there he was going to have a long wasted night mouth dry coltrane glanced at his watch realizing that the time was almost midnight tash should have been home by now she should have called by now unless she was waiting to contact nolan first and nolan wasnt home unless that was in fact nolan in the car out there get back to work he told himself itll help distract you descending to the darkroom he shut off the overhead lights switched on the dim amber safelight and began making more prints from the negatives he had prepared then he remembered the print that he had turned upside down in the washing tray took it out of the water and was stunned anew by the beauty of tash in her diving suit as she emerged from the ocean her eyes seemed to look directly into his whats happening to me he thought how could someone ive known since only yesterday make me feel this way he had never believed that love at first sight was possible but then it hadnt been at first sight had it he reminded himself he had seen tashs face long before he had met her he remembered having read about the theory of soul mates that souls who had been devoted to each other in a former life could never be fulfilled unless they found each other in a later life perhaps that explained the irresistible attraction that had overcome him it was as if he had recognized rebecca chance the first time he had seen her photograph it was as if he had been in love with her in another time and now had the chance to be in love with her again with tash whatever youre feeling it doesnt need an explanation he told himself youll ruin it so far he had made prints only for the shots he had taken at the stores in the beverly center santa monica and westwood he still had to deal with the images of the crowd near the store in the south coast plaza uneasy that tash hadnt called beginning to worry that something had happened to her he forced himself to go to the enlarger and put one of the processed negatives into the negative holder after determining the correct focus he put a sheet of eightbyteninch printing paper into the easel set the timer and turned on the enlarger lamp which was positioned above the negative and cast a beam through it projecting the negatives image down through a magnifying lens and onto the paper if he had been preparing prints that were intended to be displayed he would have done tests to determine the ideal length of time to expose the lightsensitive paper to the negatives enlarged image using trial and error to achieve the perfect density of detail and contrast of lights and darks but these prints were important only for their information not their aesthetic appeal he needed to get them done as soon as possible so he didnt care about perfection only whether the faces in the crowd were clear enough for tash to be able to recognize any of them his experience with developing the previous prints had taught him that twenty seconds was an effective length of time to let the negatives projected image touch the paper the instant the timer clicked the enlarger lamp turned off automatically he removed the paper and set it where the only illumination that could reach it would be from the dim amber safelight when he had exposed half a dozen sheets of paper he took them to the developing tray set them in the solution and gently agitated the tray rotating the sheets developing them evenly the magic happened feeling a surge of anticipation coltrane studied them as he had the earlier prints during his fifteen years as a professional photographer he had trained himself to have a keen visual memory so he could easily recall details from earlier prints but now his surge of anticipation changed to a sinking feeling of disappointment for he still had not seen any faces that recurred in various locations his pride made him hope that he wouldnt have to admit to tash that his plan had been a failure to make matters worse the six prints in the developing tray had something wrong with them the faces in the bottomright corner of each print were overexposed too dark to be distinguished the faces in the rest of the area were perfectly acceptable however that contrast told him that although twenty seconds of exposure to the enlargers light was sufficient for most of the area in these prints their bottomright corners needed only fifteen seconds the prints werent usable muttering an expletive he shoved them into a waste can and returned to the enlarger he prepared to reexpose sheets of paper to the six negatives for each one he again set the timer for twenty seconds but for this set of prints when the timer reached fifteen seconds he slowly waved his right hand between the paper and the negative preventing the enlarger lamp from projecting onto the bottomright corner of each print for the final five seconds the movement of his hand reminded him of a magicians gesture an apt comparison because he was after all performing darkroom magic by lessening the exposure time on the lowerright corners he was able to enhance that area and bring out details when the sheets were finally exposed he set them into the developing tray but this time when the images came to life he opened his mouth in shock the previously indistinct lowerright corners were now vivid as at the beverly center he had taken these shots from an upper level aiming down at the crowd on the first print in the sequence he found himself staring at a man with a mm camera raised to his face aiming in the direction of where tash and her bodyguards approached her store the camera was a mask preventing coltrane from noting the mans features the saltandpepper hair was an indication of middle age that and the mans somewhathefty build were the only identifiers feeling as if something sharp was caught in his throat coltrane turned to the next print in the sequence and saw that the man had pivoted slightly to the right his camera remaining at eye level his finger pressing the shutter button he was taking a photograph of tash as she walked along the new angle of his mostly hidden face revealed a thick neck and the suggestion of a puffy cheek coltrane turned to the third print in the series where the man had pivoted more to the right continuing to take photographs of tash from this angle coltrane saw a hint of a jowl he told himself that he had to be wrong that his imagination was deceiving him hurrying he flipped through the final three prints in the sequence and saw in stop action the man lower his camera to his chin to his neck to his chest never removing his intense gaze from where tash was walking the mans profiled face was now fully in the open and coltrane felt nauseated as he was forced to admit that he hadnt been wrong that his imagination hadnt deceived him the man was duncan reynolds when the phone rang coltrane had trouble getting his muscles to work only after two more rings was he able to avert his eyes from the prints and pick up the phone concerned that jennifer might have broken her word and decided to call he kept his voice neutral or tried to the stress of having identified duncan reynolds made him hoarse hello not very enthusiastic tash sounded mischievous i thought youd be a little more pleased to hear from me her tone was wonderfully sonorous pleased is an understatement did i wake you no ive been working coltrane frowned toward the prints he continued to strain to adjust to what he had discovered im sorry i took so long i didnt want to phone you until after i talked to carl but ive been ringing his number for the past hour and all i get is his answering machine thats because hes probably in a car up the street from me watching my house youre kidding someones in a car up the street it looks like the kind he drives jesus tash said i guess we were right to have me go home instead of to your place maybe not this time he wouldnt be catching me by surprise maybe i should go out there and no there doesnt have to be more trouble tash said i think i can get him to calm down i just need a chance to talk to him and make him understand that he got the wrong idea thats something id like to understand too coltrane said what wrong idea are you talking about i promised to tell you and im going to then how about now no not like this not over the phone i need to see your eyes i need to make sure that you understand its that bad theres nothing bad at all but this is going to take awhile and i remembered what you said about not using the cellular phone lyle and the state trooper are still with me i had them drive me to a pay phone at a gas station on the pacific coast highway im not exactly where i can talk about this tomorrow yes thats another reason im calling do you have anything you cant get away from for the next few days only from seeing you she didnt say anything for a moment that gave me shivers the good kind i hope in the right places can you meet me tomorrow morning at lax lax he asked in surprise at the delta counter ninefifteen that ought to give us enough time to buy our tickets and catch a tenten flight to where acapulco the estate i inherited i cant bear looking over my shoulder any longer i want to get away to where no one knows who we are where no one can bother us not carl not the creep whos after me nobody where its just the two of us where we can talk and swim and lie on the beach sounds good do other things sounds better youll go twist my arm tash laughed i like it when you laugh coltrane said the only time i laugh is when you make me maybe in mexico ill do more of it delta ninefifteen ill bring the photographs i developed i think i found something what tash asked quickly im still not sure what it means a face im curious if youll recognize it you think you found him maybe thats the best news i might be mistaken no ive got a good feeling coltrane turned off all the lights in the house taking care that he couldnt be seen he peered past the blinds in his living room and surveyed the darkness outside on the hill a streetlight cast a glow illuminating the upper part of the slope the car was gone he couldnt tell if he was relieved or more troubled eleven the moment the delta airlines lifted off its engines roaring tash said let me see the photographs but when coltrane tried to lean forward to pick up the carrying case in the storage compartment under his feet his seat belt prevented him he started to unbuckle it then thought better as the jet continued its steep climb from his righthand window seat he noticed that they were passing above the yachts and sailboats at marina del rey he had a painful mental image of jennifers condominium down there saturday morning she might be sitting on her balcony drinking coffee perhaps looking up at the jet flying over id better wait until we level off he said i could barely sleep for worrying that i wouldnt be able to identify the face youre suspicious about identifying the face isnt the problem i already know who he is the question is will he look familiar to you you know who he is it came as a big surprise in the photographs theres a man taking photographs of you randolph packards assistant duncan reynolds does that name mean anything to you no confused tash searched her memory i dont understand what does packards assistant have to do with me why would he single me out if i dont know him maybe youll soon have an answer glancing out the window again coltrane saw the gleam of sails on the wavescudded ocean then the jet banked inland heading south over the smogshrouded la basin to the right in the distance he saw the tiny outline of santa catalina island and was reminded that packards mother and father had died in a sailing accident near there packard then sixteen had been the only survivor according to his biographies the family had just returned from a voyage to mexico had they been to acapulco just as he and tash were going there the pilot isnt climbing so steeply now tash said his thoughts interrupted coltrane turned from the window and looked at her again he was struck by her beauty she had dressed casually deck shoes khaki pants a yellow cotton pullover and a linen jacket it too khaki the cuffs folded up a turquoise necklace hardly any makeup only subtle eyeliner that echoed something in the turquoise and a touch of peach lipstick but for all her casual appearance she looked stunning yes he unbuckled his seat belt leaned forward and picked up the black case when he opened it and handed her some of the photographs he had never seen a more intense expression on anyones face which one tash asked i dont want to prejudice you im going to start with the first exposure i made well go through the locations in the order you visited them starting with the beverly center as tash examined each one she pursed her lips in concentration i dont see anybody i recognize heres the next set again tash concentrated nobody i recognize here either no repeated faces none she went through the third set with the same result theres too much to pay attention to im worried that im missing something keep trying heres the fourth set were almost finished coltrane had put the photographs that troubled him into the middle where they wouldnt be conspicuous nope nothing on this one either and not on this one and words catching in her throat tash raised the next photograph then went back to the three previous ones tensing she looked at several of the next ones him the one with the camera i shouldnt have mentioned the camera it prejudiced you no in fact i went right by it your eyes for this are better than mine but this man she tapped a face this man i recognize he was with the attorney who came to my house and told me that randolph packard had included me in his will coltrane stared but the name he used wasnt duncan reynolds it was william butler he said he worked for the attorney whats going on why did he lie to me maybe he didnt want you to know his connection with packard obviously if you knew who he was youd have asked him all kinds of questions about why packard included you in his will questions he didnt want to answer its a reasonable guess but why wouldnt he have wanted to answer my questions tashs voice had become so strong with anxiety that an expensively dressed couple in the adjacent row frowned at her she leaned close to coltrane and lowered her voice why is he doing this to me i told you i did a photo assignment for the lapd threat management unit coltrane said yes it taught me a lot people think that stalkers are either rejected husbands and boyfriends or fans obsessed with celebrities and politicians but there are other categories i found out some stalkers have only a casual relationship with their victims a checkout kid at a supermarket becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman who shops there he stands close to her while she pays by check and he gets a look at her name and address he starts driving by her house when that doesnt satisfy him he watches the house at night then thats not enough and he follows her he phones the house hoping to hear her voice he sends her flowers and notes he takes surreptitious photographs of her he wants desperately to have a relationship with her but he knows thats impossible and as his frustration mounts he gets angry finally he decides to punish her for being too good for him so he gets a can of gasoline or a knife or a gun and tash shuddered youre suggesting duncan reynolds fits that profile i wouldnt have believed it without the evidence to tell you the truth i kind of like him he doesnt seem the type coltrane said but then what is the type when neighbors find out the man living next door to them just went to where he works and shot five people they always say but he was so quiet i never would have expected him to do anything like that who knows what anybodys capable of tash shuddered again what you said about the knife is a little too vivid sorry i didnt mean to upset you coltrane touched her hand to reassure her a crackle of static electricity jumped from her they both stared at where it had happened maybe what im really giving off is fear tash reached for the telephone attached to the seat back in front of her what are you doing coltrane asked im phoning walt now that we finally know whos been threatening me the police can arrest him they can make the bastard admit hes been stalking me no stop coltrane said whats wrong walt cant do anything without evidence hell want to see the photographs then well show them to him a thought struck her oh you see what im getting at youll have to explain why you cant show him the photographs a vague excuse about taking a brief trip first is only going to puzzle him if your evidence is so convincing why are you waiting a couple of days to bring it to him ill seem like a flake unless you tell him the whole story coltrane said that you didnt see the photographs until you were on a jet to acapulco but once he knows where youre going hell ask why and our quiet getaway becomes everybodys business tash exhaled in discouragement if carl finds out he might even come after us right her hand unsteady tash returned the phone to the seat back duncan reynolds doesnt know where i am either for now there are just the two of us youre sure you werent followed to the airport i used a taxi i told the driver to drop me off at united once inside i hurried over to delta what was anyone following me going to do he couldnt just abandon his car in all that traffic at the departure doors his car would be towed away while he was trying to find me in the terminal is everything all right coltrane and tash looked up in surprise at a female flight attendant we just realized we had some business we forgot to take care of before we left coltrane said i guess theres no good time to take a vacation well the movie were showing is a comedy maybe itll help get you in a holiday mood i certainly hope so if they hadnt been so preoccupied the rest of the threeandahalfhour flight would have been a pleasure the service was firstclass especially the mexican lunch of sea bass with tomato sauce olives and sweet and hot peppers the scenery was spectacular glancing out his window coltrane saw the blue of the gulf of california with the rugged coastal cliffs of baja california on the right then baja ended in a series of dramatic rock formations and the pacific ocean was spread out before him breathtaking as the jet continued along its southeast route far down mexicos coast toward acapulco when cortéss soldiers had discovered the area in it was obvious that the deep cshaped bay would make one of the finest harbors in the world an article in deltas seatpocket magazine said for hundreds of years it had been a major trading depot but not until the s had the sleepy village with its pristine beaches and impressive mountainous background become prized as a recreation area rich vacationers from mexico city were soon followed by the powerful and famous from other countries b traven malcolm lowry and sherwood anderson had been there as had tennessee williams whose the night of the iguana was set there but from its zenith in the fifties and sixties acapulcos popularity had declined due to overbuilding and overpopulation only in the late eighties had the authorities made a major effort to refurbish the resort and return it to its former glory to get a good view tash and coltrane had to leave their seats and shift over to the left windows as the pilot announced his descent past the city i wasnt prepared for how big it is coltrane stared in wonder the magazine article mentioned that more than a million people live down there tash said yeah and i bet very few of them can afford to stay in those hotels hundreds of them huge and brilliant in the sun rimmed the semicircular harbor or perched on tropical slopes beyond it coltrane took a mental photograph of the impressionistic display below him the green of myriad palm trees blending with copper cliffs coral roofs golden sand and the azure bay cruise ships waited near the mouth of the harbor while excursion boats streamed toward docks passing speedboats sailboats and yachts but it didnt look like this in coltrane said there wasnt a telephone until two years later land could be bought for three cents an acre only three thousand people lived down there as hard to get to as it was this would have been edens outpost and packards eden espalda del gato was even smaller tash said i wonder how rebecca chance reacted when packard took her there they had only carryon luggage so after obtaining their tourist cards and passing through immigration they were able to leave the chaos of the hangarlike terminal sooner than they expected an airport taxi drove them northward along a coast that had golf courses beaches and luxury hotels one of which resembled an aztec pyramid after twenty minutes the highway climbed to the rim of a hill where the spectacle of acapulcos harbor appeared before them costera miguel alemán a scenic avenue that paralleled the curve of the bay took them past modernlooking highrise buildings to the old part of the city where the architecture was traditionally mexican and where they got out at a small hotel called el geranio blanco the white geranium which the driver recommended when he found out that they didnt have a place to stay he had a relative who worked there he said and although january was one of acapulcos busiest months he was sure that a room could be obtained for a suitable price and a suitable tip coltrane thought after the driver came back from speaking to his relative inside announcing with a smile that everything had been arranged the smile grew broader when coltrane gave him fifty dollars as the taxi pulled away he and tash peered up at the array of white geraniums on each of the hotels wroughtiron balconies lets hope our driver was telling the truth about the relative he had inside coltrane said they looked questioningly at each other and suddenly found the idea that they might have been cheated inexplicably funny as things turned out a room had indeed been obtained for them one so small that the bed practically filled it with only one window on the fifth floor the uppermost in a hotel that didnt have an elevator for a rate that coltrane suspected was equal to that for the most luxurious in the building what do you think should we go somewhere else coltrane asked from what our driver said the towns packed i vote for staying tash said look on the bright side at least weve got a bathroom but we have to crawl over the bed to get to it details details and theres something else we have to do are you still referring to the bed carl nolan i made a mistake tash said coltrane inwardly squirmed how so they sat at a small wooden table at an outdoor café in old acapulcos busy plaza both had margaritas neither had touched them the first thing you have to understand tash said is the past few weeks since my trouble started carl and i have been together a lot coltrane felt a sinking sensation nothing happened tash said look i feel terrible asking you about this your life is your own this wouldnt be any of my business if he hadnt threatened me no tash said id make it your business even if he hadnt threatened you if were going to have a future together you have every right to know about my past the plaza was shaded by palm trees children played on a bandstand a moorishlooking church with yellow spires and an onionshaped blue top dominated the far end coltrane registered none of this is that what you want a future with me tash smiled warmly i feel more comfortable with you than with any man ive ever met as if ive known you a long time but of course i havent so i get to have all the fun of finding out about you emotion made it impossible for coltrane to speak carl and i spent time together tash said so did lyle and i walt and i the others theyre my bodyguards after all one or another is usually with me in cars at the house we share meals we talk coltrane waited uneasily when the package with the bulls heart was delivered to my house there was so much blood it freaked me out a lab crew came and took it then carl showed up to see if there was anything he could do walt and lyle were already there but they couldnt stay they had a breakin to investigate but carl told them not to worry that hed hang around for a while so they left coltrane leaned forward i was so upset that i started sobbing tash said i reached out and held him i cant tell you how tired i was of feeling frightened when he started kissing me i didnt resist it was human contact it was but then his kisses became more forceful and he was touching me and stop you dont need to put yourself through this coltrane said no if carl ever tells you i led him on i want to make sure you understand everything i want to explain this now so i dont ever have to do it again on the other side of the crowded plaza a mariachi band started playing coltrane didnt hear it i pushed carl away tash said i told him that he had the wrong idea that sex wasnt what i wanted that all i needed was a little comfort i told him my life was out of control as it was without complicating things he said hed fallen in love with me he wanted to know what was wrong with him that i didnt want him and i told him that under the present circumstances i couldnt think about wanting anybody fidgeting tash glanced toward the harbor where excursion yachts and fishing boats were docking but the faraway look in her eyes made clear that what she was seeing had happened weeks earlier the truth is i knew i could never have a relationship with him but this is what went through my mind im not proud of it even so here it is i was thinking that some nut was out there probably planning to kill me and i needed all the help i could get so i wasnt firm in rejecting him when carl asked maybe not now but what about later after we find this creep and you dont have to worry anymore i didnt have the courage to be honest instead of telling him no what i said was that i couldnt think about anything like that while i was jumping at shadows now i realize that the false hope he took from that conversation is all hes been thinking about when you showed up at my house on new years day i could see his resentment when i asked you to stay and talk about the estate id inherited i could feel his jealousy so he decided to pay me a visit at the beverly center and make sure i understood that i wasnt welcome that he had dibs on you coltrane said im afraid thats how he sees it that he has dibs on me coltranes cheek muscles hardened well when we get back to la after we arrange for duncan reynolds to be arrested ill make sure carl gets his mind straight no let the police handle it i dont want you to get hurt this time he wouldnt be catching me by surprise please tash said it was my mistake theres been enough trouble lets not start more coltrane couldnt resist her plaintive tone all right he worked to calm himself ill let the police handle it thank you when he touched her hand he was pleased that this time there wasnt any static electricity the main thing is its almost over almost over tash sounded wistful something worth drinking to they picked up their margaritas clicking glasses in fact if we hadnt decided to fly down here it would be over coltrane said do you want to go home tomorrow settle everything and come back for a real vacation a day longer isnt going to make a difference i need to know why randolph packard put me in his will if we can find the estate i inherited it might give me some answers yes from the moment i found packards photographs of rebecca chance ive had the sense that the past and the present are connected coltrane set down his glass and picked up his camera hold that pose now that he was paying attention to the plaza he realized that this wasnt the first time he had seen the moorishlooking church behind tash its onionshaped top had been in one of the photographs in the vault rebecca chance had been in this plaza so had randolph packard coltrane pressed the shutter button where its just the two of us where we can talk and swim and lie on the beach tash had said describing some of the reasons she wanted to go to acapulco it was too late for the swim but just the right time to take a stroll hand in hand up a shoplined hill to the cliff above the harbor and watch the crimson of the sunset tint the blue of the ocean as tash leaned her head against his shoulder coltrane put his arm around her they peered out toward the sun sinking below the horizon only a faint orange sliver visible watch for a green flash she turned to him puzzled no dont look at me coltrane said keep your eyes on the horizon in a second theres going to be a green flash what are you talking about packard wrote a book about photography he called it sightings and in it he claimed that during the instant the sun vanishes below the horizon theres a green flash he claimed to have seen it many times something to do with a change in the spectrum of light and he said it had been one of his careerlong goals to capture a photograph of that flash although he was never able to because by the time he saw it and pressed the shutter button the flash was over he tried to anticipate it and press the shutter button just before he thought the flash was going to happen but he never managed that either ive spent many evenings staring at sunsets trying to see that flash but ive never been able to was packard telling the truth do you think the flash really happens other photographers claim to have seen it ansel adams used to take guests onto his porch and try to show it to them but its always eluded you yep then what makes you expect youll see it tonight because youre with me tash didnt say anything for a moment thats the tenderest thing anybody ever told me will you please stop looking in my direction tash giggled keep your eyes on the horizon yes sir tash giggled again she peered away from him watching the last speck of the suns faint orange vanish below the horizon and inhaled sharply for as black invaded the sky a green flash shot amazingly up like a monocolored single beam from the aurora borealis with equal abruptness it vanished im almost afraid to ask i saw it too coltrane felt pounding behind his ears holy god yes i feel as if were the only people in the world who saw it tash said yes our own private show coltrane turned her toward him and brought his mouth to hers as the cliff seemed to waver he had a fleeting sense that it wasnt their bodies but their souls that were trying to merge maybe thats why this is called a soul kiss he thought then he was incapable of thought as they held each other tighter kissing deeper their hotel was only a tenminute stroll away but coltrane had no recollection of the restaurants and shops they passed hurrying back seeming to get there instantaneously and yet he couldnt recall an occasion when a comparable amount of time had seemed to take so long they barely managed to lock the door to their room before they were all over each other unable to get enough of each other their hands slid urgently under each others clothes their need so great that taking the time to undress would have been an unbearable postponement then it wasnt necessary to take the time to undress for they were suddenly naked their clothes scattered everywhere as they pressed against each other chesttochest stomachtostomach grointogroin their skin itself a powerful sexual organ that drove them to even greater urgency his back pressed against the switch on the wall activating the overhead light they didnt care the light didnt matter they were too absorbed by each other to turn it off when they sank to the bed coltrane felt he was falling never to stop he rolled and twisted sliding sweatslicked over her into her moaning seeming to soar above himself as he thrust to plunge into himself as he withdrew his brain pattern flashed white black white black then there was only white and he lay disoriented beside her gradually his heart pumped slower no longer threatening to burst when he finally mustered strength he glanced toward tash whose eyes were closed contentedly her body glistening with sweat dont move i wasnt planning to she murmured i want to take your photograph she didnt answer for what seemed a long while yes when he stood and peered down trying to decide what angle to use he was so enthralled by the casual perfection of her unselfconscious nakedness that he almost forgot to reach for his camera she was on her back her arms spread with sensual exhaustion her breasts at ease gravity tucking her stomach in her pubic hair a perfect triangle her right leg straight the left bent lazily he had never been with a woman who had so entranced him by the sheer fact of her being a woman it was as if he felt attracted to her because of a subtle chemical signal that he was biologically programmed to find irresistible but that didnt explain it even though the aftersex musk smell from her it filled the room made him feel intoxicated his attraction was more than that he had fallen in love with her long before he had met her he had known her before and had been searching for her ever since he raised the camera adjusted it then lovingly sighted through the viewfinder which heightened the impression she created her small distant yet close image became intensified idealized when he pressed the shutter button he knew that this would be one of the finest photographs he had ever made he took a dozen images from various angles some of which were full shots others half shots a few of which showed only tashs breasts one of which showed only her perfect dark triangle he knelt easing his right hand onto her mound luxuriating in its softness tash placed her left hand over his that feels nice coltrane heard the forceful pounding of his heart do you think the photographs will be good tash asked yes coltrane managed to say im surprised that i let you take them thank you for letting me i trust you i know you wouldnt do anything with those photographs that would cheapen me never he said gently in eyesquinting sunlight the soldier one of three at a roadblock between two jeeps held up his hand for coltrane to stop coltrane was driving a fiveyearold blue ford station wagon with a crumpled fender and eighty thousand miles on it the only vehicle that he had been able to find for rent the carrental agency had told him that the next day something better would be available but coltrane hadnt wanted to wait so after making sure to get a good map and buy plenty of mexican car insurance they had headed south from acapulco forty minutes beyond the airport the rain forestlined road had long since become two lanes and the soldiers blocked their way coltrane nodded in what he hoped looked like respect asking in spanish if anything was wrong instead of responding the soldier scowled into the station wagons backseat and rear compartment both of which were empty except for an ice cooler on the back floor the soldier lifted his right hand from his automatic weapon and motioned that he wanted the cooler opened tash bent over the backseat and complied the two soldiers on her side of the car concentrating on her hips as she showed them that the cooler contained only soft drinks with a dismissive gesture the first soldier indicated that coltrane could proceed what was that about tash asked the man at the carrental agency said the armys been checking vehicles for guns and drugs they looked so sullen god help anyone they decide to arrest this heat cant have improved their humor the temperature was almost ninety the cars air conditioning wasnt working forcing them to drive with the windows open away from the ocean breeze the humidity seemed to have increased but at least the air wasnt hazed with automobile exhaust if this map is accurate tash said espalda del gato is the third village ahead of us another thirty miles and if this road gets any worse coltrane said as the station wagon jounced over a series of deep potholes itll take us all morning to get there tash handed him an icebeaded can of coke they got there in an hour the first two villages were dilapidated causing coltrane and tash to assume the worst when they rounded a foliagerimmed curve and stopped to peer down at their destination surprised they saw neatlooking thatchroofed houses and shops in a small cove that had cliffs on the north and south and an inviting beach in the middle its sort of a miniature acapulco tash said the way i suppose acapulco once was a few small boats were pulled up onto the beach other boats bobbed on waves beyond the coves entrance looks like a fishing village but not for long coltrane pointed toward a yacht in the harbor its been discovered when coltrane got out to take photographs something on the cliff opposite him made him focus his zoom lens in that direction check this he handed the camera to tash who peered through it toward a cluster of white structures on the cliff beyond the village seems to be an estate aim the camera farther to the right coltrane said she did then suddenly lowered it turning toward him that rock formation up there a cat arching its back the same as in packards photograph we found it excited they got back in the car but despite their eagerness to hurry into town they were forced to drive slowly down a narrow switchback road on the left scarlet pink and white flowers thrived beneath a canopy of trees on the right a cliff dropped into the ocean at last the road leveled off winding through rain forest they passed a villager leading a burro laden with firewood several women carried baskets filled with bananas the roadside activity increased rounding a bend they came into the village its picturesque buildings made of upright poles woven together the palmleaved roofs tied neatly layered thickly locals glanced with curiosity toward the unfamiliar car and the two strangers inside it the plaza appeared stalls set up for market day villagers shopping children scampering a centuriesold church stood at one end a stone well and a trough for watering animals occupied the middle coltrane parked outside a tavern called la primorosa the beautiful woman and surveyed the activity this far south much of the population was indian their coppercolored narrow faces sloped foreheads and pointed chins looking especially strong in profile reminding coltrane of the sharp details on newly minted pennies the men wore white cotton trousers and shirts their large sombreros woven from what might have been strands of dried palmtree leaves the women wore anklelength skirts and colorfully embroidered blouses all were either barefoot or in sandals hoping that his camera wouldnt offend them trying to conceal it he took several photographs through his open window the possibilities exciting him if he could capture the textures before him assuming that is your estate up there he said you live in a pretty good neighborhood a teenage girl went by selling yellow gardenias nestled in a banana frond he called her over bought one of the flowers and gave it to tash a homecoming present a little premature but a lovely thought tash smelled the flower enjoying its fragrance puzzled coltrane noticed that the girl hadnt moved whats the matter he wondered does she want me to buy more didnt i pay enough but the girl wasnt gazing at him only at tash youve got a fan tash smiled at the girl who looked startled by the attention stepped back and hurried into the crowd youre going to have to tone down your smile coltrane said probably not used to outsiders they got out of the station wagon coltrane assessed the cocacola sign on the exterior of the tavern he had parked next to i suppose this is as good a place as any to ask if anybody knows about the estate up there but before he could enter he paused for an elderly woman with waistlong braided hair who frowned as she approached them passing she frowned back harder but not at coltrane first the flower seller now that woman whats going on tash said a bandylegged grayhaired man carrying a chicken by its feet looked astonished when he noticed tash what on earth tash asked i dont get it either coltrane said im the one who looks foreign if you were wearing a long native skirt and your hair was braided youd fit right in they should be staring at me another woman stared come on lets get off the street tash said they crossed hardpacked earth stepped under a canopy of palm leaves and entered the tavern coltranes eyes took a moment to adjust to the softer light the place was clean it had a plank floor simple chairs and trestlestyle tables a child petted a dog in a corner americans presumably from the yacht looked up with mild curiosity nodding before redirecting their attention to bottles of corona beer locals however set down their drinks and looked startled so it isnt just that were outsiders coltrane thought trying to seem oblivious he escorted tash to the worn mahogany counter but as he started to ask the bartender what he knew about the buildings on top of the cliff a row of photographs on a warped shelf behind the bartender caught his attention simultaneously the gangly bartender glanced up from washing cups got a look at tash and couldnt stop his mouth from hanging open my god coltrane said he pointed toward the photographs they were old and yellowed a dozen eightbytens they all depicted a beautiful woman hence the name of the tavern la primorosa the face of the woman was the same in each photograph in unconscious imitation of what the flowerselling teenager had done when tash smiled at her coltrane gaped rebecca chance they think its me tash murmured un fantasma the bartender managed to say no coltrane said hurriedly in spanish not a ghost my friend is the granddaughter of the woman in the photographs la nieta sí coltrane said de rebecca chance señorita a frail voice asked they looked toward a stoopshouldered whitehaired whitebearded man in the doorway unlike the indians in the village he had a broader facial structure of spanish descent quién es usted who are you the old man seemed afraid to ask mi nombre es natasha adler la nieta the bartender said the granddaughter the old man stepped uneasily closer behind him a crowd had gathered beneath the portal es verdad the old man paused before tash studying her is it true sí después de tanto tiempo after so much time the old man continued in spanish you must speak with esmeralda the name jolted into coltranes memory esmeralda had been the first name of the woman whom tashs mother had said was tashs grandmother but she couldnt be rebecca chance was tashs grandmother esmeralda gutiérrez sí mi esposa the old man said my wife a splendid flower garden separated the small cottage from the rain forest sitting in chairs made of woven branches with glazed cups of papaya juice on a table in front of them coltrane and tash peered mystified toward a wizened cinnamonskinned whitehaired woman who kept staring at tash shaking her head and fingering her rosary you look exactly like her the old woman esmeralda said in spanish pointing toward faded photographs of rebecca chance that her husband had brought from the house my mother claimed that you were my grandmother tash replied in spanish no esmeralda said although i did take care of your mother how old must she be coltrane wondered in dismay in her eighties especially afterward afterward after your grandmothers death esmeraldas voice was whispery with age coltrane had to lean forward to hear what she said then why did my mother lie to me why does anyone lie to avoid the truth do you know the truth the old woman nodded i regret so drink esmeraldas husband said this talking will make you thirsty esmeralda dropped her rosary into her lap and used both hands slightly atremble to raise her cup of juice to her wrinkled lips then set it back down why have you come here because of a man named randolph packard the old woman grimaced you know of him too well if he sent you here no he died recently esmeraldas aged eyes narrowed randolph packard is dead a few months ago then the world is a better place but i pity the poor souls in hell i inherited some property from him we think its the estate on top of the cliff to the south of the village burn it what destroy it it can only bring you harm what are you talking about the old woman shook her head in distress tell them the old man said it was so long ago if randolph packard is truly dead you no longer have anything to fear he looked at tash and coltrane for confirmation i saw his ashes sprinkled into the ocean coltrane said her hands more unsteady the elderly woman again raised the earthcolored cup to her lips drinking then slowly setting it down when she was seventeen she said the village was so isolated that acapulco was a threeday trek along a snakeinfested trail through the rain forest outsiders were unheard of then the first stranger she had ever met and the first gringo sailed into the harbor he was amazingly tall his leanness emphasized his height but what i noticed most were his oddly handsome face his shock of black hair and his eyes which never stopped searching randolph packard coltrane said esmeralda nodded he told us that he planned to live near the village that he wanted to be a good neighbor that he had brought us gifts of clothing tools and medicines he would pay us generously to work for him he said so the corruption began each year after the rainy season he returned in the meantime we built his estate up there tended his gardens kept everything clean and in repair flowers in vases fresh linen on the beds ready on a moments notice for when the sails of his sleek boat would reappear approaching the harbor we grew dependent on him if he was late we worried that he might not come at all without the money goods and medicines he brought we knew we would suffer one year packard didnt come alone he brought many other boats and an army of gringos who unloaded electrical generators cameras lights sound equipment sets tents an invasion of movie equipment that the locals knew nothing about and that caused chaos within the village along with the invasion came more money and luxuries than they had ever seen the corruption worsened esmeralda hated all of it with one exception an actress the most beautiful woman she had ever seen to whom she was assigned as a maid esmeraldas wrinkled gaze lingered on the face in the yellowed photographs on the table she redirected it toward tash reverential as if rebecca chance sat before her it soon became clear she said that the reason packard had brought the movie company to the village was to ingratiate himself with rebecca to put her in debt to him for going to such extremes to advance her career at the same time it also became clear that packard had a rival for rebeccas affections the films producer winston case the name brought coltrane and tash to greater attention esmeralda learned about rebeccas situation because the actress who spoke spanish confided in her winston case had produced rebeccas previous three films they had formed a close professional and personal relationship knowing her struggle to rise within the film industry he had even given her a house that he owned in los angeles she was indebted to him but at the same time she was attracted to randolph packard whom she had met one day when she discovered him photographing her house a conversation had led to a dinner then other dinners then weekend outings his flamboyance and wit had been irresistible esmeralda felt helpless watching the two men vie for rebeccas attentions seeing how rebecca was torn between them but esmeralda wasnt the only one who noticed for the film crew and the actors soon realized that their work was secondary to the greater drama developing behind the scenes several times winston case and randolph packard exchanged angry words in front of the company packard wanted to take photographs of her whenever she wasnt working winston case wanted her to spend every evening with him their persistence so wore her down that she finally demanded that they both leave her alone and there the matter remained when the film was finished and the cast and crew returned to los angeles including rebecca who accompanied winston case while packard followed her i never expected to see rebecca again esmeralda said but the boat came back in less than a year rebecca and packard no one else to my delight i was asked to be rebeccas maid again but my delight became worry when rebecca told me that she had not come willingly that packard had invited her onto his boat for a weekend cruise and then had kept sailing refusing to let her off escape through the snakeinfested jungle was out of the question but rebecca vowed to get away and prayed for someone elses boat to enter the harbor meanwhile she pretended to be sympathetic to randolphs attentions to keep him from suspecting her plans she let him photograph her to further confuse him she submitted to the indignity of agreeing to remove her clothes before his camera but after a few weeks in which no opportunity for escape presented itself a new source of tension afflicted her because changes in her body made it obvious that she was pregnant esmeraldas first thought was that randolph had forced himself upon her but rebecca confessed that in a moment of weakness and passion she had given herself to winston case it had been packards suspicion about their intimacy that had driven him to abduct her now the growing evidence of that intimacy made rebecca fearful for the babys safety an apprehension that seemed justified when approaching sails made randolph lock her away the boat that entered the harbor belonged to winston case who had finally suspected where she was but when he hurried up to the estate he found that packard had hired a dozen men from the village to guard the property and keep him from getting inside reduced to staying in the village he gazed up longingly at the estate his only consolation the messages that esmeralda brought whenever rebecca sent her on an errand into the village the rainy season arrived as rebeccas pregnancy reached its term winston waited for rebecca to regain her strength while the baby a daughter became strong enough to travel then with esmeraldas help in relaying messages winston used the cover of an evening storm to sneak past the guards he hid until the storm cleared and the estate was in darkness then used a club to overcome a guard sleeping outside rebeccas room immediately rebecca was at the window she handed the baby to him climbed out and rushed after him through the darkness toward a path that zigzagged down from the cliff to the harbor winston had hidden a lantern behind the rock formation but before he could light it the baby started to cry and packard who had not yet fallen asleep burst from the house shouting for help racing toward the cries from the baby he caught them at the rock formation winston still held the baby but either packard didnt realize it or else he didnt care because he kept shoving at winston causing rebecca to scream in protest she lunged between the two men and reached for the baby but packard kept shoving and the next thing rebeccas scream was one of fright as she plummeted over the edge vanishing into the darkness her scream ending on the surfpounded rocks far below packard couldnt move anguished he gaped downward for the longest time then wailed by the time the guards arrived winston had scrambled down the path with the baby esmeraldas gaze returned from a faraway place she cast another look at the yellowed photographs on the table in the flower garden then shook her head and glanced toward tash i was waiting at the bottom i asked where rebecca was he didnt answer just kept urging me toward the rowboat that would take us out to his sailboat while i held the baby he pulled at the oars with a strength that i never would have dreamed he possessed by the time we reached the sailboat we heard packard and his guards on the beach they jumped into fishing boats to chase us but winston raised his sails and disappeared into the darkness before they came close esmeraldas frail voice dwindled her husband helped her to drink more juice then told coltrane and tash you must leave now so she can rest we understand coltrane said just one question señora if you got ahead of packard you should have been able to escape to los angeles but tashs mother said that you and winston and the child roamed from village to village here in mexico where he earned food by working as a carpenter he was rich why didnt he take advantage of his wealth winston said that if we went to los angeles we would never be safe from so powerful a man as randolph packard our only way to disappear was by doing something that randolph would never have dreamed of by becoming poor only after several years did he think randolphs anger would have cooled enough for him and the child to enter the united states you didnt go with him please esmeraldas husband objected no more questions for now i would have given anything to continue to take care of rebecca chances daughter esmeralda said but winston insisted that i had my own life to lead and he made me go back to the village as soon as he returned home he promised to send payment for my years of service he kept his word one day a messenger arrived with photographs of the child and more money than anyone in the village had ever seen and now esmeraldas husband stood thank you señora tash clasped her hands no i thank you seeing you is like seeing rebecca again a tear rolled down the old womans cheek may we come back after youve rested please coltrane and tash followed the old man into the house at the last moment coltrane looked back seeing the old woman pick up one of the photographs where did you get those señora rebecca gave them to me shes still alive as long as they exist the more people who see them the more she remains alive i have put them throughout the village once a year on the day of her death a mass is said for her the village prays over her photographs esmeralda shook her head dismally but in this climate the images decay and randolph packard he abandoned the village as i always knew he would the road up to the estate was so overgrown that coltrane wasnt sure the rented car would make it to the top leaves blocked his windshield branches scraped the doors as the fords wheels jounced over a fallen tree limb sunlight gleamed butterflies scattered and the estate was spread out ahead what had seemed white from the distance of the village was now revealed as the gray of concrete from which stucco had fallen a few surviving patches indicating that the original color had been coral some buildings had one level others two all had an elegant simplicity that reminded coltrane of pueblo architecture a jumble of fallen poles and decayed thatching visible through an open doorway showed where woven palmleaf roofs supported by timbers peaked as in the village had long ago collapsed imagine how magnificent this place once looked tash said as they stopped outside a low vinecovered wall that enclosed the compound and how everything went wrong as coltrane stepped from the car he admired the gardens that had run wild hibiscus bougainvillea and orchids seemingly everywhere he raised his camera and took a photograph i dont know what i expected to find here tash said the truth is down in the village with esmeralda im not so sure some inconsistencies bother me tash looked puzzled if randolph packard killed rebecca chance why did he keep hunting winston case revenge couldnt have been a factor rebeccas death was packards fault not cases maybe it wasnt winston he was hunting maybe he wanted the child why if the child was winstons as esmeralda claims why would packard have wanted her coltrane asked maybe he wanted to kill the child to get even with winston for what for making rebecca chance pregnant packard had plenty of opportunity to hurt the child when it was born and risk losing any hope of making rebecca love him tash said true coltrane brooded about it but that still doesnt explain why packard was so desperate to get the child after rebecca was killed unless do you suppose he believed he was the father he was trying to get his daughter back tash raised a hand to her throat youre suggesting randolph packard is my grandfather it explains why he put you in his will he spent most of his life trying to find his daughter but she was dead by the time he did and he was near death when he learned about you he couldnt reveal his connection with you without incriminating himself still in love with the woman he had killed all he could do was give you the place where she gave birth to your mother a ruin fitting given all the lives that were ruined in the name of love for a moment coltrane couldnt help thinking of the ruin his own father had caused but not me coltrane thought he dismally surveyed the husks of the buildings well as long as weve come this far he walked along the wall passing a gigantic aloe vera approaching the back of the estate where are you going to see where your grandmother died tall cacti stood like sentinels as coltrane approached the cliff ignoring a lizard that scurried underfoot he concentrated on the catlike rock formation before him definitely the formation in the photographs that packard took of rebecca chance he paused a few careful steps from where the cliff fell away to the sea the pounding of surf against rocks rumbled up making him uneasy the lantern was behind this rock formation tash said the path down the cliff is over here where the coastline curves toward the village forming the bay this is where randolph packard and winston case fought and where packard inadvertently pushed the love of his life over the cliff he spent the rest of his days mourning for having killed the woman he worshiped he couldnt let the world know what had happened so he built a secret monument to her where he achingly studied the photographs he had taken of her although the day was hot tash hugged herself and shivered stay there for a moment just like that coltrane said he stepped back from her moving farther along the ridge putting the cliff on his left and tashs profile ahead of him as a breeze pushed her hair he raised his camera sighting through the viewfinder reality and his memory coincided packard once stood on this very spot taking a photograph of your grandmother on the spot where you are now in that same pose tash shivered again coltrane pressed the shutter release if you were wearing a white shawl the images would be virtually identical this gives me the creeps the height doesnt help much either coltrane said goodbye tash peered down as if addressing the soul of her grandmother i warned you a voice said from behind spinning coltrane just had time to see the blur of a fist before it jolted him off his feet sprawled near the rock formation coltrane struggled numbly to raise his head blood streaming from his mouth he stared up dizzily at the impossible towering presence of carl nolan i gave you a fair chance nolans face was livid twisted with fury i told you nicely the sergeants powerful arms his weight lifters muscles bulging in a shortsleeved flowerpatterned shirt dragged coltrane to his feet and shook him so hard that coltranes teeth snapped together but a smart guy like you just cant listen can you you always know better well maybe youll listen to this the second blow struck coltrane harder ears ringing his vision blurring he landed hard but his head seemed to be falling farther and at once his consciousness cleared enough for him to realize that his head had indeed fallen farther half of him was hanging over the cliff or to this nolan kicked him another few inches over the cliff i told you not to touch her again but you went ahead and did it anyhow you never take advice this time when nolan kicked him the force was so great that it shocked coltrane over the edge a groan escaping him stomach rising he clawed at the rock wall scrabbling to find an outcrop with a strain that threatened to dislocate his arms he jerked to a halt his body dangling his fingers clinging to a twoinch ledge ten feet below the top a hundred feet farther down the hungry pounding surf waited for him still hanging around nolan frowned over the edge what do i have to do drop a rock on your head staring up helplessly his ribs aching from where hed been kicked coltrane opened his mouth to say he didnt know what whatever it was came out as a hoarse inhuman croak above him nolan looked around presumably for the rock he meant to drop then scowled at something behind him hey where the hell do you think youre going he charged away from the cliff tash coltrane thought she must be running for help hes trying to stop her despite the agony that racked his body coltrane scraped his shoes against the cliff unnerved by the thunder of the surf below him he trembled feeling a surge of hope when his right shoe found support in a crevice do it he mentally shouted he lifted his left foot taking three tries before he pressed his shoe onto a rock spur his mind became gray no clinging more fiercely he inhaled deeply his heart pounded faster his consciousness focused the gray dispersing move but his body didnt want to obey then his reflexes took control when he heard tash shouting he reached up his right hand wedged his fingers into a crack in the stone lifted his right foot scraped it against the cliff planted it on an outcrop and pulled himself higher the camera around his neck snagged on something he squirmed fearful that his movements would dislodge him imagining his plunge to the rocks again tash shouted he freed the camera and stretched higher lifting pawing groping then he couldnt find another handhold his strength dwindling he clawed at air heard tash shout a third time and realized that the reason he couldnt find another handhold was that there werent any to be found his fingers were at the top all he had to do was grip the edge push himself up and the rock formation came into view squirming over the rim he rolled onto his back but he couldnt allow himself to rest and he rolled again onto his hands and knees the next shout from tash made him waver to his feet and charge in her direction her cry came from somewhere among the ruins adrenaline giving him strength he didnt waste time looking for a gate through the waisthigh wall he raced straight ahead sending more lizards scurrying as he scrambled over the wall landing among a tangle of ferns and flowers he heard tash yell within the maze of buildings his camera thumping against his chest he charged past the shells of what might once have been guest houses and servants quarters vines tugged at his ankles threatening to topple him as he veered around a corner and saw nolan push tash against a wall trying to kiss her this time it was nolan who was caught by surprise before he could register the noise behind him coltrane slammed against his back driving him hard past tash ramming him against the wall with a groan nolan sagged then spun only to double over from coltranes fist in his stomach but before coltrane could strike again nolan rammed his head forward colliding with coltranes chest he propelled both of them across a flowerchoked courtyard walloping coltrane against the opposite wall coltrane wheezed his breath knocked out of him he did his best to punch nolan but his arms were weak from struggling up the cliff and he had no effect on nolans solid body nolans hands found his throat gripped the camera strap around it and twisted wheezing again coltrane fought to breathe his face swelling as nolan tightened the camera strap cutting into coltranes neck coltranes strength failed his vision dimming he fumbled to try to peel nolans hands away he brushed against the shutter button on the camera unintentionally tripping it the cameras whir barely audible the last sound he might ever hear no conscious of tashs frightened presence he told himself he had to save her he rammed his knee into nolans groin again again nolan lurched back in pain it was the sweetest breath coltrane had ever known as he filled his lungs nolan kept stumbling away needing to gain as much time as he could to recover from his pain then nolan took one step back too far tripped over vines and toppled backward into the wreckage of a ruined building coltrane gaped his eyes had to be playing tricks on him he thought for the decayed thatch of the collapsed roof suddenly came to life when nolan landed poles and twigs and strands of fiber thrashing into motion snapping at nolan twisting rippling over him and oh my god coltrane thought those arent poles and twigs and strands of fibers those are snakes nolan barely got a shriek out before his body tensed and trembled dying snakes that had made their home in the ruin slithered out of the doorway tash momentarily paralyzed she snapped into motion and rushed toward coltrane as the snakes hissed and coiled tash and coltrane raced from the chaos of the ruins staring frantically around to make sure they werent running into others every bush seemed a danger every cluster of flowers a trap they squirmed onto the wall hesitating afraid of what might be hiding beneath the shrubbery below them the quicklegged scamper of a lizard made tash cry out and jump down past ferns racing toward the car coltrane was only a few hurried strides behind they scrambled into the car and yanked the door shut breathing in a frenzy dear god he managed to say his chest wouldnt stop heaving sweat mixing with the blood from his swollen lips he turned toward tash whose head was pressed exhaustedly against the back of the seat her eyes wide with panic she stared at the ceiling are you coltrane filled his oxygenstarved lungs i think im her chest rose and fell in alarming turmoil i think im all right he had me trapped if you hadnt climbed to the top how the hell did he know where wed be he shouldnt have we were careful i dont understand what did we do wrong somehow he followed us i cant believe im still alive trembling tash held him i was sure i was going to fall coltrane said alive tash held him tighter my god i was so scared i am scared her mouth was suddenly on his and the pain of the pressure against his mangled lips was nothing compared to the lifeaffirming force of their embrace alive coltrane thought but he couldnt stop feeling numb and hollow talk to me tash said he kept shaking his head staring out the window what are you thinking the car seemed filled with the smell of fear and death get it out of you tash said we cant leave him like this we cant take him with us coltrane frowned toward the ruins all those snakes youre not suggesting we go back there and get his body of course not coltrane said but we cant just drive away somebody has to be told the police no way we dont have a choice you bet we do tash said we can get back to the states as fast as we can the mexican police scare me to death they have a different kind of law down here its based on the napoleonic code youre not innocent until proven guilty the way were used to the reverse youre guilty until you prove youre innocent and this might not look like selfdefense to them they might decide its manslaughter what if someone thinks you pushed him onto those snakes down here they dont believe in the right to a speedy trial but the village knows we went up here coltrane said its a safe bet theyre also aware of another stranger in the area that nolan went up here so what are they going to think when you and i come down but nolan doesnt some of them are going to get curious enough to hike up and look around as soon as they find nolans body the police will be looking for two outsiders in a car that fits this ones description theyll be waiting for us at the airport because we tried to run we really will look guilty dont you see that we have to go to the police before the police come to us a red pontiac with a rentalcar sticker on it was parked among ferns at the bottom of the overgrown lane nolan must have left it there and hiked up coltrane thought thats why we didnt hear him the rumble of the surf muffled his footsteps as he walked up behind me about to turn left onto the junglelined road that led into the village he had to wait for an exhaustspewing yellow bus to rattle past out of the corner of his eye he saw tash fidgeting sweat stuck his back to the seat pull ahead of that bus and make it stop tash said what for if the driver says its going farther north to acapulco im getting on it getting on it coltrane looked at her in astonishment a woman with my features isnt going to have a pleasant time in a mexican jail theres no guarantee youll spend any time in a mexican jail im not going to take the chance tash kept hugging herself i saw the way those soldiers looked at me when they were checking for drugs and guns tash nothings going to happen you bet it isnt because the mexican and us police are going to sort this out after i get home but the local police will find out we were together not if you tell them you went up there alone that i wasnt feeling well and took the bus back to acapulco tash please im asking you pull ahead of that bus and make it stop that vine is where he tripped coltrane said his mouth throbbed where he had been punched be careful there were snakes inside that building the last time i was here yes i see one in the corner what an especially nasty type coltranes skin turned cold he had needed all of his willpower to guide the policeman through ferns and flowers toward this spot now he needed even stronger willpower not to bolt back to the car a team of medical experts will have to drive here from acapulco to examine the body before they move it the policeman the only one in the village was middleaged and heavy with a thick dark mustache and solemn eyes you say you had a fight yes coltrane had considered inventing a story in which he had happened to find nolan already dead but he couldnt think of a way to explain his mangled lips not to mention the bruises that the medical examiner would find on nolans groin over a woman the policeman said yes and this woman isnt here as i explained she wasnt feeling well she took a bus back to acapulco while i came up here but meanwhile this man came up here also he followed you from los angeles yes he was very angry about the woman he and i had a similar argument about her back in los angeles but this time while you tried to defend yourself he stumbled back and the policeman gestured toward motion inside the building i never meant for that to happen of course theres something else i have to tell you yes the dead man is a us police officer it took a week to straighten things out coltrane endured most of that time in a crowded noxioussmelling cell not in the village which was too small to have a jail but in acapulco where his belongings were brought from the hotel and where he learned that tash had flown to the united states the day nolan died in los angeles she had hired an attorney to fly to acapulco and consult with a mexican attorney about gaining coltranes freedom the los angeles police department was disturbed that another of its officers had died and equally disturbed about nolans behavior for the sake of public relations and morale it was decided to say only that nolan had been on vacation and had died by misadventure snakebite privately the policeman whom coltrane had first spoken to expressed severe reservations about tashs sudden departure from mexico the day of the death she was extremely ill coltrane emphasized but the mexican attorney earned his substantial fee and coltrane was eventually on a plane to los angeles he had suffered doubts about how soon he would be released he had definitely suffered from the privations of a mexican jail but throughout he had kept his emotional strength because tash had not gone to jail twelve the number you have called is no longer in service a computerized voice said in his kitchen coltrane set down the phone and frowned his travel bag was at his feet i must have rushed and pressed the wrong numbers he thought he picked up the phone and tried again the number you have called is no longer in service this time he knew that he hadnt made a mistake what the as soon as he had been released from jail in acapulco he had called tashs cellular phone but had failed to get an answer at lax he had phoned her again and had still not gotten an answer now in the forty minutes it had taken a taxi to drive him home in the congestion of evening traffic her phone had been disconnected what on earth was going on at once he realized that he had another way to try to contact tash walt the number you have called is no longer in service this is crazy he thought he tried the malibu sheriffs station i need to get in touch with walt halliday is he on duty tonight no sir and he wont be on duty tomorrow either he isnt with us anymore isnt with he resigned a couple of days ago speechless coltrane set down the phone except for a light over the front door and the garage tashs house was in darkness its modernistic assemblage of cubes silhouetted against the moonlit sky no lamp was on in any of the windows that wouldnt have been unusual in the middle of the night but the time was only ten after nine and even if tash had gone out coltrane would have expected her to do what most people did leave a few lights on there was absolutely no sign that anyone was at home but there was a sign of a different sort leaving his headlights on coltrane got out of his car to study it for sale ocean realty this cant be happening he thought he walked quickly to the front door rang its doorbell listened to the hollow echo from inside and pounded on the door tash he yelled the front of the house was scorched from the fire that had been set on new years day peering through the metal fence that enclosed the incinerated flower garden he strained to get a view through a window as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he saw that the room was totally empty its furniture removed tash dismayed he ran to the end of the street and along the fence to the water hurrying toward her house from the back the deck light wasnt on the only illumination was from the stars and moon he tripped on the deck stairs but ignored the pain and scrambled the rest of the way up his urgent footsteps reverberating as he ran to a window the metal shutters had not been lowered staring in straining to decipher the blackness he realized that there wasnt any furniture in this room either tash despite the chill of the ocean breeze sweat poured off him soaking his clothes im not comfortable giving out that information the severefaced woman said she was in her forties had frosted hair and long red fingernails and wore a black designer pantsuit with a blue silk scarf but im a friend of hers i didnt know shed moved im trying to get in touch with her it was nine in the morning coltrane stood in one of the cubicles in the ocean realty office outside trucks rumbled by on the pacific coast highway surely she gave you the phone number and the address where she moved she also gave me strict instructions not to let anyone else know it behind her desk the woman pressed her back rigidly against her chair as if wanting to keep as much distance as possible between coltrane and her she told me one of the reasons she was moving was that shed been threatened by a stalker i know i helped identify the man who was doing it then im sure you can appreciate my dilemma i dont understand for all i know youre the man who was stalking her she instructed me not to give out her new phone number and address for christ sake the woman flinched okay coltrane said i understand your obligation to your client but would it be violating any confidence if you phoned tash gave her my name and told her i wanted to speak to her i really am a close friend of hers i happen to know she wont be in today ill phone her tomorrow and tell her you want her to get in touch with you tomorrow coltrane mentally groaned just in time coltrane steered from the pch as lyle came out of the coffee shop and approached his cruiser after skidding to a stop the squeal of his tires attracting lyles attention coltrane hurried from his car and reached the heavyset officer whom he had never seen in uniform before and who seemed even more heavyset with all the equipment on his gun belt lyles hair was cut short militarystyle he looked as wary as the woman in the real estate office the dispatcher at the station told me you usually have coffee here about this time coltrane said im glad i caught up to you for his part lyle didnt look glad at all he just nodded and waited listen im confused about a couple of things coltrane said im hoping you can help me lyle shrugged nothing relaxed about the gesture coltrane had to raise his voice to be heard above the passing traffic ive been trying to find tash adler she moved i know that do you have any idea where no why did walt halliday resign from the sheriffs department he didnt tell me we werent really that close i just assumed it was on account of the stress of the job well maybe he knows where tash moved i tried phoning but his numbers out of service do you have any idea where he lives so i can talk to him lived excuse me the same day walt resigned he left town what he said he needed a change of scene the asphalt of the parking lot seemed to ripple threatening to swallow coltrane i dont get it what the hell is happening seems obvious to me lyle said how its too big a coincidence both of them making a sudden decision to move at the same time i had a suspicion there was something between them what even if there wasnt it isnt any mystery why she would have moved the stress of being stalked but thats over now that you know duncan reynolds was doing it excuse me duncan reynolds didnt tash explain to you who the hell is duncan reynolds she didnt show you the photographs what photographs perplexed coltrane did his best to organize his thoughts explaining and you found something in these photographs lyle asked a man taking pictures of her duncan reynolds i know him tash met him once but he used a different name so where are these pictures tash has them the briefcase containing them had not been with coltranes travel bag when the acapulco police had brought his belongings from the hotel he had assumed that tash had gone to the hotel to get her things before she went to the airport that she had taken the briefcase back to los angeles with her to show the police and make sure duncan reynolds didnt threaten her anymore or maybe what maybe she doesnt have them maybe they were lost when the mexican police brought my stuff from the hotel that would explain why she didnt tell you she forgot to bring them with her so she decided to wait until i came back with the proof in the meantime duncan reynolds kept harassing her and she moved without even a hint to us that she knew who was after her does that make sense no not when you put it that way and you dont have the photographs either the asphalt beneath him seemed more unsteady instantly he felt on solid footing i have the negatives at home i can make others then make them and bring them to me but i have to tell you i think this is bullshit coltrane blinked as if hed been slapped i heard about what you claim happened with carl nolan in mexico he was a damned fine police officer if you expect me to believe he was jealous of you and flew down to mexico to get even with you but thats the truth sure except tash told me a different version she said carl went down to rescue her from you coltranes mind reeled she said she was moving because you were smothering her so much that she had to get away from you thats impossible are you calling me a liar the parking lot seemed to spin jesus christ am i losing my mind coltrane almost didnt close his front door so great was his need to rush down to the vault grab the negatives he had stored there and hurry into the darkroom to make new prints of duncan reynolds spying on tash but after unlocking and opening the vault coltrane stood frozen in place his mouth agape the envelope of negatives that should have been on the nearest shelf wasnt there telling himself that he must have forgotten which shelf he had put the negatives on he charged into the vault and examined every shelf but he still didnt find them the darkroom he thought i must have left them in he rushed to search it but they were gone im sorry to bother you hoping that his eyes didnt look as wild as he felt coltrane pointed toward tashs house next door your neighbor moved recently the spectacled grayhaired woman held an artists brush wore a painters smock and looked annoyed that coltrane had rung her doorbell the day before yesterday i saw the van did she happen to give you her new address im supposed to deliver some legal documents to her and she lived next to me for six months and never said a word to me i cant imagine why shed bother to give me her address you saw a van i dont suppose you happened to notice the name on yeah i remember you the overweight man in the pacific movers work shirt said we delivered that load of unusual furniture to you tubular stuff metal thats right just a minute the foreman turned to his two young helpers as they came out of an apartment building in santa monica make sure you put all those pads back in the truck he looked back at coltrane you say youve been looking for me your dispatcher told me where youd be ive got five hundred dollars for you if youll do me a favor it must be a hell of a favor not really all you have to do is go back to headquarters and look up the computer file on a customer named natasha adler and shes an old girlfriend of mine so i need to know her new address the man nodded conspiratorially as the road twisted higher into the san bernardino mountains the slopes became more rugged pine trees fought for space among granite outcrops the temperature dropped making coltrane turn up the cars heater and be grateful that hed thought to bring a ski jacket along with a hat scarf and gloves although dawn had been a half hour earlier dense gray clouds cast everything in twilight sporadic snow flecked his windshield and added to the roadside accumulation steering with one hand he drank hot black coffee from a thermos and peered toward his rearview mirror for a while after he had turned off the interstate to follow this secondary road into the mountains he had been able to see the glow of san bernardino behind him but now all he saw were snowcovered boulders and fir trees not even the headlights of a pickup truck that had followed him for about fifteen minutes and then veered off it wont be long now he promised himself what he had been given wasnt really an address just a post office box tash had evidently supplied directions to the vans driver but not his dispatcher there wasnt even a telephone number but a po box will do just fine coltrane thought bitterly big bear lake a road marker indicated miles soon he vowed soon meanwhile he had plenty to think about nagging questions that wouldnt stop threatening to tear his mind apart tash the cold air pinched his nostrils and caused his breath to come out as vapor after parking his car on a side street where it couldnt be seen from the main road coltrane walked past rusticlooking shops ignoring their alpine exteriors christmas decorations still hung in some windows but he ignored those also his wafflesoled hiking boots squeaking on newfallen snow as he strode around a corner and saw big bears post office across the street in contrast with the mountainresort appearance of many buildings in town this was the usual antiseptic institutionalstyle building with a fake redwood and stone exterior a lowpitched roof drop boxes for mail and an unobscured parking lot in front he checked his watch although the post office staff wouldnt be on duty until nine a few people going in and out the front door made clear that the building had been opened earlier so that customers with po boxes wouldnt have to wait to pick up their mail that meant there was a slight chance tash had already been here to check if she had any but i doubt it coltrane thought shell be tired after shipping her furniture two days ago and then trying to sort through the chaos of boxes yesterday shell give herself a break this morning she wont be up to speed for a while yet he entered a chaletstyle house of pancakes and asked the waitress for a table at the window coffee she asked yes but im not sure what i want to eat i might take a while to order take all the time you need believe me i intend to coltrane thought pretending to study the menu he kept his attention on the post office across the street two hours later after the slowesteaten pancakes eggs and sausages of his life after pretending to read a newspaper over yet another cup of coffee he decided that he couldnt hang around any longer without attracting attention outside the air remained gray and cold he pretended to study merchandise in shop windows within view of the post office he feigned taking photographs of the area training his zoom lens on the post office by the parking lot at the house of pancakes was almost full one more vehicle wouldnt be noticed he moved his car from the side street found an inconspicuous spot that gave him a good view of the post office and settled in to wait periodically he turned on the engine to get warm a little after two he went in for lunch snow started falling again while he stalled over a hamburger fries and coleslaw he prayed the weather wouldnt become so bad that he couldnt see the parking lot unable to put off going to the rest room he did so as quickly as possible afraid that tash would pick up her mail while he was away returning to his table he was tortured by the misgiving that he had failed to see her at ten after four standing to pay his bill he needed all his selfcontrol not to reveal his excitement when he saw walt getting out of his mountaineer over there this ought to cover it he told his waitress keep the change thats very generous i guess im still in the christmas spirit outside seeing walt go into the post office coltrane raced through flurries to get to his car before walt came out and drove away he slipped on a patch of ice struggled to keep his balance and barely avoided a pickup truck that drove from the restaurant breathing rapidly the cold air burning his throat he unlocked his car hurried in and started it he was troubled by how much his hands were shaking then he concentrated on walt coming out of the post office his mustached square face sullen his gloved hands empty his trip apparently fruitless but not mine coltrane thought he let walt get a halfblock lead three vehicles between them before he pulled out to follow does walt know my car he saw it the night i first met tash but in the dark he didnt get a good look at it and anyway its different now its covered with snow two of the cars took side streets then big bears outskirts merged into postcard scenery walts car the car in the middle and coltranes car proceeding along a partially cleared road that paralleled on the left the icerimmed pine treebordered lake making coltrane nervous the flurries thickened dark clouds hung lower obscuring the peaks ahead walt switched on his lights so did the driver in the middle wanting to be invisible coltrane resisted then slowing its signal light flashing the middle car turned to the right onto a plowed driveway that led to a cabin and coltrane found himself fifty yards behind walts mountaineer he dropped back farther hoping that the increasingly difficult driving conditions would make his sluggish pace seem appropriate but walt slowed also dont tell me he figured out whos behind him coltrane thought in alarm walt slowed more jesus then walts right signal light flashed and the mountaineer headed up a road at first there were cottages then only snowladen pine trees after a quarter mile walt steered to the left up a lane by the time coltrane reached the turnoff the mountaineer had disappeared he eased to a stop and stared out his drivers window toward the tracks leading up the lane toward the curtain of snowflakes that prevented him from seeing past the trees is this where walt was headed or did he notice me and hes trying to lead me where therell be only the two of us the falling snow made a hissing sound beginning to fill the tracks so whats it going to be coltrane brooded if i wait too long there wont be any tracks to follow he shut off the car put on his hat gloves and scarf adjusted the neck strap on his camera so that the camera was under his ski jacket then zipped up the jacket and got out of the car the cold had deepened it didnt matter finding tash mattered getting answers mattered he followed the tracks along the treeflanked road the snow came up to his ankles an inch away from the top of his thick leather hiking boots the increasingly heavy flakes brushed against his eyelids making him blink repeatedly wary he studied the driftcovered undergrowth on each side in case walt might be hiding there then the road reached a y the tracks headed to the right and coltrane followed them nervously except for the hiss of the snow and the muffled tread of his footsteps the late afternoon was totally silent dusk thickened he went another fifty paces before he lurched to a stop a huge shadow towering over him lights punctuating it this isnt a road he realized with a start im on a driveway ive reached a house a cabin he corrected himself although it certainly looked as sizable as a house two stories a roofed porch a massive chimney he barely took in these details before he ducked off the driveway into the cover of the pine trees and waited uneasily for any indication that he had been spotted after a minute passed and the only sound was the intensifying hiss of the falling snow he slowly rose and took a harder look at the cabin or as much of it as he could see through the snowfall the cabins base was built from huge rocks held together by concrete mortared logs formed the rest of the structure except for the chimney and two others that now became apparent all made from the same huge stones along the cabins base solid substantial keeping to the trees he eased along the edge of the clearing all the while studying the cabin the porch continued along the right side a small balcony projected from the second story the roof was sharply peaked a small structure to the side had tire tracks leading into it im still too exposed he thought even with the snow falling if i can see the cabin someone inside can see me so what now that youve found tash what difference does it make if youre seen go up on the porch and pound on the front door demand to know whats going on but i dont know for certain tash is in there just because i saw walt go into the post office that doesnt mean he has the same po box she does she might be staying in town or at another cabin if i barge in on walt and hes all by himself whats that going to look like a shadow moved beyond a window prompting coltrane to tense he backed deeper into the forest and relaxed only when the falling snow prevented him from seeing the cabin the time was a little before five dusk intensified by the weather became more pronounced it would soon be dark the thing to do is find a place to hole up and wait he thought its not like i havent been in snow in the mountains before sure in bosnia the thought startled him where the hell did that come from pushing it away he glanced around and saw a wooded slope behind him from its top he would have a vantage point on the cabin as soon as the weather lifted a drift spilled over the tops of his hiking boots but his wool socks kept most of it from chilling his ankles breathing rapidly from the unaccustomed altitude he arrived on the bluff assumed he was in line with the unseen cabin and took shelter beneath the snowladen boughs of a fir tree its limbs were bent over him in a tent shape again he had the feeling that hed done this before in bosnia i havent come far he dismally thought at six the weather moved on stars glistened moonlight sparkled off drifts as did lights from the cabin now visible below him his coldpinched nostrils were pinched even more by the smell of smoke that drifted from the biggest chimney it was the only imperfection in the norman rockwell homeyness of what he saw muscles compacting he noticed someone move beyond the lamp glow in a window down there even though he was confident that the illumination in the house would make the windows like mirrors and prevent anyone from seeing him in the nightcloaked forest he reflexively crouched behind a firtree branch peering cautiously over its snowcovered needles at a distance of what he judged to be a hundred yards he couldnt make out who was at the window so he hurriedly unzipped his ski jacket pulled out his camera and rezipped the jacket against the cold that attacked his chest he fumbled with a gloved hand to remove the cameras lens cap pocketing it he peered through the viewfinder and simultaneously held his breath so that frost from his mouth wouldnt waft up and cloud his vision then he zoomed in on the window adjusted the focus and felt his chest turn cold again when he saw walt facing the window looking down at something making a stirring motion walt wore a red checked shirt the magnification of the camera wasnt strong enough to reveal the slight scar above his right eyebrow but the sand color of his mustache was readily discernible walt turned to his right coltranes left and spoke to someone with the zoom lens at its maximum coltrane concentrated on walts lips but couldnt read them someone came into view at a sliding glass door farther to the left coltrane aimed the camera in that direction and if he hadnt already held his breath to avoid clouding the viewfinder he would have done so now for what he saw made his soul ache wearing jeans and a gray ragwool sweater that accentuated her lush hair hanging loosely framing her heartbreakingly beautiful features tash had both hands gripped around a coffee mug coltrane so projected himself within her that his hands could feel the heat from the mug she looked out at the snowcovered porch then turned to speak to walt who moved toward her his imposing body close to her she was tall but he was taller he placed his large hands on her shoulders in a gesture of domination she returned his stare he kissed her coltrane flinched almost charged from cover almost raced toward the porch but shock overwhelmed him he heard a click and whir and discovered that he had taken a photograph what am i seeing he thought walts hands remained on her shoulders she made no effort to set down the coffee cup and embrace him she didnt move her head to avoid his kiss but she didnt accept it either walt studied her he asked her a question whether tashs response was one of rejection or affection coltrane couldnt tell i need to get closer not caring whether his tracks would be seen in the morning coltrane responded to his sense of urgency and headed down the slope failing to look down he stumbled over a snowcovered log and barely managed not to fall with a lurch that jarred him he came to the bottom halfrunning and strained to avoid tree limbs he scraped past frantic he took slower steps and at last came to a stop alarmed by how forceful his breathing was how fierce his heartbeat in the trees at the edge of the clearing he was only a hundred feet from the cabin he didnt need his zoom lens to see tash and walt beyond the sliding glass door walt continued to grip her shoulders tash continued to stare up at him then walt kissed her again and this time tash set the mug on a table raised both hands and kissed him back she held him tightly receiving giving and coltrane heard another click and whir as he took a second photograph then he heard something else an unwilled sound that came from his throat as if he was being choked stunned he sank into a drift with his back against the rough bark of a pine tree he hugged himself but couldnt subdue the spasms shaking him this cant be happening he thought he shook his head insistently from side to side from where he was slumped he could still see the sliding glass door see them kissing walts hands were under tashs sweater her mouth was pressed against his she fumbled at his belt and coltrane screamed before he knew it he was on his feet surging from the trees he raced across the clearing and charged onto the hollowsounding wooden porch seeing the startled look on their faces when he yanked at the sliding glass door his shoulder felt a shock of pain as the door held firm i want to talk to you tash stumbled back walt lunged toward something on the right you told me i meant something to you coltrane yelled his belt still dangling walt reappeared jabbed at the lock and shoved the door open coltrane tried to veer past him why did you lie to me walt struck him coltrane lurched back ignoring his bleeding mouth the same spot where nolan had struck him in mexico he again tried to get to tash why did you make me think you loved me walt knocked him off the porch but the moment coltrane landed in a drift he scurried to try to stand only to lose all power of movement when he saw the revolver six inches from his face aimed between his eyes i could blow your head off walts breathing was hoarse why did you lead me on coltrane screamed at tash with your history with the two men youve already killed walt said what peeking through windows taking pictures stalking a lawenforcement officer trying to break into my home there isnt a grand jury anywhere that would blame me for defending myself tash backed away in fright especially if i put an unregistered pistol in your hand walt said and squeezed a shot through that glass door so youd have powder residue on your glove and thered be no doubt about your intentions so go ahead try to get past me give me a reason to pull this trigger why did you lie to me you just dont pay attention walt said the gunshot was deafening the heat of the bullet sped past the left side of coltranes head singeing his hair he didnt hear the impact of the bullet behind him couldnt could hardly hear walt shout in his face get out of here before i think twice and aim where i should have if i ever see you around here again if i ever see you anywhere walt fired again this time to the right side of coltranes head and the agony of the assault on coltranes ears made him clutch them and fall back writhing in the snow walt pulled coltranes hands away and grabbed his camera strap yanking the camera over coltranes head hurling it against the side of the cabin smashing it he dragged coltrane to his feet and shoved him across the clearing thrusting him out of the driveway and onto the road where coltrane fell in a daze gripping his ears again unable to stop the torturous disabling roar in them i need a room the motel clerk straightened my god what happened to you coltrane could barely hear him i had a skiing accident man you look like you ran into a tree another skier does he look as messed up as you he never got a scratch the room was spartan but clean a small bed a nineteeninch television a plastic ice bucket coltrane barely noticed all he cared about was locking the door behind him going over to the window opening the draperies and satisfying himself that traffic was vividly close the motel was on big bears outskirts close to the road that walt would have to use to drive into town with the glare of headlights coltrane knew that he had little chance of recognizing walts mountaineer if it went past tonight but tomorrow would be another matter he picked up the phone and called big bear information his ears still ringing so badly that he had trouble hearing the operator do you have a listing for natasha adler how about walt halliday he used a pencil and notepad on the bedside table to write down the number the phone on the other end rang five times maybe theyre out he thought hello tashs throaty voice made coltrane feel pressure in his chest just help me understand tell me why click coltrane frantically pressed the numbers again the phone was picked up halfway through the first ring youre going to be very sorry about this walt said the connection was broken coltrane pressed the numbers again but this time all he heard was the pulsing beep of a busy signal he called every ten minutes and continued to hear it the day was clear and bright in his chair coltrane stared out the window traffic close enough for him to read license plates wrappers from sandwiches that he had picked up the night before littered the floor around him using the television as radio he heard the cnn anchors tell him about a famine in africa an explosion at a school in northern ireland a mass murder in germany an oil spill in the gulf of mexico and mysterious deformities in frogs all over the world yeah things are tough he thought never taking his gaze from the window the mountaineer passed coltranes window just after four in the afternoon walts bigboned nononsense face behind the steering wheel tash next to him coltrane sprang to his feet and grabbed his ski jacket his car was directly outside the door of his motel room thirty seconds later staying far enough back to hide in traffic he again had the mountaineer in sight it parked at the post office but both tash and walt went into the building so coltrane lost that chance to speak to tash alone they came out and drove to a hardware store both entering another lost chance they drove to the parking lot of a duplex movie theater bought tickets and went in after giving them time to get settled he bought a ticket for meg ryans newest film but when he sat in the back he didnt see any profiles that resembled tashs and walts so he went out pretended to use the bathroom ducked into tom cruises latest and saw them almost at once they were on the aisle about halfway down on his right at this hour on a weekday there were plenty of seats available choosing one in the middle at the back coltrane watched them watch the movie they ate popcorn and sipped from straws in paper cups they leaned toward each other and whispered totally focused on their silhouettes coltrane had no idea what was happening on the screen but despite his concentration on tash she almost caught him by surprise when she stood and came up the aisle he slid down just in time to avoid being noticed a light haloed her as she opened the door and went out to the lobby immediately coltrane exited through the door on the other aisle but not in time to intercept her as she walked down a corridor next to the door she had used and entered a door at the end marked women coltrane stalled by buying popcorn he stalled longer by going into the corridor and lingering over a water fountain next to the mens room he pretended to show interest in posters for coming attractions he turned as the door to the womens room opened and tash came out she froze just give me an explanation coltrane said she stepped back trying to escape into the womens room but coltrane grabbed her arm what changed why did you let go of me how can everything suddenly be so different youre hurting my arm just tell me why you heard the lady a gravelly voice said youre hurting her arm let go of it coltrane swung toward the right where a broad burly man in a san bernardino county sheriffs uniform stood in the open door to the mens room the mans face had the grain of weathered barn board his hand was on his nightstick i one more time take your hand off her arm coltrane did movement in the lobby attracted his attention a door opening walt coming out walt stopped and crossed his arms not at all surprised by the scene that faced him this was a setup coltrane pivoted toward tash raising his voice christ all you had to do was explain to me and mr coltrane the sheriff said the use of the name eliminated any doubt that the sheriff was here by coincidence californias antistalking law antistalking law what are you talking about ive got a right to speak to this woman ive got a right to know why stipulates that for a crime to be committed a victim must be willfully maliciously and repeatedly harassed after your intrusion on ms adler last night your numerous unwelcome phone calls and the behavior i just witnessed id say that youre perilously close to inviting me to arrest you the theaters ticket taker and its popcorn seller peered nervously around a corner but ms adler is reluctant to take the matter to that level she tells me she wants to avoid trouble she wont make a formal complaint i think shes wrong i think shes already got trouble i think youre the trouble she had when she was living in malibu i think the only way to get rid of that trouble is for me to put you under arrest if the state of california leans on you believe me youll wish to god youd never leaned on this woman but coltrane felt lightheaded with confusion im not a stalker arent you a part of him thought how else would you describe what youve been doing youve become your father he felt sick so this is the deal im going to offer you the sheriff said get out of big bear and never come back if i see you here again ill arrest you for the assault i just witnessed at a minimum because next time im willing to bet ms adler wont be so generous about not pressing charges leave town now coltrane looked at tash okay damn it if you dont want me to have anything to do with you im out of here forget about why you made me think there was something special between us forget about how you lied mr coltrane just tell me one thing what happened to the photographs how did the negatives disappear from my house what photographs negatives tash shook her head i dont know what you mean of duncan reynolds who jesus coltrane said you are some piece of work i dont know what game youre playing but im not going to be a part of it anymore mr coltrane the sheriffs tone was filled with warning dont worry im leaving i finally got my mind straight go to hell tash youre not worth it wrong walt said as coltrane passed him shes the best thing that ever happened to me the negatives of duncan reynolds how had they disappeared from the vault the question kept nagging at coltrane all the while he drove angrily down from the mountains darkness obscured the peaks but he wouldnt have paid attention to them even if he had been able to see them there was too much on his mind when he had discovered that the negatives were missing he hadnt thought clearly about the implications he had taken for granted that someone had broken into his house and stolen them and that their disappearance was related to tashs disappearance if he could find out what happened to tash he would find out what happened to the negatives he had reasoned both were tied together because tash was the only person besides himself who knew that he had taken photographs of duncan reynolds spying on her the logical conclusion then was that tash had been responsible for their theft but that explanation hadnt made sense why would tash want to steal evidence that would help imprison the man who was stalking her stalking the memory of what he had been accused of sent a shock wave through his mind the sheriff had even gone so far as to imply that coltrane was the person who had stalked tash in malibu dear god what have i gotten myself involved in he felt he was being sucked into a spinning vortex totally without balance and direction the dismaying sensation was reinforced by a sharp curve in the mountain road that his headlights didnt reveal in time for him to reduce his speed he almost veered out of control and narrowly avoided careening into the trees at the side of the road his palms sweating he fought with the steering wheel steadied the car past the curve and sped onward through the night tash because it had seemed improbable for her to steal evidence that would help her coltrane had automatically rejected the idea with no other explanation however the mystery had been thoughtjamming another on coltranes list of many baffling questions that he needed to ask her but not anymore now that tash had denied any knowledge of the negatives and duncan reynolds coltranes thoughts were no longer blocked without his bias in favor of tash he saw the problem in the direct way that it should have struck him at the start his house had not been broken into there had not been any sign of forced entry so how could tash have gotten past the locks and the intrusion detector she couldnt have but someone else could have the one person who stood to benefit by the theft of the negatives duncan reynolds coltrane hadnt had time to change the locks duncan still had a key although coltrane had changed the numerical code on the intrusion detector most number pads could be programmed with several codes and duncan must have known about an existing one that coltrane did not know motive and means it was the only way to explain so clean a theft the reason coltrane hadnt suspected duncan was that duncan hadnt been aware of the incriminating photographs coltrane had taken of him duncan wouldnt have had a reason to invade coltranes house and steal negatives that he didnt even know existed unless tash had warned him why coltrane shot around another curve and saw the glow of riverside below him but instead of taking highway northwest toward the hollywood hills and home he headed west toward newport beach the redandblue flashing emergency lights startled him as he rounded the corner outside the estate that duncan had inherited from packard police cars blocked part of the exclusive street an ambulance was in the opengated driveway an unmarked car with a flashing dome light pulled in behind it radios squawked policemen came and went along the driveway feeling as cold as when he had hiked through the snow to reach walts cabin at big bear coltrane parked far enough back that his car wouldnt be in the way then got out in a daze slowly approaching the commotion neighbors had left their houses and formed troubled groups on the sidewalk what happened coltrane asked numbly reaching the nearest group the welldressed neighbors eyed his battered lips with suspicion do you live around here a policeman asked no the flashing lights were oppressive as coltrane watched an attendant open the back doors of the ambulance in duncans driveway then please get back in your car sir and i came to visit the man who lives in that house coltranes voice sounded faint to him far away duncan reynolds yes coltrane felt colder i havent talked to him in awhile i was in the area i thought id see if he was home when was the last time you spoke with him a couple of weeks what happened here was he depressed about anything money problems problems in a relationship problems with no money problems his employer died in november the will was generous did the death hit him hard what are you getting at the policeman hesitated a gardener noticed a smell he hadnt seen your friend in several days all the doors were locked he peered through a back window and saw a trouser leg projecting from behind a chair dear lord coltranes mouth was so dry that he had trouble forming the words when we forced the door open im sorry to have to tell you this we found your friends body what caused im not the medical examiner but the way it looks now he shot himself coltranes thoughts were so disjointed that driving down the hill toward his house he was slow to notice the car parked in front a bmw a minute earlier he would have sworn that his emotions couldnt possibly have gotten more complicated he would have been wrong after pressing the garagedoor opener he steered into the driveway stopped in the garage and got out on the street the bmws door opened and closed high heels clicked on concrete coming toward him jennifer wearing a blue business suit her short blond hair glinting from the light above the garage stopped in front of him he felt awkward embarrassed didnt know what to say she broke the silence i promised i wasnt going to bother you again actually im glad to see you she went on as if she hadnt heard him ive got a speech prepared i dont want to forget any of it then youd better not stop i vowed i wouldnt phone you not show up at your home not happen to cross paths with you the way i did the last time we broke up but here i am the fact is ive been leaving messages on your machine for the last two days when you didnt get back to me i figured you were determined to avoid me i didnt know about the messages ive been away so i had to break my word and show up here and wait for you you might have had a long wait coltrane said it already has been as soon as i got off work i drove over here three hours ago somehow i get the feeling its not because of my irresistible charm jennifer nodded you pretty much wiped out your charm the last time we talked then just because im furious at you that doesnt mean i wouldnt feel terrible if something happened to you her real name isnt natasha adler what and men have a habit of dying around her they sat in the tubular chairs in coltranes living room two cans of diet pepsi open glasses filled neither of them drinking after you told me to get lost jennifer said i hope i wasnt that blunt everythings a matter of perspective from my perspective she took a long breath anyway lets just say i felt hurt i felt used i coltrane looked down at his hands im not trying to throw this back at you jennifer said the only reason im going into this is to make you understand why i did what came next after what ive been through the past couple of days believe me i understand what you felt throw it back at me i deserve it i felt angry and confused and deeply deeply troubled not just about our breakup but about tash adler maybe you thought it was normal to fall in love with her on the spot but given your usual reluctance to make an emotional commitment i thought your sudden commitment to her was disturbing as hell coltrane felt stung those photographs of rebecca chance jennifer said tash adlers uncanny resemblance to her the whole business didnt only baffle me it struck me as being unnatural so i decided to try to make sense of it not because i thought i might find some dirt that would help get us back together i had no hope of that i still dont its not why im here for all i know youre going to tell me im making all this up so i can cause trouble between you and tash but i have to try because if something happened to you id never forgive myself for not having warned you dont worry you cant cause any more trouble between tash and me than there already is coltrane said coming into the house jennifer had asked about the gashes on his mouth he had told her what happened in mexico and big bear if im right there could be a lot more trouble jennifer said i think youre in real danger keep talking i wanted to find out just who this woman is that she could set your mind spinning the way she did and you said her real name isnt she was born melinda chance how do you know i hired the same private detective you did when you wanted to find out where natasha adler lived he didnt have much to go on just what youd told me about the stores she owns and her connection with rebecca chance but that was enough the stores arent owned in her name theyre controlled by a corporation she runs called opportunity inc the private detective followed the trail of that corporation and worked backward but im going to explain from the beginning and work forward jennifer opened a briefcase that she had brought with her heres a copy of a birth certificate melinda chance born april twentyninth fresno california father unknown mother stephanie chance all that proves is that some woman had the same last name heres a copy of a page from a fresno high school yearbook his stomach fluttering coltrane peered down at the copy she set before him it was a goodquality photographic reproduction he scanned the rows of students faces and fixed almost at once on the features of a young woman gazing back at him her dark hair was a little shorter and her features were more girlish than womanly but she had the same smoldering coals in her eyes tash except that the name under the photograph was melinda chance when was this yearbook issued when she was seventeen just before she left fresno whats this caption under her name destined to launch a thousand ships a compliment about her looks at first it puzzled me too but it reminded me of a quotation from something so i asked a reference librarian to track it down for me was this the face that launchd a thousand ships its from a renaissance play by christopher marlowe the face thats referred to is helen of troys i thought the allusion was a little fancy for a high school yearbook but then i noticed that below the caption it says favorite activity the drama club heres a photocopy of another page from the yearbook these are the members of the drama club melinda chance is easily the eyecatcher as the caption indicates among other things the club practiced by reading scenes from classic plays must have been a tough teacher portions from shakespeares hamlet and marlowes doctor faustus thats the play with the thousand ships quote you can see the title on the cover of the book shes holding in this photograph its about a man who sells his soul to the devil coltrane felt a chill what are you getting at she never finished high school in fresno she and her mother left town the reason they left is that melinda chance also enjoyed being on the football teams cheerleading squad she gave two of the players quite a bit of extra encouragement the quarterback killed a fullback because of her coltranes chill worsened stabbed him in a parking lot after the spring prom my god the killer was eighteen old enough to be tried as an adult jennifer said his family didnt have any social position but the boy who got stabbed was sixteen and his father was a bank president the jury found the older boy guilty the sentence was ten years and melinda chance moved on to sacramento she finished high school there and went to college but by then her name was vivian breuer breuer its a distinctive spelling ill get to why thats important in college she majored in drama but the drama she was involved in didnt happen only on a stage a young man she was dating fell from the tenstoryhigh balcony of her apartment the police questioned another boyfriend of hers who was in her apartment at the time of the fall that second young man was eventually arrested for harassing her meanwhile the chairman of the drama department a fortysixyearold man with a wife and two children shot himself to death after the final performance of the drama clubs spring production the play was tennessee williamss cat on a hot tin roof youll never guess who played maggie the character elizabeth taylor played in the movie and youll also never guess who was suspected of having had an affair with the professor you can prove all this here are photocopies of articles from the sacramento newspaper ive underlined vivian breuers name by now she was smart enough not to allow herself to be photographed for the yearbook but the private detective i hired tracked down cast members from that production of cat on a hot tin roof and they identified vivian breuer from melinda chances photos in the fresno high school yearbook theyre also the ones who suspected she was having an affair with the professor who killed himself these are the private detectives notes of the conversations he had with the cast members and these are the tape recordings of the same conversations coltrane looked with horror at the accumulating materials she transferred to humboldt state university in arcata california still majoring in drama but now she changed her name to linda erikson that last names important too ill explain why in a little while in arcata the lead actor in william inges picnic beat his male costar to death in an argument after the productions dress rehearsal do you remember the movie of that play william holden was the star right and cliff robertson was the male costar and the plot had to do with how holden playing a drifter showed up in a small town in kansas and stole robertsons girlfriend kim novak played the girl and tash had the kim novak role youre suggesting that what happened in the play also happened in life except that in the play one of the male costars doesnt beat the other one to death here are copies of the arcata newspaper articles about the murder note that linda erikson managed to avoid getting her photograph taken the student actor admitted that he killed the other actor because he was jealous about linda for her part linda professed to be as shocked as everyone else she said that she was too disturbed about what had happened to continue her studies and she moved on as soon as she finished testifying at the trial the student actor got eight years here are transcripts and tape recordings of conversations that my private investigator had with members of the picnic cast whom he tracked down he showed them melinda chances high school yearbook photographs they identified her as linda erikson coltranes feet and hands turned numb meanwhile the young man who was arrested for harassing her in sacramento set out to find her as soon as he got out of jail his search took him to guess where arcata where his body washed up on the beach one morning the medical examiners report suggested that he had drank too much gone swimming at night passed out and drowned heres a copy of it you ready for more no but i think id better hear it the next place she showed up was san francisco but she wasnt interested in college any longer she suddenly had the money to start half a dozen clothing boutiques and now her name was evelyn young i assume that last names important too coltrane said yes but this time shes making a joke i dont get it you will the money for the stores where did she from the acapulco venture group the name had uncomfortable overtones and filled coltrane with misgiving a subsidiary of orange coast investments jennifer said which is a division of seaview enterprises she paused which was owned by randolph packard coltrane looked down at the table and saw double for a moment so she lied to me when she said she didnt know about packard one of the things my private investigator couldnt find out is why packard would have given her money because packard thought he was her grandfather coltrane explained what he had learned in mexico maybe packard was her grandfather jennifer said coltrane shook his head and regretted it aggravating a splitting pain no rebecca chance told her servant that winston case was assuming rebecca chance told the truth coltranes blurred vision cleared as a terrible thought occurred to him she made each man think he was the father she was trying to set randolph packard and winston case against each other she wanted them to fight over her like grandmother like granddaughter and a lifetime later packard finally found his daughter and a granddaughter he didnt know about and he gave them money or maybe earlier the fact that in fresno her mother and she used the last name chance suggests that maybe they wanted to be found maybe they were found in fresno from what the private detective was able to learn they had a lot of money what happened when she showed up in san francisco jennifer shrugged fatalistically she changed her technique and joined a sailing club two prominent male members competed for her all three went out on a boat for a weekend up the coast only she and one of the men came back the inquest didnt dispute their story that the other man went on deck during the night lost his balance and fell overboard the body was never recovered something she did on the boat made the two men fight over her of course two months later the man whod survived was arrested for harassing her just like the student in sacramento coltrane said and just like that student he drowned shortly after he was released from jail in this case he took a boat out by himself and it capsized or maybe she arranged for him to have an accident so thered be one less person who knew how she got her kicks coltrane said the survivors of love affairs with her dont have much luck youre a survivor think about that while i tell you about san diego jennifer said she changed her name to donna miller is that a significant last name too you bet youll understand why in a minute she opened more clothing boutiques ran them for a while then turned them over to a manager and left on a yearlong aroundtheworld vacation that was six months ago six months the number nudged at something in coltranes memory a neighbor of hers told me thats when tash showed up in malibu as much as the investigator could determine nothing happened in san diego he thinks shes planning to keep it uncontaminated a home base but malibu was another matter melinda chance or tash adler or whatever you want to call her was up to her old tricks with a new variation that added more excitement she pretended to be stalked so she could have policemen around her big men with big guns whom she would manipulate to fight over her pretended to coltrane said no you dont understand duncan reynolds was in fact stalking her he instantly another piece of the puzzle slid horrifyingly into place jesus he wasnt stalking her he was her accomplice he was doing what tash asked him to do so the police would believe she was being threatened and she could manipulate her bodyguards until they turned on one another that explains how duncan knew about the photographs i took of him tash is the only one who could have told him she must have ordered him to take the evidence and cover her tracks and then whats the matter what else was stolen coltrane sprang to his feet as coltrane scrambled down the stairs he heard jennifer running after him frantic he reached the vault unlocked it and charged inside he flicked at the light switch without stopping raced past the shelves reached the false wall in the far left corner and shivered from more than the vaults chill when he stooped to free the catches and pull out the wall behind him jennifers heels sounded urgently on the concrete floor but his attention was totally directed toward the hidden chamber the vaults glaring overhead lights making him squint toward the shadows in there shes gone his voice broke rebecca chances face no longer peered out at him the lifesized photograph of her haunting features no longer hung on the back wall of the chamber he took a half step back as if hed been pushed then moaned and lurched into the chamber knowing what he wouldnt find but needing to search anyhow the effort was worthless the chamber was empty every box of photographs had been removed coltrane spun toward jennifer duncan didnt know about this chamber tash must have told him jesus feeling off balance he groped for a shelf when i confronted her in big bear she denied knowing anything about the negatives or duncan it didnt make sense why would she lie so i drove to duncans house in newport beach to confront him too late several days ago he shot himself duncan jennifer turned pale why would he maybe tash helped him along the way we assume she helped two of her old boyfriends along one less piece of evidence one less person who knew the truth the implications reduced them to stunned silence what about the last names she used tell me why theyre significant coltrane said breuer erikson young miller adler in college before i got into graphic arts i thought about a career in psychology i took a lot of classes in it the names erikson and adler had a lot of associations when i saw them together that made me think about the other names they all fit every one of them is a famous psychotherapist breuer and adler were colleagues of freud adler was one of his disciples i never heard of a famous psychotherapist called young spell it differently jung shes making a joke or she chose the names without realizing the connection among them a subconscious slip my private investigator found out that under each of these names she went to a therapist in each of the cities she lived in and what about miller alice miller the subtitle of one of her books is tracing childhood trauma in creativity and destructiveness coltranes voice was an uneasy whisper childhood trauma theres one other thing i have to tell you you mean it gets worse she told you her mother was dead well shes batting a thousand because that isnt true either in pointandshoot cameras the viewfinder and the lens have different openings as a consequence the image seen through the viewfinder is not quite the same as that received through the lens and recorded on film making precise framing difficult the difference between what the viewfinder sees and what the lens sees is known as the parallax effect and that is what coltrane suffered now what he had thought was happening was so at odds with what had truly been happening that the parallax threatened to drive him insane at ten the next morning after he and jennifer had caught a am flight to oakland he walked apprehensively along a corridor in the redwood rest facility in room after room aged men and women lay in beds a recreation room revealed a dozen residents in wheelchairs watching a game show on television in the hallway a few residents managed to get around with the aid of walkers coltrane nodded respectively to them then stopped where a whiteuniformed male attendant waited outside a room the attendant was in his twenties with wirerim glasses and his hair tied back in a ponytail youd better prepare yourselves the odds are she wont know you i dont expect her to coltrane said its been years since we met he lied the last time i saw her was when we lived on the same street in sacramento but i have these photographs i took of her daughter coltrane held up a packet and when her daughter found out i was coming to oakland for a photo assignment she asked me to visit her mother and give these to her the camera hanging from coltranes neck gave credence to his story sometimes her language can be a little frank no problem i admire elderly women who speak their mind jennifer said well maybe frank isnt the right word the attendant said coltrane tilted his head in puzzlement shocking would be more accurate the attendant said but who knows you might get lucky and catch her in one of her occasional ladylike moods the doctor said the photographs youre bringing might improve her mental outlook nothing else has so lets hope the attendant reached for the doorknob just give me a minute to go in and see that shes presentable take all the time you need coltrane said while the attendant went in his apprehension swelled so far so good the story about the photographs worked jennifer said i wish it hadnt i dont want to go in there the photographs of tash that coltrane had brought were from the film he had exposed in acapulco he had developed the prints the night before careful to shield jennifer from the nudes but inadvertently processing an image that he hadnt even known he had taken when carl nolan had tried to strangle him with the camera strap coltrane had fumbled to attempt to pry the hands away and had accidentally pressed the cameras shutter button the resultant image tilted on a fortyfivedegree angle showed the blur of what might have been the side of a hand on the right and the blur of what was possibly a shoulder on the left between them tashs face was distinct coltrane had never seen an expression of such animalistic delight he had almost been embarrassed to look at it so open was the sexual pleasure that she took from watching carl and him fight because of her the door hissed open the attendant stepping out i cant tell her mood but shes ready to see you am i ready though coltrane asked himself after an uncertain glance toward jennifer he felt encouraged by the touch of her hand on his arm he entered the room the rest homes administrator had given coltrane a sense of what to expect even so he was caught by surprise faltering as jennifer closed the door theres been a mistake were in the wrong room no mistake jennifer said but coltrane stared at the apparently sleeping woman on the bed tashs mother was born in depending on when her birthday is shed be sixtythree or sixtyfour now but this woman is what are you whispering about the woman on the bed complained she sounded as if she had broken glass caught in her throat sorry coltrane said we thought you were asleep we were trying to decide whether to wake you you mean you were trying to decide if i was asleep so you could feel me up uh coltrane lost the power of speech the woman in the bed who should have looked in her early sixties seemed in her nineties stringy thinning white hair rheumy red eyes shriveled skin a prematurely shrinking and collapsing body a scar disfigured each of her cheeks but the most disturbing aspect about her was that in spite of all the ravages her body had endured from alcohol and drugs the administrator had explained she was recognizably rebecca chances daughter and tashs mother as if this was how rebecca chance would have looked had she lived and led a hard life or as if this was how tash was destined to end go ahead feel me up the attendants do it all the time the prematurely old woman pawed at her spiderweb hair as if combing it coltrane looked at jennifer shocked and sickened stephanie jennifer approached the bed who the hell are you my names jennifer wed like to ask you a few questions no women allowed we brought you some photographs of your daughter no women allowed if i leave do you promise to talk to my friend did he come here to the suggestion she made turned coltranes stomach sour im afraid the attendants wouldnt like him to do that jennifer said they might get angry good they might start a fight yes you enjoy that make them fight they deserve to be punished why for wanting me does your daughter like men to fight the little the next word was shocking why do you call her that thought she was better than me took my men away from me when she was in college hah in high school hah when i was asleep she got a razor snuck up and did this to my cheeks couldnt stand her momma to get all the attention thought she could destroy the competition didnt work im still as beautiful as ever she gave coltrane the most demanding look he had ever received arent i yes then what she said next made coltrane look away what good are you get yourself a new boyfriend missy this one cant cut it pictures did you say you brought pictures of my daughter yes coltrane managed to say burn them send her to hell and get out of here quit wasting my time ive got men lined up waiting to youre right coltrane said were wasting your time im sorry we bothered you on the pillared steps of the rest home coltrane sank and put his head between his knees it took him several deep breaths before his swirling sensation passed and his stomach became still from the bay a saltladen breeze drifted over him cooling the sweat on his brow finally he was able to peer up at jennifer youre the one who took all the psychology courses its called being a sexual predator jennifer said in women its very rare but how did heredity or environment take your pick or both in other words who knows coltrane said my abnormalpsych prof said that emotional illness can be inherited jennifer eased down next to him crossing her arms over the knees of her gray slacks we dont know anything about rebeccas mother but she and her daughter and her granddaughter are all beautiful women so obsessed with their beauty so selfconscious and uncomfortable about it that they feel selfworth only when men fight over them or they were all abused as children and theyre so ambivalent about men so bitter that they want to punish men for finding them attractive coltrane said which takes us from heredity to environment we dont know how that pathetic woman in there was raised it could be winston case was a monster but from what she said about the way tash or melinda or whatever you want to call her was raised its clear that even as a child tash felt jealous about all the men her mother had around her she needed attention but since she couldnt get it from her mother she got it from her mothers boyfriends the trouble is she may have gotten more attention than she bargained for if tash was molested im not surprised that she feels so angry at men now that shes grown up on the one hand she feels compelled to tempt them on the other hand she needs to punish them for wanting her having sex with her is unforgivable coltrane felt his cheeks turn warm i have a terrible feeling youre next on her list of getevens jennifer said but even if you hadnt had sex with her you know she was lying about the negatives and duncan reynolds you see through her act and that puts you in a position to make trouble for her if shes true to form shell protect herself by finding a way to get rid of you just as she got rid of duncan and her former boyfriends thats what shes doing with walt shes setting him up to use him against me we have to warn him mr coltrane this is eliot blaine a concerned voice said from the speaker on coltranes car phone as soon as he and jennifer had gotten back to the los angeles airport he had called his home to find out if he had any messages on his answering machine a series of hangup calls had troubled him reminding him of ilkovic making him wonder if it was walt then blaine said im the attorney for randolph packards estate i dont know if youve heard this from another source if not forgive me for being the messenger of bad news i know you spent time with randolphs assistant duncan reynolds he confided to me that he was fond of his chats with you im theres no easy way to say this youll be as dismayed as i was to learn that duncans body was found at his home last evening apparently hed been dead for several days the police seem to think he committed its more appropriate if we discuss this in person please call me at my office about a week ago duncan came to me with a strange request i respected his privacy and didnt question him about it but it now seems obvious that he was taking care of personal matters before i have a package he wanted me to give you in the event of his death an audiocassette coltrane looked puzzled at the object he removed from the envelope seated in a softlooking brown leather chair behind a large glass desk blaine slid a signed letter in coltranes direction his manicured fingernails glistening at the time i thought it was a strange request but in my profession strange requests arent unusual duncans instructions to me were that you should listen to the tape in my presence when you telephoned to say you were coming i instructed my secretary to rearrange my schedule so that we could do so now thank you i always made time for duncan he was more than a business associate yes i thought of him as a friend too blaine was in his fifties of medium height and weight with cautious eyes his hair was perfectly trimmed his suit expensively tailored his shoes so shiny that they looked as if they had just come out of their box he stood and put the cassette into a player on a stack of stereo components next to law books as a soft hiss came from speakers at each end of the shelf he returned to his chair interlocked his fingers on his desk and hardened his patrician jaw in concentration the hiss on the tape continued something made a hollow thumping noise as if a microphone was being moved the clinking of what sounded like ice cubes in a glass was followed by the gulp of a large mouthful of liquid being swallowed this message is for mitch coltrane duncans slurred voice said if youre listening to this tape you know im dead another strained breath what an odd thing to hear myself say more clinking of ice cubes more liquid being swallowed duncan didnt speak again for what seemed like fifteen seconds his breathing was forced i thought about running but that would only make her decide im a greater liability than i suspect she already thinks i am besides i cant stand to be away from her what she lets me do to her a man of my years with my ordinary looks with my physical limitations i never dreamed i could know such to be indulged by maybe she doesnt think im a liability maybe i dont have a reason to be afraid maybe things will go on as they are and shell continue to let me what on earth is he talking about blaine asked coltrane held up a hand for blaine to be silent if only you hadnt taken those photographs of me duncan said you werent supposed to get to the south coast plaza melinda told carl that youd be at the first stop at the beverly center photographing the crowd trying to find the stalker she had carl worked up to the point where she knew hed use force to discourage you from seeing her again we were certain that youd be sufficiently disabled not to go on to the other stores when the photographs i took of her at the south coast plaza arrived at her house in the mail our assumption was that youd realize how close you had come to getting an image of the stalker youd have become more determined that would have made carl more determined eventually a labored breath but damn you you had to keep going and now if youre still alive youve figured out that she destroyed the photographs you took of me and that im the only one who had access to your house to steal the negatives but that still leaves you and me for the first time someone knows my connection to her how will she destroy that evidence a bump led to unnerving silence not even a hiss as if the tape machine had been turned off the tapes hiss resumed i thought i heard her duncan said i keep expecting her footsteps to come down the hall shell smile and put her arms around me and tell me who shes going to be next and the next game shes going to play but when she makes me a drink will she put something in it or will she get me more drunk than usual and take me out to the dock for a moonlight stroll and push me underwater the way she did to that kid who managed to follow her from sacramento to arcata would someone explain blaine started to say quiet duncan chuckled bitterly she certainly had that kid jumping through hoops but then she had us all jumping through hoops randolph knew what she was knew what her mother was knew what rebecca chance was but he was powerless to resist the same as i am even after he got so angry with rebecca that he pushed her off that cliff in mexico he couldnt get away from her spell he had to spend years trying to find the daughter that he wasnt even sure was his and when he finally found her and his granddaughter he fell into the same trap in the name of love he excused the terrible things they did melinda was happy to take his money but she never came to see him never made the slightest effort to delude him into thinking he was loved poor randolph such a lonely man he wanted the comfort of a family but i was the only one who provided it he finally had his will amended so that she would inherit the place he most hated where he killed the woman he never stopped loving even though he hated her for having manipulated him duncans voice was unsteady i have to stop i dont dare let her catch me with this tape recorder id warn you right now in person but what if im wrong what if she hasnt turned against me i cant give her up and if im right to be suspicious about her in that case im dead ive got nothing to lose make sure she doesnt destroy you the way she did me get even for me even though i deserve whatever she might do to me i have absolutely no loyalty to her god help me though how i need her the tape hissed something made a scraping sound possibly duncans hand setting down the microphone then the tape became silent although coltrane could see it continuing to turn in the tape deck now blaine asked now would you explain what this is about when jennifer finished blaine leaned back from the documents she had spread on the desk we have to take this to the police coltrane said blaine shook his head i dont know what good it would do these materials dont prove anything what are you talking about a skillful defense attorney would have a case predicated on these flimsy connections dismissed before it went to trial youre filling in blanks without any support for your conclusions in the eyes of the law the theory youre proposing is wildly circumstantial but what about all the names she used to protect her privacy the defense would argue that shes an unfortunate young woman who through no fault of her own has been plagued by men who want to dominate her a chain of terrible consequences for which she bears no responsibility has forced her to keep changing her name and where she lives you cant prove she manipulates men into fighting over her you cant prove she arranges for the victors to have lethal accidents the law deals with facts not supposition what about duncans tape the ravings of a man deranged enough to commit suicide the defense would deny any sexual connection between her and duncan it would argue that duncan was fantasizing in my professional opinion these materials are worthless but they might convince the police to look more closely into duncans death its clear now that he didnt commit suicide he was murdered clear to you but if melinda chance is as calculating as you believe she is i think its highly unlikely that she left anything to incriminate herself coltrane started to say something then gestured in frustration but my personal opinion is another matter blaine said i think this woman is dangerous i think you should give this material to the police in the hopes that they might finally investigate her then i think you should run like hell i bought a revolver and a shotgun here before christmas the clerk at the gun shop nodded but i couldnt take the handgun because of the fiveday waiting period youve come to pick it up yes and another shotgun jennifers face was stark with dismay as coltrane set the shotgun in the backseat along with the briefcaselike container that the revolver came in its happening again i know how you feel about guns he said but i dont see another choice its my fault i got into this mess if id stayed away from her you dont deserve to be at risk youve already helped a great deal im going to take you home and like hell you are coltrane blinked she makes me furious jennifer said the force of her words made coltrane study her in surprise im furious at the way she used you jennifer said at the way shes threatening you at what she did to us so dont give me any bullshit about taking me home im going to do my damnedest to help you stop her jennifer thought about her tone and started to laugh whats funny just like old times did you ever argue with her yes he shook his head their laughter subsided never he said jennifer remained silent for a long somber moment maybe you and i just arent a match because we disagree about some things hey its easy not to disagree when someones playing a role and constantly lying the way tash was maybe thats my problem i always tell the truth jennifer said i wouldnt call that a problem if i know whats good for me you said ill tell you whats good for me you are jennifer studied him studied her hands but how will you feel tomorrow the way i feel right now coltrane said he couldnt help thinking if were still alive tomorrow he had chosen a revolver because his lack of experience with handguns warned him to get something simple there wasnt any magazine to be loaded and inserted any slide to be pulled back any slight possibility of jamming characteristics of a semiautomatic pistol with the weapon he had chosen a colt python all he had to do was press a lever on the left side of the frame tilt out a cylinder push six rounds into its chambers and shove the cylinder back into place as easy as that it was ready to use an important consideration for someone with coltranes inexperience granted a semiautomatic in a similar caliber held more than twice as many rounds as the python but coltrane had concluded that a weapon he didnt feel comfortable with was almost as bad as not having a weapon at all he explained this to jennifer after he pulled into his garage loaded the handgun and shoved it under his sport coat it gouged his skin youre going to carry that with you if we need it its no use in a drawer coltrane loaded the shotgun you remember i showed you how to use this i swore i never would that was then what about now yes i remember how to use it coltrane had closed the garage before loading the weapons now he held the shotgun in his left hand used his right hand to unlock the garages entrance into the house and pushed the door open jennifer came behind him she closed the door as he turned to disarm the intrusion detector but a fidgety corner of his mind was already warning him that something was wrong the detector should have let out a thirtysecond beep reminding him to deactivate the system before it went into full alarm mode but it wasnt beeping no coltrane said jennifer secured the dead bolt on the door whats wrong the glowing words on the keypad chilled him ready to arm he spun toward the murky stairs that went up and down aiming the shotgun i turned on the alarm when i left but now its off somebodys in the house jennifer bumped backward against the shadowy wall it had to be tash coltrane thought duncan had known the secondary codes that disarmed the intrusion detector she must have made him tell her the sequence coltrane the mans voice was deep hoarse with anger it came from the right from upstairs in the dark living room walt jesus if he sees me with this shotgun he might not give me a chance to talk coltrane thought sweating he set the shotgun on the entryways floor close to the wall where it might not be noticed he buttoned his sport coat concealing the revolver under his belt im glad youre here the feelings mutual the husky voice was unsteady with greater anger coltrane flicked a light switch near the front door activating a lamp in the living room im coming up ive got something to show you what a coincidence ive got something to show you coltrane took a deep breath and started up the stairs jennifer followed her briefcase tight in her hand one step another coltrane gradually came up to the living room and saw walt diagonally across from him farthest from the illuminated lamp at the top of the stairs his face in shadow walt was seated in one of the black tubular chairs his hands on his knees if youll give me a minute coltrane said i need to tell you something you read my mind again oh because i came here to tell you something this is jennifer if shes smart shell get out of here let me explain in her briefcase shes got i dont give a damn about whats in her briefcase walt stood his rigid body rising like sections of an unfolding machine what i do give a damn about coltrane winced when he saw that as walt rose he lifted something from beneath the chair a baseball bat holding it in his right hand patting its hitting surface against the palm of his left hand walt had never looked so tall and menacing is making sure you get my message this time walt stepped forward for heaven sake listen tash has done this before i warned you to stay away from her i have stayed away from her you call following her everywhere yesterday staying away from her walt came closer patting the bat i didnt ive been in oakland sure ask jennifer hes right jennifer said quickly mitch was with me in youre lying walt smashed an art deco lamp the impact eartorturing glass and beads flying coltrane had never seen a more furious gaze if the two of you were in oakland how could you have followed tash and me to the stores she owns walt demanded followed but i didnt walt shattered a glass table shards exploding every damned store we went to the minute we entered the phone rang and it was for her from you tash is the one whos lying coltrane made a placating gesture startled to see that when walt raised his arms to swing his leather windbreaker hiked up and revealed a semiautomatic pistol in a holster clipped to his belt oh jesus if he realizes im wearing a handgun too he might drop the bat and reach for suddenly buying the gun seemed a terrible idea she must have somebody helping her coltrane said maybe she phoned ahead and told somebody in each store to claim she had a phone call when the two of you walked in then she pretended the call was from me bullshit why would she to make you so mad that youd come after me what are you talking about you stalked her in malibu youre stalking her now but i swear youll never do it again walt swung his body movement warning coltrane just in time for him to jump back the bat whistled past his head and walloped against the wall she likes men to fight over her coltrane shouted as walt swung in the reverse direction coltrane dodged again and jennifer dove to the floor the bat missed coltrane by an inch the fierce movement of air cooling the sweat on his brow listen to me coltrane shouted she wasnt being stalked in malibu she was making it up she had help you expect me to believe that crap but its true jennifer yelled from the floor ive got the proof in my briefcase her name isnt natasha adler its melinda chance shes had half a dozen different identities and lady i warned you to stay out of this men keep killing each other because of her jennifer rose with her briefcase offering it in a crouch just let me open this and show you what i you asked for it walt put all his weight behind his swing delivering the full force of the bat against the briefcase jolting it out of jennifers hands it burst open and flipped through the air documents flying the briefcase rebounded off the wall and landed among the broken glass of the table simultaneously jennifer shrieked falling back walt was poised to reverse the swing of his bat aiming at jennifer as she raised her hands to protect her head walt balked suddenly seeming to realize what he had become i whatever he meant to say it was too late coltrane charged the terror in jennifers eyes had released a fury in him beyond anything he had ever felt he struck walt from the side and collided with the table upon which the only light in the room sat their combined weight slammed down onto it buckling the table breaking the lamp sending the room into darkness as they rolled walt had to release his grip on the bat to block coltranes punches the hard edges of coltranes revolver tore against his side making him groan then the revolver slipped free falling among the wreckage and coltrane struggled upward with walt amid the roaring fury of his frantic breathing and his savage heartbeat he heard jennifer shouting no she was pleading wailing stop this is what she wants but coltrane was far beyond reason with no doubt whatsoever that walt meant to destroy him he had to do to walt what walt meant to do to him they lurched this way and that striking each other groaning blood mixing with the sweat on their faces legs weakening coltrane charged with all his remaining might his body hit walt so hard that walt jerked backward but the force of coltranes attack propelled coltrane with him and they hurtled through a french door glass bursting like a bomb going off kept hurtling struck the railing of a balcony and plummeted over for a moment coltrane had the sensation of floating in darkness then his stomach rose air rushed past him or the other way around as he and walt rushed through air falling twisting locked in each others arms their impact was shocking cold black water engulfing them they struck the pool so hard that their momentum took them all the way to the bottom jolting against it his breath knocked out of him coltrane gasped inhaled water and panicked struggling toward the surface he broke through gulped air and was thrown underwater again as walt gripped his shoulders and pressed down lungs burning coltrane twisted free braced his bent legs against the pools bottom and thrust himself upward breaking the surface again straining to breathe lights came on all around him in the living room from which they had fallen in the lower level that gave access to the pool in the shrubs of the backyard in the pool itself temporarily blinded coltrane splashed backward just in time to avoid walts hands around his throat stop jennifers pleading voice was close she must have turned on the lights and run down to the pool but coltrane paid no attention too busy avoiding walts attempts to push him under as walt lost his balance in the shoulderhigh water coltrane dove beneath the surface rocketed to the surface behind walt grabbed him from behind and pushed him beneath the water no a pole banged against the back of coltranes neck feeling bristles on the end of it coltrane vaguely realized that jennifer was using one of the poolcleaning tools to try to stop them from fighting walt wrestled free gasped for air spun and came at coltrane as jennifer dropped the pole between them and threw a cushion from a deck chair stop they had each other by the throat coltrane felt his face bulging as he tightened his grip and the shotgun blast was so startling that he jerked his hands away stumbling back he lost his footing went under splashed to the surface breathed frantically saw that walt had reacted much as he had and was astonished to discover jennifer at the side of the pool holding the shotgun down the street a dog barked in alarm several houses away a man yelled what was that her movements unpracticed jennifer awkwardly racked a fresh shell into the shotguns firing chamber the spent shell arced through the air clattering onto concrete look at yourselves its what she wants dont you understand youre being used for gods sake what do i have to do to make you stop jennifer looked so surprised her eyes fierce obviously uncomfortable with the shotgun doing her best to keep it balanced in her hands that coltrane suddenly had a sense of how out of control he had become shes right he stared at walt i dont want to laughter interrupted him from above deepthroated sensuous laughter baffled he looked upward and saw tash leaning over the balcony on the topmost level her beautiful features radiant with amusement her laughter swelled until she had to throw her head back to release it tash walt murmured do you understand now coltrane asked peering down from two stories above them tash wiped away tears of laughter but walt became speechless with bewilderment read the documents i had in my briefcase jennifer said tash shook her head in delight make her shoot again make her jump in and try to stop you tash walt said this time with realization you the word sounded like a curse as he splashed through the water he reached the side pulled himself out glared up dripping and suddenly broke into a run charging toward the house as walt disappeared into the bottom level coltrane forced his way to the side of the pool he crawled out ignored the cold air on his wet skin and raced after him jennifer hurried next to him the two of them passing the darkroom and the vault pounding up the stairs higher walt was shouting something tash continuing to laugh coltrane reached the living room and surveyed the wreckage the incalculable damage that walt had inflicted on the priceless furniture he saw the revolver that he had lost during the fight and he picked it up but he didnt see walt although he did hear a commotion above him and raced higher when he and jennifer came to the third level and rushed into the bedroom coltrane was shocked the bedroom was the only room on that level a flowerrimmed balcony led along all four sides and through the windows coltrane saw tash gamboling from one section to the next taunting walt as he pursued her the effect was dizzying coltrane in the middle of his bedroom turning peering outward watching tash sprint from one section of the balcony to the next walt was slowing his chest heaving for her part tash seemed to have an endless reservoir of energy skipping spinning evading walt she wore an allwhite anklelong cotton dress of a type that coltrane had seen in mexico loose it flared provocatively as she skipped and spun a red shawl was draped over her shoulders tied at her cleavage watching her and walt round another corner coltrane turned dizzier amazed at the sudden burst of speed that walt mustered thrusting out a hand walt grabbed the back of tashs shawl and jerked her up short causing her to gasp but before walt could pull her toward him she ducked her head and slipped free of the shawls tied loop he shot out another hand clutching her arm as she started to run when he spun her toward him he tossed away the shawl and drew back his hand to strike her she stared defiantly he hesitated whats the matter are you afraid to hit a woman youre not a woman you sure thought i was three hours ago when i that doesnt make you a woman tash laughed no what does it make me walt said a word the crudity of which was devastating the laughter halted i dont know what i saw in you walt said im going to have to burn my clothes and scour myself with bleach to get rid of the slime you left on me tashs eyes darkened youre a cesspool walt turned to enter the bedroom hey tash said seeing walt come through the doorway coltrane was overwhelmed by the look of absolute revulsion on walts face where do you think youre going tash demanded walt came farther into the bedroom im not through with you tash said the important thing is im through with you walt kept crossing the bedroom not bothering to look at her nobody walks away from me watch come back here go to hell you first tash grabbed a heavy pot from a row of flowers rushed into the bedroom and hurled it against the back of walts head for an instant coltrane thought that the cracking sound he heard was the pot breaking but then the pot thudded intact onto the floor and coltrane realized that the sound had come from walts skull the burly policeman staggered toward coltrane reached for support but never got that far his eyes rolled up his body became a collapsing rag doll when his face struck the carpeted floor the back of his head had an indentation covered with blood oh tash said the room seemed to shrink now look what youve made me do coltrane was so startled that he couldnt move next to him jennifer gaped at walts unmoving body the next thing tash was hunkered next to walts body fumbling through his pockets its not supposed to happen this way she glared up at coltrane youll pay for this for the first time coltrane noticed that her hands were shiny she was wearing plastic gloves from walts leather jacket she pulled out a small black electronic object that resembled a miniature remote control she picked up walts left hand wedged his fingers around the device and used his thumb to press a button on it make you pay im calling the police coltrane said starting toward the bedside phone he saw tash grope hurriedly beneath walts jacket understood and yelled to jennifer get back down the stairs immediately tash pulled walts semiautomatic free of its holster pressed it into his right hand inserted his index finger into the trigger guard and squeezed the trigger the gunshot was deafening not as loud as the shotgun blast had been but earslamming all the same the unaimed bullet missed coltrane by a wide margin blasting into a wall but he had the sense that the next bullet would be very deliberately aimed he scrambled toward the stairs as tash removed the weapon from walts hand and sighted expertly along it jesus diving coltrane heard the shot as he felt a bullet whiz by him he hit the stairs on his side winced and tumbled to the landing seeing the blurred figure of jennifer racing down the continuation of the stairs he rolled the next gunshot making his ears ring plaster exploding from the wall stinging his face jolting to a painful halt in the living room he only then realized that he was still holding the revolver that he had picked up before climbing the stairs to the bedroom reflexively he pointed it upward and pulled the trigger his aim bad missing tash as she ducked back from the landing above him her surprise at being shot at slowed her enough that coltrane had time to race down to the frontdoor landing before tash fired again he collided with jennifer who was fumbling to unlock the front door no time he yelled dragging her down the further continuation of the stairs an instant before two bullets whacked holes in the door they were on the bottom level now but the overhead light exposed them and jennifer flicked switches sending the bottom level of the pool area into darkness the next moment tash appeared at the landing fired three times into the shadows and dove back out of sight before his eyes could tell his brain to stop the impulse coltrane fired at the empty landing the gun awkward in his hand the recoil unnerving jennifer here her voice was unsteady behind him are you hurt no coltranes heart pounded so hard that he feared his arteries would burst crouching behind a concrete pillar he aimed up toward the landing the garden jennifers voice shook we can get away through the back no wed be trapped theres a wall around it wed only have bushes for cover she could pick us off from the living room balcony tash no answer tash coltrane raised his voice louder still no answer melinda jennifer called what the neighbors will have heard the shots theyll have phoned the police jennifer said its finished not yet tashmelinda said but it soon will be whats she talking about coltrane wondered she isnt stupid enough to hang around until the police come why is she waiting and why is she wearing plastic gloves so she wont leave fingerprints he thought then why did she press walts semiautomatic into his hand and use his finger to pull the trigger so his hand would have gunpowder residue isnt that what walt said up in big bear he threatened to shoot me then put a pistol in my hand and squeeze off a shot so youd have powder residue walt had said so it would look like id shot at walt and he was forced to defend himself thats what shes doing she wants to make it look as if walt did the shooting not her but therell be other evidence she cant hide he thought how does she plan to what was that remote control she pressed walts thumb on do you smell smoke jennifer murmured coltrane whirled even in the darkness he could see thick gray smoke billowing behind him from the darkroom it wafted up his nose and made him bend over coughing his eyes watering the smoke so dense that it cloaked the exit to the pool walt must have planted an incendiary device among the chemicals in there the remote control tash pressed walts thumb on set off jennifer get away from the door to the darkroom exploded flames bursting out flashing across the corridor whooshing toward the ceiling but as loud as the eruption was it didnt muffle jennifers scream as she sprinted toward the concrete pillar behind which coltrane crouched tash shot at her silhouette against the flames coltrane shot back jesus my hair jennifer pawed at it brushing out sparks now its almost over tash said coltrane cast a panicked glance toward the roaring wall of flames behind him so ill give you a choice tash said you can burn to death or you can let me shoot you and then drag walts body down here to make it look like he killed us but got caught in the fire he set sounds good to me tash said but youre running out of time i hear sirens jennifer said i dont its only been a couple of minutes nice try though coltrane felt the heat of the fire through the back of his sport coat his hair felt warm smoke seared his throat doubled over coughing he knew that he and jennifer had only a few more seconds before they would have to run toward the stairs although the house was made of reinforced concrete the walls floors and ceilings of the interior had conventional wooden frames held in by the concrete the flames would shoot along the wood like a firestorm we have to get out of the vault he thought unable to stop coughing its fireproof he almost struggled toward it before he remembered that it had a halongas fireextinguishing system not sufficient to put out the flames in the rest of the house but certainly enough to suffocate the two of them if they tried to seek shelter in there we have to rush the stairs and hope she doesnt shoot us before we as the heat on his back became unbearable and he braced himself to run he heard a scream from the frontdoor landing a shot but the bullet wasnt aimed toward the lower level it was aimed toward the figure who toppled down the stairs toward where tash crouched out of sight at the side of the landing the figure collided against her and sent her sprawling in full view of coltrane the figure was walt the blow to his head hadnt killed him regaining consciousness he must have lurched downstairs toward the sound of shouting on the bottom level his husky body pinned her his hands groped for her throat as she screamed again and pulled the trigger blasting a spray of crimson from the back of his alreadybattered skull in a panic she squirmed to get out from under walts nowtruly deadweight jennifer took advantage of the distraction and raced toward her caught by surprise coltrane took a second longer to rush from the fire tash pushed walts body off her and down the stairs then aimed at jennifer who lost her balance when she dodged walts tumbling body the bullet meant for her hit coltranes shoulder knocking him backward onto the floor for an instant he blacked out the heat of the spreading fire stung him back to panicked consciousness the pain in his right shoulder sending his nervous system into spastic overdrive as the flames seethed closer he struggled to stand and saw jennifer grappling with tash on the landing tash pulled the trigger on her pistol but nothing happened the slide staying back the magazine out of ammunition she threw the handgun grazing jennifers head as jennifer moaned and stumbled back tash turned slipped and scurried on all fours up the stairs jennifer grabbed for her snagging the anklelong hem of her dress when tash kicked backward jennifer held firm but tashs frantic movements tore the dress exposed her right leg to the knee and left jennifer holding a scrap of cloth again tash tried to scurry up the stairs again jennifer grabbed at the dress ripping more of it away unable to restrain her the two of them raced higher jennifer doesnt know ive been hit coltrane thought in dismay his right shoulder throbbed as he wavered up the stairs she thinks im coming to help her amid the roar of the flames behind him he heard noises outside the house shouts approaching sirens thank god he thought as he managed somehow to unlock the front door but the crash of something being thrown above him and a wail of pain warned him that jennifer needed him he struggled to climb higher his mind swirling when for a second time that night he came to the wreckage of the furniture in the living room and again he heard a commotion from even higher dripping blood he wavered up the stairs to the bedroom it all came back to the bedroom he thought the place was in darkness when he groped to flick the switch on the wall and achieved no result he realized that the crash he had heard was the rooms floor lamp being smashed the rooms silence unnerved him where is she jennifer asked from the corner on coltranes right i dont know my eyes havent adjusted to the darkness i a heavy object struck him in the chest knocking the wind out of him aggravating the agony in his shoulder dizzied by pain he fell against a bureau grabbed it for support and touched a camera he had set there are you okay jennifer whispered from the darkness to his right no ive been another object walloped against the wall near where jennifer had spoken where the hell is she throwing from i dont know coltrane said shes wearing white even in the darkness we ought to be able to see her she was wearing white coltrane didnt understand the remark crouching he grasped the camera outside the sirens grew closer louder across the room he saw what looked like a single pulse from a firefly the spark came and went so suddenly he wondered if his eyes were playing tricks on him baffled until he remembered tashs problem with static electricity readying the camera he aimed it toward where he had seen the spark activated the flash and pushed the shutter button the stab of light caught her in midmotion crawling toward the open door to the balcony because the flash was directed away from him it didnt hurt his eyes and presumably jennifers as much as it did tashs she winced her hand raised to protect her vision at once it was dark again and tash scurried toward the balcony as jennifer leapt from her hiding place jennifers cryptic remark that tash wasnt wearing white any longer now made sense because her white dress had been torn from her she was naked her sleek tan body hard to see in the darkness jennifers own clothes had been torn a sleeve of her navy blazer ripped off the buttons of her silk blouse yanked open she caught up to tash on the balcony and tashs supple body fought back in a way reminiscent of a feral cat she was clawing twisting lunging spitting streaks of blood suddenly appearing on jennifers cheeks bitch jennifer screamed the ferocity of her attack increasing the flames from the bottom level lit up the night smoke rose toward the struggling figures and from behind the stairway filled with a haze that drifted into the bedroom as jennifer lunged in a fury tash sidestepped shouldered jennifer against the railing grabbed her feet and upended her throwing her over the side coltranes heart stopped with a shock it restarted urging him toward the railing jennifer had gripped the railing as tash flipped her over and now jennifer dangled straining to hang on as tash pounded at her fingers and tried to peel them off below flames roared from both levels and the swimming pool didnt extend to this side beneath the flames there was only a tiled patio no thrusting tash aside coltrane reached his good arm toward jennifer to pull her up the punch to his wounded shoulder drove him nearly insane with anguish seeing tash try to hit him a second time he managed to block the blow but not without further pain to his wound i cant hold on jennifer shouted but coltrane couldnt pull her up he had to let go and defend himself against tash who lifted a heavy flowerpot to throw at him as she had at walt the effort to raise the pot above her head tilted her off balance and when coltrane pushed her as hard as he could she hit the railing so topweighted that when he slammed her shoulders she too went over the side jennifer jerked she grabbed me i cant hang on in a rush coltrane leaned over the side and slung his good arm under jennifers chest straining to support her weight below her he saw tash dangling from jennifers ankles the flames from both levels roaring up at her losing his hold desperate he tested his wounded arm using it to try to pull jennifer up blood pulsed his injured muscle failed no he strained harder with his good arm feeling jennifer slip all the while he stared down at tash who clawed her way up jennifers legs almost to her knees coltrane wept with the effort to keep jennifer from falling tash groped higher jennifer jerked her right leg free and kicked tash reached up jennifer kicked again why dont you jennifer kicked harder and coltrane couldnt help thinking about walts last words to tash and where tashs mother had said she wanted her go to hell as coltrane felt jennifer slipping away from him jennifer gave one last kick and tash lost her grip screaming plummeting into the flames below the roar of the fire was so intense that coltrane couldnt hear the impact of her body hitting the patio two levels down jennifer felt weightless hang on to me dont let go im trying as hard as i can jennifer pulled herself toward him my shoes are on fire she struggled upward coltrane lifting and abruptly they were sprawled on the balcony coltrane ignoring the sharp misery of his wound burning his hands as he yanked off jennifers smoking shoes and threw them away but flames filled the stairway to the bedroom so weak that they could hardly walk they wavered toward the section of the balcony farthest from the flames from there they had a view of the flashing lights of emergency vehicles in front of the house of the crowd that had gathered and firefighters spraying water at the blaze a woman in the crowd shouted my god someones up there two firemen stared toward the upper balcony turned off the hose they had trained on the house and ran toward the ladder truck raising it to save the two figures they had seen epilogue fire purifies but how coltrane wondered can you incinerate your mind the increasing traumas of the previous two months had so numbed him that only after surviving the final horror did he begin to understand the full extent of his psychic damage the rational part of him had grieved over the murders of his two closest friends and of his grandparents but the irrational part he came to realize had never acknowledged that those murders had occurred that those loved ones were lost to him forever those conflicting parts seemed to be reacting to separate universes and in one of those universes the murders couldnt possibly have occurred just as coltrane couldnt possibly have been hunted by dragan ilkovic so if those events couldnt have occurred they hadnt occurred otherwise he would surely have gone insane dragan ilkovic had seemed the epitome of evil but then coltrane had encountered tash adler her malignance existing on such an unimaginably primal level that it had shocked away the numbness created by what ilkovic had done to him he wept without warning he couldnt sleep for fear of nightmares he needed all his concentration to explain repeatedly to the police and the fire investigators what had happened in his house that night and the events that had led up to it when you reach absolute bottom coltrane told himself when you cant possibly fall any further and deeper you have to start climbing in that way tash had done him a favor by setting fire to the house that had once belonged to rebecca chance and randolph packard she had destroyed part of a festering past that had taken possession of him similarly the money with which coltrane had purchased the house was his only legacy from his hated father and although coltranes insurance company would reimburse him for the devastation of the property he had the sense that the money had been cleansed that the legacy too had been destroyed in the fire he planned to give some of it to gregs widow and the rest to various charities he refused to rebuild the house he put the lot up for sale but there was one other element of the past that he had to deal with and on a balmy day a month later he drove to the trailer court in glendale where he steered down the lane past the dilapidated playground where his mother had once pushed him in a swing he knocked on the door of the battered trailer where he and his mother had once lived and where his father had shot his mother and then committed suicide he knocked several times but the elderly black woman didnt answer mister she dont live here no more a kid on a beatup bicycle said do you know where she moved she dont live anywhere she dead ah his spirit sank and who lives here now nobody he bought the trailer had it towed away and without ever stepping into it again watched as a huge metal press crumpled it destroying it he bought the best new trailer he could find had it towed onto the trailer court found the poorest family in the area and arranged for them to live rentfree in the trailer then he paid for the old playground to be leveled and a shiny new one to take its place it gave him tremendous satisfaction he was cleaning house he told himself throwing out the past one aspect of the past that he was happy to retain although he felt oddly distant from it was the special edition of southern california magazine in which randolph packards classic series of photographs of la houses in the twenties and thirties was mirrored by coltranes updates of them along with the photographs of people and places he had come in contact with during the odyssey of his assignment theyre brilliant jennifer said theyre going to give you a whole new direction for your career i feel as if someone else took them coltrane said im a different person now good i wouldnt want you to become too complacent her tone was teasing i know one thing ill never take another photograph that doesnt make me appreciate being alive and part of the world like this photograph especially the photograph they were looking at showed a wistful frightened but determined young woman with wan cheeks sunken eyes and a scarf over her head that concealed the baldness that her chemotherapy treatments had caused the setting sun toward which she peered was a metaphor for the declining days of her life but the last moments of that setting sun made her face radiant her name was diane laramy and coltrane had taken that photograph on the day he and jennifer had set out to find the first of the houses that packard had photographed rudolph valentinos who although he hadnt known it had at the time himself been in the sunset of his life coltrane and jennifer had suspected that diane was undergoing treatments for cancer but they hadnt been certain until coltrane happened to see his photograph of her in the los angeles times apparently no one had considered that the photograph might be copyrighted and not available for reproduction without coltranes permission under the circumstances it didnt matter because the photograph was on the obituary page diane was survived by her parents and her husband whom she had married two months earlier donations could be made to the american cancer society coltrane did so i remember something we said the day we met her coltrane told jennifer they were in the living room of his town house where he had decided to continue staying what do you mean we said we admired the way in the face of death diane planned to get married to grasp at life yes jennifer sounded wistful to grasp at life i want to tell you something that ive never said to another woman its something i should have told you long ago im not sure i can take being hurt again ive learned a lot in the last couple of weeks about the difference between fools gold and the real thing i think you should be careful about what you say i love you now listen to yourself how would you feel about what a week in hawaii no getting married you keep surprising me well you wouldnt surprise me if you said no i cant tell you how sorry i am for having been so stupid for having hurt you id like the chance to try again getting married is more than a try jennifer said ive been there remember my exhusband had his own problems about commitment maybe we should just go on as we are for a while and see how things work out but a commitment is what i want to prove to you im making how do i know i wont get hurt again id die before id ever hurt you again coltrane said if you died that would be the worst hurt of all i made a terrible mistake coltrane touched her cheek im afraid of losing you i know i cant change the past but does that mean we should let it drag us backward all my life ive let the past drag me backward cant we learn from it and move forward they gazed at each other then were the real thing jennifer asked in answer coltrane put his arms around her and their kiss
