ian rankin mortal causes the sixth book in the inspector rebus series acknowledgements a lot of people helped me with this book id like to thank the people of northern ireland for their generosity and their crack particular thanks need to go to a few people who cant be named or wouldnt thank me for naming them you know who you are thanks also to colin and liz stevenson for trying gerald hammond for his gun expertise the officers of the city of edinburgh police and lothian and borders police who never seem to mind me telling stories about them david and pauline for help at the festival the best book on the subject of protestant paramilitaries is professor steve bruces the red hand oup one quote from the book there is no northern ireland problem for which there is a solution there is only a conflict in which there must be winners and losers the action of mortal causes takes place in a fictiionallsed summer before the shankill road bombing and its bloody aftermath perhaps edinburghs terrible inability to speak out edinburghs silence with regard to all it should be saying is but the hush that precedes the thunder the liberating detonation so oppressively imminent now hugh macdiarmid were all gonna be just dirt in the ground introduction he could scream all he liked they were underground a place he didnt know a cool ancient place but lit by electricity and he was being punished the blood dripped off him onto the earth floor he could hear sounds like distant voices something beyond the breathing of the men who stood around him ghosts he thought shrieks and laughter the sounds of a good night out he must be mistaken he was having a very bad night in his bare toes just touched the ground his shoes had came off as theyd scraped him down the flights of steps his socks had followed sometime after he was in agony but agony could be cured agony wasnt eternal he wondered if he would walk again he remembered the barrel of the gun touching the back of his knee sending waves of energy up and down his leg his eyes were closed if he opened them he knew he would see flecks of his own blood against the whitewashed wall the wall which seemed to arch towards him his toes were still moving against the ground dabbling in warm blood wherever he tried to steak he could feel his face cracking dried salt tears and sweat it was strange the shape your life could take you might be loved as a child but still go bad you might have monsters for parents but grow up pure his life had been neither one nor the other or rather it had been both for hed been cherished and abandoned in equal measure he was six and shaking hands with a large man there should have been more affection between them but somehow there wasnt he was ten and his mother was looking tired bowed down as she leaned over the sink washing dishes not knowing he was in the doorway she paused to rest her hands on the rim of the sink he was thirteen and being initiated into his first gang they took a pack of cards and skinned his knuckles with the edge of the pack they took it in turns all eleven of them it hurt until he belonged now there was a shuffling sound and the gun barrel was touching the back of his neck sending out more waves how could something be so cold he took a deep breath feeling the effort in his shoulderblades there couldnt be more pain than he already felt heavy breathing close to his ear and then the words again nemo me impune lacessit he opened his eyes to the ghosts they were in a smoke filled tavern seated around a long rectangular table their goblets of wine and ale held high a young woman was slouching from the lap of a onelegged man the goblets had stems but no bases you couldnt put them back on the table until theyd been emptied a toast was being raised those in fine dress rubbed shoulders with beggars there were no divisions not in the taverns gloom then they looked towards him and he tried to smile he felt but did not hear the final explosion probably the worst saturday night of the year which was why inspector john rebus had landed the shift god was in his heaven just making sure there had been a derby match in the afternoon hibs versus hearts at easter road fans making their way back to the west end and beyond had stopped in the city centre to drink to excess and take in some of the sights and sounds of the festival the edinburgh festival was the bane of rebuss life hed spent years confronting it trying to avoid it cursing it being caught up in it there were those who said that it was somehow atypical of edinburgh a city which for most of the year seemed sleepy moderate bridled but that was nonsense edinburghs history was full of licence and riotous behaviour but the festival especially the festival fringe was different tourism was its lifeblood and where there were tourists there was trouble pickpockets and housebreakers came to town as to a convention while those football supporters who normally steered clear of the city centre suddenly became its passionate defenders challenging the foreign invaders who could be found at tables outside shortlease cafes up and down the high street tonight the two might clash in a big way its hell out there one constable had already commented as he paused for rest in the canteen rebus believed him all too readily the cells were filling nicely along with the cid intrays a woman had pushed her drunken husbands fingers into the kitchen mincer someone was applying superglue to cashpoint machines then chiselling the flap open later to get at the money several bags had been snatched around princes street and the can gang were on the go again the can gang had a simple recipe they stood at bus stops and offered a drink from their can they were imposing figures and the victim would take the proffered drink not knowing that the beer or cola contained crushed up mogadon tablets or similar fastacting tranquillisers when the victim passed out the gang would strip them of cash and valuables you woke up with a gummy head or in one severe case with your stomach pumped dry and you woke up poor meantime there had been another bomb threat this time phoned to the newspaper rather than lowland radio rebus had gone to the newspaper offices to take a statement from the journalist whod taken the call the place was a madhouse of festival and fringe critics filing their reviews the journalist read from his notes he just said if we didnt shut the festival down wed be sorry did he sound serious oh yes definitely and he had an irish accent sounded like it not just a fake the reporter shrugged he was keen to file his story so rebus let him go that made three calls in the past weak each one threatening to bomb or otherwise disrupt the festival the police were taking the threat seriously how could they afford not to so far the tourists hadnt been scared off but venues were being urged to make security checks before and after each performance back at st leonards rebus reported to his chief superintendent then tried to finish another piece of paperwork masochist that he was he quite liked the saturday backshift you saw the city in its many guises it allowed a salutory peek into edinburghs grey soul sin and evil werent black hed argued the point with a priest but were greyly anonymous you saw them all night long the grey peering faces of the wrongdoers and malcontents the wife beaters and the knife boys unfocused eyes drained of all concern save for themselves and you prayed if you were john rebus prayed that as few people as possible ever had to get as close as this to the massive grey nonentity then you went to the canteen and had a joke with the lads fixing a smile to your face whether you were listening or not here inspector have you heard the one about the squid with the moustache he goes into a restaurant and rebus turned away from the dcs story towards his ringing phone di rebus he listened for a moment the smile melting from his face then he put down the receiver and lifted his jacket from the back of his chair bad news asked the dc youre not joking son the high street was packed with people most of them just browsing young people bobbed up and down trying to instil enthusiasm in the fringe productions they were supporting supporting them they were probably the leads in them they busily thrust flyers into hands already full of similar sheets only two quid best value on the fringe you wont see another show like it there were jugglers and people with painted faces and a cacophony of musical disharmonies where else in the world would bagpipes banjos and kazoos meet to join in a bucking battle from hell locals said this festival was quieter than the last theyd been saying it for years rebus wondered if the thing had ever had a heyday it was plenty busy enough for him though it was a warm night he kept his car windows shut even so as he crawled along the seas flyers would be pushed beneath his windscreen wipers all but blocking his vision his scowl met impregnable drama student smiles it was ten oclock not long dark that was the beauty of a scottish summer he tried to imagine himself on a deserted beach or crouched atop a mountain alone with his thoughts who was he trying to kid john rebus was always alone with his thoughts and just now he was thinking of drink another hour or two and the bars would sluice themselves out unless theyd applied for and been granted the very late licences available at festival time he was heading for the city chambers across the street from st giles cathedral you turned off the high street and through one of two stone arches into a small parking area in front of the chambers themselves a uniformed constable was standing guard beneath one of the arches he recognised rebus and nodded stepping out of the way rebus parked his own car beside a marked patrol car stopped the engine and got out evening sir where is it the constable nodded towards a door near one of the arches attached to the side wall of the chambers they walked towards it a young woman was standing next to the door inspector she said hello mairie ive told her to move on sir the constable apologised mairie henderson ignored him her eyes were on rebuss whats going on rebus winked at her the lodge mairie we all meet in secret like she scowled well then give me a chance off to a show are you i was till i saw the commotion saturdays your day off isnt it journalists dont get days off inspector whats behind the door its got glass panels mairie take a peek for yourself but all you could see through the panels was a narrow landing with doors off one door was open allowing a glimpse of stairs leading down rebus turned to the constable lets get a proper cordon set up son something across the arches to fend off the tourists before the show starts radio in for assistance if you need it excuse me mairie then there is going to be a show rebus stepped past her and opened the door closing it again behind him he made for the stairs down which were lit by a naked lightbulb ahead of him he could hear voices at the bottom of this first flight he turned a corner and came upon the group there were two teenage girls and a boy all of them seated or crouching the girls shaking and crying over them stood a uniformed constable and a man rebus recognised as a local doctor they all looked up at his approach this is the inspector the constable told the teenagers right were going back down there you three stay here rebus squeezing past the teenagers saw the doctor give them a worried glance he gave the doctor a wink telling him theyd get over it the doctor didnt seem so sure together the three men set off down the next flight of stairs the constable was carrying a torch theres electricity he said but a couple of the bulbs have gone they walked along a narrow passage its low ceiling further reduced by air and heatingducts and other pipes tubes of scaffolding lay on the floor ready for assembly there were more steps down you know where we are the constable asked mary kings close said rebus not that hed ever been down here not exactly but hed been in similar old buried streets beneath the high street he knew of mary kings close story goes said the constable there was a plague in the s people died or moved out never really moved back then there was a fire they blocked off the ends of the street when they rebuilt they built over the top of the close he shone his torch towards the ceiling which was now three or four storeys above them see that marble slab thats the floor of the city chambers he smiled i came on the tour last year incredible the doctor said then to rebus im dr galloway inspector rebus thanks for getting here so quickly the doctor ignored this youre a friend of dr aitkens arent you ah patience aitken shed be at home just now feet tucked under her a cat and an improving book on her lap boring classical music in the background rebus nodded i used to share a surgery with her dr galloway explained they were in the close proper now a narrow and fairly steep roadway between stone buildings a rough drainage channel ran down one side of the road passages led off to dark alcoves one of which according to the constable housed a bakery its ovens intact the constable was beginning to get on rebuss nerves there were more ducts and pipes runs of electric cable the far end of the close had been blocked off by an elevator shaft signs of renovation were all around bags of cement scaffolding pails and shovels rebus pointed to an arc lamp can we plug that in the constable thought they could rebus looked around the place wasnt damp or chilled or cobwebbed the air seemed fresh yet they were three or four storeys beneath road level rebus took the torch and shone it through a doorway at the end of the hallway he could see a wooden toilet its seat raised the next door along led into a long vaulted room its walls whitewashed the floor earthen thats the wine shop the constable said the butchers is next door so it was it too consisted of a vaulted room again whitewashed and with a floor of packed earth but in its ceiling were a great many iron hooks short and blackened but obviously used at one time for hanging up meat meat still hung from one of them it was the lifeless body of a young man his hair was dark and slick stuck to his forehead and neck his hands had been tied and the rope slipped over a hook so that he hung stretched with his knuckles near the ceiling and his toes barely touching the ground his ankles had been tied together too there was blood everywhere a fact made all too plain as the arc lamp suddenly came on sweeping light and shadows across the walls and roof there was the faint smell of decay but no flies thank god dr galloway swallowed hard his adams apple seeming to duck for cover then retreated into the close to be sick rebus tried to steady his own heart he walked around the carcass keeping his distance initially tell me he said well sir the constable began the three young people upstairs they decided to come down here the place had been closed to tours while the building work goes on but they wanted to come down at night there are a lot of ghost stories told about this place headless dogs and how did they get a key the boys greatuncle hes one of the tour guides a retired planner or something so they came looking for ghosts and they found this thats right sir they ran back up to the high street and bumped into pc andrews and me we thought they were having us on at first like but rebus was no longer listening and when he spoke it wasnt to the constable you poor little bastard look what they did to you though it was against regulations he leaned forward and touched the young mans hair it was still slightly damp hed probably died on friday night and was meant to hang here over the weekend enough time for any trail any clues to grow as cold as his bones what do you reckon sir gunshots rebus looked to where blood had sprayed the wall something highvelocity head elbows knees and ankles he sucked in breath hes been sixpacked there were shuffling noises in the close and the wavering beam of another torch two figures stood in the doorway their bodies silhouetted by the arc lamp cheer up dr galloway a male voice boomed to the hapless figure still crouched in the close recognising the voice rebus smiled ready when you are dr curt he said the pathologist stepped into the chamber and shook rebuss hand the hidden city quite a revelation his companion a woman stepped forward to join them have the two of you met dr curt sounded like the host at a luncheon party inspector rebus this is ms rattray from the procurator fiscals office caroline rattray she shook rebuss hand she was tall as tall as either man with long dark hair tied at the back caroline and i curt was saying were enjoying supper after the ballet when the call came so i thought id drag her along kill two birds with one stone so to speak curt exhaled fumes of good food and good wine both he and the lawyer were dressed for an evening out and already some white plasterdust had smudged caroline rattrays black jacket as rebus moved to brush off the dust she caught her first sight of the body and looked away quickly rebus didnt blame her but curt was advancing on tie figure as though towards another guest at the party he paused to put on polythene overshoes i always carry some in my car he explained you never know when theyll be needed he got close to the body and examined the head first before looking back towards rebus dr galloway had a look has he rebus shook his head slowly he knew what was coming hed seen curt examine headless bodies and mangled bodies and bodies that were little more than torsos or melted to the consistency of lard and the pathologist always said the same thing poor chaps dead thank you i take it the crew are on their way rebus nodded the crew were on their way a van to start with loaded with everything theyd need for the initial scene of crime investigation soc officers lights and cameras strips of tape evidence bags and of course a bodybag sometimes a forensic team came too if cause of death looked particularly murky or the scene was a mess i think said curt the procurator fiscals office will agree that foul play is suspected rattray nodded still not looking well it wasnt suicide commented rebus caroline rattray turned towards the wall only to find herself facing the sprays of blood she turned instead to the doorway where dr galloway was dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief wed better get someone to fetch me my tools curt was studying the ceiling any idea what this place was a butchers shop sir said the constable only too happy to help theres a wine shop too and some houses you can still go into them he turned to rebus sir whats a sixpack a sixpack echoed curt rebus stared at the hanging body its a punishment he said quietly only youre not supposed to die whats that on the floor he was pointing to the dead mans feet to the spot where they grazed the darkstained ground looks like rats have been nibbling his toes said curt no not that there were shallow grooves in the earth so wide they must have been made with a big toe four crude capital letters were discernible is that neno or nemo could even be memo offered dr curt captain nemo said the constable hes the guy in leagues beneath the sea jules verne said curt nodding the constable shook his head no sir walt disney he said on sunday morning rebus and dr patience aitken decided to get away from it all by staying in bed he nipped out early for croissants and papers from the local corner shop and they ate breakfast from a tray on top of the bedcovers sharing sections of the newspapers discarding more than they read there was no mention of the previous nights grisly find in mary kings close the news had seeped out too late for publication but rebus knew there would be something about it on the local radio news so he was quite content for once when patience tuned the bedside radio to a classical station he should have come off his shift at midnight but murder tended to disrupt the system of shifts on a murder inquiry you stopped working when you reasonably could rebus had hung around till two in the morning consulting with the night shift about the corpse in mary kings close hed contacted his chief inspector and chief super and kept in touch with fettes hq where the forensic stuff had gone di flower kept telling him to go home finally hed taken tile advice the real problem with back shifts was that rebus couldnt sleep well after them anyway hed managed four hours since arriving home and four hours would suffice but there was a warm pleasure in slipping into bed as dawn neared curling against the body already asleep there and even more pleasure in pushing the cat off the bed as you did so before retiring hed swallowed four measures of whisky he told himself it was purely medicinal but rinsed the put it away hoping patience wouldnt notice she complained often of his drinking among other things were eating out she said now when lunch today where that place out at carlops rebus nodded witchs leap he said what thats what carlops means theres a big rock there they used to throw suspected witches from it if you didnt fly you were innocent but also dead their judicial system wasnt perfect witness the duckingstool same principle how do you know all this its amazing what these young constables know nowadays he paused about lunch i should go into work oh no you dont patience theres been a john therell be a murder here if we dont start spending some time together phone in sick i cant do that then ill do it im a doctor theyll believe me they believed her they walked off lunch by taking a look at carlops rock and then braving a climb onto the pentlands despite the fierce horizontal winds back in oxford terrace patience eventually said she had some office things to do which meant filing or tax or flicking through thelatest media journals so rebus drove out along queensferry road and parked outside the church of our lady of perpetual noting with guilty pleasure that no one had yet corrected the mischievous graffiti on the noticeboard which turned help into hell inside the church was empty cool and quiet and flooded with coloured light from the stained glass hoping his timing was good he slipped into the confessional there was someone on the other side of the grille forgive me father said rebus im not even a catholic ah good its you you heathen i was hoping youd come i want your help shouldnt that be my line dont be bloody cheeky come on lets have a drink father conor leary was between fiftyfive and seventy and had told rebus that he couldnt remember which he was nearer he was a bulky barrelling figure with thick silver hair which sprouted not only from his head but also from ears nose and the back of his neck in civvies rebus guessed he would pass for a retired dockworker or skilled labourer of some kind who had also been handy as a boxer and father leary had photos and trophies to prove that this last was incontrovertible truth he often jabbed the air to make a point finishing with an uppercut to show that there could be no comeback in conversation between the two men rebus had often wished for a referee but today father leary sat comfortably and sedately enough in the deckchair in his garden it was a beautiful early evening warm and clear with the trace of a cool seaborne breeze a great day to go hotair ballooning said father leary taking a swig from his glass of guinness or bungee jumping i believe theyve set up something of the sort on the meadows just for the duration of the festival man id like to try that rebus blinked but said nothing his guinness was cold enough to double as dental anaesthetic he shifted in his own deckchair which was by far the older of the two before sitting hed noticed how threadbare the canvas washow how it had been rubbed away where it met the horizontal wooden spars he hoped it would hold do you like my garden rebus looked at the bright blooms the trim grass i dont know much about gardens he admitted me neither its not a sin but theres an old chap i know who does know about them and he looks after this one for a few bob he raised his glass towards his lips so how are you keeping im fine and dr aitken shes fine and the two of you are still just about father leary nodded rebuss tone was warning him off another bomb threat eh i heard on the radio it could be a crank but youre not sure the ira usually use codewords just so we know theyre serious father leary nodded to himself and a murder too rebus gulped his drink i was there they dont even stop for the festival do they whatever must the tourists think father learys eyes were sparkling its about time the tourists learned the truth rebus said a bit too quickly he sighed it was pretty gruesome im sorry to hear that i shouldnt have been so flippant thats all right its a defence youre right it is rebus knew this it was the reason behind his many little jokes with dr curt it was their way of avoiding the obvious the undeniable even so since last night rebus had held in his mind the picture of that sad strung up figure a young man they hadnt even identified yet the picture would stay there forever everybody had a photographic memory for horror hed climbed back out of mary kings close to find the high street aglow with a firework display the streets thronged with people staring up openmouthed at the blues and greens in the night sky the fireworks were coming from the castle the nights tattoo display was ending he hadnt felt much like talking to mairie henderson in fact he had snubbed her this isnt very nice shed said standing her ground this is very nice father leary said now relaxing back further into his seat the whisky rebus had drunk hadnt rubbed out the picture if anything it had smeared the corners and edges which only served to highlight the central fact more whisky would have made this image sharper still were not here for very long are we he said now father leary frowned you mean here on earth thats what i mean were not around long enough to make any difference tell that to the man with a bomb in his pocket every one of us makes a difference just by being here im not talking about the man with the bomb im talking about stopping him youre talking about being a policeman ach maybe im not talking about anything father leary allowed a shortlived smile his eyes never leaving rebuss a bit morbid for a sunday john isnt that what sundays are for maybe for you sons of calvin you tell yourselves youre doomed then spend all week trying to make a joke of it others of us give thanks for this day and its meaning rebus shifted in his chair lately he didnt enjoy father learys conversations so much there was something proselytising about them so when do we get down to business he said father leary smiled the protestant work ethic you havent brought me here to convert me we wouldnt want a dour bugger like you besides id more easily convert a fiftyyard penalty in a murrayfield crosswind he took a swipe at the air ach its not really your problem maybe it isnt a problem at all he ran a finger down the crease in his trouserleg you can still tell me about it a reversal of roles eh well i suppose thats what i had in mind all along he sat further forward in the deckchair the material stretching and sounding a sharp note of complaint here it is then you know pilmuir dont be daft yes stupid question and pilmuirs garibaldi estate the garb its the roughest scheme in the city maybe in the country there are good people there but youre right thats why the church sent an outreach worker and now hes in trouble maybe father leary finished his drink it was my idea theres a community hall on the estate only it had been locked up for months i thought we could reopen it as a youth club for catholics for both faiths he sat back in his chair even for the faithless the garibaldi is predominantly protestant but there are catholics there too we got agreement and set up some funds i knew we needed someone special someone really dynamic in charge he punched the air someone who might just draw the two sides together mission impossible thought rebus this scheme will selfdestruct in ten seconds not least of the garbs problems was the sectarian divide or the lack of one depending on how you looked at it protestants and catholics lived in the same streets same tower blocks mostly they lived in relative harmony and shared poverty but there being little to do on the estate the youth of the place tended to organise into opposing gangs and wage warfare every year there was at least one pitched battle for police to contend with usually in july usually around the protestant holy day of the th so you brought in the sas rebus suggested father leary was slow to get the joke not at all he said just a young man a very ordinary young man but with inner strength his fist cut the air spiritual strength and for a while it looked like a disaster nobody came to the club the windows were smashed as soon as wed replaced them the graffiti got worse and more personal but then he started to break through that seemed the miracle attendance at the club increased and both sides were joining so whats gone wrong father leary loosened his shoulders it just wasnt quite right i thought thered be sports maybe a football team or something we bought the strips and applied to join a local league but the lads werent interested all they wanted to do was hang around the hall itself and the balance isnt there either the catholics have stopped joining most of them have even stopped attending he looked at rebus thats not just sour grapes you understand rebus nodded the prod gangs have annnexed it im not saying that exactly sounds like it to me and your outreach worker his names peter cave oh hes still there too often for my liking i still dont see the problem actually he could but he wanted it spelling out john ive talked to people on the estate and all over pilmuir the gangs are as bad as ever only now they seem to be working together divvying the place up between them all thats happened is that theyve become more organised they have meetings in the club and carve up the surrounding territory it keeps them off the street father leery didnt smile so close the youth club thats not so easy it would look bad for a start and would it solve anything have you talked with mr cave he doesnt listen hes changed thats what troubles me most of all you could kick him out father leery shook his head hes lay john i cant order him to do anything weve cut the clubs funding but the money to keep it going comes from somewhere nevertheless where from i dont know how much it doesnt take much so what do you want me to do the question rebus had been trying not to ask father leery gave his weary smile again to be honest i dont know perhaps i just needed to tell someone dont give me that you want me to go out there not if you dont want to it was rebuss turn to smile ive been in safer places and a few worse ones too i havent told you about half of them father rebus finished his drink another he shook his head its nice and quiet here isnt it father leary nodded thats the beauty of edinburgh youre never far from a peaceful spot and never far from a hellish one either thanks for the drink father rebus got up i see your team won yesterday what makes you think i support hearts theyre prods arent they and youre a protestant yourself away to hell father said john rebus laughing father leery pulled himself to his feet he straightened his back with a grimace he was acting purposely aged just an old man about the garb john he said opening his arms wide im in your hands like nails thought rebus like carpentry nails monday morning saw rebus back at work and in the chief supers office farmer watson was pouring coffee for himself and chief inspector frank lauderdale rebus having refused he was strictly decaf these days and the farmer didnt know the meaning of the word a busy saturday night said the farmer handing lauderdale a grubby mug as inconspicuously as he could lauderdale started rubbing marks off the rim with the ball of his thumb feeling better by the way john scads better sir thank you said rebus not even close to blushing a grim business under the city chambers yes sir so what do we have it was lauderdales turn to speak victim was shot seven times with what looks like a ninemillimetre revolver ballistics will have a full report for us by days end dr curt tells us that the head wound actually killed the victim and it was the last bullet delivered they wanted him to suffer lauderdale sipped from the cleaned rim of his mug a murder room had been set up along the hall and he was in charge consequently he was wearing his best suit there would be press briefings maybe a tv appearance or two lauderdale looked ready rebus would gladly have tipped the mug of coffee down the mauve shirt and paisley pattern tie your thoughts john said farmer watson someone mentioned the words sixpack yes sir its a punishment routine in northern ireland usually carried out by the ira ive heard of kneecappings rebus nodded for minor offences theres a bullet in each elbow or ankle for more serious crimes theres a kneecapping on top and finally theres the sixpack both elbows both knees both ankles you know a lot about it i was in the army sir i still take an interest you were in ulster rebus nodded slowly in the early days chief inspector lauderdale placed his mug carefully on the desktop but they normally wouldnt then kill the person not normally the three men sat in silencefor a moment the farmer broke the spell an ira punishment gang here rebus shrugged a copycat maybe gangs aping what theyve seen in the papers or on tv but using serious guns very serious said lauderdale could be a tiein with these bomb threats the farmer nodded thats the line the media are taking maybe our wouldbe bomber had gone rogue and they caught up with him theres something else sir said rebus hed phoned dr curt first thing just to check they did the knees from behind maximum damage you sever the arteries before smashing kneecaps whats your point two points sir one they knew exactly what they were doing two why bother when youre going to kill him anyway maybe whoever did it changed his mind at the last minute maybe the victim was meant to live the probable handgun was a revolver six shots whoever did it must have stopped to reload before putting that final bullet in the head eyes were avoided as the three men considered this putting themselves in the victims place youve been sixpacked you think its over then you hear the gun being reloaded sweet jesus said the farmer there are too many guns around lauderdale said matteroffactly it was true over the past few years there had been a steady increase in the number of firearms on the street why mary kings close asked the farmer youre not likely to be disturbed there rebus guessed plus its virtually soundproof you could say the same about a lot of places most of them a long way from the high street in the middle of the festival they were taking a big risk why bother rebus had wondered the same thing he had no answer to offer and nemo or memo it was lauderdales turn another respite from the coffee ive got men on it sir checking libraries and phone directories digging up meanings youve talked to the teenagers yes sir they seem genuine enough and the person who gave them the key he didnt give it to them sir they took it without his knowledge hes in his seventies and straighter than a plumbline some builders i know said the farmer could bend even a plumbline rebus smiled he knew those builders too were talking to everyone lauderdale went on whos been working in mary kings close it seemed he had got the farmers joke all right john said the farmer you were in the army what about the tattoo yes the tattoo rebus had known the conclusion everyone would jump to from the case notes theyd spent most of sunday jumping to it the farmer was examining a photograph it had been taken during sundays postmortem examination the socos on saturday night had taken photos too but those hadnt come out nearly as clearly the photo showed a tattoo on the victims right forearm it was a rough selfinflicted affair the kind you sometimes saw on teenagers usually on the backs of hands a needle and some blue ink thats all you needed that and a measure of luck that the thing wouldnt become infected those were all the victim had needed to prick the letters sas into his skin its not the special air service said rebus no rebus shook his head for all sorts of reasons youd use a capital a for a start more likely if you wanted an sas tattoo youd go far the crest the knife and wings and who dares wins something like that unless you didnt know anything about the regiment offered lauderdale then why sport a tattoo do we have any ideas asked the farmer were checking said lauderdale and we still dont know who he is no sir we still dont know who he is farmer watson sighed then thatll have to do for now i know were stretched just at the minute with the festival threat and everything else but it goes without saying this takes priority use all the men you have to we need to clean this up quickly special branch and the crime squad are already taking an interest ah thought rebus so that was why the farmer was being a bit more thorough than usual normally hed just let lauderdale get on with it lauderdale was good at running an office you just didnt want him out there on the street with you watson was shuffling the papers on his desk i see the can gang have been at it again it was time to move on rebus had had dealings in pilmuir before hed seen a good policeman go wrong there hed tasted darkness there the sour feeling returned as he drove past stunted grass verges and broken saplings though no tourists ever came here there was a welcome sign it comprised somebodys gable end with white painted letters four feet high enjoy your visit to the garb garb was what the kids for want of a better term called the garibaldi estate it was a mishmash of early s terraced housing and late s tower blocks everything faced with grey harling with boring swathes of grass separating the estate from the main road there were a lot of orange plastic traffic cones lying around they would make goalposts for a quick game of football or chicanes for the bikers last year some enterprising souls had put them to better use using them to divert traffic off the main road and into the garb where youths lined the sliproad and pelted the cars with rocks and bottles if the drivers ran from their vehicles they were allowed to go while the cars were stripped of anything of value right down to tyres seatcovers and engine parts later in the year when the road needed digging up a lot of drivers ignored the genuine traffic cones and as a result drove into newly dug ditches by next morning abandoned vehicles had been stripped to the bone the garb would have stripped the paint if they could you had to admire their ingenuity give these kids money and opportunity and theyd be the saviours of the capitalist state instead the state gave them dole and daytime tv rebus was watched by a gang of preteens as he parked one of them called out wheres yir swanky car its no him said another kicking the first lazily in the ankle the two of them were on bicycles and looked like the leaders being a good year or two older than their cohorts rebus waved them over what is it but they came anyway keep an eye on my car he told them anyone touches it you touch them okay theres a couple of quid for you when i get back half now the first said quickly the second nodded rebus handed over half the money which they pocketed naebodyd touch that car anyway mister said the second producing a chorus of laughter from behind him rebus shook his head slowly the patter here was probably sharper than most of the standups on the fringe the two boys could have been brothers more than that they could have been brothers in the s they were dressed in cheap modern style but had shorn heads and wide ears and sallow faces with darkringed eyes you saw them staring out from old photographs wearing boots too big for them and scowls too old they didnt just seem older than the other kids they seemed older than rebus himself when he turned his back he imagined them in sepia he wandered towards the community centre hed to pass dome lockup garages and one of the three twelvestorey blocks of flats the community centre itself was no more than a hall small and tired looking with boarded windows and the usual indecipherable graffiti surrounded by concrete it had a low flat roof asphalt black on which lay four teenagers smoking cigarettes their chests were naked their tshirts tied around their waists there was so much broken glass up there they could have doubled as fakirs in a magic show one of them had a pile of sheets of paper and was folding them into paper planes which he released from the roof judging by the number of planes littering the grass it had been a busy morning at the control tower paint had peeled in long strips from the centres doors and one layer of the plywood beneath had been punctured by a foot or a fist but the doors were locked fast by means of not one but two padlocks two more youths sat on the ground backs against the doors legs stretched in front of them and crossed at the ankles for all the world like security guards on a break their trainers were in bad repair their denims patched and torn and patched again maybe it was just the fashion one wore a black tshirt the other an unbuttoned denim jacket with no shirt beneath its shut the denim jacket said when does it open the night no polis allowed though rebus smiled i dont think i know you whats your name the smile back at him was a parody black tshirt grunted an undeveloped laugh rebus noticed flecks of white scale in the youths hair neither youth was about to say anything the teenagers on the roof were standing now ready to leap in should anything develop hard men said rebus he turned and started to walk away denim jacket got to his feet and came after him whats up mr polisman rebus didnt bother looking at the youth but he stopped walking why should anything be up one of the paper planes aimed or not hit him on the leg he picked it up on the roof they were laughing quietly why should anything be up he repeated behave youre not our usual plod a change is as good as a rest arrest what for rebus smiled again he turned to the youth the face was just leaving acne behind it and would be good looking for a few more years before it started to decline poor diet and alcohol would be its undoing if drugs or fights werent the hair was fair and curly like a childs hair but not thick there was a quick intelligence to the eyes but the eyes themselves were narrow the intelligence would be narrow too focusing only on the main chance the next deal there was quick anger in those eyes too and something further back that rebus didnt like to think about with an act like yours he said you should be on the fringe i fuckn hate the festival join the club whats your name son you like names dont you i can find out the youth slipped his hands into his tight jeans pockets you dont want to no a slow shake of the head believe me you really dont want to the youth turned heading back to his friends or next time he said your car might not be there at all sure enough as rebus approached he saw that his car was sinking into the ground it looked like maybe it was taking cover but it was only the tyres theyd been generous theyd only slashed two of them he looked around him there was no sign of the preteen gang though they might be watching from the safe distance of a towerblock window he leaned against the car and unfolded the paper plane it was the flyer for a fringe show and a blurb on the back explains that the theatre group in question were uprooting from the city centre in order to play the garibaldi community centre for one night you know not what you do rebus said to himself some young mothers were crossing the football pitch a crying baby was being shaken on its buggy springs a toddler was being dragged screaming by the arm his legs frozen in protest so that they scraped the ground both baby and toddler were being brought back into the garb but not without a fight rebus didnt blame them for resisting detective sergeant brian holmes was in the murder room handing a polystyrene cup of tea to detective constable siobhan clarke and laughing about something whats the joke asked rebus the one about the hardup squid holmes answered the one with the moustache holmes nodded wiping an imaginary tear from his eye and gervase the waiter brilliant eh sir brilliant rebus looked around the murder room was all purposeful activity photos of the victim and the locus had been pinned up on one wall a staff rota not far from it the staff rota was on a plastic wipeboard and a wpc was checking names from a list against a series of duties and putting them on the board in thick blue markerpen rebus went over to her keep di flower and me away from one another eh even if it means a slip of the pen i could get into trouble for that inspector she was smiling so rebus winked at her everyone knew that having rebus and flower in close proximity two detectives who hated one another would be counter productive but of course lauderdale was in charge it was lauderdales list and lauderdale liked to see sparks fly so much so that he might have been happier in a foundry holmes and clarke knew what rebus had been talking about with the wpc but said nothing im going back down mary kings close rebus said quietly anyone want to tag along he had two takers rebus was keeping an eye on brian holmes holmes hadnt tendered his resignation yet but you never knew when it might come when you joined the police of course you signed on for the long haul but holmess significant other was pulling on the other end of the rope and it was hard to tell whod win the tug o war on the other hand rebus had stopped keeping an eye on siobhan clarke she was past her probation and was going to be a good detective she was quick clever and keen police officers were seldom all three rebus himself might pitch for thirty per cent on a good day the day was overcast and sticky with lots of bugs in the air and no sign of a dispersing breeze what are they greenfly maybe midges ill tell you what they are theyre disgusting the windscreen was smeared by the time they reached the city chambers and there being no fluid in the wiper bottle the windscreen stayed that way it struck rebus that the festival really was a high street thing most of the city centre streets were as quiet or as busy as usual the high street was the hub the chambers small car park being full he parked on the high street when he got out he brought a sheet of kitchentowel with him spat on it and cleaned the windscreen what we need is some rain dont say that a transit van and a flatback trailer were parked outside the entrance to mary kings close evidence that the builders were back at work the butchers shop would still be taped off but that didnt stop the renovations inspector rebus an old man had been waiting for them he was tall fit looking and wore an open creamcoloured raincoat despite the days heat his hair had turned not grey silver but a kind of custard yellow and he wore halfmoon glasses most of the way down his nose as though he needed them only to check the cracks in the pavement mr blairfish rebus shook the brittle hand id like to apologise again my greatnephew can be such a no need to apologise sir your greatnephew did us a favour if he hadnt gone down there with those two lassies we wouldnt have found the body so fast as we did the quicker the better in a murder investigation blairfish inspected his oftrepaired shoes then accepted this with a slow nod still its an embarrassment not to us sir no i suppose not now if youll lead the way mr blairfish led the way he took them in through the door and down the flights of stairs out of daylight and into a world of lowwattage bulbs beyond which lay the halogen glare of the builders it was like looking at a stageset the workers moved with the studied precision of actors you could charge a couple of quid a time and get an audience if not a fringe first award the gaffer knew police when he saw their and nodded a greeting otherwise nobody paid much attention except for the occasional sideways and appraising glance towards siobhan clarke builders were builders below ground as above blairfish was providing a running commentary rebus reckoned hed been the guide when the constable had come on the tour rebus heard about how the close had been a thriving thoroughfare prior to the plague only one of many such plagues to hit edinburgh when the denizens moved back they swore the close was haunted by the spirits of those who had perished there they all moved out again and the street fell into disuse then came a fire leaving only the first few storeys untouched edinburgh tenements back then could rise to a precarious twelve storeys or more after which the city merely laid slabs across what remained and built again burying mary kings close the old town was a narrow place you must remember built along a ridge or if you enjoy legend on the back of a buried serpent long and narrow everyone was squeezed together rich and poor living cheek by jowl in a tenement like this youd have your paupers at the top your gentry in the middle floors and your artisans and commercial people at street level so what happened asked holmes genuinely interested the gentry got fed up said blairfish when the new town was built on the other side of nor loch they were quick to move with the gentry gone the old town became dilapidated and stayed that way for a long time he pointed down some steps into an alcove that was the bakers see those flat stones thats where the oven was if you touch them theyre still warmer than the stones around them siobhan clarke had to testthis she came back shrugging rebus was glad hed brought holmes and clarke with him they kept blairfish busy while he could keep a surreptitious eye on the builders this had been his plan all along to appear to be inspecting mary kings close while really inspecting the builders they didnt look nervous well no more nervous than you would expect they kept their eyes away from the butchers shop and whistled quietly as they worked they did not seem inclined to discuss the murder someone was up a ladder dismantling a run of pipes someone else was mending brickwork at the top of a scaffold further into the tour away from the builders blairfish took siobhan clarke aside to show her where a child had been bricked up in a chimney a common complaint among eighteenthcentury chimney sweeps the farmer asked a good question rebus confided to holmes he said why would you bring anyone down here think about it it shows you must be local only locals know about mary kings close and even then only a select few it was true the public tour of the close was not common knowledge and tours themselves were by no means frequent theyd have to have been down here themselves or know someone who had if not theyd more likely get lost than find the butchers holmes nodded a shame theres no record of the tour parties this had been checked the tours were informal parties of a dozen or more at a time there was no written record could be they knew about the building work and reckoned the body would be down here for weeks or maybe said rebus the building work is the reason they were down here in the first place someone might have tipped them off were checking everyone is that why were here just now giving the crew a onceover rebus nodded and holmes nodded back then he had an idea maybe it was a way of sending a message thats what ive been wondering but what kind of message and who to you dont go for the ira idea its plausible and implausible at the same time rebus said weve got nothing here to interest the paramilitaries weve got edinburgh castle holyrood palace the festival he has a point they turned towards the voice two men were standing in torchlight rebus recognised neither of them as the men came forwards rebus studied both the man who had spoken the slightly younger of the two had an english accent and the look of a london copper it was the hands in the trouser pockets that did it that and the air of easy superiority that went with the gesture plus of course he was wearing old denims and a black leather bomberjacket he had close cropped brown hair spiked with gel and a heavy pockmarked face he was probably in his latethirties but looked like a fortysomething with coronary problems his eyes were a piercing blue it was difficult to meet them he didnt blink often like he didnt want to miss any of the show the other man was wellbuilt and fit in his lateforties with ruddy cheeks and a good head of black hair just turning silver at the edges he looked as if he needed to shave two or even three times a day his suit was dark blue and looked straight off the tailors dummy he was smiling inspector rebus the same im dci kilpatrick rebus knew the name of course it was interesting at last to have a face to put to it if he remembered right kilpatrick was still in the scs the scottish crime squad i thought you worked out of stuart street sir rebus said shaking hands i moved back from glasgow a few months ago i dont suppose it made the front page of the scotsman but im heading the squad here now rebus nodded the scs took on serious crimes where crossforce investigations were necessary drugs were their main concern or had been rebus knew men whod been seconded to the scs you stayed three or four years and came out two things unwillingly and tough as secondday bacon kilpatrick was introducing his companion this is di abernethy from special branch hes come all the way from london to see us that takes the biscuit said rebus my grandad was a jock abernethy answered gripping rebuss hand and not getting the joke rebus introduced holmes and when she returned siobhan clarke from the colouring in clarkes cheeks rebus reckoned someone along the way had made a pass at her he decided to rule out mr blairfish which still left plenty of suspects so said abernethy at last rubbing his hands wheres this slaughterhouse a butchers actually mr blairfish explained i know what i mean said abernethy mr blairfish led the way but kilpatrick held rebus back look he whispered i dont like this bastard being here any more than you do but if were tolerant well get rid of him all the quicker agreed yes sir kilpatricks was a glaswegian accent managing to be deeply nasal even when reduced to a whisper and managing too to be full of irony and a belief that glasgow was the centre of the universe usually glaswegians somehow added to all this a ubiquitous chip on their shoulder but kilpatrick didnt seem the type so no more bloody cracks about biscuits understood sir kilpatrick waited a moment it was you who noticed the paramilitary element wasnt it rebus nodded good work thank you sir yes and glaswegians could be patronising bastards too when they rejoined the group holmes gave rebus a questioning look to which rebus replied with a shrug at least the shrug was honest so they strung him up here abernethy was saying he looked around at the setting bit melodramatic eh not the iras style at all give them a lockup or a warehouse something like that but someone who likes a bit of drama set this up rebus was impressed it was another possible reason for the choice of venue bangbang abernethy continued then back upstairs to melt into the crowd maybe take in a latenight revue before toddling home clarke interrupted you think theres some connection with the festival abernethy studied her openly causing brian holmes to straighten up not for the first time rebus wondered about clarke and holmes why not abernethy said its every bit as feasible as anything else ive heard but it was a sixpack rebus felt obliged to defend his corner no abernethy corrected a sevenpack and thats not paramilitary style at all a waste of bullets for a start he looked to kilpatrick could be a drug thing gangs like a bit of melodrama it makes them look like theyre in a film plus they do like to send messages to each other loud messages kilpatrick nodded were considering it my moneyd still be on terrorists rebus added a gun like that dealers use guns too inspector they like guns big ones to make a big loud noise ill tell you something id hate to have been down here the report from a ninemillimetre in an enclosed space like this it could blow out your eardrums a silencer siobhan clarke offered it wasnt her day abernethy just gave her a look so rebus provided the explanation revolvers dont take silencers abernethy pointed to rebus but his eyes were on clarkes listen to your inspector darling you might learn something rebus looked around the room there were six people there four of whom would gladly punch anothers lights out he didnt think mr blairfish would enter the fray abernethy meantime had sunk to his knees rubbing his fingers over the floor over ancient dirt and husks the socos took off the top inch of earth rebus said but abernethy wasnt listening bags and bags of the stuff had been taken to the sixth floor of fettes hq to be sieved and analysed and god knew what else by the forensics lab it occurred to rebus that all the group could now see of abernethy was a fat arse and brilliant white reeboks abernethy turned his face towards them and smiled then he got up brushing his palms together was the deceased a drug user no signs only i was thinking sas could be smack and speed again rebus was impressed thoroughly despite himself dust had settled in the gel of abernethys hair small enough motes of comfort could be scott and sheena offered rebus in other words could be anything abernethy just shrugged hed been giving them a display and now the show was over i think ive seen enough he said kilpatrick nodded with relief it must be hard rebus reflected being a top cop in your field a man with a rep sent to act as tour guide for a junior officer and a sassenach at that galling that was the word abernethy was speaking again might as well drop in on the murder room while im here why not said rebus coldly no reason i can think of replied abernethy all sweetness and bite and what youve got doesnt make much sense st leonards police station headquarters of the citys b division boasted a semipermanent murder room the present inquiry looked like it had been going on forever abernethy seemed to favour the scene he browsed among the computer screens telephones wall charts and photographs kilpatrick touched rebuss arm keep an eye on him will you ill just go say hello to your chief super while im here right sir chief inspector lauderdale watched him leave so thats kilpatrick of the crime squad eh funny he looks almost mortal it was true that kilpatricks reputation a hard one to live up to preceded him hed had spectacular successes in glasgow and some decidedly public failures too huge quantities of drugs had been seized but a few terrorist suspects had managed to slip away at least he looks human lauderdale went on which is more than can be said for our cockney friend abernethy couldnt have heard this he was out of earshot but he looked up suddenly towards them and grinned lauderdale went to take a phone call and the special branch man sauntered back towards rebus hands stuffed into his jacket pockets its a good operation this but theres not much to go on is there not much not yet you worked with scotland yard on a case didnt you thats right with george flight right again hes gone for retraining you know i mean at his age got interested in computers i dont know maybe hes got a point theyre the future of crime arent they days coming the big villains wont have to move from their living rooms the big villains never have this earned a smile from abernethy or at least a lopsided sneer has my minder gone for a jimmy hes gone to say hello to someone well tell him tata from me abernethy looked around then lowered his voice i dont think dci kilpatrick will be sorry to see the back of me what makes you say that abernethy chuckled listen to you if your voice was any colder you could store cadavers in it still think youve got terrorists in edinburgh rebus said nothing well its your problem im well shot of it tell kilpatrick ill talk to him before i head south youre supposed to stay here just tell him ill be in touch there was no painless way of stopping abernethy from leaving so rebus didnt even try but he didnt think kilpatrick would be happy he picked up one of the phones what did abernethy mean about it being rebuss problem if there was a terrorist connection itd be out of cids hands it would become special branchs domain mis domain so what did he mean he gave kilpatrick the message but kilpatrick didnt seem bothered after all there was relaxation in his voice the sort that came with a large whisky the farmer had stopped drinking for a while but was back off the wagon again rebus wouldnt mind a drop himself lauderdale who had also just put down a telephone was staring at a pad on which hed been writing as he took the call something rebus asked we may have a positive id on the victim do you want to check it out lauderdale tore the sheet from the pad do hibs fans weep rebus answered accepting it actually not all hibs fans were prone to tears siobhan clarke supported hibernian which put her in a minority at st leonards being englisheducated another minority much smaller she didnt understand the finer points of scottish bigotry though one or two of her fellow officers had attempted to educate her she wasnt catholic they explained patiently so she should support heart of midlothian hibernian were the catholic team look at their name look at their green strip they were edinburghs version of glasgow celtic just as hearts were like glasgow rangers its the same in england theyd tell her wherever youve got catholics and protestants in the same place manchester had united catholic and city protestant liverpool had liverpool catholic and everton protestant it only got complicated in london london even had jewish teams siobhan clarke just smiled shaking her head it was no use arguing which didnt stop her trying they just kept joking with her teasing her trying to convert her it was lighthearted but she couldnt always tell how lighthearted the scots tended to crack jokes with a straight face and be deadly serious when they smiled when some officers at st leonards found out her birthday was coming she found herself unwrapping half a dozen hearts scarves they all went to a charity shop shed seen the darker side of football loyalty too the collection tins at certain games depending on where you were standing youd be asked to donate to either one cause or the other usually it was for families or victims or prisoners aid but everyone who gave knew they might be perpetuating the violence in northern ireland fearfully most gave one pound sterling towards the price of a gun shed come across the same thing on saturday when with a couple of friends shed found herself standing at the hearts end of the ground the tin had come round and shed ignored it her friends were quiet after that we should be doing something about it she complained to rebus in his car such as get an undercover team in there arrest whoevers behind it behave well why not because it wouldnt solve anything and thered be no charge we could make stick other than something paltry like not having a licence besides if you ask me most of that cash goes straight into the collectors pocket it never reaches northern ireland but its the principle of the thing christ listen to you principles they were slow to go and some coppers never lost them entirely here we are he reversed into a space in front of a tenement block on mayfield gardens the address was a top floor flat why is it always the top floor siobhan complained because thats where the poor people live there were two doors on the top landing the name on one doorbell read murdock there was a brown bristle welcomemat just outside the door the message on it was get lost charming rebus pressed the bell the door was opened by a bearded man wearing thick wireframed glasses the beard didnt help but rebus would guess the mans age at midtwenties he had thick shoulderlength black hair through which he ran a hand im detective inspector rebus this is come in come in mind out for the motorbike yours mr murdock no its billys it hasnt worked since he moved in the bikes frame was intact but the engine lay disassembled along the hall carpet lying on old newspapers turned black from oil smaller pieces were in polythene bags each bag tied at the neck and marked with an identifying number thats clever said rebus oh aye said murdock hes organised is billy in here he led them into a cluttered living area this is millie she lives here hiya millie was sitting on the sofa swathed in a sleeping bag despite the heat outside she was watching the television and smoking a cigarette you phoned us mr murdock aye well its about billy murdock began to pad around the room see the description in the paper and on the telly well i didnt think about it at the time but as millie says its not like billy to stay away so long like i say hes organised usually hed phone or something just to let us know when did you last see him murdock looked to millie when was it thursday night i saw him friday morning so you did rebus turned to millie she had short fair hair dark at the roots and dark eyebrows her face was long and plain her chin highlighted by a protruding mole rebus reckoned she was a few years older than murdock did he say where he was going he didnt say anything theres not a lot of conversation in this flat at that hour what hour she flicked ash into the ashtray which was balanced on her sleeping bag it was a nervous habit the cigarette being tapped even when there was no ash for it to surrender seven thirty quarter to eight she said where does he work he doesnt said murdock resting his hand on the mantelpiece he used to work in the post office but they laid him off a few months back hes on the dole now along with half of scotland and what do you do mr murdock im a computer consultant sure enough some of the living rooms clutter was made up of keyboards and disk drives some of them dismantled piled on top of each other there were piles of fat magazines too and books hefty operating manuals did either of you know billy before he moved in i did said millie a friend of a friend casual acquaintance sort of thing i knew he was looking for a room and there was a room going spare here so i suggested him to murdock she changed channels on the tv she was watching with the sound turned off watching through a squint of cigarette smoke can we see billys room why not said murdock hed been glancing nervously towards millie all the time shed been talking he seemed relieved to be in movement he took them back into where the narrow entrance hall became a wider rectangle off which were three doors one was a cupboard one the kitchen back along the narrow hall theyd passed the bathroom on one side and murdocks bedroom on the other which left just this last door it led them into a very small very tidy bedroom the room itself would be no more than ten feet by eight yet it managed to contain single bed wardrobe a chest of drawers and a writing desk and chair a hifi unit including speakers sat atop the chest of drawers the bed had been made and there was nothing left lying around you havent tidied up have you murdock shook his head billy was always tidying you should see the kitchen do you have a photograph of billy rebus asked i might have some from one of our parties you want to look at them just the best one will do ill fetch it then thank you when murdock had gone siobhan squeezed into the room beside rebus until then shed been forced to stay just outside the door initial thoughts rebus asked neurotically tidy she said the comment of one whose own fiat looked like a cross between a pizza franchise and a bottle bank but rebus was studying the walls there was a hearts pennant above the bed and a union jack flag on which the red hand of ulster was centrally prominent with above it the words no surrender and below it the letters ftp even siobhan clarke knew what those stood for fuck the pope she murmured murdock was back he didnt attempt to squeeze into the narrow aisle between bed and wardrobe but stood in the doorway and handed the photo to siobhan clarke who handed it to rebus it showed a young man smiling manically for the camera behind him you could see a can of beer held high as though someone were about to pour it over his head its as good a photo as weve got murdock said by way of apology thank you mr murdock rebus was almost sure almost billy had a tattoo on his arm aye it looked like one of those things you do yourself when youre a daft laddie rebus nodded theyd released details of the tattoo looking for a quick result i never really looked at it close up murdock went on and billy never talked about it millie had joined him in the doorway she had discarded the sleeping bag and was wearing a modestly long tshirt over bare legs she put an arm around murdocks waist i remember it she said sas big s small a did he ever tell you what it stood for she shook her head tears were welling in her eyes its him isnt it hes the one you found dead rebus tried tobe noncommittal but his face gave him away millie started to bawl and murdock hugged her to him siobhan clarke had lifted some cassette tapes from the chest of drawers and was studying them she handed them silently to rebus they were collections of orange songs songs about the struggle in ulster their titles said it all the sash and other glories king billys marching tunes no surrender he stuck one of the tapes in his pocket they did some more searching of billy cunninghams room but came up with little excepting a recent letter from his mother there was no address on the letter but it bore a glasgow postmark and millie recalled billy saying something about coming from hillhead well theyd let glasgow deal with it let glasgow break the news to some unsuspecting family in one of the drawers siobhan clarke came up with a fringe programme it contained the usual meltdown of abigails partys and krapps last tapes revues called things like teenage alsatian orgy and comic turns on the run from london fatigue hes ringed a show said clarke so he had a country and western act at the crazy hose saloon the act had appeared for three nights back at the start of the festival theres no country music in his collection clarke commented at least he showed taste said rebus on the way back to the station he pushed the orange tape into his cars antiquated machine the tape played slow which added to the grimness rebus had heard stuff like it before but not for a wee while songs about king billy and the apprentice boys the battle of the boyne and the glory of songs about routing the catholics and why the men of ulster would struggle to the end the singer had a pub vibrato and little else and was backed by accordion snare and the occasional flute only an orange marching band could make the flute sound martial to the ears well an orange marching band or lain anderson from jethro tull rebus was reminded that he hadnt listened to tull in an age anything would be better than these songs of the word hate sprang to mind but he dismissed it there was no vitriol in the lyrics just a stern refusal to compromise in any way to give ground to accept that things could change now that the s had become the s it was all blinkered and backward looking how narrow a view could you get the sod is said siobhan clarke you find yourself humming the tunes after aye said rebus bigotrys catchy enough all right and he whistled jethro tull all the way back to st leonards lauderdale had arranged a press conference and wanted to know what rebus knew im not positive was the answer not a hundred per cent how close ninety ninetyfive lauderdale considered this so should i say anything thats up to you sir a fingerprint teams on its way to the flat well know soon enough one way or the other one of the problems with the victim was that the last killing shot had blown away half his face the bullet entering through the back of the neck and tearing up through the jaw as dr curt had explained they could do an id covering up the bottom half of the face allowing a friend or relative to see just the top half but would that be enough before todays potential break theyd been forced to consider dental work the victims teeth were the usual result of a scottish childhood eroded by sweets and shored up by dentistry but as the forensic pathologist had said the mouth was badly damaged and what dental work remained was fairly routine there was nothing unusual there for any dentist to spot definitively as his or her work rebus arranged for the party photograph to be reprinted and sent to glasgow with the relevant details then he went to lauderdales press conference chief inspector lauderdale loved his duels with the media but today he was more nervous than usual perhaps it was that he had a larger audience than he was used to chief superintendent watson and dci kilpatrick having emerged from somewhere to listen both sported faces too ruddy to be natural whisky certainly the cause while the journalists sat towards the front of the room the police officers stood to the back kilpatrick saw rebus and sidled over to him you may have a positive id he whispered maybe so is it drugs or the ira there was a wry smile on his face he didnt really expect an answer it was the whisky asking that was all but rebus had an answer for him anyway if its anybody he said its not the ira but the other lot there were so many names for them he didnt even begin to list them uda uvf uff ur the u stood for ulster in each case they were proscribed organisations and they were all protestant kilpatrick rocked back a little on his heels his face was full of questions fighting their way to the surface past the burst blood vessels which cherried nose and cheeks a drinkers face rebus had seen too many of them including his own some nights in the bathroom mirror but kilpatrick wasnt so far gone he knew he was in no condition to ask questions so he made his way back to the farmer instead where he spoke a few words farmer watson glanced across to rebus then nodded to kilpatrick then they turned their attention back to the press briefing rebus knew the reporters they were old hands mostly and knew what to expect from chief inspector lauderdale you might walk into a lauderdale session sniffing and baying like a bloodhound but you shuffled out like a sleepy faced pup so they stayed quiet mostly and let him have his insubstantial say except for mairie henderson she was down at the front asking questions the others werent bothering to ask werent bothering for the simple reason that they knew the answer the chief inspector would give no comment he told mairie for about the twentieth time she gave up and slumped in her chair someone else asked a question so she looked around surveying the room rebus jerked his chin in greeting mairie glared and stuck her tongue out at him a few of the other journalists looked around in his direction rebus smiled out their inquisitive stares the briefing over mairie caught up with him in the corridor she was carrying a legal notepad her usual blue fineliner pen and a recording walkman thanks for your help the other night she said no comment she knew it was a waste of time getting angry at john rebus so exhaled noisily instead i was first on the scene i could have had a scoop come to the pub with me and you can have as many scoops as you like that ones so weak its got holes in its knees she turned and walked off rebus watching her he never liked to pass up the opportunity of looking at her legs edinburgh city mortuary was sited on the cowgate at the bottom of high school wynd and facing st anns community centre and blackfriars street the building was lowbuilt red brick and pebbledash purposely anonymous and tucked in an out of the way place steep sloping roads led up towards the high street for a long time now the cowgate had been a thoroughfare for traffic not pedestrians it was narrow and deep like a canyon its pavements offering scant shelter from the taxis and cars rumbling past the place was not for the fainthearted societys underclass could be found there when it wasnt yet time to shuffle back to the hostel but the street was undergoing redevelopment including a court annexe first theyd cleaned up the grassmarket and now the city fathers had the cowgate in their sights rebus waited outside the mortuary for a couple of minutes until a woman poked her head out of the door inspector rebus thats right he told me to tell you hes already gone to bannermans thanks rebus headed off towards the pub bannermans had been just cellarage at one time and hadnt been altered much since its vaulted rooms were unnervingly like those of the shops in mary kings close cellars like these formed connecting burrows beneath the old town worming from the lawnmarket down to the canongate and beyond the bar wasnt busy yet and curt was sitting by the window his beer glass resting on a barrel which served as table somehow hed found one of the few comfortable chairs in the place it looked like a minor noblemans perch with armrests and high back rebus bought a double whisky for himself dragged over a stool and sat down your health john and yours so what can i do for you even in a pub rebus would swear he could smell soap and surgical alcohol wafting up from curts hands he took a swallow of whisky curt frowned looks like i might be examining your liver sooner than id hoped rebus nodded towards the pack of cigarettes on the table they were curts and they were untipped not if you keep smoking those dr curt smiled he hadnt long taken up smoking having decided to see just how indestructible he was he wouldnt call it a death wish exactly it was merely an exercise in mortality how long have you and ms rattray been an item then curt laughed dear god is that why im here you want to ask me about caroline just making conversation shes not bad though oh shes quite something curt lit a cigarette and inhaled nodding to himself quite something he repeated through a cloud of smoke we may have a name for the victim in mary kings close its up to fingerprints now is that why you wanted to see me not just to discuss carol i want to talk about guns im no expert on guns good im not after an expert im after someone i can talk to have you seen the ballistics report curt shook his head were looking at something like a smith and wesson model going by the rifling marks five grooves righthand twist its a revolver takes six rounds of nine millimetre parabellum youve lost me already probably the version with the threeinch rather than fourinch barrel which means a weight of thirtytwo ounces rebus sipped his drink there were whisky fumes in his nostrils now blocking any other smells revolvers dont accept silencers ah curt nodded i begin to see some light a confined space like that shaped the way it was rebus nodded past the bar to the room beyond much the same size and shape as this it would have been loud bloody loud deafening you might say meaning what exactly rebus shrugged im just wondering how professional all of this really was i mean on the surface if you look at the style of execution then yes it was a pro job no question but then things start to niggle curt considered so what now do we scour the city for recent purchasers of hearingaids rebus smiled its a thought all i can tell you john is that those bullets did damage whether meant to or not they were messy now weve both come up against messy killers before usually the facts of the mess make it easier to find them but this time there doesnt seem to be much evidence left lying around apart from the bullets i know curt slapped his hand on the barrel tell you what ive got a suggestion what is it he leaned forward as if to impart a secret let me give you caroline rattrays phone number bugger off said rebus that evening a marked patrol car picked him up from patiences oxford terrace flat the driver was a detective constable called robert burns and burns was doing rebus a favour i appreciate it said rebus though burns was attached to c division in the west end hed been born and raised in pilmuir and still had friends and enemies there he was a known quantity in the garb which was what mattered to rebus i was born in one of the prefabs burns explained before they levelled them to make way for the highrises the highrises were supposed to more civilised if you can believe that bloody architects and town planners you never find one admitting he made a mistake do you he smiled theyre a bit like us that way by us do you mean the police or the wee frees burns was more than just a member of the free church of scotland on sunday afternoons he took his religion to the foot of the mound where he spouted hellfire and brimstone to anyone whod listen rebus had listened a few times but burns took a break during the festival as hed pointed out even his voice would be fighting a losing battle against steel bands and untuned guitars they were turning into the garb passing the gable end again with its sinister greeting drop me as close as you can eh sure said burns and when they came to the dead end near the garages he slowed only fractionally as he bumped the car up first onto the pavement and then onto the grass its not my car he explained they drove beside the path past the garages and a highrise until there was nowhere else to go when burns stopped the car was resting about twelve feet from the community centre i can walk from here said rebus kids whod been lying on the centres roof were standing now watching them cigarettes hanging from open mouths people watched from the path and from open windows too burns turned to rebus dont tell me you wanted to sneak up on them this is just fine he opened his door stay with the car i dont want us losing any tyres rebus walked towards the community centres wide open doors the teenagers on the roof watched him with practised hostility there were paper planes lying all around some of them made airborne again temporarily by a gust of wind as rebus walked into the building he heard grunting noises above him his rooftop audience were pretending to be pigs there was no preliminary chamber just the hall itself at one end stood a high basketball hoop some teenagers were in a ruck around the grounded ball feet scraping at ankles hands pulling at arms and hair so much for noncontact sports on a makeshift stage sat a ghetto blaster blaring out the fashion in heavy metal rebus didnt reckon hed score many points by announcing that hed been in at the birth most of these kids had been born after anarchy in the uk never mind communication breakdown there was a mix of ages and it was impossible to pick out peter cave he could be nodding his head to the distorted electric guitar he could be smoking by the wall or in with the basketball brigade but no he was coming towards rebus from the other direction from a tight group which included black tshirt from rebuss first visit can i help father leary had said he was in his midtwenties but he could pass for lateteens the clothes helped and he wore them well rebus had seen church people before when they wore denim they usually looked as if theyd be more comfortable in something less comfortable but cave in faded denim jeans and denim shirt with half a dozen thin leather and metal bracelets around his wrists he looked all right not many girls rebus stated playing for a little more time peter cave looked around not just now usually there are more than this but on a nice night it was a nice night hed left patience drinking cold rose wine in the garden he had left her reluctantly he got no initial bad feelings from cave the young man was fresh faced and cleareyed and looked level headed too his hair was long but by no means untidy and his face was square and honest with a deep cleft in the chin im sorry cave said im peter cave i run the youth club his hand shot out bracelets sliding down his wrist rebus took the hand and smiled cave wanted to know who he was a not unreasonable request detective inspector rebus cave nodded davey said a policeman had been round earlier i thought probably he meant uniformed whats the trouble inspector no trouble mr cave a circle of frowning onlookers had formed itself around the two of them rebus wasnt worried not yet call me peter mr cave rebus licked his lips how are things going here what do you mean a simple question sir only crime in pilmuir hasnt exactly dropped since you started this place up cave bristled at that there havent been any gang fights rebus accepted this but housebreaking assaults there are still syringes in the playpark and aerosols lying aerosols to you too rebus turned to see who had entered it was the boy with the naked chest and denim jacket hello davey said rebus the ring had broken long enough to let denim jacket through the youth pointed a finger i thought i said you didnt want to know my name i cant help it if people tell me things davey davey soutar burns added he was standing in the doorway arms folded looking like he was enjoying himself he wasnt of course it was just a necessary pose davey soutar rebus echoed soutar had clenched his fists peter cave attempted to intercede now please is there a problem here inspector you tell me mr cave he looked around him frankly were a little bit concerned about this gang hut colour flooded caves cheeks its a youth centre rebus was now studying the ceiling nobody was playing basketball any more the music had been turned right down if you say so sir look you come barging in here i dont recall barging mr cave more of a saunter i didnt ask for trouble if davey here can be persuaded to unclench his fists maybe you and me can have a quiet chat outside he looked at the circle around them im not one for playing to the cheap seats cave stared at rebus then at soutar he nodded slowly his face drained of anger and eventually soutar let his hands relax you could tell it was an effort burns hadnt put in an appearance for nothing there now said rebus come on mr cave lets you and me go for a walk they walked across the playing fields burns had returned to the patrol car and moved it to a spot where he could watch them some teenagers watched from the back of the community centre and from its roof but they didnt venture any closer than that i really dont see inspector you think youre doing a good job here sir cave thought about it before answering yes i do you think the experiment is a success a limited success so far but yes once again he had his hands behind his back head bowed a little he looked like he didnt have a care in the world no regrets none funny then what your church doesnt seem so sure cave stopped in his tracks is that what this is about youre in conors congregation is that it hes sent you here to whats the phrase come down heavy on me nothing like that hes paranoid he was the one who wanted me here now suddenly hes decided i should leave ipso facto i must leave hes used to getting his way after all well i dont choose to leave i like it fine here is that what hes afraid of well theres not much he can do about it is there and as far as i can see inspector theres nothing you can do about it either unless someone from the club is found breaking the law caves face had reddened his hands coming from behind his back so he could gesture with them that lot break the law every day now just a no listen for a minute okay you got the jaffas and the tims together but ask yourself why they were amenable if theyre not divided theyre united and theyre united for a reason theyre the same as before only stronger you must see that i see nothing of the sort people can change inspector rebus had been hearing the line all his professional life he sighed and toed the ground you dont believe that frankly sir not in this particular case and the crime stats back me up what youve got just now is a truce of sorts and it suits them because while theres a truce they can get busy carving up territory between them anyone threatens them they can retaliate in spades or even with spades but it wont last and when they split back into their separate gangs theres going to be blood spilled no way round it because now therell be more at stake tell me in your club tonight how many catholics were there cave didnt answer he was too busy shaking his head i feel sorry for you really i do i can smell cynicism off you like sulphur i dont happen to believe anything youve just said then youre every bit as naive as i am cynical and that means theyre just using you which is good because the only way of looking at this is that youve been sucked into it and you accept it knowing the truth caves cheeks were red again how dare you say that and he punched rebus in the stomach hard rebus had been punched by professionals but he was unprepared and felt himself double over for a moment getting his wind back there was a burning feeling in his gut and it wasnt whisky he could hear cheering in the distance tiny figures were dancing up and down on the community centre roof rebus hoped theyd fall through it he straightened up again is that what you call setting a good example mr cave then he punched cave solidly on the jaw the young man stumbled backwards and almost fell he heard a double roar from the community centre the youth of the garb were clambering down from the roof starting to run in his direction burns had started the car and was bumping it across the football pitch towards him the car was outpacing the crowd but only just an empty can bounced off its rear windscreen burns barely braked as he caught up with rebus rebus yanked the door open and got in grazing a knee and an elbow then they were off again making for the roadway well burns commented checking the rearview that seemed to go off okay rebus was catching his breath and examining his elbow how did you know davey soutars name hes a maniac burns said simply i try to keep abreast of these things rebus exhaled loudly rolling his sleeve back down never do a favour for a priest he said to himself ill bear that in mind sir said burns rebus walked into the murder room next morning with a cup of delicatessen decaf and a tuna sandwich on wholemeal he sat at his desk and peeled off the top from the styrofoam cup from the corner of his eye he could see the fresh mound of paperwork which had appeared on his desk since yesterday but he could ignore it for another five minutes the victims fingerprints had been matched with those taken from items in billy cunninghams room so now they had a name for the body but precious little else murdock and millie had been interviewed and the post office were looking up their personnel files today billys room would be searched again they still didnt know who he was really they still didnt know anything about where he came from or who his parents were there was so much they didnt know in a murder investigation rebus had found you didnt always need to know everything chief inspector lauderdale was standing behind him rebus knew this because lauderdale brought a smell with him not everyone could distinguish it but rebus could it was as if talcum powder had been used in a bathroom to cover some less acceptable aroma then there was a click and the buzz of lauderdales batteryshaver rebus straightened at the sound chief wants to see you lauderdale said breakfast can wait rebus stared at his sandwich i said it can wait rebus nodded ill bring you back a mug of coffee shall i sir he took his own coffee with him sipping it as he listened for a moment at farmer watsons door there were voices inside one of them more nasal than the other rebus knocked and entered dci kilpatrick was sitting across the desk from the farmer morning john said the chief super coffee rebus raised his cup got some sir well sit down he sat next to kilpatrick morning sir good morning john kilpatrick was nursing a mug but he wasnt drinking the farmer meantime was pouring himself a refill from his personal machine right john he said at last sitting down bottom line youre being seconded to dci kilpatricks section watson took a gulp of coffee swilling it around his mouth rebus looked to kilpatrick who obliged with a confirmation youll be based with us at fettes but youre going to be our eyes and ears on this murder inquiry liaison if you like so youll still spend most of your time here at st leonards but why well inspector this case might concern the crime squad yes sir but why me in particular youve been in the army i notice you served in ulster in the late s that was quarter of a century ago rebus protested an age spent forgetting all about it nevertheless youll agree there seem to be paramilitary aspects to this case as you commented the gun is not your everyday holdup weapon its a type of revolver used by terrorists a lot of guns have been corning into the uk recently maybe this murder will connect us to them wait a second youre saying youre not interested in the shooting youre interested in the gun i think it will become clearer when i show you our operation at fettes ill be through here in he looked at his watch say twenty minutes that should give you time to say goodbye to your loved ones he smiled rebus nodded he hadnt touched his coffee a cooling scum had formed on its surface all right sir he said getting to his feet he was still a little dazed when he got back to the murder room two detectives were being told a joke by a third the joke was about a squid with no money a restaurant bill and the guy from the kitchen who washed up the guy from the kitchen was called hans rebus was joining the scs the bastard brigade as some called it he sat at his desk it took him a minute to work out that something was missing which bollocks of yous eaten my sandwich as he looked around the room he saw that the joke had come to an untimely end but no one was paying attention to him a message was being passed through the place changing the mood lauderdale came over to rebuss desk he was holding a sheet of fax paper what is it rebus asked glasgow have tracked down billy cunninghams mother good is she coming here lauderdale nodded distractedly shell be here for the formal id no father the father and mother split up a long time ago billy was still an infant she told us his name though he handed over the fax sheet its morris cafferty what rebuss hunger left him morris gerald cafferty rebus read the fax sheet say it aint so its just glasgow having a joke but lauderdale was shaking his head no joke he said big ger cafferty was in prison had been for several months would be for many years to come he was a dangerous man runner of protection rackets extortioner murderer theyd pinned only two counts of murder on him but there had been others rebus knew there had been others you think someone was sending him a message he asked lauderdale shrugged this changes the case slightly certainly according to mrs cunningham cafferty kept tabs on billy all the time he was growing up made sure he didnt want for anything she still gets money from time to time but did billy know who his father was not according to mrs cunningham then would anyone else have known lauderdale shrugged again i wonder wholl tell cafferty they better do it by phone i wouldnt want to be in the same room with him lucky my good suits in my locker said lauderdale therell have to be another press conference best tell the chief super first though eh lauderdales eyes cleared of course he lifted rebuss receiver to make the call what did he want with you by the way nothing much said rebus he meant it too now but maybe this changes things he persisted to kilpatrick in the car they were seated in the back a driver taking them the slow route to fettes he was sticking to the main roads instead of the alleys and shortcuts and fast stretches unpoliced by traffic lights that rebus would have used maybe said kilpatrick well see rebus had been telling kilpatrick all about big ger cafferty i mean he went on if its a gang thing then its nothing to do with paramilitaries is it so i cant help you kilpatrick smiled at him what is it john most coppers i know would give their drinking arm for an assignment with scs yes sir but youre not one of them im quite attached to my drinking arm it comes in handy for other things rebus looked out of the window the thing is ive been on secondment before and i didnt like it much you mean london the chief superintendent told me all about it i doubt that sir rebus said quietly they turned off queensferry road not a minutes walk from patiences flat humour me said kilpatrick stiffly after all it sounds like youre an expert on this man cafferty too id be daft not to use a man like you yes sir and they left it at that saying nothing as they turned into fettes edinburghs police hq at the end of the long road you got a good view of the gothic spires of fettes school one of the citys most exclusive rebus didnt know which was uglier the ornate school or the low anonymous building which housed police hq it could have been a comprehensive school not so much a piece of design as a lack of it it was one of the most unimaginative buildings rebus had ever come across maybe it was making a statement about its purpose the scottish crime squads edinburgh operation was run from a cramped office on the fifth floor a floor shared with the citys scene of crime unit one floor above worked the forensic scientists and the police photographers there was a lot of interaction between the two floors the crime squads real hq was stuart street in glasgow with other branches in stonehaven and dunfermline the latter being a technical support unit eightytwo officers in total plus a dozen or so civilian staff weve got our own surveillance and drugs teams kilpatrick added we recruit from all eight scottish forces he kept his spiel going as he led rebus through the scs office a few people looked up from their work but by no means all of them two who did were a bald man and his frecklefaced neighbour their look wasnt welcoming just interested rebus and kilpatrick were approaching a very large man who was standing in front of a wallmap the map showed the british isles and the north european mainland stretching east as far as russia some sea routes had been marked with long narrow strips of red material like something youd use in dressmaking only the big man didnt look the type for crimpingshears and tissuepaper cutouts on the map the ports had been circled in black pen one of the routes ended on the scottish east coast the man hadnt turned round at their approach inspector john rebus said kilpatrick this is inspector ken smylie he never smiles so dont bother joking with him about his name he doesnt say much but hes always thinking and hes from fife so watch out you know what they say about fifers im from fife myself said rebus smylie had turned round to grip rebuss hand he was probably six feet three or four and had the bulk to make the height work the bulk was a mixture of muscle and fat but mostly muscle rebus would bet the guy worked out every day he was a few years younger than rebus with short thick fair hair and a small dark moustache youd take him for a farm labourer maybe even a farmer in the borders hed definitely have played rugby ken kilpatrick said to smylie id like you to show john around hes going to be joining us temporarily hes exarmy served in ulster kilpatrick winked a good man ken smylie looked appraisingly at rebus who tried to stand up straight inflating his chest he didnt know why he wanted to impress smylie except that he didnt want him as an enemy smylie nodded slowly sharing a look with kilpatrick a look rebus didnt understand kilpatrick touched smylies arm ill leave you to it he turned and called to another officer jim any calls then he walked away from them rebus turned to the map ferry crossings there isnt a ferry sails from the east coast they go to scandinavia this one doesnt he had a point rebus decided to try again boats then boats yes we think boats rebus had expected the voice to be basso profondo but it was curiously high as though it hadnt broken properly in smylies teens maybe it was the reason he didnt say much youre interested in boats then only if theyre bringing in contraband rebus nodded guns maybe guns he pointed to some of the east european ports see these days things being what they are there are a lot of weapons in and around russia if you cut back your military you get excess and the economic situation there being what it is you get people who need money so they steal guns and sell them if they need to steal them a lot of the soldiers kept their guns plus they picked up souvenirs along the way stuff from afghanistan and wherever here sit down they sat at smylies desk smylie himself spilling from a moulded plastic chair he brought some photographs out of a drawer they showed machine guns rocket launchers grenades and missiles armourpiercing shells a whole dusty armoury this is just some of the stuff thats been tracked down most of it in mainland europe holland germany france but some of it in northern ireland of course and some in england and scotland he tapped a photo of an assault rifle this ak was used in a bank holdup in hillhead you know professor kalashnikov is a travelling salesman these days times are hard so he goes to arms fairs around the world flogging his creations like this smylie picked out another photograph later model the ak the magazines made of plastic this is actually the still quite rare on the market a lot of the stuff travels across europe courtesy of motorcycle gangs hells angels smylie nodded some of them are in this up to their tattooed necks and making a fortune but there are other problems a lot of stuff comes into the uk direct the armed forces they bring back souvenirs too from the falklands or kuwait kalashnikovs you name it not everyone gets searched a lot of stuff gets in later its either sold or stolen and the owners arent about to report the theft are they smylie paused and swallowed maybe realising how much hed been talking i thought you were the strong silent type rebus said i get carried away sometimes rebus wouldnt fancy being on stretcher detail smylie began to tidy up the photographs thats basically it he said the material thats already here we cant do much about but with the help of interpol were trying to stop the trafficking youre not saying scotland is a target for this stuff a conduit thats all it comes through here on its way to northern ireland the ira to whoever has the money to pay for it right now we think its more a protestant thing we just dont know why how much evidence do you have not enough rebus was thinking kilpatrick had kept very quiet but all along hed thought there was a paramilitary angle to the murder because it tied in with all of this youre the one who spotted the sixpack smylie asked rebus nodded you might well be right about it if so the victim mustve been involved or just someone who got caught up in it that tends not to happen but theres another thing the victims father is a local gangster big ger cafferty you put him away a while back youre well informed well said smylie cafferty adds a certain symmetry doesnt he he rose briskly from his chair come on ill give you the rest of the tour not that there was much to see but rebus was introduced to his colleagues they didnt look like supermen but you wouldnt want to fight them on their terms they all looked like theyd gone the distance and beyond one man a ds claverhouse was the exception he was lanky and slowmoving and had dark cusps beneath his eyes dont let him fool you smylie said we dont call him bloody claverhouse for nothing claverhouses smile took time forming it wasnt that he was slow so much as that he had to calculate things before he carried them out he was seated at his desk rebus and smylie standing in front of him he was tapping his fingers on a red cardboard file the file was closed but on its cover was printed the single word shield rebus had just seen the word on another file lying on smylies desk shield he asked the shield claverhouse corrected its something we keep hearing about maybe a gang maybe with irish connections but just now interrupted smylie all it is is a name shield the word meant something to rebus or rather he knew it should mean something to him as he turned from claverhouses desk he caught something claverhouse was saying to smylie saying in an undertone we dont need him rebus didnt let on hed heard he knew nobody liked it when an outsider was brought in nor did he feel any happier when introduced to the bald man a ds blackwood and the freckled one dc ormiston they were as enthusiastic about him as dogs welcoming a new flea to the area rebus didnt linger there was a small empty desk waiting from him in another part of the room and a chair which had been found in some cupboard the chair didnt quite have three legs but rebus got the idea they hadnt exactly stretched themselves to provide him with a wholesome working environment he took one look at desk and chair made his excuses and left he took a few deep breaths in the corridor then descended a few floors he had one friend at fettes and saw no reason why he shouldnt visit her but there was someone else in di gill templers office the nameplate on the door told him so her name was di murchie and she too was a liaison officer rebus knocked on the door enter it was like entering a headmistresss office di murchie was young at least her face was but she had made determined efforts to negate this fact yes she said i was looking for di templer murchie put down her pen and slipped off her halfmoon glasses they hung by a string around her neck shes moved on she said dunfermline i think dunfermline whats she doing there dealing with rapes and sexual assaults so far as i know do you have some business with inspector templer no i just i was passing and never mind he backed out of the room di murchie twitched her mouth and put her glasses back on rebus went back upstairs feeling worse than ever he spent the rest of the morning waiting for something to happen nothing did everyone kept their distance even smylie and then the phone rang on smylies desk and it was a call for him chief inspector lauderdale smylie said handing over the receiver hello i hear youve been poached from us sort of sir well tell them i want to poach you back im not a fucking salmon thought rebus im still on the investigation sir he said yes i know that the chief super told me all about it he paused we want you to talk to cafferty he wont talk to me we think he might does he know about billy yes he knows and now he wants someone he can use as a punchbag lauderdale didnt say anything to this what good will it do talking to him im not sure then why bother because hes insisting he wants to talk to cid and not just any officer will do hes asked to speak to you there was silence between them john anything to say yes sir this has been a very strange day he checked his watch and its not even one oclock yet big ger cafferty was looking good he was fit and lean and had purpose to his gait a white tshirt was tight across his chest flat over the stomach and he wore faded work denims and newlooking tennis shoes he walked into the visiting room like he was the visitor rebus the inmate the warder beside him was no more than a hired flunkey to be dismissed at any moment cafferty gripped rebuss hand just a bit too hard but he wasnt going to try tearing it off not yet strawman hello cafferty they sat down at opposite sides of the plastic table the legs of which had been bolted to the floor otherwise there was little to show that they were in barlinnie jail a prison with a tough reputation from way back but one which had striven to remake itself the visiting room was clean and white a few public safety posters decorating its walls there was a flimsy aluminium ashtray but also a no smoking sign the tabletop bore a few burn marks around its rim from cigarettes resting there too long they made you come then strawman cafferty seemed amused by rebuss appearance he knew too that as long as he kept using his nickname for rebus rebus would be needled im sorry about your son cafferty was no longer amused is it true they tortured him sort of sort of caffertys voice rose theres no halfway house with torture youd know all about that caffertys eyes blazed his breathing was shallow and noisy he got to his feet i cant complain about this place you get a lot of freedom these days ive found you can buy freedom same as you can buy anything else he stopped beside the warder isnt that right mr petrie wisely petrie said nothing wait for me outside cafferty ordered rebus watched petrie leave cafferty looked at him and grinned a humourless grin cosy he said just the two of us he started to rub his stomach what do you want caferty stomachs started giving me gyp whats my point strawman my points this he was standing over rebus and now leant down his hands pressing rebuss shoulders i want the bastard found rebus found himself staring at caffertys bared teeth see i cant have people fucking with my family its bad for my reputation nobody gets away with something like that itd be bad for business nice to see the paternal instincts so song cafferty ignored this my men are out there hunting understood and theyll be keeping an eye on you i want a result strawman rebus shrugged off caffertys pressure and got to his feet you think were going to sit on our hands because the victim was your son you better not thats what im saying revenge strawman ill have it one way or the other ill have it on somebody not on me rebus said quietly he held caffertys stare till cafferty opened his arms wide and shrugged then went to his chair and sat down rebus stayed standing i need to ask you a few questions he said fire away did you keep in touch with your son cafferty shook his head i kept in touch with his mum shes a good woman too good for me always was i send her money for billy at least i did while he was growing up i still send something from time to time by what means someone i can trust did billy know who his father was absolutely not his mum wasnt exactly proud of me he started rubbing his stomach again you should take something for that rebus said so could anyone have got to him as a way of getting at you cafferty nodded ive thought about it strawman ive thought a lot about it now he shook his head i cant see it i mean it was my first thought but nobody knew nobody except his mum and me and the intermediary he didnt have anything to do with it ive had people ask him the way cafferty said this sent a shiver through rebus two more things he said the word nemo mean anything cafferty shook his head but rebus knew that by tonight villains across the east of scotland would be on the watch for the name maybe caffertys men would get to the killer first rebus had seen the body he didnt much care who got the killer so long as someone did he guessed this was caffertys thinking too second thing he said the letters sas on a tattoo cafferty shook his head again but more slowly this time there was something there some recognition what is it cafferty but cafferty wasnt saying what about gangs was he in any gangs he wasnt the type he had the red hand of ulster on his bedroom wall ive got a pirelli calendar on mine doesnt mean i use their tyres rebus walked towards the door not much fun being a victim is it cafferty jumped to his feet remember he said ill be watching cafferty if one of your goons so much as asks me the time of day ill throw him in a cell you threw me in a cell strawman where did it get you unable to bear caffertys smile the smile of a man who had drowned people in pigshit and shot them in cold blood a cold devious manipulator a man without morals or remorse unable finally to bear any of this rebus left the room the prison officer petrie was standing outside shuffling his feet his eyes couldnt meet rebuss youre an absolute disgrace rebus told him walking away while he was in glasgow rebus could have talked to the boys mother only the boys mother was in edinburgh giving an official id to the top half of her dead sons face dr curt would be sure she never saw the bottom half as hed said to rebus if billy had been a ventriloquists dummy hed never have worked again youre a sick man doctor john rebus had said he drove back to edinburgh weary and trembling cafferty had that effect on him hed never thought hed have to see the man again at least not until both of them were of pensionable age cafferty had sent him a postcard the day hed arrived in barlinnie but siobhan clarke had intercepted it and asked if he wanted to see it tear it up rebus had told her he still didnt know what the message had been siobhan clarke was still in the murder room when he got back youre working hard he told her its a wonderful thing overtime besides were a bit short of hands youve heard then yes congratulations what scs its like a lateral promotion isnt it its only temporary like a run of good games to hibs wheres brian out at cunninghams digs talking to murdock and millie again was mrs cunningham up to questioning just barely who talked to her i did the chief inspectors idea then for once lauderdales had a good idea did you ask her about religion you mean all that orange stuff in billys room yes i asked she just shrugged like it was nothing special it is nothing special there are hundreds of people with the same flag the same musictapes christ ive seen them and this was the truth hed seen them at close quarters not just as a kid hearing the sash sung by drunks on their way home but more recently hed been visiting his brother in fife just over a month ago the weekend before july th thered been an orange march in cowdenbeath the pub they were in seemed to be hosting a crowd of the marchers in the dance hall upstairs sounds of drums especially the huge drum they called the lambeg and flutes and penny whistles bad choruses repeated time and again theyd gone upstairs to investigate just as the thing was winding down god save the queen was being destroyed on a dozen cheap flutes and some of the kids singing along sweaty brows and shirts open some of them had their arms raised hands straight out in front of them a nazistyle salute nothing else he asked clarke shook her head she didnt know about the tattoo she thinks he must have done it in the last year or so well thats interesting in itself it means were not dealing with some ancient gang or old flame sas was something recent in his life what about nemo it didnt mean anything to her ive just been talking to cafferty sas meant something to him lets pull his records see if they tell us anything now we can make a start by the way remember that card he sent me clarke nodded what was on it it was a picture of a pig in its sty and the message there wasnt any message she said on the way back to patiences he dropped into the video store and rented a couple of movies it was the only video store nearby that he hadnt turned over at one time or another with vice or trading standards looking for porn and splatter and various bootleg tapes the owner was a middleaged fatherly type happy to tell you that some comedy was particularly good or some adventure film might prove a bit strong for the ladies he hadnt commented on rebuss selections terminator and all about eve but patience had a comment great she said meaning the opposite whats wrong you hate old movies and i hate violence rebus looked at the schwarzenegger its not even an and who says i dont like old films whats your favourite black and white movie there are hundreds of them name me five no three and dont say im not fair he stared at her they were standing a few feet apart in the living room rebus with the videos still in his hands patience with her arms folded her back erect he knew she could probably smell the whisky on his breath even keeping his mouth shut and breathing through his nose it was so quiet he could hear the cat washing itself somewhere behind the sofa what are we fighting about he asked she was ready for this were fighting about consideration as usual to wit your lack of any ben hur colour well that courtroom one then with james stewart she nodded and that other one with orson welles and the mandolin it was a zither shite said john rebus throwing down the videos and making for the front door millie docherty waited until murdock had been asleep for a good hour she spent the hour thinking about the questions the police had asked both of them and thinking further back to good days and bad days in her life she spoke murdocks name his breathing remained regular only then did she slip out of bed and walk barefoot to billys bedroom door touching the door with her fingertips christ to think he wasnt there would never be there again she tried to control her breathing fast in slow out otherwise she might hyperventilate panic attacks they called them for years shed suffered them not knowing she was not alone there were lots of people out there like her billy had been one of them she turned the doorknob and slipper into his room his mother had been round earlier on hardly in a state to cope with any of it there had been a policewoman with her the same one whod come to the flat that first time billys mum had looked at his room but then shook her head i cant do this another time if you like millie had offered i can bag everything up for you all youd have to do is have his things collected the policewoman had nodded her gratitude at that well it was the least she felt the tears coming and sat down on his narrow bed funny how a bed so narrow could be made wide enough for two if the two were close she did the breathing exercises again fast in slow out but those words her instructions to herself reminded her of other things other times fast in slow out ive got this selfhelp book billy had said its in my room hed gone to find it for her and shed followed him into his room such a tidy room here it is hed said turning towards her quickly not realising how close behind him she was whats all this red hand stuff shed asked looking past him at his walls hed waited till her eyes returned to his then hed kissed her tongue rubbing at her teeth till she opened her mouth to him billy she said now her hands filling themselves with his bedcover she stayed that way for a few minutes part of her mind staying alert listening for sounds from the room she shared with murdock then she moved across the bed to where the hearts pennant was pinned to the wall she pushed it aside with a finger underneath taped flat against the wall was a computer disk shed left it here half hoping the police would find it when they searched the room but theyd been hopeless and watching them search shed become suddenly afraid for herself and had started to hope they wouldnt find it now she got her fingernails under it and unpeeled it looking at the disk well it was hers now wasnt it they might kill her for it but she could never let it go it was part of her memory of him she rubbed her thumb across the label the streetlight coming through the unwashed window wasnt quite enough for her to read by but she knew what the label said anyway it was just those three letters sas dark dark dark rebus recalled that line at least if patience had asked him to quote from a poem instead of giving her movie titles hed have been all right he was standing at a window of st leonards taking a break from his deskful of work all the paperwork on morris gerald cafferty dark dark dark she was trying to civilise him not that shed admit it what she said instead was that it would be nice if they liked the same things it would give them things to talk about so she gave him books of poetry and played classical music at him bought them tickets for ballet and modern dance rebus had been there before other times other women asking for something more for commitment beyond the commitment he didnt like it he enjoyed the basic the feral cafferty had once accused him of liking cruelty of being attracted to it his natural right as a celt and hadnt rebus accused peter cave of the same thing it was coming back to him pain on pain crawling back along his tubes from some place deep within him his time in northern ireland hed been there early in the history of the troubles just as it was all boiling over so early that he hadnt really known what was going on what the score was none of them had not on any side the people were pleased to see them at first catholic and protestant offering food and drink and a genuine welcome then later the drinks were laced with weedkiller and the welcome might be leading you into a honey trap the crunching in the sponge cake might only be hard seeds from the raspberry jam then again it might be powdered glass bottles flying through the dark lit by an arc of flame petrol spinning and dripping from the rag wick and when it fell on a littered road it spread in an instant pool of hate nothing personal about it it was just for a cause a troubled cause that was all and later still it was to defend the rackets which had grown up around that aged cause the protection schemes black taxis gunrunning all the businesses which had spread so very far away from the ideal creating their own pool hed seen bullet wounds and shrapnel blasts and gashes left by hurled bricks hed tasted mortality and the flaws in both his character and his body when not on duty they used to hang around the barracks knocking back whisky and playing cards maybe that was why whisky reminded him he was still alive where other drinks couldnt there was shame too a retaliatory strike against a drinking club which had gotten out of hand hed done nothing to stop it hed swung his baton and even his slr with the rest of them yet in the middle of the commotion the sound of a rifle being cocked was enough to bring silence and stillness he still kept an interest in events across the water part of his life had been left behind there something about his tour of duty there had made him apply to join the special air service he went back to his desk and lifted the glass of whisky dark dark dark the sky quiet save for the occasional drunken yell no one would ever know who called the police no one except the man himself and the police themselves hed given his name and address and had made his complaint about the noise and do you want us to come and see you afterwards sir after weve investigated that wont be necessary the phone went dead on the desk officer who smiled it was very seldom necessary a visit from the police meant you were involved he wrote on a pad then passed the note along to the communications room the call went out at ten to one when the rover patrol car got to the community centre it was clear that things were winding down the officers debated heading off again but since they were here certainly there had been a party a function of some kind but as the two uniformed officers walked in through the open doors only a dozen or so stragglers were left the floor was a mess of bottles and cigarette butts probably a few roaches in there too if they cared to look whos in charge nobody came the sharp response there were flushing sounds from the toilets evidence being destroyed perhaps weve received complaints about the noise no noise here the patrolman nodded on a makeshift stage a ghettoblaster had been hooked up to a guitar amplifier a large marshall job with separate amp and speakerbin probably a hundred watts none of it built for subtlety the amplifier was still on emitting an audible buzz this thing belongs out at the exhibition centre simple minds let us borrow it whose is it really though wheres your search warrant the officer smiled again he could see that his partner was itching for trouble but though neither of them had a welter of experience they werent stupid either they knew where they were they knew the odds so he stood there smiling legs apart arms by his side not looking for aggro he seemed to be having a dialogue with one of the group a guy with a denim jacket and no shirt underneath he was wearing black squaretoed biker boots with straps and a round silver buckle the officer had always liked that style had even considered buying himself a pair just for the weekends then maybe hed start saving for the bike to go with them do we need a search warrant he said were called to a disturbance doors wide open no one barring our entry besides this is a community centre there are rules and regulations licences need to be applied for and granted do you have a licence for this soiree swaahray the youth said to his pals fuckin listen to that swaaahrrrayl and he came sashaying over towards the two uniforms like he was doing some oldfashioned dance step he turned behind and between them is that a dirty word something im not supposed to understand this isnt your territory you know this is the garb and were having our own wee festival since nobody bothered inviting us to the other one youre not in the real world now you better be careful the first officer could smell alcohol like something from a chemistry lab or a surgery gin vodka white rum look he said there has to be someone running the show and it isnt you why not because youre a shortarsed wee prick there was stillness in the hall the other officer had spoken and now his partner swallowed trying not to look at him keeping all his concentration on the denim jacket denim jacket was considering a finger to his lips tapping them mmm he said at last nodding interesting he started moving back towards the group he seemed to be wiggling his bum as he moved then he stooped forward pretending to tie a shoelace and let rip with a loud fart he straightened up as his gang enjoyed the joke their laughter subsiding only when denim jacket spoke again well sirs he said were just packing everything away he faked a yawn its well past our bedtimes and wed like to go home if you dont mind he opened his arms wide to them even bowed a little id like to thatll be fine the first officer touched his partners arm and turned away towards the doors they were going to get out and when they got out he was going to have words with his partner no doubt about that right then lads said denim jacket lets get this place tidy well need to put this somewhere for a start the constables were near the door when without warning the ghettoblaster caught both of them a glancing blow to the back of their skulls rebus heard about it on the morning news the radio came on at six twentyfive and there it was it brought him out of bed and into his clothes patience was still trying to rouse herself as he placed a mug of tea on the bedside table and a kiss on her hot cheek ace in the hole and casablanca he said then he was out of the door and into his car at drylaw police station the day shift hadnt come on yet which meant that he heard it from the horses mouths so to speak not a big station drylaw had requested reinforcements from all around as what had started as an assault on two officers had turned into a miniature riot cars had been attacked house windows smashed one local shop had been ramraided with consequent looting if the owner was to be believed five officers were injured including the two men who had been coshed with a hifi machine those two constables had escaped the garb by the skin of their arses it was like northern bloody ireland one veteran said or brixton thought rebus or newcastle or toxteth the tv news had it on now and police heavyhandedness was being discussed peter cave was being interviewed outside the youth club saying that his had been the partys organising hand but i had to leave early i thought i had flu coming on or something to prove it he blew his nose at breakfasttime too complained someone beside rebus i know cave went on that i bear a certain amount of responsibility for what happened thats big of him rebus smiled thinking we police invented irony we live by its rules but said cave there are still questions which need answering the police seem to think they can rule by threat rather than law ive talked to a dozen people who were in the club last night and theyve told me the same thing surprise surprise namely that the two police officers involved made threats and menacing actions the interviewer waited for cave to finish then and what do you say mr cave to local people who claim the youth club is merely a sort of hangout a gang headquarters for juveniles on the estate juveniles rebus liked that cave was shaking his head theyd brought the camera in on him for the shot i say rubbish and he blew his nose again wisely the producer switched back to the studio eventually the police had managed to make five arrests the youths had been brought to drylaw less than an hour later a mob from the garb had gathered outside demanding their release more thrown bricks more broken glass until a massed charge by the police ranks dispersed the crowd cars and foot patrols had cruised drylaw and the garb for the rest of the night there were still bricks and strewn glass on the road outside inside a few of the officers involved looked shaken rebus looked in on the five youths they sported bruised faces bandaged hands the blood had dried to a crust on them and theyd left it there like war paint like medals look one of them said to the others its the bastard who took a poke at pete keep talking retorted rebus and youll be next im quaking the police had stuck a video camera onto the rioters outside the station the picture quality was poor but after a few viewings rebus made out that one of the stone throwers face hidden by a football scarf was wearing an open denim jacket and no shirt he stuck around the station a bit longer then got back in his car and headed for the garb it didnt look so different there was glass in the road sounds of brittle crunching under his tyres but the local shops were like fortresses wire mesh metal screens padlocks alarms the wouldbe looters had run up and down the main road for a while in a hotwired ford cortina then had launched it at the least protected shop a place specialising in shoe repairs and keycutting inside the owners own brand of security a sleepyeyed alsatian had thrown itself into the fray before being beaten off and chased away as far as anyone knew it was still roaming the wide green spaces a few of the ground floor flats were having boards hammered into place across their broken windows maybe one of them had made the initial call rebus didnt blame the caller he blamed the two officers no that wasnt fair what would he have done if hed been there yes exactly and thered have been more trouble than this if he had he didnt bother stopping the car hed only be in the way of the other sightseers and the media with not much happening on the ira story reporters were here in numbers plus he knew he wasnt the garbs most popular tourist though the constables couldnt swear whod thrown the ghettoblaster they knew the most likely suspect rebus had seen the description back at drylaw it was davey soutar of course the boy who couldnt afford a shirt one of the cid men had asked rebus what his interest was personal hed said a few years back a riot like this would have prompted the permanent closure of the community hall but these days it was more likely the council would bung some more cash at the estate guilt money shutting the hall down wouldnt do much good anyway there were plenty of empty flats on the estate flats termed unlettable they were kept boarded up and padlocked but could soon be opened squatters and junkies used them gangs could use them too a couple of miles away in different directions middle class barnton and inverleith were getting ready for work a world away they only ever took notice of pilmuir when it exploded it wasnt much of a drive to fettes either even with the morning bottlenecks starting their days business he wondered if hed be first in the office that might show too willing well he could check then nip out to the canteen until everyone started arriving but when he pushed open the office door he saw that there was someone in before him it was smylie morning rebus said smylie nodded back he looked tired to rebus which was saying something the amount of sleep rebus himself had had he rested against one of the desks and folded his arms do you know an inspector called abernethy special branch said smylie thats him is he still around smylie looked up he went back yesterday caught an evening plane did you want to see him not really there was nothing here for him no smylie shook his head wed know about it if there was were the best wedve spotted it before him qed quod erat demonstrandum smylie looked at him youre thinking of nemo arent you latin for nobody i suppose i am rebus shrugged nobody seems to think billy cunningham knew any latin smylie didnt say anything im not wanted here am i how do you mean i mean you dont need me so why did kilpatrick bring me in he mustve known itd cause nothing but aggro best ask him yourself maybe i will meantime ill be at st leonards well be pining away in your absence i dont doubt it smylie what does the woman do her names millie docherty said siobhan clarke she works in a computer retailers and her boyfriends a computer consultant and they shared their fiat with an unemployed postie an odd mix not really sir no well maybe not they were in the canteen facing one another across the small table rebus took occasional bites from a damp piece of toast siobhan had finished hers whats it like over at fettes she asked oh you know glamour danger intrigue much the same as here then much the same i read some of caffertys notes last night ive marked the place so you can take over threes more fun said brian holmes dragging over a chair hed placed his tray on the table taking up all the available room rebus gave holmess fryup a longing look knowing it wouldnt square with hisdiet all the same sausage bacon eggs tomato and fried bread ought to carry a government health warning said the vegetarian clarke hear about the riot holmes asked i went out there this morning rebus admitted the place looked much the same i heard they threw an amplifier at a couple of our lads the process of exaggeration had begun so about billy cunningham rebus nudged none too subtly holmes forked up some tomato what about him what have you found out not a lot holmes conceded unemployed deliverer of the royal mail the only regular job hes ever had mum was overfond of him and kept gifting him money to get by on bit of a loyalist extremist but no record of him belonging to the orange lodge son of a notorious gangster but didnt know it holmes thought for a second decided this was all he had to say and cut into his sliced sausage plus said clarke the anarchist stuff we found ach thats nothing holmes said dismissively what anarchist stuff asked rebus there were some magazines in his wardrobe clarke explained soft porn football programmes a couple of those survivalist mags teenagers like to read to go with their diet of terminator films rebus almost said something but stopped himself and a flimsy little pamphlet called she sought the title the floating anarchy factfile it was years old sir said holmes not relevant do we have it here yes sir said siobhan clarke its from the orkneys said holmes i think its priced in old money it belongs in a museum not a police station brian said rebus all that fat youre eating is going to your head since when do we dismiss anything in a murder inquiry he picked a thin rasher of streaky from the plate and dropped it into his mouth it tasted wonderful the floating anarchy factfile consisted of six sheets of a paper folded over with a single staple through the middle to keep it from falling apart it was typed on an old and irregular typewriter with hand printed titles to its meagre articles and no photographs or drawings it was priced not in old money but in new pence five new pence to be exact from which rebus guessed it to be fifteen to twenty years old there was no date but it proclaimed itself issue number three to a large extent brian holmes was right it belonged in a museum the pieces were written in a style that could be termed celtic hippy and this style was so uniform as were the spelling mistakes that the whole thing looked to be the work of a single individual with access to a copying machine something like an old roneo as for the content there were cries of nationalism and individualism in one paragraph philosophical and moral lethargy the next anarchosyndicalism was mentioned but so were bakunin rimbaud and tolstoy it wasnt to rebuss eye the sort of stuff to boost advertising revenue for example what dalriada needs is a new commitment a new set of mores which look to the existent and emerging youth culture what we need is action by the individual without recourse or prior thought to the rusted machinery of law church state we need to be free to make our own decisions about our nation and then act selfconsciously to make those decisions a reality the sons and daughters of alba are the future but we are living in the mistakes of the past and must change those mistakes in the present if you do not act then remember now is the first day of the rest of your strife and remember too inertia corrodes except that mores was spelt moeres and existent as existant rebus put the pamphlet down a psychiatrist could have a field day he muttered holmes and clarke were seated on the other side of his desk he noticed that while hed been at fettes people had been using his desktop as a dumping ground for sandwich wrappers and polystyrene cups he ignored these and turned the pamphlet over there was an address at the bottom of the back page zabriskie house brinyan rousay orkney isles now thats what i call dropping out said rebus and look the house is named after zabriskie point is that in the orkneys too asked holmes its a film said rebus hed gone to see it a long long time ago just for the s soundtrack he couldnt remember much about it except for an explosion near the end he tapped his finger against the pamphlet i want to know more about this youre kidding sir said holmes thats me said rebus sourly always a smile and a joke clarke turned to holmes i think that means hes serious in the land of the blind said rebus the oneeyed man is king and even i can see theres more to this than meets your eyes brian holmes frowned such as sir such as its provenance its advanced years what would you say billy cunningham wasnt even born in so whats this doing in his wardrobe beside up todate scud mags and football programmes he waited answer came there none holmes looked sullen an annoying trait whenever rebus showed him up but clarke was ready well get orkney police to check sir always supposing the orkneys possess any police do that said rebus like a rubber ball he thought as he drove ill come bouncing back to you hed been summoned back to fettes by dci kilpatrick in his pocket there was a message from caroline rattray asking him to meet her in parliament house he was curious about the message which had been taken over the phone by a detective constable in the murder room he saw caroline rattray as shed been that night all dressed up and then dragged down into mary kings close by dr curt he saw her strong masculine face with its slanting nose and high prominent cheekbones he wondered if curt had said anything to her about him he would definitely make time to see her kilpatrick had an office of his own in a corner of the otherwise openplan room used by the scs just outside it sat the secretary and the clerical assistant though rebus couldnt work out which was which both were civilians and both operated computer consoles they made a kind of shield between kilpatrick and everyone else a barrier you passed as you moved from your world into his as rebus passed them they were discussing the problems facing south africa itll be like on uist one of them said causing rebus to pause and listen north uist is protestant and south uist is catholic and they cant abide one another kilpatricks office itself was flimsy enough just plastic partitions seethrough above waist height the whole thing could be dismantled in minutes or wrecked by a few judicious kicks and shouldercharges but it was definably an office it had a door which kilpatrick told rebus to close there was a certain amount of sound insulation there were two filingcabinets maps and printouts stuck to the walls with blutak a couple of calendars still showing july and on the desk a framed photograph of three grinning gaptoothed children yours sir my brothers im not married kilpatrick turned the photo around the better to study it i try to be a good uncle yes sir rebus sat down beside him sat ken smylie hands crossed in his lap the skin on his wrists had wrinkled up like a bloodhounds face ill get straight to the point john said kilpatrick weve got a man undercover hes posing as a longdistance lorry driver were trying to pick up information on arms shipments whos selling whos buying something to do with the shield sir kilpatrick nodded hes the one whos heard the name mentioned so who is he my brother smylie said his names calumn rebus took this in does he look like you ken a bit then i dare say hed pass as a lorry driver there was almost a smile at one corner of smylies mouth sir rebus said to kilpatrick does this mean you think the mary kings close killing had something to do with the paramilitaries kilpatrick smiled why do you think youre here john you spotted it straight off weve got three men working on billy cunningham trying to track down friends of his for some reason they had to kill him id like to know why me too sir if you want to find out about cunningham try his flatmate first murdock yes were talking to him no not murdock murdocks girlfriend i went round there when they reported him missing there was something about her something not quite right like she was holding back putting on an act smylie said ill take a look her and her boyfriend both work with computers think that might mean something ill take a look smylie repeated rebus didnt doubt that he would ken thinks you should meet calumn kilpatrick said rebus shrugged fine by me good said kilpatrick then well take a little drive out in the main office they all looked at him strangely like they knew precisely what had been said to him in kilpatricks den well of course they knew their looks told rebus he was resented more than ever even claverhouse usually so laid back was managing a snide little grin di blackwood rubbed a smooth hand over the hairless crown of his head then tucked a stray hair back behind his ear his tonsure was positively monasterial and it bothered him in his other hand he held his telephone receiver listening to someone on the line he ignored rebus as rebus walked past at the next desk along ds ormiston was squeezing spots on his forehead you two make a picture rebus said ormiston didnt appear to get it but that wasnt rebuss problem his problem was that kilpatrick was taking him into his confidence and rebus still didnt know why there are lots of warehouses in sighthill most of them anonymous they werent exactly advertising that one of them had been leased by the scottish crime squad it was a big old prefabricated building surrounded by a high wire fence and protected by a high barred gate there was barbed wire strung out across the top of the fence and the gate and the gatehouse was manned the guard unlocked the gate and swung it open so they could drive in we got this place for a song kilpatrick explained the markets not exactly thriving just now he smiled they even offered to throw in the security but we didnt think wed need any help with that kilpatrick was sitting in the back with rebus smylie acting as chauffeur the steering wheel was like a frisbee in his paws but he was a canny driver slow and considerate he even signalled as he turned into a parking bay though there was only one other car in the whole forecourt parked five bays away when they got out the sierras suspension groaned upwards they were standing in front of a normal sized door whose nameplate had been removed to its right were the much bigger doors of the loading bay from the rubbish lying around the impression was of a disused site kilpatrick took two keys from his pocket and unlocked the side door the warehouse was just that no offices or partitions off just one large space with an oily concrete floor and some empty packing cases a pigeon disturbed by their entrance fluttered near the ceiling for a moment before settling again on one of the iron spars supporting the corrugated roof it had left its mark more than once on the hgvs windshield thats supposed to be lucky said rebus not that the articulated lorry looked clean anyway it was splashed with pale cakedon mud and dust it was a ford with a uk licence plate k registration the cab door opened and a large man heaved himself out he didnt have his brothers moustache and was probably a year or two younger but he wasnt smiling and when he spoke his voice was highpitched almost cracking from effort you must be rebus they shook hands kilpatrick was doing the talking we impounded this lorry two months back or rather scotland yard did theyve kindly loaned it to us rebus hoisted himself onto the runningplate and peered in the drivers window behind the driving seat had been fixed a nude calendar and a dogeared centrefold there was space for a bunk on which a sleeping bag was rolled up ready for use the cab was bigger than some of the caravans rebus had stayed in for holidays he climbed back down there was a noise from the back of the lorry calumn smylie was opening its container doors by the time rebus and kilpatrick got there the two smylies had swung both doors wide and were standing inside the back just in front of a series of wooden crates weve taken a few liberties said kilpatrick hoisting himself into the back beside them rebus following the stuff was originally hidden beneath the floor false fuel tanks explained ken smylie good ones too welded and bolted shut the yard cut into them from up here kilpatrick stamped his foot and inside they found what the tipoff had told them theyd find calumn smylie lifted the lid off a crate so rebus could look in inside wrapped in oiled cloths were eighteen or so ak assault rifles rebus lifted one of them out by its folded metal butt he knew how to handle a gun like this even if he didnt like doing it rifles had gotten lighter since his army days but they hadnt gotten any more comfortable theyd also gotten a deal more lethal the wooden handgrip was as cold as a coffin handle we dont know exactly where they came from kilpatrick explained and we dont even know where they were headed the driver wouldnt say anything no matter how scary the antiterrorist branch got with him he denied all knowledge of the load and wasnt about to point a finger anywhere else rebus put the gun back in its crate calumn smylie leaned past him to wipe off any fingerprints with a piece of rag so whats the deal rebus asked calumn smylie gave the answer when the driver was pulled in there were some phone numbers in his pocket two in glasgow one in edinburgh all three of them were bars could mean nothing rebus said or everything commented ken smylie see calumn added could be those bars are his contacts maybe his employers or the people his employers are selling to so said kilpatrick leaning against one of the crates weve got men watching all three pubs in the hope of what it was calumns turn again when special branch stopped the lorry they managed to keep it quiet its never been reported and the drivers tucked away somewhere under the prevention of terrorism act and a few minor offences rebus nodded so his employers or whoever wont know whats happened calumn was nodding too and they might get antsy now rebus shook his head you should be a sniper calumn frowned why because thats the longest shot ive ever heard neither smylie seemed thrilled to hear this ive already overheard a conversation mentioning the shield calumn said but youve no idea what the shield is rebus countered which pub are we talking about anyway the dell it was rebuss turn to frown just off the garibaldi estate thats the one weve had some aggro there yes so i hear rebus turned to kilpatrick why do you need the lorry in case we can operate a sting how long are you going to give it calumn shrugged his eyes were dark and heavy from tension and a lack of sleep he rubbed a hand through his uncombed hair then over his unshaven face i can see its been like a holiday for you rebus said he knew the plan must have been cooked up by the smylie brothers they seemed its real defenders kilpatricks part in it was more uncertain better than that calumn was saying how so the holiday im having you dont need to send postcards not many people know of parliament house home of the high court of justiciary scotlands highest court for criminal cases there are few signposts or identifying markers outside and the building itself is hidden behind st giles separated from it by a small anonymous car park containing a smattering of jaguars and bmws of the many doors facing the prospective visitor only one normally stands open this is the public entrance and leads into parliament hall from off which stretch the signet library and advocates library there were fourteen courts in all and rebus guessed hed been in all of them over the years he sat on one of the long wooden benches the lawyers around him were wearing dark pinstripe suits white shirts with raised collars and white bow ties grey wigs and long black cloaks like those his teachers had worn mostly the lawyers were talking either with clients or with each other if with each other they might raise their voices maybe even share a joke but with clients they were more circumspect one welldressed woman was nodding as her advocate talked in an undertone all the while trying to stop the many files under his arm from wriggling free rebus knew that beneath the large stained glass window there were two corridors lined with old wooden boxes indeed the first corridor was known as the boil corridor each box was marked with a lawyers name and each had a slat in the top though the vast majority of boxes were kept open more or less permanently here documents awaited collection and perusal rebus had wondered at the openness of the system the opportunities for theft and espionage but there had never been any reports of theft and security men were in any case never far away he got up now and walked over to the stained glass he knew the king portrayed was supposed to be james v but wasnt sure about the rest of it all the figures or the coats of arms to his right through a wooden swing door with glass windows he could see lawyers poring over books etched in gold on the glass were the words private room he knew another private room close to here indeed just on the other side of st giles and down some flights of stairs billy cunningham had been murdered not fifty yards from the high court he turned at the sound of heels clicking towards him caroline rattray was dressed for work from black shoes and stockings to powdergrey wig i wouldnt have recognised you he said should i take that as a compliment she gave him a big smile and held it as she held his gaze then she touched his arm i see youve noticed she looked up at the stained glass the royal arms of scotland rebus looked up too beneath the large picture there were five smaller square windows each showing a coat of arms caroline rattrays eyes were on the central panel two unicorns held the shield of the red lion rampant above on a scroll were the words in defence and at the bottom a latin inscription rebus read it nemo me impune lacessit he turned to her never my best subject you might know it better as wha daur meddle wi me its the motto of scotland or rather the motto of scotlands kings a while since weve had any of them and of the order of the thistle sort of makes you the monarchs private soldier except they only give it to crusty old sods sit down she led them back to the bench rebus had been sitting on she had files with her which she placed on the floor rather than the bench though there was space then she gave him her full attention rebus didnt say anything so she smiled again tipping her head slightly to one side dont you see nemo he guessed yes latin for nobody we already know that miss rattray also a character in jules verne and in dickens plus the letters make the word omen backwards he paused weve been working you see but does it get us any further forward i mean was the victim trying to tell us that no one killed him she seemed to puncture her shoulders sagging it was like watching an old balloon die after christmas it could be something he offered but its hard to know what i see you could have told me about it on the phone yes i could she straightened her back but i wanted you to see for yourself you think the order of the thistle ganged up and murdered billy cunningham her eyes were holding his again no smile on her lips he broke free staring past her at the stained glass hows the prosecution game its a slow day she said i hear the victims father is a convicted murderer is there a connection maybe no concrete motive yet no motive the longer rebus looked at the royal arms the more his focus was drawn to its central figure it was definitely a shield the shield he said to himself sorry nothing its just he turned back to her she was looking eager about something and hopeful too miss rattray he said did you bring me here to chat me up she looked horrified her face reddening not just her cheeks but forehead and chin too even her neck coloured inspector rebus she said at last sorry sorry he bowed his head and raised his hands sorry i said that well i dont know she looked around its not every day im accused of being well whatever i think i need a drink then reverting to her normal voice i think youd better buy me one dont you they crossed the high street dodging the leafleters and mime artists and clowns on stilts and threaded their way through a dark close and down some worn stone steps into caro rattrays preferred bar i hate this time of year she said its such a hassle getting to and from work and as for parking in town its a hard life all right she went to a table while rebus stood at the bar she had taken a couple of minutes to change out of her gown and wig had brushed her hair out though the sombre clothes that remained the accent on black with touches of white still marked her out as a lawyer in this lawyers town the place had one of the lowest ceilings of any pub rebus had ever been in when he considered he thought they must be almost directly above some of the shops which led off mary kings close the thought made him change his order make that whisky a double but he added plenty of water caroline rattray had ordered lemonade with lots of ice and lemon as rebus placed her drink on the table he laughed whats so funny he shook his head advocate and lemonade that makes a snowball he didnt have to explain to her she managed a weary smile heard it before eh e said sitting beside her and every person who says it thinks theyve just invented it cheers aye slainte slainte do you speak gaelic just a couple of words i learnt it a few years ago ive already forgotten most of it ach its not much use anyway is it you wouldnt mind if it died out i didnt say that i thought you just did rebus gulped at his drink never argue with a lawyer another smile she lit a cigarette rebus declining dont tell me he said you still see mary kings close in your head at night she nodded slowly and during the day i cant seem to erase it so dont try just file it away thats all you can do admit it to yourself it happened you were there then file it away you wont forget but you wont harp on it either police psychology common sense hard learnt thats why you were so excited about the latin inscription yes i thought i was involved youll be involved if we ever catch the buggers itll be your job to put them away i suppose so until then leave it to us yes i will im sorry though sorry you had to see it typical of curt dragging you down there there was no need to are you and him her whoop filled the bar you dont think were just acquaintances he had a spare ticket i was on hand christ almighty you think i could with a pathologist theyre human despite rumours to the contrary yes but hes twenty years older than me thats not always a consideration the thought of those hands on me she shivered sipped her drink what did you say back there about a shield he shook his head he saw a shield in his mind and you never got a shield without a sword with sword and shield that was a line from an orange song he slapped the table with his fist so hard that caroline rattray looked frightened was it something i said caroline youre brilliant ive got to go he got up and walked past the bar then stopped and came back taking her hand in his holding it ill phone you he promised then if you like he waited till shed nodded then turned again and left she finished her lemonade smoked another cigarette and stubbed it into the ashtray his hand had been hot not like a pathologists at all the barman came to empty her ashtray into a pail and wipe the table outhunting again i see he said quietly you know too much about me dougie i know too much about everyone hen said dougie picking up both glasses and taking them to the bar several months back rebus had been talking to an acquaintance of his called matthew vanderhyde their conversation had concerned another case one involving as it turned out big ger cafferty and apropos of very little vanderhyde blind for many years and with a reputation as a white witch had mentioned a splinter group of the scottish national party the splinter group had been called sword and shield and theyd existed in the late s and early s but as a phone call to vanderhyde revealed sword and shield had ceased to exist around the same time the rolling stones were putting out their first album and at no time anyway had they been known as sas i do believe vanderhyde said and rebus could see him in his darkened living room its curtains shut slumped in an armchair with his portable phone there exists in the united states an organisation called sword and shield or even scottish sword and shield but i dont know anything about them i dont think theyre connected to the scottish rites temple which is a sort of north american freemasons but im a bit vague rebus was busy writing it all down no youre not he said youre a bloody encyclopaedia that was the problem with vanderhyde he seldom gave you just the one answer leaving you more confused than before youd asked your question is there anything i can read about sword and shield rebus asked you mean histories i wouldnt know i shouldnt think theyd bother to issue any as braille editions or talking books i suppose not but there must have been something left when the organisation was wound up papers documents perhaps a local historian might know would you like me to do some sleuthing inspector id appreciate it said rebus would big ger cafferty have had anything to do with the group i shouldnt think so why do you ask nothing forget i said it he terminated the call with promises of a visit then scratched his nose wondering who to take all this to kilpatrick or lauderdale hed been seconded to scs but lauderdale was in charge of the murder inquiry he asked himself a question would lauderdale protect me from kilpatrick the answer was no then he changed the names around the answer this time was yes so he took what he had to kilpatrick and then had to admit that it wasnt much kilpatrick had brought smylie into the office to join them sometimes rebus wasnt sure who was in charge calumn smylie would be back undercover maybe drinking in the dell so said kilpatrick summing up john weve got the word nemo weve got a latin phrase much quoted by nationalists smylie added at least in its scots form and weve got a shield on this coat of arms all of which reminds you of a group called sword and shield who were wound up in the early s you think theyve sprung up again rebus visualised a spring suddenly appearing through the worn covering of an old mattress he shrugged i dont know sir and then this source of yours mentions an organisation in the usa called sword and shield sir all i know is sas must stand for something calumn smylies been hearing about an outfit called the shield who might be in the market for arms theres also a shield on the scottish royal arms as well as a phrase with the word nemo i know these are all pretty weak links but all the same kilpatrick looked to smylie who gave a look indicating he was on rebuss side maybe smylie said in proof we could ask our friends in the states to check for us theyd be doing the work theres nothing to lose and with the backup theyve got they could probably give us an answer in a few days as i say we havent lost anything i suppose not all right then kilpatricks hands were ready for prayer john well give it a go also sir rebus added just pushing his luck a bit we might do some digging into the original sword and shield if the names been revived it wasnt just plucked out of the air fair point john ill put blackwood and ormiston onto it blackwood and ormiston theyd thank him for this theyd bring him flowers and chocolates thank you sir said rebus ever since the riot father leary had been trying to contact rebus leaving message after message at st leonards so when he got to st leonards rebus relented and called the priest it hasnt gone too well father he said gamely then its gods will for a second rebus heard it as god swill he stuck in his own apostrophe and said i knew youd say that he was watching siobhan clarke striding towards him she had her thumbs up and a big grin spread across her face got to go father say one for me dont i always rebus put down the receiver whatve you got cafferty she said throwing the file onto his desk buried way back she produced a sheet of paper and handed it to him rebus read through it quickly yes buried because it was only a suspicion one of hundreds that the police had been unable to prove over the course of caffertys career handling dirty money he said for the ulster volunteer force cafferty had formed an unholy alliance with a glasgow villain called jinky johnson and between them theyd offered a service turning dirty money into clean at the behest of the uvf then johnson disappeared rumour had it hed either fled with the uvfs cash or else hed been skimming a bit and theyd found out and done away with him whatever cafferty broke his connection what do you think clarke asked it ties cafferty to the protestant paramilitaries and if they thought he knew about johnson itd mean there was no love lost but rebus had doubts about the time scale they wouldnt wait ten years for revenge then again cafferty did know what sas stood for hes heard of it a new terrorist group i think so definitely and theyre here in edinburgh he looked up at clarke and if were not careful caffertys men are going to get to them first then he smiled you dont sound overly concerned im so bothered by it all i think ill buy you a drink deal said siobhan clarke as he drove home he could smell the cigarettes and booze on his clothes more ammo for patience christ there were those videos to take back too she wouldnt do it it was up to him thered be extra to pay and he hadnt even watched the bloody things yet to defer the inevitable he stopped at a pub they didnt come much smaller than the oxford bar but the ox managed to be cosy too most nights there was a party atmosphere or at the very least some entertaining patter and there were quarter gills too of course he drank just the one drove the rest of the way to patiences and parked in his usual spot near the sports merc someone on queensferry road was trying to sing tie a yellow ribbon overhead the streetlightings orange glow picked out the top of the tenements their chimney pots bristling the warm air smelt faintly of breweries rebus it wasnt dark yet not quite rebus had seen the man waiting across the road now the man was approaching hands deep in jacket pockets rebus tensed the man saw the change and brought his hands out to show he was unarmed just a word the man said what about mr caffertys wondering how things are going rebus studied the man more closely he looked like a weasel with misshapen teeth his mouth constantly open in something that was either a sneer or a medical problem he breathed in and out through his mouth in a series of small gasps there was a smell from him that rebus didnt want to place you want a trip down the station pal the man grinned showing his teeth again close up rebus saw that they were stained so brown from nicotine they might have been made of wood what are the charges the weasel said rebus looked him up and down offence against public decency for a start they should have kept you in your cage right at the back of the pet shop he said you had a way with words not just with words rebus started to cross the road to patiences flat the man followed so close he might have been on a leash im trying to be pleasant the weasel said tell the charm school to give you a refund he said youd be difficult rebus turned on the man difficult you dont know just how difficult i can get if i really try if i see you here again youd better be ready to square off the man narrowed his eyes thatd suit me fine ill be sure to mention your cooperation to mr cafferty do that rebus started down the steps to the garden flat the weasel leaned down over the rails nice flat rebus stopped with his key in the lock he looked up at the man shame if anything happened to it by the time rebus ran back up the steps the weasel had disappeared have you heard from your brother it was next morning and rebus was at fettes talking with ken smylie he doesnt phone in that often rebus was trying to turn smylie into someone he could trust looking around him he didnt see too many potential allies blackwood and ormiston were giving him their doubleact filthy look from which he deduced two things one theyd been assigned to look into what if anything remained of the original sword and shield two they knew whose idea the job had been rebus pleased at their glower decided he wouldnt bother mentioning that matthew vanderhyde was looking into sword and shield too why give them shortcuts when theyd have had him run the marathon smylie didnt seem in the mood for conversation but rebus persisted have you talked to billy cunninghams flatmate she kept going on about his motorbike and what was she supposed to do with it is that all smylie shrugged unless i want to buy a stripped down honda careful smylie i think maybe youve caught something what a sense of humour as rebus drove to st leonards he rubbed at his jaw and chin enjoying the feel of the bristles under his fingertips he was remembering the very different feel of the ak and thinking of sectarianism scotland had enough problems without getting involved in irelands they were like siamese twins whod refused the operation to separate them only one twin had been forced into a marriage with england and the other was hooked on selfmutilation they didnt need politicians to sort things out they needed a psychiatrist the marching season the season of the protestant was over for another year give or take the occasional small fringe procession now it was the season of the international festival a festive time a time to forget the small and insecure country you lived in he thought again of the poor sods whod decided to put on a show in the garb st leonards looked to be joining in the fun theyd even arranged for a pantomime someone had owned up to the billy cunningham murder his name was unstable from dunstable the police called him that for two reasons one he was mentally unstable two he claimed he came from dunstable he was a local tramp but not without resources with needle and thread he had fashioned for himself a coat constructed from bar towels and so was a walking sandwichboard for the products which kept him alive and kept him dying there were a lot of people out there like him shiftless until someone usually the police shifted them theyd been returned to the community a euphemism for dumped thanks to a tightening of the governments heart and purse strings some of them couldnt tighten their shoe laces without bursting into tears it was a crying shame unstable was in an interview room now with ds holmes being fed hot sweet tea and cigarettes eventually theyd turf him out maybe with a couple of quid in his hand his technicolor beercoat having no pockets siobhan clarke was at her desk in the murder room she was being talked at by di alister flower so someone had forgotten rebuss advice regarding the duty roster well flower said loudly spotting rebus if it isnt our man from the scs have you brought the milk rebus was too slow getting the reference so flower obliged the scottish cooperative society scs same letters as the scottish crime squad wasnt sean connery a milkman with the coop said siobhan clarke before he got into acting rebus smiled towards her appreciating her effort to shift the gist of the conversation flower looked like a man who had comebacks ready so rebus decided against a jibe instead he said they think very highly of you flower blinked who rebus twitched his head over at scs flower stared at him then narrowed his eyes do tell rebus shrugged whats to tell im serious the high hiedyins know your record theyve been keeping an eye on you thats what i hear flower shuffled his feet relaxing his posture he almost became shy colour showing in his cheeks they told me to tell you rebus leaned close flower doing likewise that as soon as theres a milk round to spare theyll give you a call flower showed two rows of narrow teeth as he growled then he stalked off in search of easier prey hes easy to wind up isnt he said siobhan clarke thats why i call him the clockwork orangeman is he an orangeman hes been known to march on the th he considered maybe orange peeler would be a better name for him eh clarke groaned what have you got for me from our teuchter friends you mean the orkneys i dont think theyd appreciate being called teuchters she tried hard to pronounce the word but being mostly english she just failed remember said rebus teuch is scots for tough i dont think theyd mind me calling them tough he dragged a chair over to her desk so what did you get she flicked open a paper pad finding the relevant page zabriskie house is actually a croft theres a small cottage one bedroom and one other room doubling as im not thinking of buying the place no sir the current owners didnt know anything about its past history but neighbours remembered a chap renting the place for a year or two back in the s he called himself cuchullain what a mythical warrior celtic i think and that was all he called himself that was all it fitted with the tone of the floating anarchy factfile celtic hippy rebus knew that in the early s a lot of young scots had emulated their american and european cousins by dropping out but then years later they tended to drop back in again and did well for themselves in business he knew because hed almost dropped out himself but instead hed gone to northern ireland anything else he asked bits and pieces a description thats twentyodd years old now from a woman whos been blind in one eye since birth this is your source is it mostly yes a police constable went sniffing he also talked to the man who used to run the subpost office and a couple of boatmen you need a boat to get provisions across to rousay and the postman comes by his own boat he kept himself to himself grew his own food there was talk at the time because people used to come and go at zabriskie house young women with no bras on men with beards and long hair the locals mustve been mortified clarke smiled the lack of bras was mentioned more than once well a place like that you have to make your own entertainment theres one lead the constable is still following up hell get back to me today i wont hold my breath have you ever been to the orkneys youre not thinking of she was interrupted by her telephone dc clarke speaking yes she looked up at rebus and pulled her notepad to her starting to write presumably it was the old policeman of hoy so rebus took a stroll around the room he was reminded again just why he didnt fit why he was so unsuited to the career life had chosen for him the murder room was like a production line you had your own little task and you did it maybe someone else would follow up any lead you found and then someone else after that might do the questioning of a suspect or potential witness you were a small part of a very large team it wasnt rebuss way he wanted to follow up every lead personally cross referencing them all taking them through from first principle to final reckoning hed been described not unkindly as a terrier locking on with his jaws and not letting go some dogs you had to break the jaw to get them off siobhan clarke came up to him something he asked my constable friend found out cuchullain used to keep a cow and a pig plus some chickens part of the self sufficiency thing he wondered what might have happened to them when cuchullain moved away he sounds bright turns out cuchullain sold them on to another crofter and this crofter keeps records we got lucky cuchullain had to wait for his money and he gave the crofter a forwarding address in the borders she waved a piece of paper at him dont get too excited warned rebus were still talking a twenty year old address for a man whose name we dont know but we do know the crofter had a note of that too its francis lee francis lee rebus sounded sceptical wasnt he playing for manchester city in the s francis lee as in frank lee as in frank lee my dear i dont give a damn you think its another alias i dont know lets get the borders police to take a look he studied the murder room ach no on second thoughts lets go take a look ourselves whenever john rebus had cause or inclination to drive through any town in the scottish borders one word came to his mind neat the towns were simply laid out and almost pathologically tidy the buildings were constructed from unadorned stone and had a squarebuilt nononsense quality to them the people walking briskly from bank to grocers shop to chemists were rosy checked and bursting with health as though they scrubbed their faces with pumice every morning before sitting down to farmhouse fare the mens limbs moved with the grace of farm machinery you could present any of the women to your own mother shed tell them you werent good enough for them truth be told the borderers scared rebus he couldnt understand them he understood though that placed many more miles from any large scottish conurbation than from the english border there was bound to be some schizophrenia to the towns and their inhabitants selkirk however was definably scots in character architecture and language its annual laminas fair was not yet just a memory to see the townfolk through the winter there were still rows of pennants waiting to be taken down flapping in the slightest breeze there were some outside the house which abutted the kirkyard wall siobhan clarke checked the address and shrugged its the manse isnt it rebus repeated sure that they had something wrong its the address ive got here the house was large with several prominent gables it was fashioned from dull grey stone but boasted a lush and sweetsmelling garden siobhan clarke pushed open the gate she searched the front door for a bell but found none so resorted to the iron knocker which was shaped like an open hand no one answered from nearby came the sound of a manual lawnmower its pull and push as regular as a pendulum rebus looked in through the front window of the house and saw no sign of movement were wasting our time he said a waste of a long car journey too lets leave a note and get out of here clarke peered through the letterbox then stood up again maybe we could ask around now were here fine said rebus lets go talk to the lawnmower man they walked round to the kirkyard gate and took the red gravel path around the perimeter of the church itself at the back of the soot blackened building they saw an old man pushing a mower which in edinburgh might have graced a new town antique shop the gentleman stopped his work when he saw them crossing the trimmed grass towards him it was like walking on a carpet the grass could not have been shorter if hed been using nail scissors he produced a voluminous handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his suntanned brow his face and arms were as brown as oak the face polished with sweat the elderly skin was still tight across the skull shiny like a beetles back he introduced himself as willie mcstay is it about the vandalism he asked vandalism here theyve been desecrating the graves daubing paint on the headstones its the skinheads skinheads in selkirk rebus was not convinced how many skinheads are there mr mcstay mcstay thought about it grinding his teeth together as though he were chewing tobacco or a particularly tough piece of phlegm well he said theres alec tunnocks son for a start his hairs cropped awful short and he wears those boots wi the laces boots with laces eh he hasna had a job since he left school rebus was shaking his head were not here about the headstones mr mcstay we were wondering about that house he pointed towards it the manse who lives there mr mcstay the minister reverend mckay how long has he lived there gracious i dont know fifteen years maybe before him it was reverend bothwell and the bothwells were here for a quarter century or more rebus looked to siobhan clarke a waste of time were looking for a man called francis lee she said mcstay chomped on the name jaw chewing from side to side cheekbones working he reminded rebus of a sheep the old man shook his head nobody i know of he said well thanks anyway said rebus a minute mcstay ordered meaning that he wanted to think about it for a minute more finally he nodded youve got it the wrong way round he leant a hand against the mowers black rubber grip the bothwells were a lovely couple douglas and ina couldnt do enough for this town when they died their son sold the house straight off he wasnt supposed to reverend bothwell told me that often enough he was supposed to keep it in the family but its a manse clarke said church of scotland property how could he sell it the bothwells loved the house so much they bought it off the church they were going to live there when reverend bothwell retired the thing is the son sold it back to the church he was a wastrel that one took the money and ran nobodyd look after their grave if it wasnt for me and a few other old folk here who remember them fondly he shook his head young people theyve no sense of history or commitment whats this got to do with francis lee siobhan clarke asked mcstay looked at her like she was a child whod spoken out of turn and addressed his answer to rebus their son was called lee i think his middle name was francis lee francis bothwell francis lee it was too close to be mere coincidence rebus nodded slowly i dont suppose youve any idea he said where we might find he broke off frankie bothwell thanks mr mcstay thanks for your help and he walked towards the gate it took siobhan clarke a moment to catch up with him so are you going to tell me you dont know frankie bothwell he watched her try out the name in her mind she shook her head furiously he owns the crazy hose saloon now she nodded that fringe programme in billy cunninghams room yes with a show at the crazy hose circled nice coincidence eh they were at the car now rebus opened the passenger door but didnt get in instead he rested his elbow on the roof and looked across at her if you believe in coincidence shed driven them twenty or thirty yards when rebus ordered her to stop hed been looking in his wing mirror and now got out of the car and started back towards the gates siobhan cursed under her breath drew the car in to the kerb and followed him idling by the gates was a red estate car shed seen parked further away when they were leaving rebus had stopped two men whod been walking towards willie mcstay neither of the two would have looked out of place in the back of a scrum siobhan was in time to catch the end of her superiors argument and if you dont lay off so help me ill drop you so far in it youll wish youd brought a diving bell to reinforce this point rebus jabbed his finger into the larger mans gut all the way up to the second joint the man didnt look like he was enjoying it his face was a huge ripe plum but he kept his hands clasped behind his back throughout he was showing such self control siobhan might have taken him for a buddhist only shed yet to come across a buddhist with razor scars carved down both cheeks and whats more rebus was saying you can tell cafferty we know all about him and the uvf so he neednt go on acting the innocent about terrorism the bigger of the two men spoke mr caffertys getting very impatient he wants a result i dont care if he wants world peace now get out of here and if i hear youve been back asking questions ill see you both put away and i dont care what ive got to do understood they didnt look overly impressed but the two men walked away anyway back to the gates and through them your fan club siobhan clarke guessed ach they only want me for my body which in a sense was true it was late afternoon and the crazy hose was doing no trade at all those in the know just called it the hose those not in the know would say shouldnt it be horse but it was the hose because its premises were an old decommissioned fire station left vacant when they built a new edifice just up the street and it was the crazy hose saloon because it had a wild west theme and country and western music the main doors were painted gloss black and boasted small square barred windows rebus knew the place was doing no trade because lee francis bothwell was sitting on the steps outside smoking a cigarette although rebus had never met frankie bothwell he knew the reputation and there was no mistaking the mess on the steps for anything else he was dressed like a las vegas act with the face and hair of mcgarrett in hawaii the hair had to be fake and rebus would lay odds some of the face was fake too mr bothwell the head nodded without the hair moving one millimetre out of coiffeured place he was wearing a tancoloured leather safari jacket tight white trousers and an opennecked shirt the shirt would offend all but the colour blind and the truly blind it had so many rhinestones on it rebus was in no doubt the rhine mines were now exhausted as a result around bothwells neck hung a simple gold chain but he would have been better off with a neckcast a neckcast would have disguised the lines the wrinkles and sags which gave away bothwells not insubstantial age im inspector rebus this is detective constable clarke rebus had briefed clarke on the way here and she didnt look too stunned by the figure in front of her you want a bottle of rye for the police rake no sir were trying to complete a collection of magazines huh bothwell had been studying the empty street just along the road was tollcross junction but you couldnt see it from the front steps of the crazy hose now he looked up at rebus im serious rebus said were missing a few back issues maybe you can help i dont get it the floating anarchy factfile frankie bothwell took off his sunglasses and squinted at rebus then he ground his cigaretteend under the heel of a cowboy boot that was a lifetime ago how do you know about it rebus shrugged frankie bothwell grinned he was perking up again christ that was a long time ago up in the orkneys peace and love i had some fun back then but whats it got to do with anything do you know this man rebus handed over a copy of the photo murdock had given him the one from the party it had been cropped to show billy cunninghams face only his names billy cunningham bothwell took a while studying the photo then shook his head he came here to see a country and western show a couple of weeks back were packed most nights inspector especially this time of year i can ask the bar staff the bouncers see if they know him is he a regular we dont know sir see if hes a regular hell carry the cowpoke card you get one after three visits in any one month entitles you to thirty per cent off the admission rebus was shaking his head whats he done anyway hes been murdered mr bothwell bothwell screwed up his face bad one then he looked at rebus again not the kid in that underground street rebus nodded bothwell stood up brushing dirt from his backside floating anarchy hasnt been in circulation for twenty years you say this kid had a copy issue number three siobhan clarke confirmed bothwell thought about it number three that was a big printing a thousand or so there was momentum behind number three after that not so much momentum he smiled ruefully can i keep the photo like i say ill ask around fine mr bothwell weve got copies secondhand shops maybe pardon the magazine maybe he got it secondhand thats a thought a kid that age christ he shook his head i love kids inspector thats what this place is all about giving kids a good time theres nothing like it really sir bothwell spread his hands i dont mean anything you know nothing like that ive always liked kids i used to run a football team local youth club thing anything for kids he smiled again thats because im still a kid myself inspector me im peter bloody pan still holding the photo he invited them in for a drink rebus was tempted but declined the bar would be an empty barn no place for a drink he handed bothwell a card with his office number ill do my best bothwell said rebus nodded and turned away he didnt say anything to siobhan clarke till they were back in her car well what do you think creepy she said how can he dress like that years of practice i suppose so what do you reckon to him rebus thought about this im not sure let me think about it over a drink thats very kind sir but im going out she made a show of checking her watch a fringe show she nodded early tom stoppard she said well rebus sniffed i didnt say you were invited anyway he paused who are you going with she looked at him im going on my own not that its any of your business sir rebus shifted a little you can drop me off at the ox as they drove past there was no sign of frankie bothwell on the steps of the crazy hose saloon the ox gave rebus a taste he phones patience but got the answerphone he seemed to remember she was going out tonight but couldnt recall where he took the slow route home in daintrys lounge he stood at the bar listening in on its tough wit the festival only touched places like daintrys insofar as providing posters to advertise the shows these were as much decoration as the place ever had he stared at a sign above the row of optics it said if arseholes could fly this place would be an airport ready for takeoff he said to the barmaid proffering his empty glass a little later he found himself approaching oxford terrace from lennox street so turned into lennox street lane what had once been stables in the lane had now become first floor homes with ground floor garages the place was always dead some of the tenements on oxford terrace backed onto the lane rebus had a key to patiences garden gate hed let himself in the back door to the flat as shortcuts went it wasnt much of one but he liked the lane he was about a dozen paces from the gate when somebody grabbed him they got him from behind pulling him by the coat keeping the grip tight so that he might as well have been wearing a straitjacket the coat came up over rebuss head trapping him binding his arms a knee came up into his groin he lashed out with a foot which only made it all the easier to unbalance him he was shouting and swearing as he fell the attacker had released his grip on the coat while rebus struggles to get out of it a foot caught him on the side of the head the foot was wearing a plimsoll which explained why rebus hadnt heard his attacker following him it also explained why he was still conscious after the kick another kick dug into his side and then just as his head was emerging from his coat the foot caught him on the chin and all he could see were the setts beneath him slick and shining from what light there was the attackers hands were on him rifling pockets the man was breathing hard take the money rebus said trying to focus his eyes he knew there wasnt much money to take less than a fiver all of it in small change the man didnt seem happy with his haul it wasnt much for a nights work am gonny put you in the hospital the accent was glaswegian rebus could make out the mans build squat but not yet his face there was too much shadow he was rearing up again coins spilling from his hands to rain down on rebus hed given rebus just enough time to shake off the alcohol rebus sprang from his crouch and hit the man square in the stomach with his head propelling his assailant backwards the man kept his balance but rebus was standing too now and he was bigger than the glaswegian there was a glint in the mans hand a cutthroat razor rebus hadnt seen one in years it flashed in an arc towards him but he dodged it then saw that there were two other figures in the lane they were watching hands in pockets he thought he recognised them as caffertys men the ones from the churchyard the razor was swinging again the glaswegian almost smiling as he went about his business rebus slipped his coat all the way off and wrapped it around his left arm he met the blade with his arm feeling it cut into the cloth and lashed out with the sole of his right foot connecting with the mans knee the man took a step back and rebus struck out again connecting with a thigh this time when the man attempted to come back at him he was limping and easy to sidestep but instead of aiming with the razor he barrelled into rebus pushing him hard against some garage doors then he turned and ran there was only one exit from the alley and he took it running past caffertys men rebus took a deep breath then sank to his knees and threw up onto the ground his coat was ruined but that was the least of his problems cafertys men were strolling towards him they lifted him to his feet like he was a bag of shopping you all right one asked winded rebus said his chin hurt too but there was no blood he puked up more alcohol feeling better for it the other man had stooped to pick up the money rebus didnt get it your man he said they were shaking their heads then the bigger one spoke he just saved us the bother he was trying to hospitalise me i think id have done the same said the big man holding out rebuss coins if this is all id found rebus took the money and pocketed it then he took a swing at the man it was slow and tired and didnt connect but the big man connected all right his punch took all the remaining fight out of rebus he fell to his knees again palms on the cold ground thats by way of an incentive the man said just in case you were needing one mr caffertyll be talking to you soon not if i can help it spat rebus sitting with his back to the garage they were walking away from him back towards the mouth of the lane hell be talking to you then they were gone a glaswegian with a razor rebus thought to himself happy to sit here till the pain went away if not caffertys man then whose and why rebus struggled towards consciousness even as he picked up the telephone heathen he gasped into it pardon to call at this ungodly hour hed recognised dci kilpatricks voice he ran the palm of his hand down his face pulling open his eyelids when he could focus he tried finding the time on the clock but in his struggle for the receiver hed knocked it to the floor what do you want sir i was hoping you could come in a bit early what cleaners on strike and youre looking for a relief resounds like the dead but hes still cracking jokes when do you want me say half an hour you say it ill do what i can he put down the receiver and found his watch it was on his wrist the time was five past six he hadnt so much slept as drifted into coma maybe it was the drink or the vomiting or the beating maybe it was just too many late nights catching up with him whatever he didnt feel the worse for it he checked his side it was bruised but not badly his chin and face didnt feel too bad either just grazed who the hell was that patience growled sleepily from beneath her pillow duty calls said rebus swinging his unwilling legs out of bed they were seated in kilpatricks office rebus and ken smylie rebus held his coffee cup the way a disaster victim would cradling this smallest of comforts he couldnt have looked worse if thered been a blanket around his shoulders and a reporter in front of him asking how he felt about the plane crash his early morning buzz had lasted all the way from the bed to the bathroom it had been an effort to look in the mirror unshaven you hardly noticed the bruises but he could feel them on the inside smylie seemed alert enough not needing the caffeine and rebus shouldnt have been drinking it either it would play merry hell with him later it was a minute short of seven oclock and they were watching kilpatrick pretend to reread some fax sheets at last he was ready he put down the sheets and interlocked the fingers of both hands rebus and smylie were trying to get a look at what the fax said ive heard from the united states you were right ken theyre quick workers the gist is there are two fairly widespread but above board organisations in the us ones called the scottish rites temple thats a kind of masonic lodge for scots rebus said remembering vanderhydes words kilpatrick nodded the other is called scottish sword and shield he watched rebus and smylie exchange a look dont get excited its much more lowkey than scottish rites but its not into the financing of gunrunning however he picked up the fax again theres one final group it has its main headquarters in toronto canada but also has branches in the states particularly in the south and the northwest its called the shield and you wont find it in any phone book the fbi have been investigating the us operation for just over a year as have the american tax people i had a chat with an fbi agent at their headquarters in washington and and the shield is a fundraiser only nobodys quite sure what for whatever it is it isnt catholic the fbi agent said hed already passed a lot of this information on to the royal ulster constabulary in the event of their becoming cognisant of the organisation ten minutes on the phone to washington and already kilpatrick was aping american speech so rebus said now we talk to the ruc i already have thats why i called this meeting what did they say they were pretty damned cagey no surprises there sir said smylie they did admit to having some information on what they called sword and shield great but they wont release it usual ruc runaround they dont like sharing things their line is if we want to see it we have to go there those bastards really are a law unto themselves no point going higher up with this sir someone could order the information out of them yes and it could get lost or they could lift out anything they didnt feel like letting us see no i think we show willing on this belfast kilpatrick nodded id like you both to go itll only be a day trip kilpatrick checked his watch theres a loganair flight at sevenforty so youd best get going no time to pack my tour guides said rebus inside two old dreads were warming his gut they banked steeply coming down over belfast harbour like one of those fairground rides teenagers take to prove themselves rebus still had a hum of caffeine in his ears pretty good eh said smylie aye pretty good rebus hadnt flown in a few years hed had a fear of flying ever since his sas training already he was dreading the return trip it wasnt when he was high up he didnt mind that but the takeoff and landing that view of the ground so near and yet far enough to kill you stone dead if you hit it here it came again the plane dropping fast now too fast his fingers were sore against the armrests there was every chance of them locking there he could see a surgeon amputating at the wrists and then they were down smylie was quick to stand up the seat had been too narrow for him with not enough legroom he worked his neck and shoulders then rubbed his knees welcome to belfast he said we like to give visitors the tour yates said he was inspector yates of the royal ulster constabulary and both he and his car were in mufti he had a face formed of fistfights or bad childhood infections scar tissue and things not quite in their right place his nose veered leftwards one earlobe hung lower than the other and his chin had been stitched together not altogether successfully youd look at him in a bar and then look away again quickly not risking the stare he deserved he had no neck that was another thing his head sat on his shoulders like a boulder on the top of a hill thats very kind said smylie as they sped into town but wed lets you see what were dealing with yates kept looking in his rearview conducting a conversation with the mirror the two cities its the same in any war zone i knew this guy height of the trouble in beirut he was recruited as a croupier there bombs falling gunmen on the rampage and the casinos were still open now these he nodded out of the windscreen are the recruiting stations they had left the city airport behind shaved the commercial centre and were passing through a wasteland until now you couldnt have said which british city you were in a new road was being built down by the docks old flats no worse than those in the garb were being demolished as yates had commented sometimes the divide was hidden not far away a helicopter hovered high in the sky watching someone or something around them whole streets had been bulldozed the kerbstones were painted green and white youll see red white and blue ones in other areas on the gableend of a row of houses was an elaborate painting rebus could make out three masked figures their automatic weapons raised high there was a tricolour above them and a phoenix rising from flames above this a nice piece of propaganda said rebus yates turned to smylie your man knows what hes talking about its a work of art these are some of the poorest streets in europe by the way they didnt look so bad to rebus the gableend had reminded him again of the garb only there was more rebuilding going on here new housing developments were rising from the old see that wall said yates thats called an environmental wall built and maintained by the housing executive it was a red brick wall functional with a pattern in the bricks there used to be houses there the other side of the wall is protestant once you get past the wasteland they knock down the houses and extend the wall theres the peace line too thats an ugly old thing made from iron rather than bricks streets like these theyre meat and drink to the paramilitaries the loyalist areas are the same eyes were following their slow progress the eyes of teenagers and children grouped at street corners the eyes held neither fear nor hate only mistrust on a wall someone had daubed painted messages old references to the h block and bobby sands newer additions in praise of the ira and promising revenge against the loyalist paramilitaries the uvf and uff predominantly rebus saw himself patrolling these streets or streets like them back when there had been more houses more people on the move hed often been the back walker which meant he stayed at the back of the patrol and faced the rear his gun pointing towards the people theyd just passed men staring at the ground kids making rude gestures shows of bravado and mothers pushing prams the patrol moved as cautiously as in any jungle see here we are yates was saying were coming into protestant territory now more gableends now painted with tenfoothigh williams of orange riding twentyfoothigh white horses and then the cheaper displays the graffiti exhorting the locals to fuck the pope and the ira the letters ftp were everywhere five minutes before they had been fkb fuck king billy they were just routine a reflex but of course they were more you couldnt laugh them off as namecalling because the people whod written them wouldnt let you they kept shooting each other and blowing each other up smylie read one of the slogans aloud irish out he turned to yates what all of them yates smiled the catholics write troops out so the loyalists write irish out they dont see themselves as irish theyre british he looked in the mirror again and theyre getting more vicious loyalist paramilitaries killed more civvies last year than the ira did thats a first so far as i know the loyalists hate us now too whos us the ruc they werent happy when the uda was outlawed your man sir patrick mayhew he lit the fuse i read about some riots only last month here in the shankill and elsewhere they say were harassing them we cant really win can we i think we get the picture said smylie anxious to get to work but rebus knew the point the ruc man was making this was their work if you think you get the picture yates said then youre not getting the picture youre to blame you know eh the scots you settled here in the seventeenth century started pushing around the catholics i dont think we need a history lesson rebus said quietly smylie was looking like he might explode but its all about history yates said levelly on the surface at least and underneath paramilitaries are in the business of making money they cant exist without money so now theyve become gangsters pure and simple because thats the easy way to make the money they need and then it becomes self perpetuating the ira and uda get together now and then and discuss things they sit around a table together just like the politicians want them to but instead of talking about peace they talk about carving up the country you can extort from these taxi firms if we can extort from the building sites you even get cases where the stuff the one side has stolen is passed on to the other for them to sell in their areas you get times when the tensions high then its back to business as usual its like one of those mafia films the money these bastards are making yates shook his head they cant afford peace itd be bad for business and bad for your business too yates laughed aye right enough overtime wouldnt be easy to come by but then we might live to retirement age too that doesnt always happen just now yates had lifted his radio transmitter twosixzero im about five minutes from base two passengers the radio spat static received and understood he put down the receiver now this he said this is belfast too south belfast you dont hear much about it because hardly anything ever happens here see what i mean about two cities rebus had been noticing the change in their surroundings suddenly it looked prosperous safe there were wide treelined avenues detached houses some of them very newlooking theyd passed the university a redbrick replica of some older college yet they were still only ten minutes from the troubles rebus knew this face of the city too hed only spent the one tour of duty here but he remembered the big houses the busy city centre the victorian pubs whose interiors were regarded as national treasures he knew the city was surrounded by lush green countryside winding lanes and farm tracks at the end of which might sit silent milkchurns packed with explosives the ruc station on the malone road was a well disguised affair tucked away behind a wooden fence with a discreet lookout tower we have to keep up appearances for the locals yates explained this is a nice part of town no mesh fences and machine guns the gates had been opened for them and closed quickly again thanks for the tour rebus said as they parked he meant it something yates acknowledged with a nod smylie opened his door and prised himself out yates glanced at the upholstery then opened the glove compartment and lifted out his holstered pistol bringing it with him is your accent irish rebus asked mostly theres a bit of liverpool in there too i was born in bootle we moved here when i was six what made you join the ruc smylie asked ive always been a stupid bastard i suppose he had to sign both visitors into the building and their identities were checked later rebus knew some clerical assistant would add them to a computer file inside the station looked much like any police station except that the windows were heavily protected and the beat patrols carried padded vests with them and wore holsters theyd seen policemen during their drive but had acknowledged none of them and theyd passed a single army patrol young squaddies sitting at the open rear door of their personnel carrier known as a pig in rebuss day and probably still automatic rifles held lightly faces trained not to show emotion in the station the windows might be well protected but there seemed little sign of a siege mentality the jokes were just as blue just as black as the ones told in edinburgh people discussed tv and football and the weather smylie wasnt watching any of it he wanted the job done and out again as quick as could be rebus wasnt sure about smylie the man might be a wonder in the office as efficient as the day was long but here he seemed less sure of himself he was nervous and showed it when he took his jacket off complaining of the heat there were large sweat marks spreading from beneath his arms rebus had thought hed be the nervous one yet he felt detached his memories bringing back no new fears he was all right yates had a small office to himself theyd bought beakers of tea at a machine and now sat these on the desk yates put his gun into a desk drawer draped his jacket over his chair and sat down pinned above him on the wall behind the desk was a sheet of computer printout bearing the oversized words nil illegitimum non carborundum smylie decided to take a poke i thought latin was for the catholics yates stared at him there are catholics in the ruc dont get us confused with the udr then he unlocked another drawer and pulled out a file pushing it across the desk towards rebus this doesnt leave the room smylie drew his chair towards rebuss and they read the contents together smylie the faster reader fidgeting as he waited for rebus to catch up this is incredible smylie said at one point he was right the ruc had evidence of a loyalist paramilitary force called sword and shield usually just referred to as the shield and of a support group working out of the mainland acting as a conduit through which money and arms could pass and also raising funds independently by mainland do you mean scotland rebus asked yates shrugged were not really taking them seriously its just a cover name for the uvf or uff got to be thats the way it works there are so many of these wee groups ulster resistance the red hands commando knights of the red hand we can hardly keep up with them but this group is on the mainland rebus said yes and weve maybe come up against them he tapped the folder yet nobody thought to tell us any of this yates shrugged again his head falling further into his body we leave that to special branch you mean special branch were told about this special branch here would inform special branch in london any idea who the contact would be in london thats classified information inspector sorry a man called abernethy yates pushed his chair back so he could rock on it the front two legs coming off the floor he studied rebus thats answer enough rebus said he looked to smylie who nodded they were being screwed around by special branch but why i see somethings on your mind said yates want to tell me about it id like to hear what you know rebus placed the folder on the desk then come to edinburgh some time maybe well tell you yates placed all four legs of his chair on the floor when he looked at rebus his face was stone his eyes fire no need to be like that he said quietly why not weve wasted a whole day for four sheets of filing paper all because you wouldnt send it to us its nothing personal inspector its security wouldnt matter if you were the chief fucking constable perspectives tend to change when your arse is in the line of fire if yates was looking for the sympathy vote rebus wasnt about to place a cross in his box the prods havent always been as keen as the provos have they whats going on first off theyre loyalists not prods prods means protestants and were dealing only with a select few not with all of them second theyre provies not provos third were not sure theres a younger leadership a keener leadership plus like i say theyre not happy just to let the security forces get on with it see the loyalist paramilitaries have always had a problem theyre supposed to be on the same side as the security forces theyre supposed to be lawabiding thats changed they feel threatened just now theyre the majority but it wont always be that way plus the british governments more concerned with its international image than with a few hardline loyalists so its paying more attention to the republic put all that together and you get disillusioned loyalists and plenty of them the loyalist paramilitaries used to have a bad image a lot of their operations went wrong they didnt have the manpower or the connections or the international support of the ira these days they seem to be better organised though not so much blatant racketeering a lot of the thugs have been put off the road that is put off the shankill road as in banished but at the same time theyre arming themselves rebus said its true added smylie in the past whenever we caught them redhanded on the mainland we used to find gelignite or sodium chlorate now were finding rocket launchers and armourpiercing shells redhanded yates smiled at that oh its getting heavy duty he agreed but you dont know why ive given you all the reasons i can rebus wondered about that but didnt say anything look this is a new thing for us yates said were used to facing off the provies not the loyalists but now theyve got kalashnikovs rpgs frag grenades brownings and youre taking them seriously oh yes inspector were taking them seriously thats why i want to know what you know maybe well tell you over a beer rebus said yates took them to the crown bar across the street most of the windows in the europa hotel were boarded up the result of another bomb the bomb had damaged the crown too but the damage hadnt been allowed to linger it was a victorian pub well preserved with gas lighting and a wall lined with snugs each with its own table and its own door for privacy the interior reminded rebus of several edinburgh bars but here he drank stout rather than heavy and whiskey rather than whisky i know this place he said been here before eh inspector rebus smylie explained was in the army in belfast so then rebus had to tell yates all about it all about he wasnt getting it out of his system he could still feel the pressure inside him he remembered the republican drinking club again and the way theyd gone in there swinging wildly some of the toms more enthusiastic than others what would he say if he met any of the men theyd beaten sorry didnt seem enough he wouldnt talk about it but he told yates a few other stories talking was okay j and drinking was okay too the thought of the return flight didnt bother him so much after two pints and a nip by the time they were in the indian restaurant eating an early lunch in a private booth a long way from any other diners smylie had grown loquacious but it was all mental arm wrestling comparing and contrasting the two police forces discussing manpower backup arrest sheets drug problems as yates pointed out leaving aside terrorism northern ireland had one of the lowest crime rates going certainly for serious crimes there were the usual housebreakings and carjackings but few rapes and murders even the rougher housing schemes were kept in check by the paramilitaries whose punishments went beyond incarceration which brought them back to mary kings close were they any nearer rebus wondered to finding out why billy cunningham had been tortured and killed and who had killed him the letters sas on an arm the word nemo on the floor the style of the assassination and cunninghams own sympathies what did it all add up to yates meantime talked a little more freely while helping smylie polish off the remaining dishes he admitted they werent all angels in the ruc which did not exactly surprise rebus and smylie but yates said they should see some of the men in the ulster defence regiment who were so fairminded that their patrols had to be accompanied by ruc men keeping an eye on them you were here in inspector youll remember the b specials the udr was formed to replace the b spesh the same madmen joined see if a loyalist wants to do something for his cause all he has to do is join the udr or the ruc reserve that fact has kept the uda and uvf small is there still collusion between the security forces and the loyalists yates pondered that one over a belch probably he said reaching for his lager the udr used to be terrible so did the royal irish rangers now its not so widespread either that or better hidden said rebus with cynicism like that you should join the ruc i dont like guns yates wiped at his plate with a final sliver of nan bread ah yes he said the essential difference between us i get to shoot people its a big difference rebus suggested all the difference in the world yates agreed smylie had gone quiet he was wiping his own plate with bread do the loyalists get aid from overseas rebus asked yates sat back contentedly not as much as the republicans the loyalists probably rake in a year from the mainland mostly to help families and convicted members twothirds of that comes from scotland there are pockets of sympathisers abroad australia south africa the us and canada canadas the big one the uvf have some ingrams submachine guns just now that were shipped from toronto why do you want to know rebus and smylie shared a look then smylie started to talk rebus was happy to let him this way yates only got to know what smylie knew rather than what rebus suspected toronto headquarters of the shield when smylie had finished rebus asked yates a question this group sword and shield i didnt see any names on the file you mean individuals rebus nodded well its all pretty lowkey weve got suspicions but the names wouldnt mean anything to you try me yates considered then nodded slowly okay for instance whos the leader we havent breached their command structure not yet but you have your suspicions yates smiled oh yes theres one bastard in particular his voice already low dropped lower still alan fowler he was uvf but left after a disagreement a right bad bastard i think the uvf were glad to be shot of him can i have a photo a description yates shrugged why not hes not my problem just now anyway rebus put down his glass whys that because he took the ferry to stranraer last week a car picked him up and drove him to glasgow yates paused and thats where we lost him ormiston was waiting at the airport with a car rebus didnt like ormiston he had a huge round face marked with freckles and a semipermanent grin too close to a sneer for comfort his hair was thickly brown always in need of a comb or a cut he reminded rebus of an overgrown schoolboy seeing him at his desk next to the bald and schoolmasterly blackwood was like seeing the classroom dunce placed next to the teacher so an eye could be kept on his work but there was something particularly wrong with ormiston this afternoon not that rebus really cared all he cared about was the headache which had woken him on the approach to edinburgh a midday drinking headache a glare behind the eyes and a stupor further back in the brain hed noticed at the airport the way ormiston was looking at smylie smylie not realising it got any paracetamol on you rebus asked sorry and he caught rebuss eye again as if trying to communicate something normally he was a nosy bugger yet he hadnt asked about their trip even smylie noticed this what is it ormiston a vow of omerta or something ormiston still wasnt talking he concentrated on his driving giving rebus plenty of time for thought he had things to tell kilpatrick and things he wanted to keep to himself for the time being when ormiston stopped the car at fettes he turned to rebus not you weve got to meet the chief somewhere what smylie half out of his door stopped whats up ormiston just shook his head rebus looked to smylie ormiston see you later then aye sure and smylie got out relieving the cars suspension as soon as hed closed the door ormiston moved off what is it ormiston best if the chief tells you himself give me a clue then a murder ormiston said changing up a gear theres been a murder the scene had been cordoned off it was a narrow street of tall tenements st stephen street had always enjoyed a rakish reputation something to do with its mix of student flats cafes and junk shops there were several bars one of them catering mainly to bikers rebus had heard a story that nico exvelvet underground had lived here for a time it could be true st stephen street connecting the new town to raeburn place was a quiet thoroughfare which still managed to exude charm and seediness in equal measures the tenements either side of the street boasted basements and a lot of these were flats with their own separate stairwells and entrances patience lived in just such a flat not seven minutes walk away rebus walked carefully down the stone steps they were often worn and slippy at the bottom in a sort of damp courtyard the owner or tenant of the flat had attempted to create a garden of terracotta pots and hanging baskets but most of the plants had died probably from lack of light or perhaps from rough treatment at the hands of the builders scaffolding stretched up the front of the tenement much of it covered with thick polythene crackling in the breeze cleaning the facade someone said rebus nodded the front door of the flat faced a whitewashed wall and in the wall were set two doors rebus knew what these were they were storage areas burrowed out beneath the surface of the pavement patience had almost identical doors but never used the space for anything the cellars were too damp one of the doors stood open the floor was mostly moss some of which was being scraped into an evidence bag by a soco kilpatrick watching this was listening to blackwood who ran his left hand across his pate tucking an imaginary hair behind his ear kilpatrick saw rebus hello john sir wheres smylie ormiston was coming down the steps rebus nodded towards him the quiet man there dropped him at hq so whats the big mystery blackwood answered flats been on the market a few months but not selling owner decided to tart it up a bit see if that would do the trick builders turned up yesterday today one of them decided to take a look at the cellars he found a body been there long blackwood shook his head theyre doing the postmortem this evening any tattoos no tattoos said kilpatrick thing is john it was calumn the chief inspector looked genuinely troubled almost ready for tears his face had lost its colour and had lengthened as though the muscles had lost all motivation he massaged his forehead with a hand calumn rebus shook away his hangover calumn smylie he remembered the big man in the back of the hgv with his brother tried imagine him dead but couldnt especially not here in a cellar kilpatrick blew his nose loudly then wiped it i suppose id better get back and tell ken no need sir ken smylie was standing at street level gripping the glossblack railings he looked like he might uproot the lot instead he arched back his head and gave a highpitched howl the sound swirling up into the sky as a smattering of rain began to fall smylie had to be ordered to go home they couldnt shift him otherwise everyone else in the office moved like automatons dci kilpatrick had some decisions to make chief among them whether or not to tie together the two murder inquiries he was stabbed he told rebus no signs of a struggle certainly no torture nothing like that there was relief in his voice a relief rebus could understand stabbed and dumped whoever did it probably saw the for sale sign outside the flat didnt reckon on the body being found for a while he had produced a bottle of laphroaig from the bottom drawer of his desk and poured himself a glass medicinal he explained but rebus declined the offer of glass hed taken three paracetamol washed down with irnbru he noticed that the level in the laphroaig bottle was low kilpatrick must have a prescription you think he was rumbled what else said kilpatrick dribbling more malt into his glass id have expected another punishment killing something with a bit of ritual about it ritual kilpatrick considered this he wasnt killed there you know the pathologist said there wasnt enough blood maybe they held their ritual wherever they killed him christ and i let him go out on a limb he took out a handkerchief and blew his nose then took a deep breath well ive got a murder inquiry to start up the high hiedyins are going to be asking questions yes sir rebus stood up but stopped at the door two murders two cellars two lots of builders kilpatrick nodded but said nothing rebus opened the door sir who knew about calumn how do you mean who knew he was undercover just this office or anyone else kilpatrick furrowed his brow such as special branch say just this office kilpatrick said quietly rebus turned to leave john what did you find out in belfast that sword and shield exists that the ruc know its operating here on the mainland that they told special branch in london he paused that di abernethy probably knows all about it having said which rebus left the room kilpatrick stared at the door for a full minute christ almighty he said his telephone was ringing he was slow to answer it is it true brian holmes asked siobhan clarke was waiting for an answer too its true said rebus they were in the murder room at st leonards he was working on something that might well be connected to billy cunningham so what now sir we need to talk to millie and murdock again weve talked to them thats why i said again dont you listen and after that lets fix up a little chat with some of the jaffas jaffas rebus tutted at siobhan clarke how long have you lived here jaffas are orangemen the orange lodge said holmes what can they tell us the date of the battle of the boyne for a start inspector yes sir the date of course means more than a mere annus mirabilis onesixnineo one and six make seven nine plus nought equals nine seven and nine being crucial numbers he paused do you know anything of numerology inspector no sir what about the lassie siobhan clarke bristled visibly its sort of a crank science isnt it she offered rebus gave her a cooling look humour him the look ordered not crank no its ancient with the ring of truth can i get you something to drink no thanks mr gowrie they were seated in arch gowries front room a parlour kept for visitors and special occasions the real living room with comfortable sofa tv and video drinks cabinet was elsewhere on this sprawling ground floor the house was at least three storeys high and probably boasted an attic conversion too it was sited in the grange a leafy backwater of the citys southern side the grange got few visitors few strangers and never much traffic since it was not a wellknown route between any two other areas of the city a lot of the huge detached houses onetime merchants houses with walled grounds and high wooden or metal gates had been bought by the church of scotland or other religious denominations there was a retirement home to one side of gowries own residence and what rebus thought was a convent on the other side archibald gowrie liked to be called arch everyone knew him as arch he was the public face of the orange lodge an eloquent enough apologist not that he thought there was anything to apologise for but by no means that organisations most senior figure however he was high enough and he was easy to find unlike millie and murdock who werent home gowrie had agreed readily to a meeting saying hed be free between seven and quarter to eight plenty of time sir rebus had said he studied arch gowrie now the man was big and fiftyish and probably attractive to women in that way older men could be though rebus noticed siobhan clarke didnt seem too enthralled though his hair thinning nicely was silver his thick moustache was black he wore his shirt with the sleeves rolled up showing darkly haired arms he was always ready for business in fact open for business had been his public motto and he worked tirelessly whenever he got his teeth into a new development from what rebus knew gowrie had made his money initially as director of a company which had nippily shifted its expertise from ships and pipelines to building exploration platforms and oil rigs for the north sea that was back in the early s the company had been sold at vast profit and gowrie had disappeared for several years before reappearing in the guise of property developer and investment guru he was still a property developer his name on several projects around the city as well as further afield but he had diversified into wildly different areas film production hifi design edible algae forestry two country house hotels a woollen mill and the eyrie restaurant in the new town probably arch was best known for his part ownership of the eyrie the citys best restaurant certainly its most exclusive by far its most expensive you wouldnt find nutritious hebridean blue algae on its menu not even written in french rebus knew of only one large loss gowrie had taken as money man behind a film set predominantly in scotland even boasting rab kinnoul as its star the film had been an easter turkey still gowrie wasnt shy there was a framed poster for the film hanging in the entrance hall annul mirabilis rebus mused thats latin isnt it gowrie was horrified of course its latin dont tell me you never studied latin at school i though we scots were an educated bunch miraculous year thats what it means sure about that drink maybe a small whisky sir kill or cure nothing for me sir said siobhan clarke her voice coming from the high moral ground i wont be a minute said gowrie when hed left the room rebus turned to her dont piss him off he hissed just keep your gob shut and your ears open sorry sir have you noticed what theres nothing green in this room nothing at all he nodded again the inventor of red white and blue grass will make a fortune gowrie came back into the room he took a look at the two of them on the sofa then smiled to himself and handed rebus a crystal tumbler i wont offend you by offering water or lemonade with that rebus sniffed the amber liquid it was a west highland malt darker more aromatic than the speysides gowrie held his own glass up slainte he took a sip then sat in a dark blue armchair well now he said how exactly can i help you well sir its nothing to do with us you know weve told the chief constable that theyre an offshoot of the grand lodge less than that even now that weve disbarred them rebus suddenly knew what gowrie was talking about there was to be a march along princes street on saturday organised by the orange loyal brigade hed heard about it weeks ago when the very idea had provoked attacks from republican sympathisers and antiright wing associations there were expected to be confrontations during the march when did you disbar the group exactly sir april th that was the day we had the disciplinary hearing they belonged to one of our district lodges and at a dinnerdance theyd sent collecting tins round for the lpwa he turned to siobhan clarke thats the loyalist prisoners welfare association then back to rebus we cant have that sort of thing inspector weve denounced it in the past well have no truck with the paramilitaries and the disbarred members set up the orange loyal brigade correct rebus was feeling his way how many do you think will be on the march ach a couple of hundred at most and thats including the bands i think theyve got bands coming from glasgow and liverpool you think therell be trouble dont you isnt that why youre here whos the brigades leader gavin macmurray but dont you know all this already your chief constable asked if i could intervene but i told him theyre nothing to do with the orange lodge nothing at all do they have connections with the other rightwing groups you mean with fascists gowrie shrugged they deny it of course but i wouldnt be surprised to see a few skinheads on the march even ones with sassenach accents rebus left a pause before asking do you know if theres any linkup between the orange brigade and the shield cowrie frowned what shield sword and shield its another splinter group isnt it cowrie shook his head ive never heard of it no never rebus placed his whisky glass on a table next to the sofa i just assumed youd know something about it he got to his feet followed by clarke sorry to have bothered you sir rebus held out his hand is that it thats all sir thanks for your help well cowrie was clearly troubled shield no means nothing to me then dont worry about it sir have a good evening now at the front door clarke turned and smiled at cowrie well let you get back to your wee numbers goodbye sir they heard the door close behind them with a solid click as they walked back down the short gravel path to the driveway ive only got one question sir what was all that about were dealing with lunatics clarke and cowrie isnt a lunatic a zealot maybe but not a madman tell me what do you call a haircut in an asylum by now clarke knew the way her bosss mind worked a lunatic fringe she guessed thats who i want to talk to you mean the orange loyal brigade rebus nodded and every one of them will be taking a stroll along princes street on saturday he smiled without humour ive always enjoyed a parade saturday was hot and clear with a slight cooling breeze just enough to make the day bearable shoppers were out on princes street in numbers and the lawns of princes street gardens were as packed as a seaside beach every bench in full use a carousel attracting the children the atmosphere was festive if frayed with the kids squealing and tiring as their icecream cones melted and dropped to the ground turning instantly into food for the squirrels pigeons and panting dogs the parade was due to set off from regent road at three oclock and by twofifteen the pubs behind princes street were emptying their cargo of brollytoting whitegloved elders bowler hats fixed onto their sweating heads faces splotched from alcohol there was a show of regalia and a few large banners were being unfurled rebus couldnt remember what you called the guy at the front of the march the one who threw up and caught the heavy ornamental staff hed probably known in his youth the flute players were practising and the snare drummers adjusted their straps and drank from cans of beer people outside the post office on waterloo place could hear the flutes and drums and peered along towards regent road that the march was to set off from outside the old royal high school mothballed site for a devolved scottish parliament added a certain something to the affair rebus had been in a couple of the bars taking a look at the brigade members and supporters they were a varied crew taking in a few doc martenwearing skinheads just as gowrie had predicted as well as the bowler hats there were also the dark suitwhite shirtdark tie types their shoes as polished as their faces most of them were drinking like fury though they didnt seem completely mortal yet empty cans were being kicked along regent road or trodden on and left by the edges of the pavement rebus wasnt sure why these occasions always carried with them the air of threat of barely suppressed violence even before they started extra police had been drafted in and were readying to stop traffic from coming down onto princes street metalgrilled barriers waited by the side of the road as did the small groups of protesters and the smaller group of protesters who were protesting against the protesters rebus wondered not for the first time which maniac on the council had pushed through the okay for the parade the marching season of course had finished the main parades being on and around the th of july date of the battle of the boyne even then the biggest marches were in glasgow what was the point of this present parade to stir things up of course to make a noise to be noticed the big drum the lambeg was being hammered now there was competition from a few bagpipe buskers near waverley station but theyd be silenced by the time the parade reached them rebus wandered freely among the marchers as they drank and joked with each other and adjusted their uniforms a union jack was unfurled then ordered to be rolled up again bearing as it did the initials of the british national party there didnt seem to be any collecting tins or buckets the police having pressed for a quick march with as little interaction with the public as possible rebus knew this because hed asked farmer watson and the farmer had confirmed that it would be so heres tae king billyl a can was raised god bless the queen and king william of orange well said son the bowler hats said little standing with the tips of their umbrellas touching the ground hands resting lightly on the curved wooden handles it was easy to dismiss these unsmiling men too lightly but god help you if you started an argument with one of them why dae yis hate catholics a pedestrian yelled we dont somebody yelled back but she was already bustling away with her shopping bags there were smiles but shed made her point rebus watched her go hey gavin how long now five minutes just relax rebus looked towards the man who had just spoken the man who was probably called gavin macmurray and therefore in charge he seemed to have appeared from nowhere rebus had read the file on gavin macmurray two arrests for breach of the peace and actual bodily harm but a lot more information to his name than that rebus knew his age that he was married and lived in currie and that he ran his own garage he knew inland revenue had no complaints against him that he drove a red mercedes benz though he made his money from more prosaic fords renaults and the like and that his teenage son had been in trouble for fighting with two arrests after pitched battles outside rangers matches and one arrest after an incident on the train home from glasgow so rebus assumed the teenager standing close beside gavin macmurray must be the son jamesie jamesie had pretensions of all obvious kinds he wore sunglasses and a tough look seeing himself as his fathers lieutenant his legs were apart shoulders back rebus had never seen anyone itching so badly for action of some kind he had his fathers low square jaw the same black hair cut short at the front but while gavin macmurray was dressed in chainstore anonymity jamesie wanted people to look at him biker boots tight black jeans white tshirt and black leather jacket he wore a red bandana around his right wrist a studded leather strap around the left his hair long and curling at the back had been shaved above both ears turning from son to father was like turning from overt to covert strength rebus knew which hed rather tackle gavin macmurray was chewing gum with his front teeth his head and eyes constantly in movement checking things keeping things in check he kept his hands in his windcheater pockets and wore silverframed spectacles which magnified his eyes there seemed little charisma about him little of the rouser or orator he looked chillingly ordinary because he was ordinary they all were all these semi inebriated working men and retired men quiet family types who might belong to the british legion or their local exservicemens club who might inhabit the bowling green on summer evenings and go with their families on holiday to spain or florida or largs it was only when you saw them in groups like this that you caught a whiff of something else alone they had nothing but a nagging complaint together they had a voice the sound of the lambeg dense as a heartbeat the insistent flutes the march they always fascinated rebus he couldnt help it it was in his blood hed marched in his youth hed done a lot of things back then there was a final gathering of lines macmurray readying his troops a word with the policeman in charge a conversation by twoway radio then a nod from macmurray the opening fatfry of snare drums the lambeg pumping away and then the flutes they marched on the spot for a few moments then moved off towards princes street where traffic had been stopped for them where the castle glared down on them where a lot of people but by no means everyone paused to watch a few months back a prorepublican march had been banned from this route that was why the protesters were particularly loud in their jeers thumbs held down some of them were chanting nazis nazis and then being told to shut up by uniformed police there would be a few arrests there always were you hadnt had a good day out at a march unless thered been at least the threat of arrest rebus followed the march from the pavement sticking to the gardens side which was quieter a few more marchers had joined in but it was still small beer hardly worth the bother he was beginning to wonder what hed thought would happen his eyes moved back through the procession from the tosser at the front busy with his muckle stick through the flutes and drums past bowler hats and suits to the younger marchers and stragglers a few preteenage kids had joined in on the edges loving every minute jamesie right near the back told them in no uncertain terms that they should leave but they didnt listen to him tough always was a relative term but now one of the stragglers clutched jamesies arm and they shared a few words both of them grinning the straggler was wearing sunglasses with mirrored lenses and a denim jacket with no shirt beneath hello said rebus quietly he watched jamesie and davey soutar have their conversation saw jamesie pat davey on the shoulder before davey moved away again falling back until he left the procession altogether squeezing between two of the temporary barriers and vanishing into the crowd jamesie seemed to relax a bit after this his walk became looser less of an act and he swung his arms in time to the music he seemed to be realising that it was a bright summers day and at last peeled off his leather jacket slinging it over one shoulder showing off his arm muscles and several tattoos rebus walked a bit faster keeping close to the edge of the pavement one of the tattoos was professional and showed the ornately overlaid letters rfc rangers football club but there was also the maroon emblem of heart of midlothian fc so obviously jamesie liked to play safe then there was a kilted busbywearing piper and further down his arm towards the leather wristband a much more amateur job the usual shaky greeny blue ink the letters sas rebus blinked it was almost too far away for him to be sure almost but he was sure and suddenly he didnt want to talk to gavin macmurray any more he wanted a word with his son he stopped on the pavement letting the march pull away from him he knew where they were heading a left turn into lothian road passing the windows of the caledonian hotel something for the rich tourists to get a picture of then another left into kings stables road stopping short of the grassmarket afterwards theyd probably head down into the grassmarket itself for the postmarch analysis and a few more beers the grassmarket being trendy these days thered be a lot of fringe drinkers there too a fine cocktail of cultures for a saturday afternoon he followed the trail to one of the rougher pubs on the cowgate just the other side of candlemaker row from the grassmarket at one time theyd hung miscreants from the gallows in the grassmarket it was a cheerier prospect these days though you wouldnt necessarily know it from a visit to the merchants bar where at ten pm each night the pint glasses were switched for flimsy plastic imposters relieving the bar of ready weapons it was that kind of place inside the bar was airless a drinkers fug of smoke and television heat you didnt come here for a good time you came out of necessity the regulars were like dragons each mouthful cooling the fire inside them as he entered the bar he saw no one he recognised not even the barman the barman was a new face just out of his teens he poured pints with an affected disdain and took the money like it was a bribe from the sounds of atonal song rebus knew the marchers were upstairs probably emptying the place rebus took his pint still in a glass glass and headed up to the dance hall sure enough the marchers were about all there was theyd shed jackets ties and inhibitions and were milling around singing to off key flutes and downing pints and shorts getting the drink in had become a logistical nightmare and more marchers were coming in all the time rebus took a deep breath carved a smile into his face and waded in magic lads aye ta pal nae bother eh aye nae bother right enough all right there lads fine aye magic gavin macmurray hadnt arrived yet maybe he was off elsewhere with his generals but his son was on the stage pretending he held a microphone stand and a crowds attention another lad clambered onto the stage and played an invisible guitar still managing to hold his pint glass lager splashed over his jeans but he didnt notice that was professionalism for you rebus watched with the smile still on his face eventually they gave up as hed known they would there being no audience and leapt down from the stage jamesie landed just in front of rebus rebus held his arms wide whoah therel that was brilliant jamesie grinned aye ta rebus slapped him on the shoulder get you another i think im all right ta fair enough rebus looked around then leant close to jamesies ear i see youre one of us he winked eh the tattoo had been covered by the leather jacket but rebus nodded towards it the shield he said slyly then he nodded again catching jamesies eye and moved away he went back downstairs and ordered two pints the bar was busy and noisy both tv and jukebox blaring a couple of arguments rising above even these half a minute later jamesie was standing beside him the boy wasnt very bright and rebus weighed up how much he could get away with how do you know jamesie asked theres not much i dont know son but i dont know you rebus smiled into his drink best keep it that way then how come you know me rebus turned towards him i just do jamesie looked around him licking his lips rebus handed him one of the pints here get this down you ta he lowered his voice youre in the shield what makes you think that now jamesie smiled hows davey by the way davey davey soutar said rebus you two know each other dont you i know davey he blinked christ you are in the shield hang on did i see you at the parade i bloody hope so now jamesie nodded slowly i thought i saw you youre a sharp lad jamesie theres a bit of your dad in you jamesie started at this hell be here in five minutes you dont want him to see us youre right he doesnt know about the shield then of course not jamesie looked slighted only sometimes the lads tell their dads not me rebus nodded youre a good one jamesie weve got our eyes on you really absolutely rebus supped from his pint shame about billy jamesie became a statue the glass inches from his lips he recovered with effort pardon good lad say nothing rebus took another sup good parade wasnt it oh aye the best ever been to belfast jamesie looked like he was having trouble keeping up with the conversation rebus hoped he was naw he said at last i was there a few days ago jamesie its a proud city a lot of good people there our people rebus was wondering how long can i keep this up a couple of teenagers probably a year or two beneath the legal drinking age had already come to the stairs looking for jamesie to join them true jamesie said we cant let them down absolutely not remember billy cunningham jamesie put down his glass is this his voice had become a little less confident is this a some sort of warning rebus patted the young mans arm no no youre all right jamesie its just that the polis are sniffing around it was amazing where a bit of confident bulls keech could get you im no squealer said jamesie the way he said it rebus knew not like billy definitely not rebus was nodding to himself when the doors burst open and gavin macmurray swaggered in a couple of his generals squeezing through the doorway in his wake rebus became just another punter at the bar as macmurray slung a heavy arm around his sons neck awright jamesie boy fine dad my shout three exportthen bring them up back aye no bother dad jamesie watched the three men walk to the stairs he turned towards his confidant but john rebus had already left the bar every chain no matter how strong has one link weaker than the rest rebus had hopes of jamesie macmurray as he walked out of the merchants he was halfway to his car when he saw caro rattray walking towards him you were going to call me she said works been a bit hectic she looked back at the pub call that work do you he smiled do you live here on the canongate ive just been walking my dog your dog there was no sign of a leash never mind the animal she shrugged i dont actually like dogs i just like the idea of walking them so i have an imaginary dog whats he called sandy rebus looked down at her feet good boy sandy actually sandys a girl hard to tell at this distance and i dont talk to her she smiled im not mad you know right you just go walking with a pretend dog so what are you and sandy doing now going home and having a drink fancy joining us rebus thought about it sure he said drive or walk lets walk said caroline rattray i dont want sandy shedding on your seats she lived in a nicely furnished flat tidy but not obsessive there was a grandfather clock in the hall a family heirloom her surname was engraved on the brass face a dividing wall had been taken away so that the living room had windows to front and back a book lay open on the sofa next to a halffinished box of shortbread solitary pleasures thought rebus youre not married e said god no boyfriend she smiled again funny word that isnt it especially when you get to my age i mean a boyfriend should be in his teens or twenties gentleman friend then he persisted doesnt have the same connotations though does it rebus sighed i know i know she said never argue with an advocate rebus looked out of the back window onto a drying green overhead the few clouds were basking in the space they had sandys digging up your flower bed what do you want to drink tea please sure ive only got decaf thats perfect he meant it while she made noises in the kitchen he walked through the living room diningtable and chairs and wall units at the back sofa chairs bookcases towards the front it was a nice room from the small front window he looked down onto slowwalking tourists and a shop selling tartan teddybears this is a nice part of town he said not really meaning it are you kidding ever tried parking round here in the summer i never try parking anywhere in the summer he moved away from the window a flute and some sheet music sat on a spindly musicstand in one corner on a unit were small framed photos of the usual gaptoothed kids and kindlooking old people family she said coming back into the room she lit a cigarette took two deep puffs on it then stubbed it into an ashtray exhaling and wafting the smoke away with her hand i hate smoking indoors she explained then why do it i smoke when im nervous she smiled slyly and returned to the kitchen rebus following the aroma of the cigarette mingled with the richer aroma of the perfume she wore had she just applied some it hadnt been this strong before the kitchen was small functional the whole flat had the look of recent but not radical redecoration milk please no sugar their conversation he realised was assuming a studied banality the kettle clicked off can you take the mugs she had already poured a splash of milk into either plain yellow mug there wasnt much room at all in the kitchen something rebus realised as he went to pick up the mugs he was right beside her as she stirred the teabags in the pot her head was bent down affording a view of the long black hairs curling from her nape and the nape of her neck itself she half turned her face towards him smiling her eyes finally finding his then she moved her body around too rebus kissed her forehead first then her cheek she had closed her eyes he burrowed his fare in her neck inhaling deeply shampoo and perfume and skin he kissed her again then came up for air caroline opened her eyes slowly well now she said he felt suddenly as though hed been flung down a tunnel watching the circle of light at the entrance shrink to a full stop he tried desperately to think of something to say there was perfume in his lungs well now she repeated what did that mean was she pleased shocked bemused she turned back to the teapot and put its lid on i better go rebus said she became very still he couldnt see her face not enough of it hadnt i ive no commitments john her hands were resting lightly on the work surface either side of the pot what about you he knew what she meant she meant patience theres someone he said i know dr curt told me im sorry caroline i shouldnt have done that what she turned to him kissed you i didnt mind she gave him her smile again ill never drink a whole pot of tea on my own he nodded realising he was still holding the mugs ill take them through he walked out of the kitchen on unsteady legs his heart shimmying hed kissed her why had he kissed her he hadnt meant to but it had happened it was real now the photographs smiled at him as he put the mugs down on a small table which already had coffeerings on it what was she doing in the kitchen he stared at the doorway willing her to come willing her not to come she came the teapot was on a tray now a teacosy in the shape of a king charles spaniel keeping in the heat is sandy a king charles same days how strong do you like it as it comes she smiled again and poured handed him a mug then took one herself and sat in her chair she didnt look very comfortable rebus sat opposite her on the sofa not resting against the back of it but leaning forward theres some shortbread she said no thanks so she said any progress on nemo i think so this was good they were talking sas is a loyalist support group theyre buying and shipping arms and the victim in mary kings close he was killed by paramilitaries nothing to do with his father rebus shrugged again theres been another murder it could be linked that man they found in the cellar rebus nodded nobody told me they were connected its being kept a bit quiet he was working undercover how was he found the flat was having some building work done one of the labourers opened the cellar door thats a coincidence what there was building work going on in mary kings close too not the same firm youve checked rebus frowned not me personally but yes weve checked oh well she took another cigarette from her packet and made to light it but stopped herself she took the cigarette from her mouth and examined it john she said if youd like to we can make love any time you want there were none of caffertys men waiting for him outside patiences flat nothing to delay him hed been hoping for the weasel right now he felt ready for some handson with the weasel but it wasnt caffertys man he was angry with inside the long hallway was cool and dark the only light coming from three small panes of glass above the front door patience he called hoping shed be out her car was outside but that didnt mean anything he wasted to run a bath steep in it he turned on both taps then went to the bedroom picked up the phone and rang brian holmes at home holmess partner nell picked up the call its john rebus he told her she said nothing just put the receiver to one side and went off to fetch brian there was no love lost these days between rebus and nell stapleton something holmes himself realised but couldnt bring himself to query yes sir brian those two building companies mary kings close and st stephen street how thoroughly have we checked them pretty well and weve crossreferenced theres no connection between them no why can you check them again yourself i can humour me then do it monday anything in particular i should be looking for no he paused yes start with casual labour i thought you wanted siobhan and me to go see murdock i did ill take your place have a nice evening rebus put down the phone and went back to the bathroom there was good pressure in the pipes and the bath was practically full already he turned of the cold and reduced the hot to a trickle the kitchen was through the living room and he fancied some milk from the fridge patience was in the kitchen chopping vegetables i didnt know you were here rebus said i live here remember this is my flat yes i know she was angry with him he opened the fridge door took out the milk and managed to pass her without touching her he put the milk on the breakfast table and got a glass from the draining board what are you cooking why the interest you never eat here patience she came to the sink scraping peelings into a plastic container it would all go onto her compost heap she turned to him running a bath yes its giorgio isnt it sorry that perfume she leaned close sniffed his shirt giorgio of beverly hills patience youll have to tell me about her one of these days you think im seeing someone she threw the small sharp kitchen knife at the sink and ran from the room rebus stood there listening until he heard the front door slam he poured the milk down the sink he took back the videos still unwatched then went for a drive the dell bar sat on an unlovely stretch of main road outside the garb it didnt get much passing trade but there was a line of cars parked outside rebus slowed as he drove past he could go in but what good would it do then he saw something and pulled his car up kerbside next to him a van was parked with flyposters pasted on its sides the posters advertised the play which was soon td go on in the garb gang hut the theatre group was called active resistance some of them must be drinking inside a few vehicles further on was the car he wanted he bent down at the drivers side window ken smylie tried to ignore him then wound the window down angrily what are you doing here he asked i was about to ask the same said rebus smylie nodded towards the dell he had his hands on the steeringwheel they werent just resting on it they were squeezing it maybe theres someone drinking fn there killed calumn maybe there is rebus said quietly he didnt fancy being smylies punchbag what are you going to do about it smylie stared at him im going to sit here and then what break the neck of every man who comes out you know the score ken leave me alone look ken rebus broke off as the dells door swung open and two punters sauntered out cigarettes in mouths sharing some joke between them look he said i know how you feel ive got a brother too but this isnt doing any good just go away rebus sighed straightened up fair enough then but if theres any hassle radio for assistance just do that for me okay smylie almost smiled there wont be any trouble believe me rebus did the way he believed tv advertising and weather reports he walked back towards his car the two drinkers were getting into their vauxhall as the passenger yanked open his door it nearly caught rebus the man didnt bother to apologise he gave rebus a look like it was rebuss fault then got into his seat rebus had seen the man before he was about fiveten broad in the chest wearing jeans and black tshirt and a denim jacket he had a face shiny with drink sweat on his forehead and in his wavy brown hair but it wasnt until rebus was back in his own car and halfway home that he put a name to the face the man yates had told him about shown him a photo of the exuvf man theyd lost in glasgow alan fowler drinking in the garb like he owned the place maybe he did at that rebus retraced his route cruising some of the narrow streets checking parked cars but hed lost the vauxhall and ken smylies car was no longer outside the dell monday morning at st leonards chief inspector lauderdale was having to explain a joke hed just made see the squids so meek hans cant bring himself to thump it either he caught sight of rebus walking into the murder room the prodigal returns tell us whats it like working with the glamour boys its all right said rebus ive already had one return flight out of them lauderdale clearly had not been expecting this so its true then he said recovering well theyre all high flyers over at scs he captured a few laughs for his trouble rebus didnt mind being the butt he knew the way it was in a murder inquiry you worked as a team lauderdale as team manager had the job of boosting morale keeping things lively rebus wasnt part of the team not exactly so he was open to the occasional low tackle with studs showing he went to his desk which more than ever resembled a rubbish tip and tried to see if any messages had been left for him he had spent the rest of his weekend when not avoiding patience trying to track down abernethy or anyone else in special branch whod talk to him rebus had left message after message so far without success di flower teeth showing advanced on rebuss desk weve got a confession he said to the stabbing in st stephen street want to talk to the man rebus was wary who is it unstable from dunstable hes off his trolley this time keeps asking for a curry and talking about cars i told him hed have to settle for a bridie and his bus fare youre all heart flower rebus saw that siobhan clarke had finished getting ready excuse me ready sir clarke asked plenty ready lets go before lauderdale or flower can think of another gag at my expense not that their jokes ever cost me more than small change they took clarkes cherryred renault following bus after bus west through the slow streets until they could take a faster route by way of the grange passing the turnoff to arch gowries residence and you said the grange didnt lead anywhere clarke said powering through the gears true enough it was the quickest route between st leonards and morningside it was just that as a policeman rebus had never had much cause to heed morningside that genteel backwater where old ladies in white face powder like something out of a restoration play sat in tea shops and pondered aloud their next choice from the cakestand morningside wasnt exclusive the way grange was there were students in morningside living at the top of roadside tenements and people on the dole in rented flats housing too many bodies keeping the rent down but when you thought of morningside you thought of old ladies and that peculiar pronunciation they had like theyd all understudied maggie smith in the prime of miss jean brodie the glaswegians joked about it they said morningside people thought sex was what the coal came in rebus doubted there were coal fires in morningside any longer though there would certainly be some woodburning stoves brought in by the young professionals who probably outnumbered the old ladies these days though they werent nearly so conspicuous it was to serve these young professionals as well as to cater for local businesses that a thriving little computer shop had opened near the corner of comiston road and morningside drive can i help you the male assistant asked not looking up from his keyboard is millie around rebus asked through the arch thanks there was a single step up to the arch through which was another part of the shop specialising in contract work and business packages rebus almost didnt recognise millie though there was no one else there she was seated at a terminal thinking about something tapping her finger against her lips it took her a second to place rebus she hit a key the screen went blank and she rose from her seat she was dressed in an immaculate combination of brilliant white skirt and bright yellow blouse with a single string of crystals around her neck i just cant shake you lot off can i she did not sound unhappy indeed she seemed almost too pleased to see them her smile immense can i fix you some coffee not for me thanks millie looked to siobhan clarke who shook her head mind if i make some for myself she went to the arch steve cuppa wouldnt say no she came back no but he might say please just once there was a cubbyhole at the back of the shop leading to a toilet cubicle in the cubbyhole sat a percolator a packet of ground coffee and several grimlooking mugs millie got to work while she was occupied rebus asked his first question billys mum tells us you were good enough to pack up all his stuff its still sitting in his room three bin liners not a lot to show for a life is it what about his motorbike she smiled that thing you could hardly call it a bike a friend of his asked if he could have it billys mum said she didnt mind you liked billy i liked him a lot he was genuine you never got bullshit with billy if he didnt like you hed tell you to your face i hear his dads some kind of villain they didnt know one another she slapped the coffeemaker this thing takes ages is that what you want to ask me about billys dad just a few general questions before he died did billy seem worried about anything ive been asked already more than once she looked at clarke you first and then that big bastard with the voice like something caught in a mousetrap rebus smiled it was a fair description of ken smylie billy was just the same as ever thats all i can say did he get along okay with mr murdock what sort of question is that christ youre scraping the barrel if you think murdock wouldve done anything to billy you know what its like in mixed flats though where theres a couple plus one jealousy can be a problem an electric buzzer announced the arrival of a customer they could hear steve talking to someone weve got to ask millie clarke said soothingly no you dont its just that you like asking so much for the good mood even steve and the customer seemed to be listening the coffee machine started dolloping boiled water into the filter look said rebus lets calm down eh if you like we can come back we could come to the flat it never ends does it what is this trying to get a confession out of me she clasped her hands together yes i killed him it was me slfe held her hands out wrists prominent ive forgotten my cuffs rebus said smiling millie looked to siobhan clarke who shrugged great i cant even get myself arrested she sloshed coffee into a mug and i thought it was the easiest thing in the world are we really so bad millie she smiled looked down at her mug i suppose not sorry about that youre under a lot of strain said siobhan clarke we appreciate that maybe if we sit down eh so they sat at millies desk like customers and assistant clarke who liked computers had actually picked up a couple of brochures thats got a twentyfive megahertz microprocessor millie said pointing to one of the brochures what size memory four meg ram i think but you can select a hard disk up to onesixty does this one have a chip good girl thought rebus clarke was calming millie down taking her mind off both billy cunningham and her recent outburst steve brought the customer through to show him a certain screen he gave the three of them a look full of curiosity sorry steve said millie forgot your coffee her smile would not have passed a polygraph rebus waited till steve and the customer had retreated did billy ever bring friends back to the flat ive given you a list rebus nodded nobody else youve thought of since no can i try you with a couple of names davey soutar and jamesie macmurray last names dont mean much in our flat davey and jamesie i dont think so rebus willed her to look at him she did so then locked away again quickly youre lying he thought they left the shop ten minutes later clarke looked up and down the pavement want to go see murdock now i dont think so what do you suppose it was she didnt want us to see sorry you look up see the police coming towards you why do you blank your computer screen pronto and then come flying off your seat all bounce and flounce you think there was something on the computer she didnt want us to see i thought i just said that said rebus he got into the renaults passenger seat and waited for clarke jamesie macmurray knows about the shield they killed billy so why arent we pulling him in weve nothing on him nothing that would stick thats not the way to work it she looked at him too mundane he shook his head like a golf course too full of holes we need to get him scared she thought about this why did they kill billy i think he was about to talk maybe hed threatened to come to us could he be that stupid maybe he had insurance something he thought would save his skin siobhan clarke looked at him it didnt work she said back at st leonards there was a message for him to call kilpatrick some magazine kilpatrick said is about to run with a story about calumn smylies murder specifically that he was working undercover at the time how did they get hold of that maybe someone talked maybe they just burrowed deep enohgh whatever a certain local reporter has made no friends for herself not mairle henderson thats the name you know her dont you not particularly rebus lied he knew kilpatrick was fishing if someone in the notoriously tightupped scs was blabbing who better to point the finger at than the new boy he phoned the news desk while siobhan fetched them coffee mairie henderson please what since when right thanks he put the phone down shes resigned he said not quite believing it since last week shes gone freelance apparently good for her said siobhan handing over a cup but rebus wasnt so sure he called mairies home number but got her answering machine its message was succinct im busy with an assignment so i cant promise a quick reply unless youre offering work if you are offering work leave your number you can see how dedicated i am here comes the beep rebus waited for it mairie its john rebus here are three numbers you can get me on he gave her st leonards fettes and patiences flat not feeling entirely confident about this last wondering if any message from a woman would reach him with patience on the intercept then he made an internal call to the stations liaison officer have you seen mairie henderson around not for a wee while the paper seems to have switched her for someone else a right dozy wee nyafl thanks rebus thought about the last time hed seen her in the corridor after lauderdales conference she hadnt mentioned any story or any plan of going freelance he made one more call external this time it was to dci kilpatrick what is it john that magazine sir the one doing the story about calumn smylie whats it called its some london rag there were sounds of papers being shuffled yes here it is snoop snoop rebus looked to siobhan clarke who nodded signalling shed heard of it right thank you sir he put the receiver down before kilpatrick could ask any questions want me to phone them and ask rebus nodded he saw brian holmes come into the room just the man he said holmes saw them and wiped imaginary sweat from his brow so said rebus what did you get from the builders everything but an estimate for repointing my house he took out his notebook where do you want me to start davey soutar had agreed to meet rebus in the community hall on his way to the garb rebus tried not to think about soutar he thought instead about building firms all brian holmes had been able to tell him was that the two firms were no cowboys and werent admitting to use of casual untaxed labour siobhan clarkes call to the office of snoop magazine had been more productive mairie hendersons piece which they intended publishing in their next issue had not been commissioned specially it was part of a larger story she was working on for an american magazine why rebus wondered would an american magazine be interested in the death of an edinburgh copper he thought he had a pretty good idea he drove into the garb car park bumped his car up onto the grass and headed slowly past the garages towards the community hall the theatre group hadnt bothered with the car park either maybe someone had had a go at their van it was now parked close by the halls front doors rebus parked next to it its the filth someone said there were half a dozen teenagers on the roof of the building staring down at him and more of them sitting and standing around the doors davey soutar had not come alone they let rebus past it was like walking through hate inside the hall there was an argument going on i never touched it it was there a minute ago you calling me a liar pal three men whod been constructing a set on the stage had stopped to watch davey soutar was talking with another man they were standing close faces inches apart clenched fists and puffedout chests is there a problem rebus said peter cave whod been sitting with head in hands now stood up no problem he said lightly the third man thought there was the wee bastard he said meaning davey soutar just lifted a packet of fags soutar looked ready to hit something it was interesting that he didnt hit his accuser rebus didnt know what hed been expecting from the theatre company he certainly hadnt been expecting this the accuser was tall and wiry with long greasy hair and several days growth of beard he didnt look in the least scared of soutar whose reputation must surely have preceded him nor did the workers on the stage look unwilling to enter any fray he reached into his pocket and brought out a fresh pack of twenty which he handed to davey soutar here he said take these and give the gentleman back his ciggies soutar turned on him like a zoo leopard not happy with its cage i dont need your the roar faded he looked at the faces around him then he laughed a hysterical giggling laugh he slapped his bare chest and shook his head then took the cigarettes from rebus and tossed another pack onto the stage rebus turned to the accuser whats your name jim hay the accent was west coast well jim why dont you take those cigarettes outside have a tenminute break jim hay looked ready to protest but then thought better of it he gestured to his crew and they followed him outside rebus could hear them getting into the van he turned his attention to davey soutar and peter cave im surprised you came said soutar lighting up im full of surprises me only last time i saw you here you were heading for the hills you owe peter an apology by the way soutar had changed completely he looked like he was enjoying himself like he hadnt lost his temper in weeks i dont think thats strictly necessary peter cave said into the silence apology accepted said rebus he dragged over a chair and sat down soutar decided this was a good idea he found a chair for himself and sat with a hard mans slump legs wide apart hands stuffed into the tight pockets of his denims cigarette hanging from his lips rebus wanted a cigarette but he wasnt going to ask for one so whats the problem inspector soutar had agreed to a meeting here but hadnt mentioned peter cave would be present maybe it was coincidence whatever rebus didnt mind an audience cave looked tired pale there was no question who was in charge who had power over whom i just have a few things to ask theres no question of charges or anything criminal all right soutar obliged with a grunt examining the laces of his basketball boots he was shirtless again still wearing the worn denim jacket it was filthy and had been decorated with pen drawings and darkinked words names mostly grease and dirt were erasing most of the messages and symbols a few of which had already been covered with fresh hieroglyphs in thicker darker ink soutar slid a hand from his pocket and ran it down his chest rubbing the few fair curling hairs over his breast bone ire was giving rebus a friendly look his lips slightly parted rebus wanted to smash him in the face i can walk any time i want he said to rebus any time the chair grated against the floor as soutar pushed it back and stood up then he laughed and sat down again wriggling to get comfortable making sure his crotch was visible ask me a question then he said you know the orange loyal brigade sure that was easy try another but rebus had turned to cave have you heard of it too i cant say i hey its me the questions are for in a second mr soutar davey soutar liked that mr soutar only the dole office and the census taker had ever called him mr the orange loyal brigade mr cave is an extreme hard line protestant group a small force but an organised one based in east central scotland soutar confirmed this with a nod the brigade were kicked out of the orange lodge for being too extreme this may give you some measure of them do you know what theyre committed to mr cave maybe mr soutar can answer mr again soutar chuckled hating the papes he said mr soutars right rebuss eyes hadnt moved from caves since hed first turned to him they hate catholics papes said soutar leftfooters tigs bogmen paddies and a few more names beside added rebus he left a measured pause youre a roman catholic arent you as if hed forgotten cave merely nodded while soutar slid his eyes sideways to look at him suddenly rebus turned to soutar whos head of the brigade davey er ian paisleyl he laughed and got a smile from rebus no but really i havent a clue no you dont know gavin macmurray macmurray is he the one with the garage in currie thats him hes the supreme commander of the orange loyal brigade ill take your word for it and his sons the provostmarshall lad called jamesie be a year or two younger than you oh aye rebus shook his head short term memory loss thats what a bad diet does eh all the chips and crisps the booze you put away not exactly brain food is it i know what its like on estates like the garb you eat rubbish and you inject yourselves with anything you can get your paws on your bodyll wither and die probably before your brain does the conversation had clearly taken an unexpected turn what are you talking about soutar yelled i dont do drugs im as fit as fuck pal rebus looked at soutars exposed chest whatever you say davey soutar sprang to his feet the chair tumbling behind him he threw off his jacket and stood there chest inflated pulling both arms up and in to show the swell of muscle you could punch me in the guts and i wouldnt flinch rebus could believe it too the stomach was flat except for ripples of musculature looking so solid they might have been sculpted from marble soutar relaxed his arms held them in front of him look no tracks drugs are for mugs rebus held up a pacifying hand youve proved your point davey soutar stared at him for a moment longer then laughed and picked his jacket up off the floor interesting tattoos by the way they were the usual homemade jobs in blue ink with one larger professional one on the right upper arm it showed the red hand of ulster with the words no sur render beneath below it the selfinflicted tattoos were just letters and messages uvf uda ftp and sas rebus waited till soutar had put on his jacket you know jamesie macmurray he stated do i you bumped into him last saturday when the brigade was marching on princes street you were there for the march but you had to leave however you said hello to your old friend first you knew mr cave was a catholic right from the start didnt you i mean he didnt hide the fact soutar was looking confused the questions were all over the place it was hard to keep up pete was straight with us he admitted he was staying on his feet and that didnt bother you i mean you came to his club bringing your gang with you and the catholic gang came along too what did jamesie say about that its nothing to do with him you could see it was a good thing though eh meeting the catholic gang divvying up the ground between you its the way it works in ulster thats what youve heard who told you jamesie his dad his dad or was it the shield i never even davey soutar stopped he was breathing hard as he pointed at rebus youre in shits up past the point of breathing when i must be standing on your shoulders come on davey its mr soutar mr soutar then rebus had his hands open palms up he was sitting back in his chair rocking it on its back legs come on sit down its no big deal everybody knows about the shield knows youre part of it everybody except mr cave here he turned to peter cave lets just say that the shield is even more extreme than the orange loyal brigade the shield collects money mostly by violence and extortion and it sends arms to northern ireland soutar was shaking his head youre nothing youve got nothing but youve got something davey youve got your hate and your anger he turned to cave again see mr cave youve got to be asking how come davey puts up with a committed worker for the church of rome or the whore of rome as davey himself might put it a question that has to be answered when he looked round soutar was on the stage he pushed over the sets kicking them stomping them then jumped down again and made for the doors his face was orange with anger was billy a friend too davey that stopped him dead billy cunningham i mean soutar was on the move daveyl youve forgotten your fags but davey soutar was out the door and screaming things which were unintelligible rebus lit a cigarette for himself that laddies got too much testosterone for his own good he said to cave look whos talking rebus shrugged just an act mr cave method acting you might say he blew out a plume of smoke cave was staring at his hands which were clasped in his lap you need to know what youve gotten into cave looked up you think i condone sectarian hate no my theorys much simpler i think you get off on violence and young men youre sick then maybe all you are mr cave is misguided get out while you can a policemans largesse never lasts he walked over to cave and bent down speaking quietly theyve swallowed you youre in the pit of the garbs stomach you can still crawl out but maybe theres not as much time as you think rebus patted caves cheek it was cold and soft like chicken from the fridge look at yourself some time rebus you might find youd make a bloody good terrorist yourself thing is id never be tempted what about you cave stood up and walked past him towards the doors then he walked through them and kept going rebus blew smoke from his nose then sat on the edge of the stage finishing the cigarette maybe hed tripped soutars fuse too early if it had come out right hed have learned something more about the shield at the moment it was all cables and coiled springs junctions from which spread different coloured wires hard to defuse when you didnt know which wire to attack first the doors were opening again and he looked up davey soutar was standing there behind him there were others more than a dozen of them soutar was breathing hard rebus glanced at his watch and hoped it was right there was an emergency exit at the other end of the hall but where did rebus go from there instead he climbed onto the stage and watched them advance soutar wasnt saying anything the whole procession took place in silence except for breathing and the shuffle of feet on the floor they were at the front of the stage now rebus picked up a length of wood part of the broken set soutar his eyes on the wood began to climb onto the stage he stopped when he heard the sirens he froze for a moment staring up at rebus the policeman was smiling think id come here without my cavalry davey the sirens were drawing closer your call davey rebus said managing to sound relaxed if you want another riot heres your chance but all davey soutar did was ease himself back off the stage he stood there eyes wide and unblinking as if sheer will of thought might cause rebus to implode a final snarl and he turned and walked away they followed him all of them some looked back at rebus he tried not to look too relieved lit another cigarette instead soutar was crazy a force gone mad but he was strong too rebus was just beginning to realise how very strong he was he went home exhausted that evening home by now being a very loose term for patiences flat he was still shaking a bit when soutar had left the hall that first time hed taken it all out on rebuss car there were fresh dents a smashed headlamp a chipped windscreen the actors in the van looked like theyd witnessed a frenzy then rebus had told them about their sets hed thought about the theatre group on his way under police escort out of the garb theyd been parked outside the dell the night hed seen the ulsterman there he still had their flyer the one that had doubled as a paper plane at st leonards he found them in the fringe programme active resistance theatre active as opposed to passive rebus supposed he placed a couple of calls to glasgow someone would get back to him the rest of the day was a blur as he was locking what was left of his car he sensed a shape behind him damn you weaselface but he turned to see caroline rattray weaselface i thought you were someone else she put her arms round him well im not im me remember me im the one whos being trying to phone you for god knows how long i know you got my messages because someone in your office told me that would be ormiston or flower or anyone else with a grudge christ caro he pulled away from her you must be crazy for coming here she looked around this is where she lives she sounded completely unconcerned rebus didnt need this his head felt like it was splitting open above the eyes he needed to bathe and to stop thinking and it would take a great effort to stop him thinking about this case youre tired she said rebus wasnt listening he was too busy looking at patiences parked car at her gateway then along the street willing her not to appear well im tired too john her voice was rising but theres always room in the day for a little consideration keep your voice down he hissed dont you dare tell me what to do christ caro he squeezed shut his eyes and she relented for a moment it was long enough to appraise his physical and psychic state youre exhausted she concluded she smiled and touched his face im sorry john i just thought youd been avoiding me whod want to do that caro though he was starting to wonder what about a drink she said not tonight all right she said pouting a moment ago she had been all tempest and cannon fire and now she was a surface as calm as any doldrums could produce tomorrow fine eight oclock then in the caly bar the caly being the caledonian hotel rebus nodded assent great he said see you then she leaned into him again kissing his lips he drew away as quickly as he could remembering her perfume one more waft of that and patience would go nuclear see you caro he watched her get into her car then walked quickly down the steps to the flat the first thing he did was run a bath he looked at himself in the mirror and got a shock he was looking at his father in later years his father had grown a short grey beard there was grey in rebuss stubble too i look like an old man there was a knock at the bathroom door have you eaten patience called not yet have you no shall i stick something in the microwave sure great he added foambath to the water pizza whatever she didnt sound too bad that was the thing about being a doctor you saw so much pain every day it was easy to shrug off the more minor ailments like arguments at home and suspected infidelities rebus stripped off his clothes and dumped them in the laundry basket patience knocked again by the way what are you doing tomorrow you mean tomorrow night he called back yes nothing i know of i might be working you better not be ive invited the bremners to dinner oh good said rebus putting his foot in the water without checking the temperature the water was scalding he lifted the foot out again and screamed silently at the mirror they had breakfast together talking around things their conversation that of acquaintances rather then lovers neither spoke his or her thoughts we scots rebus thought were not very good at going public we store up our true feelings like fuel for long winter nights of whisky and recrimination so little of us ever reaches the surface its a wonder we exist at all another cup please patience youll be here tonight she said you wont be working it was neither question nor order not explicitly so he tried phoning caro from fettes but now she was the one having messages left for her one on her answering machine at home one with a colleague at her office he couldnt just say im not coming not even to a piece of recording tape so hed just asked her to get in touch caro rattray elegant apparently available and mad about him there was something of the mad in her something vertiginous you spent time with her and you were standing on a cliff edge and where was caro she was standing right behind you when his phone rang he leapt for it inspector rebus the voice was male familiar speaking its lachlan murdock lachlan no wonder he used his last name what can i do for you mr murdock you saw millie recently didnt you yes why shes gone gone where i dont know what the hell did you say to her are you at your flat yes im coming over he went alone knowing he should take some backup but loath to approach anyone out of the four ormiston blackwood bloody claverhouse smylie smylie would still be his choice but smylie was as predictable as the edinburgh weather even now turning overcast the pavements were still festival busy but not for much longer and as recompense september would be quiet it was the citys secret month a retreat from public into private as if to reassure him the cloud swept away again and the sun appeared he wound down his window until the bus fumes made him roll it back up again the back of the bus advertised the local newspaper which led him to thoughts of mairie henderson he needed to find her and it wasnt often a policeman thought that about a reporter he parked the car as close to murdocks tenement as he could find a space pressed the intercom button beside the main door and got the answering buzz which unlocked the door your feet made the same sound on every tenement stairwell like sandpaper on a church floor murdock had opened the door to his flat rebus walked in lachlan murdock did not look in good fettle his hair was sprouting in clumps from his head and he pulled on his beard like it was a fake hed glued on too well they were in the living room rebus sat down in front of the tv it was where millie had been sitting the first time hed visited the ashtray was still there but the sleeping bag had goneand so had millie i havent seen her since yesterday murdock was standing and showed no sign of sitting down he walked to the window looked out came back to the fireplace his eyes were everywhere that wasnt rebus morning or evening morning i got back last night and shed packed and left packed not everything just a holdall i thought maybe shed gone to see a pal she does that sometimes not this time murdock shook his head i phoned steve at her work this morning and he said the police had been to see her yesterday a young woman and an older man i thought of you steve said she was in a terrible state afterwards shed to come home early what did you say to her just a few questions about billy billy the dismissive shake of the head told rebus something she got on better with billy than you did mr murdock i didnt dislike the guy was there anything between the two of them but murdock wasnt about to answer that he paced the room again flapping his arms as though attempting flight she hasnt been the same since he died it was upsetting for her yes it was but to run off can i see her room what rebus smiled its what we usually do when someone goes missing murdock shook his head again she wouldnt want that what if she comes back and sees someones been through her stuff no i cant let you do that murdock looked ready for physical resistance if necessary i cant force you rebus said calmly tell me a bit more about billy this quietened murdock like what did he like computers billy he liked video games so long as they were violent i dont know i suppose he was interested in computers he could work one just about what are you getting at just interested three people sharing a flat two of them work with computers the third doesnt murdock nodded youre wondering what we had in common look around the city inspector youll see flats full of people whore only there because they need a room or the rent money in an ideal world i wouldnt have needed someone in the spare room at all rebus nodded so what should we do about miss docherty what you called me i came where do we go from here murdock shrugged normally wed wait another day or so before listing her missing he paused unless theres reason to suspect foul play murdock seemed lost in thought then recovered lets wait another day then he started nodding maybe im overreacting i just when steve told me im sure it wasnt anything i said to her rebus lied getting to his feet can i have another look at billys room while im here its been gutted just to refresh my memory murdock said nothing thanks said rebus the small room had indeed been gutted the bed stripped of duvet and sheet and pillowcase though the pillow still lay there it was stained brown leaking feathers the bare mattress was pale blue with similar brown patches there seemed a little more space in the room but not much still rebus doubted murdock would have any trouble finding a new tenant not with the student season approaching he opened the wardrobe to a clanging of empty wire hangers there was a fresh sheet of newspaper on the floor he closed the wardrobe door between the corner of the bed and the wardrobe there was a clear patch of carpet it lay hard up against the skirtingboard beneath the still unwashed window rebus crouched down and tugged at the carpets edge it wasnt tacked and lifted an inch or so he ran his fingers underneath it finding nothing still crouched he lifted the mattress but saw only bedsprings and the carpet beneath thick balls of dust and hair marking the furthest reach of the hoover he stood up glancing at the bare walls there were small rips in the wallpaper where blutak had been removed he looked more closely at one small pattern of these the wallpaper had come away in two longer strips wasnt this where the pennant had hung yes you could see the hole made by the drawingpin the pennant had hung from a maroon cord which had been pinned to the wall meaning the pennant had been hiding these marks they didnt look so old the lining paper beneath was clean and fresh as though the sellotape had been peeled off recently rebus put his fingers to the two stripes they were about three inches apart and three inches long whatever had been taped there it had been square and thin rebus knew exactly what would fit that description out in the hall murdock was waiting to leave sorry to keep you waiting sir rebus said the canton sounded like another old ladies tearoom but in fact was a transport cafe with famed large helpings when mairie henderson finally got back to rebus he suggested taking her to lunch there it was on the shore at newhaven facing the firth of forth just about where that broad inlet became inseparable from the north sea lorries bypassing edinburgh or heading to leith from the north would usually pause for a break outside the carlton you saw them in a line by the sea wall between starbank road and pier place the drivers thought the carlton well worth a detour even if other road users and the police didnt always appreciate their sentiments inside the carlton was a clean welllit place and as hot as a truck engine for air conditioning they kept the front door wedged open you never ate alone which was why rebus phoned in advance and booked a table for two the one between the counter and the toilets he specified did i hear you right book a table you heard me nobodys booked a table all the years weve been open the chef held the phone away from his face hiy maggie theres somebody here wants tae book a table cut the shite sammy its john rebus speaking special occasion is it mr rebus anniversary ill bake yis a cake twelve oclock said rebus and make sure its the table i asked for okay yes sir so when rebus walked into the carlton and sammy saw him sammy whipped a dishtowel off the stove and came sauntering between the tables the towel over his arm your table is ready sir if youll follow me the drivers were grinning a few of them offering encouragement maggie stood there holding a pillar of empty white plates and attempted a curtsy as rebus went past the small formicatopped table was laid for two with a bit of card folded in half and the word reserved written in blue biro there was a clean sauce bottle into the neck of which someone had pushed a plastic carnation he saw mairie look through the cafe window then come in through the door the drivers looked up room here sweetheart hiy hen sit on my lap no his they grinned through the smoke cigarettes never leaving their mouths one of them ate camelstyle lower jaw moving in sideways rotation while his upper jaw chewed down he reminded rebus so strongly of ormiston he had to look away instead he looked at mairie why not everyone else was they were staring without shame at her bum as she moved between the tables true to form maine had worn her shortest skirt at least rebus hoped it was her shortest and it was tight one of those black lycra numbers she wore it with a baggy white tshirt and thick black tights whose vertical seams showed pinpricks of white leg flesh shed pushed her sunglasses onto the top of her head and swung her shoulderbag onto the floor as she took her seat i see were in the members enclosure it took money but i thought it was worth it rebus studied her while she studied the wallboard which constituted the carltons menu you look good he lied actually she looked exhausted thanks i wish i could say the same rebus winced i looked as good as you at your age even in a miniskirt she leaned down to lift a pack of cigarettes from her bag giving rebus a view of her lace edged bra down the front of her tshirt when she came up again he was frowning okay i wont smoke it stunts your growth and speaking of health warnings what about that story of yours but maggie came over so they went through the intricacies of ordering were out of moet shandy maggie said what was that about mairie asked after maggie had gone nothing he said you were about to tell me was i she smiled how much do you know i know youve been working on a story a chunk of which youve sold to snoop but the bulk of which is destined for some us magazine well you know quite a lot then you took the story to your own paper first she sighed of course i did but they wouldnt print it the company lawyers thought it was close to libel who were you libelling organisations rather than individuals i had a blowup with my editor about it and handed in my resignation his line was that the lawyers were paid to be overcautious i bet their fees arent overcautious which reminded him caro rattray he still had to contact her i was planning on going freelance anyway just not quite so soon but at least im starting with a strong story a few months back i got a letter from a new york journalist his names jump cantona sounds like a car yes a fourbyfour thats just what i thought anyway jumps a well known writer over there investigations with a capital i but then of course its easier in the us hows that you can go further before someone starts issuing writs plus youve got more freedom of information jump needed someone this end following up a few leads his name comes first in the main article but any spinoffs i write i get sole billing so what have you found a can of worms maggie was coming with their food she heard mairies closing words and gave her a cold look as she placed the fryup in front of her for rebus there was a halfportion of lasagne and a green salad how did cantona find you rebus asked someone i met when i was on a journalism course in new york this guy knew cantona was looking for someone who could do some digging in scotland i was the obvious choice she attacked four chips with her fork chewing she reached for the salt vinegar and tomato sauce after momentary consideration she poured some brown sauce on as well i knew youd do that rebus said and it still disgusts me you should see me with mustard and mayonnaise i hear you got moved to scs its true why if i didnt know better id say they were keeping an eye on me only they were there at mary kings close a murder that looks like an execution then next thing youre off to scs and i know scs are investigating gunrunning with an irish slant maggie arrived with two cans of irnbru mairie checked hers was cold enough before opening it are we working on the same story the police dont have stories mairie we have cases and its hard to answer your question without seeing your story she slipped a hand into her shoulderbag and pulled out several sheets of neatly typed paper the document had been stapled and folded in half rebus could see it was a photocopy not very long he said you can read it while i eat he did but all it did was put a lot of speculative meat on the bones he already had mostly it concentrated on the north american angle mentioning the ira fundraising in passing though the orange loyal brigade was mentioned as was sword and shield no names rebus commented i can give you a few off the record gavin and jamesie macmurray youre stealing my best lines do you have anything on them what do you think well find a garden shed full of grenade launchers that could be pretty close tell me she took a deep breath we cant put anything in print yet but we think theres an army connection you mean stuff from the falklands and the gulf souvenirs theres too much of it for it to be souvenirs what then the stuff from russia much closer to home you know stuff walks out of army bases in northern ireland ive heard of it happening same thing happend in the s in scotland the tartan army got stuff from amy bases we think its happening again at least jump thinks it is hes spoken to someone who used to be in american shield sending money over here its easier to send money here than arms shipments this guy told jump the money was buying british armaments see the ira has good links with the east and libya but the loyalist paramilitaries dont youre telling me theyre buying guns from the army rebus laughed and shook his head maine managed a small smile theres another thing i know theres nothing to back this up jump knows it too its just one mans word and that man isnt even willing to go public hes afraid american shield would get to him anyway whod believe him hes being paid to tell jump this stuff he could be making it all up journalists like a juicy conspiracy we lap them up like cream what are you talking about mairie a policeman a detective someone high up in the shield in america she shook her head at the uk end no name or anything like i say just a story aye just a story how did you find out we had a man undercover that was strange it was a phone call anonymous of course of course but who could have known another policeman obviously mairie pushed her plate away i cant eat all these chips they should put up a plaque above the table rebus needed a drink and there was a good pub only a short walk away mairie went with him though she complained she didnt have room for a drink still when they got there she found space for a white wine and soda rebus had a halfpint and a nip they sat by the window with a view out over the forth the water was battleship grey reflecting the sky overhead rebus had never seen the forth look other than forbidding what did you say hed missed it completely i said i forgot to say yes but the bit after that a man called moncur clyde moncur what about him jump has him pegged as one of the shields hierarchy in the us hes also a bigtime villain only its never been proven in a court of law and and he flies into heathrow tomorrow to do what we dont know so why arent you down in london waiting for him because hes booked on a connecting flight to edinburgh rebus narrowed his eyes you werent going to tell me no i wasnt what changed your mind she gnawed her bottom lip it may be ill need a friend sometime soon youre going to confront him yes i suppose so jesus mairie its what journalists do do you know anything about him i mean anything i know hes supposed to run drugs into canada brings illegal immigrants in from the far east a real renaissance man but on the surface all he is own a fishprocessing plant in seattle rebus was shaking his head whats wrong i dont know he said i suppose i just feel gutted it took her a moment to get the joke caro thank god rebus was back in fettes at his desk on the phone having finally tracked caroline rattray to ground youre calling off our drink she said coldly im sorry somethings cropped up work you know how it is the hours arent always social the phone went dead in his hand he replaced the receiver like it was spun sugar then having requested five minutes of his bosss time he went to kilpatricks office as ever there was no need to knock kilpatrick waved him in through the glass door take a seat john ill stand sir thanks all the same whats on your mind when you spoke to the fbi did they mention a man called clyde moncur i dont think any names were mentioned kilpatrick wrote the name on his pad who is he hes a seattle businessman runs his own fishprocessing plant possibly also a gangster hes coming to edinburgh on holiday well we need the tourist dollars and he may be high up in the shield oh kilpatrick casually underlined the name whats your source id rather not say i see kilpatrick underlined the name one last time i dont like secrets john yes sir well what do you want to do put a tail on him ormiston and blackwood are good id prefer someone else kilpatrick threw down his pen why i just would you can trust me john i know that sir then tell me why you dont want ormiston and blackwood on the tail we dont get on i get the feeling they might muck things up just to make me look bad lying was easy with practice and rebus had years of practice at lying to superiors that sounds like paranoia to me maybe it is ive got a team here john i need to know that they can work as a team you brought me in sir i didnt ask for secondment teams always resent the new man it just hasnt worn off yet then rebus played his ace you could always move me back to st leonards not that he wanted this he liked the freedom he had flitting between the two stations neither chief inspector knowing where he was is that what you want kilpatrick asked its not down to me its what you want that matters quite right and i want you in scs at least for the time being so youll put someone else on the tail i take it youve got people in mind two more from st leonards ds holmes and dc clarke they work well together theyve done this sort of thing before no john lets keep this to scs which was kilpatricks way of reasserting his authority i know two good men over in glasgow no possible grudge against you ill get them over here right sir sound all right to you inspector whatever you think sir when rebus left the office the two typists were discussing famine and third world debt ever thought of going into politics ladies myras a local councillor one of them said nodding to her partner any chance of getting my drains cleared rebus asked myra join the queue myra said with a laugh back at his desk rebus phoned brian holmes to ask him a favour then he went to the toilets down the hall the toilet was one of those design miracles like dr whos time machine somehow two urinals a toilet cubicle and wash hand basin had been squeezed into a space smaller than their total cubic volume so rebus wasnt thrilled when ken smylie joined him smylie was supposed to be taking time off work only he insisted on coming in how are you doing ken im all right good rebus turned from his urinal and headed for the sink you seem to be working hard smylie said do i youre never here i assume youre working oh im working rebus shook water from his hands only i never see any notes notes you never write down your case notes is that right rebus dried his hands on the cotton roller towel this was his lucky day a fresh roll had just been fitted he still had his back to smylie well i like to keep my notes in my head thats not procedure tough hed just got the word out and was preparing for another intake of breath when smylies arms gripped him with the force of a construction crane around his chest he couldnt breathe and felt himself being lifted off the ground smylie pushed his face against the wall next to the roller towel his whole weight was sandwiching rebus against the wall youre on to something arent you smylie said in his high whistling voice tell me who it is he released his bear hug just enough so rebus could speak get the fuck off me the grip tightened again rebuss face pressing harder into the wall ill go through it in a minute he thought my headll be sticking out into the corridor like a hunting trophy he was my brother smylie was saying my brother rebuss face was full of blood which wanted to be somewhere else he could feel his eyes bulging out of their sockets his eardrums straining my last view he thought will be of this damned rollertowel then the door swung inwards and ormiston was standing there cigarette gawping the cigarette dropped to the floor as ormiston flung his own arms around smylies he couldnt reach all the way round but enough to dig his thumbs into the soft flesh of the inner elbows let go smylie get off me rebus felt the pressure on him ease and used his own shoulders to throw smylie off there was barely room for all three men and they danced awkwardly ormiston still holding smylies arms smylie threw him off with ease he was on rebus again but now rebus was ready he kneed the big man in the groin smylie groaned and slumped to his knees ormiston was picking himself up what the hell sparked this smylie pulled himself to his feet he looked angry frustrated he nearly took the handle off the door as he pulled it open rebus looked in the mirror his face was that sunburnt cherry colour some fairskinned people go but at least his eyes had retreated back into their sockets wonder what my blood pressure got up to he said to himself then he thanked ormiston i was thinking of me not you ormiston retorted with you two wrestling he stooped to pick up his cigarette there wasnt room for me to have a quiet puff the cigarette itself survived the melee but after inspecting it ormiston decided to flush it anyway and light up a fresh one rebus joined him that may be the first time smokings saved someones life my grandad smoked for sixty years died in his sleep at eighty mind you he was bedridden for thirty of them so what was all that about filing smylie doesnt like my system smylie likes to know everything thats going on he shouldnt even be here he should be at home bereaving but thats what he is doing argued ormiston just because he looks like a big cuddly bear a gentle giant dont be fooled he took a drag on his cigarette let me tell you about smylie and he did rebus was home at six oclock much to patience aitkens surprise he had a shower rather than a bath and came into the living room dressed in his best suit and wearing a shirt patience had given him for christmas it wasnt till hed tried it on that they both discovered it required cuff links so then hed had to buy some i can never do these up by myself he said now flapping his cuffs and brandishing the links patience smiled and came to help him close up she smelt of perfume smells wonderful he said do you mean me or the kitchen both said rebus equally something to drink what are you having fizzy water till the cookings done same for me though really he was dying for a whisky hed lost the shakes but his ribs still hurt when he inflated his lungs ormiston said hed once seen smylie bearhug a recalcitrant prisoner into unconsciousness he also told rebus that before kilpatrick had come on the scene the smylie brothers had more or less run the edinburgh crime squad he drank the water with ice and lime and it tasted fine when the preparations were complete and the table laid and the dishwasher set to work on only the first of the evenings loads they sat down together on the sofa and drank gin with tonic cheers cheers and then patience led him by the hand out into the small back garden the sun was low over the tops of the tenements the birds easing off into evensong she examined every plant as she passed it like a general assessing her troops shed trained lucky the cat well it now went over the wall into the neighbouring garden when it needed the toilet she named some of the flowers for him like she always did he could never remember them from one day to the next the ice clinked in patiences glass as she moved she had changed into a long patterned dress all flowing folds and squares of colour with her hair up at the back the dress worked well showing off her neck and shoulders and the contours of her body it had short sleeves to show arms tanned from gardening though the bell was a long way off he heard it front door he said theyre early she looked at her watch well not much actually id better get the potatoes on ill let them in she squeezed his arm as they separated and rebus made his way down the hallway towards the front door he straightened himself readying the smile hed be wearing all evening then he opened the door bastard something hissed a spraycan and his eyes stung hed closed them a moment too late but could still feel the spray dotting his face he thought it must be mace or something similar and swiped blindly trying to knock the can out of his assailants hand but the feet were already on the stone steps shuffling upwards and away he didnt want to open his eyes so staggered blindly towards the bathroom his hands feeling the hallway walls past the bedroom door then hitting the light switch he slammed the door and locked it as patience was coming into the hall john john what is it nothing he said through his teeth its all right are you sure who was at the door they were looking for the upstairs neighbours he was running water into the sink he got his jacket off and plunged his head into the warm water letting the sink fill wiping at his face with his hands patience was still waiting on the other side of the bathroom door somethings wrong john what is it he didnt say anything after a few moments he pried open one eye ken shut it again shit that stung he swabbed again with the water opening his eyes underwater this time the water seemed murky to him and when he looked at his hands they were red and sticky oh christ he thought he forced himself to look in the mirror above the sink he was bright red it wasnt like earlier in the day when smylie had attacked him it was paint thats what it was red paint from an aerosol can jesus christ he staggered out of his clothes and got into the shower turning his face up to the spray shampooing s hair as hard as he could then doing it again he scrubbed at his face and neck patience was at the door again asking him what the hell he was up to and then he heard her voice change rising on the final syllable of a name the bremners had arrived he got out of the shower and rubbed himself down with a towel when he looked at himself again hed managed to get a lot of the colour off but by no means all of it then he looked at his clothes his jacket was dark and didnt show the paint too conspicuously conspicuously enough though as for his good shirt it was ruined no question about that he unlocked the bathroom door and listened patience had taken the bremners into the living room he padded down the hall into the bedroom noticing on the way that his hands had left red smears on the wallpaper in the bedroom he changed quickly into chinos yellow tshirt and a linen jacket patience had bought him for summer walks by the river which they never took he looked like a hasbeen trying to look trendy it would do the palms of his hands were still red but he could say hed been painting he popped his head round the living room door chris jenny he said the couple were seated on the sofa patience must be in the kitchen sorry im running a bit late ill just dry my hair and ill be with you no rush said jenny as he retreated into the hall he took the telephone into the bedroom and called dr curt at home hello its john rebus here tell me about caroline rattray pardon tell me what you know about her you sound smitten curt said amusement in his voice im smitten all right shes just sprayed me with a can of paint im not sure i caught that never mind just tell me about her like for instance is she the jealous type john youve met her would you say shes attractive yes and she has a very good career plenty of money a lifestyle many would envy yes but does she have any beaux you mean boyfriends and the answer is i dont know then take it from me she does not thats why she can be at a loose end when i have ballet tickets to spare ask yourself why should this be answer because she scares men off i dont know whats wrong with her but i know that shes not very good at relationships with the opposite sex i mean she has relationships but they never last very long you might have told me i didnt realise you two were an item were not oh only she thinks we are then youre in trouble it looks like it sorry i cant be more help shes always been all right with me perhaps i could have a word with her no thanks thats my department goodbye then and good luck rebus waited till curt had put his receiver down he listened to the line then heard another click patience had been listening on the kitchen extension he sat on the bed staring at his feet till the door opened i heard she said she had an oven glove in one hand she knelt down in front of him her hands on his knees you should have told me he smiled i just did yes but to my face she paused there was nothin between the two of you nothing happened nothing happened he said without blinking there was another moments silence what are we going to do he took her hands we he said are going to join our guests then he kissed her on the forehead and pulled her with him to her feet at ninethirty next morning rebus was sitting in his car outside lachlan murdocks flat when hed washed his eyes last night it had been like washing behind them as well always it came to this he tried to do things by the books and ended up cooking them instead it was easier that was all where would the crime detection rates be without a few shortcuts he had tried murdocks number from a callbox at the end of the road there was no one there just an answering machine murdock was at work rebus got out of the car and tried murdocks intercom again no answer so he picked the lock the way hed been taught by an old lag when hed gone to the man for lessons once inside he climbed the stairwell briskly a regular visitor rather than an intruder but no one was about murdocks flat was on the yale rather than a deadlock so it was easy to open too rebus slipped inside and closed the door after him he went straight to murdocks bedroom he didnt suppose millie would have left the computer disk behind but you never knew people with no access to safe deposit boxes sometimes mistook their homes for one the postman had been and murdock had left the mail strewn on the unmade bed rebus glanced at it there was a letter from millie the envelope was postmarked the previous day the letter itself written on a single sheet of lined writing paper sorry i didnt say anything dont know how long ill be away if the police ask say nothing cant say more just now love you millie rebus left the letter lying where it was and pulled on a pair of surgical gloves stolen from patience he walked over to murdocks workdesk and switched on the computer then started going through the computer disks there were dozens of them kept in plastic boxes most of them newly labelled the majority had labels with spidery black had writing which rebus guessed was murdocks the few that remained he took to be millies he went through these first but found nothing to interest him the unlabelled disks proved to be either blank or corrupted he started searching through drawers for other disks parked on the floor one side of the bed were the plastic binliners containing billys things he looked through these too murdocks side of the bed was a chaos of books ashtray empty cigarette packets but millies side was a lot neater she had a bedside cupboard on which sat a lamp alarm clock and a packet of throat lozenges rebus crouched down and opened the cupboard door now he knew why millies side of the bed was so neat the cupboard was like a wastepaper bin he sifted through the rubbish there were some crumpled yellow postit notes in amongst it he picked them out and unpeeled them they were messages from murdock the first one contained a sevendigit phone number and beneath it the words why dont you call this bitch as rebus unpeeled the others he began to understand there were half a dozen telephone messages all from the same person rebus had thought he recognised the phone number but on the rest of the messages the callers name was printed alongside mairie henderson back at st leonards he was pleased to find that both holmes and clarke were elsewhere he went to the toilets and splashed water on his face his eyes were still irritated red at their rims and bloodshot patience had taken a close look at them last night and pronounced hed live after the bremners had gone home happy shed also helped him scrub the rest of the red out of his hair and off his hands actually there was still some on his right palm cuchullain of the red hand patience had said shed been great really considering trust a doctor to be calm in a crisis shed even managed to calm him down when late in the evening hed considered going round to caroline rattrays flat and torching it here shed said handing him a whisky set fire to yourself instead he smiled at himself in the toilet mirror there was no smylie here about to grope him to death no jeering ormiston or preening blackwood this was where he belonged he wondered again just what he was doing at fettes why had kilpatrick scooped him up he thought now that he had a bloody good idea edinburghs central lending library is situated on george iv bridge across the street from the national library of scotland this was student territory and just off the royal mile and hence at the moment also festival fringe territory pamphleteers were out in force still enthusing sensing audiences to be had now that the least successful shows had packed up and headed home for the sake of politeness rebus took a lurid green flyer from a teenage girl with long blonde hair and read it as far as the first litter bin where it joined many more identical flyers the edinburgh room was not so much a room as a gallery surrounding an open space far below readers in another section of the library were at their desks or browsing among the bookshelves not that mairie henderson was reading books she was poring over local newspapers seated at one of the few readers tables rebus stood beside mairie reading over her shoulder she had a neat portable computer with her flipped open and plugged into a socket in the library floor its screen was milky grey and filled with notes it took her a minute to sense that there was someone standing over her she looked round slowly expecting a librarian lets talk said rebus she saved what shed been writing and followed him out onto the librarys large main staircase a sign told them not to sit on the window ledges which were in a dangerous condition mairie sat on the top step and rebus sat a couple of steps down from her leaving plenty of room for people to get past im in a dangerous condition too he said angrily why whats happened she looked as innocent as stained glass millie docherty yes you didnt tell me about her what exactly should i have told you that youd been trying to talk to her did you succeed no why shes run off really she considered this interesting what did you want to talk to her about the murder of one of her flatmates thats all shouldnt it be she was looking interested funny she does a runner when youre after her hows the research shed told him over their drink in newhaven that she was looking into what she called past loyalist activity in scotland slow she admitted hows yours dead stop he lied apart from ms dochertys disappearance how did you know i wanted to talk to her none of your business she raised her eyebrows her flatmate didnt tell you no comment at this time she smiled come on said rebus maybe youll talk over a coffee interrogation by scone mairie offered they walked the short walk to the high street and took a right towards st giles cathedral there was a coffee shop in the crypt of st giles reached by way of an entrance which faced parliament house rebus glanced across the car park but there was no sign of caroline rattray the coffee shop though was packed having not many tables to start with and this still being the height of the tourist season try somewhere else mairie suggested actually said rebus ive gone off the idea ive got a bit of business across the road mairie tried not to look relieved id caution you he warned her not to piss me about caution received and understood she waved as she walked off back towards the library rebus watched her good legs recede from view they stayed goodlooking all the way out of his vision then he threaded his way between the lawyers cars and entered the court building he had an idea he was going to leave a note for caroline rattray in her box always supposing she had one but as he walked into parliament hall he saw her talking with another lawyer there was no chance to retreat she spotted him immediately she kept up the conversation for a few more moments then put her hand on her colleagues shoulder said a brief farewell and headed towards rebus it was hard to reconcile her in her professional garb with the woman who had spraypainted him the previous night she left her colleague with a faint smile on her lips and met rebus with that same smile under her arm were the regulation files and documents inspector what brings you here cant you guess ah yes of course ill send a cheque he had kept telling himself all the way across the car park that he wasnt going to let her get under his skin now he found she was already there like a half inch of syringe cheque for the dry cleaning or whatever a passing lawyer nodded to her hullo mansie oh mansie she spoke with the lawyer for a few moments her hand on his elbow she was offering a cheque for the dry cleaning rebus was glad of a few moments in which to cool off but now someone was tapping his shoulder he turned to find mairie henderson standing there i forgot she said the americans in town yes i know have you done anything about him she shook her head biding my time good no use scaring him off caroline rattray was looking interested in this new arrival so much so that she was losing the thread of her own conversation she dismissed mansie halfway through a sentence and turned to rebus and mairie mairie smiled at her the two women waiting for an introduction see you then rebus said to mairie oh right mairie walked backwards a step or two just in case hed change his mind then turned as she turned caroline rattray took a step forward her hand out as though she were about to make her own introduction but rebus really didnt want her to so he grabbed the hand and held her back she shrugged his grip off and glared at him then looked back through the doorway mairie had already left the building you seem to have quite a little stable inspector she tried rubbing at her wrist it wasnt easy with the files still precariously pressed between her elbow and stomach better stable than unstable he said regretting the dig immediately he should just have denied the charge unstable she echoed i dont know what you mean look lets forget it eh i mean forget everything ive told patience all about it i find that difficult to believe thats your problem not mine you think so she sounded amused yes remember something inspector her voice was level and quiet you started it and then you told the lie my conscience is clear what about yours she gave him a little smile before walking away rebus turned and found himself confronting a statue of sir walter scott seated with his feet crossed and a walkingcane held between his open knees scott looked as though hed heard every word but wasnt about to pass judgment keep it that way rebus warned not caring who might hear he phoned patience and invited her to an early evening drink at the playfair hotel on george street whats the occasion she asked no occasion he said he was restless the rest of the day glasgow came back to him but only to say that theyd nothing on either jim hay or active resistance theatre he turned up early at the playfair making across its entrance hall all faded glory but studied faded glory almost too perfect to the bar beyond it called itself a wet bar which was okay with rebus he ordered a talisker hoisted himself onto a wellpadded barstool and dipped a hand into the bowl of peanuts which had appeared at his approach the bar was empty but would be filled soon enough with prosperous businessmen on their way home other businessmen who wanted to look prosperous and didnt mind spending money on it and the hotel clientele enjoying a snifter before a predinner stroll a waitress stood idly against the end of the bar not far from the baby grand the piano was kept covered with a dustsheet until evening so for now there was wallpaper music except that whoever was playing trumpet wasnt half bad he wondered if it was chet baker rebus paid for his drink and tried not to think about the amount of money hed just been asked for after a bit he changed his mind and asked if he could have some ice he wanted the drink to last eventually a middleaged couple came into the bar and sat a couple of seats away from him the woman put on elaborate glasses to study the cocktail list while her husband ordered drambuie pronouncing it drambooi the husband was short but bulky given to scowling he was wearing a white golfing cap and kept glancing at his watch rebus managed to catch his eye and toasted him slainte the man nodded saying nothing but the wife smiled tell me she said are there many gaelic speakers left in scotland her husband hissed at her but rebus was happy to answer not many he conceded are you from edinburgh headinburrow it sounded like pretty much she noticed that rebuss glass was now all melting ice will you join us the husband hissed again something about her not bothering people who only wanted a quiet drink rebus looked at his watch he was calculating whether he could afford to buy a round back thank you yes ill have a talisker and what is that malt whisky it comes from skye there are some gaelic speakers over there the wife started humming the first few notes of the skye boat song all about a french prince who dressed in drag her husband smiled to cover his embarrassment it couldnt be easy travelling with a madwoman maybe you can tell me something said rebus why is a wet bar called a wet bar could be because the beers draught the husband offered grudgingly not just bottled the wife had perched her shiny handbag on the bar and now opened it taking out a compact so she could check her face youre not the mystery man are you she asked rebus put down his glass sorry ellie her husband warned only she said putting away her compact clyde had a message to meet someone in the bar and youre the only person here they didnt leave a name or anything a misunderstanding thats all said clyde they got thewrong room but he looked at rebus anyway rebus obliged with a nod mysterious certainly the fresh glass was put before rebus and the barman decided he merited another bowl of nuts too slainte said rebus slainte said husband and wife am i late said patience aitken running her hands up rebuss spine she slipped onto the stool which separated rebus from the tourists for some reason the man now removed his cap showing a good amount of hair slicked back from the forehead patience rebus said id like to introduce you to clyde moncur said the man visibly relaxing rebus obviously posed no threat this is my wife eleanor rebus smiled dr patience aitken and im john patience looked at him he seldom used dr when introducing her and why had he left out his own surname listen rebus was saying staring right past her wouldnt we be more comfortable at a table they took a table for four the waitress appearing with a little tray of nibbles not just nuts but green and black olives and chipsticks too rebus tucked in the drinks might be expensive but you had to say the food was cheap youre on holiday rebus said opening the conversation thats right said eleanor moncur we just love scotland she then went on to list everything they loved about it from the skirl of the bagpipes to the windswept west coast clyde let her run on taking sips from his drink occasionally swirling the ice around he sometimes looked up from the drink to john rebus have you ever been to the united states eleanor asked no never said rebus ive been a couple of times patience said surprising him once to california and once to new england in the fall patience nodded isnt that just heaven do you live in new england rebus asked eleanor smiled oh no were way over the other side washington washington she means the state her husband explained not washington dc seattle said eleanor youd like washington its wild as in wilderness clyde moncur added ill put that on our room miss patience had ordered lager and lime which the waitress had just brought rebus watched as moncur took a room key from his pocket the waitress checked the room number clydes ancestors came from scotland eleanor was saying somewhere near glasgow kilmarnock thats right kilmarnock there were four brothers one went to australia two went to northern ireland and clydes greatgrandfather sailed from glasgow to canada with his wife and children he worked his way across canada and settled in vancouver it was clydes grandfather who came down into the united states there are still offshoots of the family in australia and northern ireland where in northern ireland rebus asked casually portadown londonderry she went on though rebus had directed the question at her husband ever visit them no said clyde moncur he was interested in rebus again rebus met the stare squarely the north wests full of scots mrs moncur rattled on we have ceilidhs and clan gatherings and highland games in the summer rebus lifted his glass to his lips and seemed to notice it was empty i think we need another round he said the drinks arrived with their own scalloped paper coasters and the waitress took away with her nearly all the money john rebus had on him hed used the anonymous message to get moncur down here and patience to put him off his guard in the event moncur was sharper than rebus had given him credit for the man didnt need to say a word his wife spoke enough for two and nothing she said could prove remotely useful so youre a doctor she asked patience now general practice yes i admire doctors said eleanor they keep clyde and me alive and ticking and she gave a big grin her husband had been watching patience while shed been speaking but as soon as she finished he turned his gaze back to rebus rebus lifted his glass to his lips for some time eleanor moncur was saying now clydes grandaddy was captain of a clipper his wife gave birth on board while the boat was headed to pick up what was it clyde timber clyde said from the philippines she was eighteen and he was in his forties the baby died and know what said eleanor they preserved the body in brandy embalmed it patience offered eleanor moncur nodded and if that boat had been a temperance vessel theydve used tar instead of brandy clyde moncur spoke to rebus now that was hard living those are the people who built america you had to be tough you might be conscientious but there wasnt always room for a conscience a bit like in ulster rebus offered they transplanted some pretty hard scots there really moncur finished his drink in silence they decided against a third round clyde reminding his wife that they had yet to take their preprandial walk down to princes street gardens and back they exchanged handshakes outside rebus taking patiences arm and leading her downhill as though they were heading into the new town wheres your car he asked back on george street wheres yours same place then where are we going he checked over his shoulder but the moncurs were out of sight nowhere he said stopping john said patience next time you need me as a cover have the courtesy to ask first can you lend me a few quid save me finding a cashpoint she sighed and dug into her bag twenty enough hope so unless youre thinking of returning to the playfair bar ive been up braes that werent as steep as that place he told her hed be back late perhaps very late and pecked her on the cheek but she pulled him to her and took her fair share of mouth to mouth by the way she said did you talk to the action painter i told her to get lost that doesnt mean she will she better said patience pecking him a last time on the cheek before walking away he was unlocking his car when a heavy hand landed on his own clyde moncur was standing next to him who the fuck are you the american spat looking around him nobody rebus said shaking off the hand i dont know what all that shit was about at the hotel but you better stay far away from me friend that might not be easy said rebus this is a small place my town not yours moncur took a step back hed be in his lates but the hand hed placed on rebuss had stung there was strength there and determination he was the sort of man who normally got his own way whatever the cost who are you rebus pulled open the car door he drove away without saying anything at all moncur watched him go the american stood legs apart and raised a hand to pat his jacket at chest height nodding slowly a gun rebus thought hes telling me hes got a gun and hes telling me hed use it too mairie henderson had a flat in portobello on the coast east of the city in victorian times a genteel bathing resort porty was still used by day trippers in summer mairies tenement was on one of the streets between high street and the promenade with his window rolled down rebus caught occasional wafts of salt air when his daughter sammy was a kid theyd come to porty beach for walks the beach had been cleaned up by then or at least covered with tons of sand from elsewhere rebus used to enjoy those walks trouser legs rolled up past the ankles feet treading the numbing water at the edge of the rolling north sea if we kept walking daddy sammy would say pointing to the skyline where would we go wed go to the bottom of the sea he could still see the dreadful look on her face shed be twenty this year twenty he reached under his seat and let his hand wander till it touched his emergency pack of cigarettes one wouldnt do any harm inside the pack nestling amongst the cigarettes was a slim disposable lighter the light was still on in mairies firstfloor window her car was parked right outside the tenements front door he knew the back door led to a small enclosed dryinggreen shed have to come out the front he hoped shed bring millie docherty with her he didnt quite know why he thought mairie was hiding millie it was enough that he thought it hed had wrong hunches before enough for a convention of the quasimodo fan club but you always had to follow them up if you stopped being true to instinct you were lost his stomach rumbled reminding him that olives and chipsticks did not a meal make he thought of the portobello chip shops but sucked on his cigarette instead he was across the road from the tenement and about six cars down it was eleven oclock and dark no chance of mairie spotting him he thought he knew why clyde moncur was in town same reason the exuvf man was here he just didnt want to go public with his thoughts not when he didnt know who his friends were at quarter past eleven the tenement door opened and mairie came out she was alone wearing a burberrystyle raincoat and carrying a bulging shopping bag she looked up and down the street before unlocking her car and getting in what are you nervous about kid rebus asked watching her headlights come on he lit another cigarette just to wash down the first and started his engine she took the portobello road back into the city he hoped she wasnt going far tailing a car even in the dark wasnt as easy as the movies made it look especially when the person you were tailing knew your car the roads were quiet making things trickier still but at least she stuck to the main routes if shed used side streets and rat runs shed have spotted him for sure on princes street the bikers were out in summernight force hitting the lateopening burger bars and revving up and down the straight he wondered if clyde moncur was out for a postprandial stroll with the burgers and bikes hed probably feel right at home moncur was tough the way old people could get seeming to shrink as they got older but that was only because they were losing juice becoming rockhard as a result there was nothing soft left of clyde moncur he had a handshake like a saloonbar challenge even patience had complained of it the night was delicious perfect for a walk and thats what most people were enjoying too bad for the fringe shows who wanted to sit in an airless dark theatre for two hours while the real show was outside continuous and absolutely free mairie turned left at the west end heading up lothian road the street was already reeling with drunks theyd probably be heading for a curry house or pizza emporium later theyd regret this move you saw the evidence each morning on the pavements just past the tollcross lights mairie signalled to cross the oncoming traffic rebus wondered where the hell she was headed his question was soon answered she parked by the side of the road and turned off her lights rebus hurried past while she was locking her door then stopped at the junction ahead there was no traffic coming but he sat there anyway watching in his rearview well well he said as mairie crossed the road and went into the crazy hose saloon he put the car into reverse brought it back and squeezed in a few cars ahead of mairle he looked across at the crazy hose the sign above was yellow and red flashing neon which must be fun for the people in the tenement outside which rebus was parked a short flight of steps led to the main doors and on these steps stood two bouncers the hoses wild west theme had passed the bouncers by and they were dressed in regulation black evening suits white shirts and black bow ties both had cropped hair to match their iqs and held their hands behind their backs swelling already prodigious chests rebus watched them open the doors for a couple of stetson tipping cowpokes and their minidressed partners in for a dime i suppose he locked his car and walked purposefully across the road trying to look like a man looking for a good time the bouncers eyed him suspiciously and did not open the door rebus decided hed played enough games today so he opened his id and stuck it in the tallest bouncers face he wondered if the man could read police he said helpfully dont i get the door opened for me only on your way out the smaller bouncer said so rebus pulled open the door and went in the admission desk had been done up like an old bank with vertical wooden bars in front of the smiling female face platinum cowpoke card rebus said again showing his id past the desk was a fairsized hallway where people were playing onearmed bandits there was a large crowd around an interactive video game where some bearded actor on film invited you to shoot him dead if you were quick enough on the draw most of the kids in front of the machine were dressed in civvies though a few sported cowboy boots and bootlace ties big beltbuckles seemed mandatory and both males and females wore levi and wrangler denims with goodsized turnups the toilets were out here too always supposing you could work out which you were a honcho or honchette a second set of doors led to the dance hall and four bars one in each corner of the vast arena plenty of money had been spent on the decor with the choicest pieces being spotlit behind perspex high up out of reach on the walls there was a lifesize cigarstore indian a lot of native headdresses and jackets and the like and what rebus hoped bras a replica of a gatlinggun old western films played silentlyon a bank of tv screens set into one wall and there was a bucking bronco machine against another wall this was disused now ever since a teenager had fallen from it and been put in a coma theyd nearly shut the place down for that rebus didnt like to think about why they hadnt he kept coming up with friends in the right places and money changing hands there was somethingthat looked like a font near one of the bars but rebus knew it was a spittoon he noticed that the bar closest to it wasnt doing great business rebus wasnt hard to pick out in a crowd although there were people there his own age they were all wearing western dress to some degree and they were nearly all dancing there was a stage which was spotlit and full of instruments but empty of bodies instead the music came through the pa a dj in an enclosed box next to the stage babbled between songs you could have heard him halfway to texas can i help you not hard to pick out in the crowd and of course the bouncers had sentword to the floor manager he was in his late twenties with slick black hair and a rhinestone waistcoat the accent was strictly lothian is frankie in tonight if bothwell were in the dancehall hed have spotted him bothwells clothes would have drowned out the pa im in charge the smile told rebus he was as welcome as haemorrhoids at a rodeo well theres no trouble son so i can put your mind at rest straight off im just looking for a friend only i didnt fancy paying the admission the manager looked relieved you could see he hadnt been in the job long hed probably been promoted from behind the bar my names lorne strang he said and mines lorne sausage strang smiled my real names kevin dont apologise drink on the house id rather drink on a barstool if thats all right with you rebus had given the dance floor a good look and mairie wasnt there which meant she was either trapped in the honchettes or was somewhere behind the scenes he wondered what she could be doing behind the scenes at frankie bothwells club so said kevin strang who are you looking for like i say a friend she said shed be here maybe im a bit late the place is only just picking up now were open another two hours whatll you have they were at the bar the bar staff wore white aprons covering chest and legs and goldcoloured bands around their sleeves to keep their cuffs out of the way is that so they cant palm any notes asked rebus nobody cheats the bar here one of the staff broke off serving someone to attend to kevin strang just a beer please rebus said draught we only serve half pints whys that theres more profit in it an honest answer ill have a bottle of becks he looked back to the dance floor the last time i saw this many cowboys was at a builders convention the record was fading out strang patted rebuss back thats my cue he said enjoy yourself rebus watched him move through the dancers he climbed onto the stage and tapped the microphone sending a whump through the onstage pa rebus didnt know what he was expecting maybe strang would call out the steps of the next barn dance but instead all he did was speak in a quiet voice so people had to be quiet to hear him rebus didnt think kevin strang had much future as floor manager at the crazy hose dudes and womenfolk its a pleasure to see you all here at the crazy hose saloon and now please welcome onto the deadwood stage our band for this evenings hoedown chaparral there was generous applause as the band emerged through a door at the back of the stage a few of the arcade junkies had come in from the foyer the band was a sixpiece barely squeezing onto the stage guitarvocals bass drums another guitar and two backing singers they started into their first number a little shakily but had warmed up by the end by which time rebus was finishing his drink and thinking about heading back to the car then he saw mairie no wonder shed had a raincoat around her underneath she must have been wearing a tasselled black skirt brown leather waistcoat white blouse cut just above the chest and up around the shoulders leaving a lot of bare flesh she wasnt wearing a stetson but there was a red kerchief around her throat and she was singing her heart out she was one of the backing singers rebus ordered another drink and gawped at the stage after a few songs he could differentiate between mairies voice and that of the other backing singer he noticed that most of the men were watching this singer she was much taller than mairie and had long straight black hair plus she was wearing a much shorter skirt but mairie was the better singer she sang with her eyes closed swaying from the hips knees slightly bent her partner used her hands a lot but didnt gain much from it at the end of their fourth song the male singerguitarist gave a short spiel while the others in the band caught their breath retuned swigged drinks or wiped their faces rebus didnt know about c ampw but chaparral seemed pretty good they didnt just play mush about pet dogs dying spouses or standing by your lover their songs had a harder much urban feel with lyrics to match and if you dont know hal ketchum the singer was saying you better get to know him this is one of his its called small town saturday night mairie took lead vocal her partner patting a tambourine and looking on at the end of the song the cheers were loud the singer came back to his mike and raised his arm towards mairie katy hendricks ladies and gentlemen the cheers resumed while mairie took her bow after this they started into their own material two songs whose intention was always ahead of ability the singer mentioned that both were available on the bands first cassette available to buy in the foyer were going to take a break now so you can all go away for the next fifteen minutes but be sure to come back rebus went into the foyer and dug six pounds out of his pocket when he came back in the band were at one of the bars hoping to be bought drinks if halftime refreshments werent on the house rebus shook the cassette in mairies ear miss hendricks would you autograph this please the band looked at him and so did mairie she took him by the lapels and propelled him away from the bar what are you doing here didnt you know im a big country and western fan you dont like anything but sixties rock you told me so yourself are you following me you sang pretty well pretty well i was great thats my mairie never one to hide her light under a tumbleweed why the false name you think i wanted those arseholes at the paper to find out rebus tried to imagine the hose full of drunken journos cheering their singerscribe no i dont suppose so anyway everyone in the band uses an alias it makes it harder for the dss to find out theyve been working she pointed at the tape you bought that well they didnt hand it over as material evidence she grinned you liked us then i really did i know i shouldnt be but im amazed she was almost persuaded onto this tack but not quite you still havent said why youre following me he put the tape in his pocket millie docherty what about her i think you know where she is what shes scared she needs help she might just run to the reporter whos being wanting to see her reporters have been known to hide their sources away protect them you think im hiding her he paused has she told you about the pennant what pennant mairie had lost her cowgirl singer look she was back in business the one on billy cunninghams wall has she told you what he had hidden behind it what rebus shook his head ill make a deal he said well talk to her together that way neither of us is hiding anything what do you say the bassist handed maine an orange juice thanks duane she gulped it down until only ice was left are you staying for the second set will it be worth my while oh yes we do a cracking version of country honk thatll be the acid test she smiled ill see you after the set mairie do you know who owns this place a guy called boswell its bothwell you dont know him never met him why the second set was paced like a foxtrot two slow dances two fast then a slow sad rendering of country honk to end with the floor was packed for the last dance and rebus was flattered when a woman a good few years younger than him asked him up but then her man came back from the honchos so that was the end of that as the band played a short upbeat encore one fan climbed onstage and presented the backing singers with sheriffs badges producing the loudest cheer of the night as both women pinned them on their chests it was a good natured crowd and rebus had spent worse evenings he couldnt see patience enjoying it though when the band fnished they went back through the door theyd first appeared through a few minutes later mairie reappeared still dressed in all her gear and with the raincoat folded up in her shopping bag along with her flatsoled driving shoes so rebus said so lets go he started for the exit but she was making towards the stage gesturing for him to follow i dont really want her to see me like this she said im not sure the outfit conveys journalistic clout and professionalism but i cant be bothered changing they climbed onto the stage then through the door it led into a lowceilinged passage of broom closets crates of empty bottles and a small room where in the evening the band got ready and during the day the cleaner could stop for a cup of tea beyond this was a dark stairwell mairie found the light switch and started to climb where exactly are we going the sheraton rebus didnt ask again the stairs were steep and twisting they reached a landing where a padlocked door faced them but mairie kept climbing at the second landing she stopped there was another door this time with no lock inside was a vast dark space which rebus judged to be the buildings attic light infiltrated from the street through a skylight and some gaps in the roof showing the solid forms of rafters watch you dont bump your head the roofspace though huge was stifling it seemed to be filled with tea chests ladders stacks of cloth which might have been old firemens uniforms shes probably asleep mairie whispered i found this place the first night we played here kevin said she could stay here you mean lorne he knows hes an old pal he got us this residency i told him she was a friend whod come up for the fringe but had nowhere to stay i said i had eight people in my flat as it was thats a lie by the way i like my privacy where else was she going to stay the citys bursting at the seams but what does she do all day she can go downstairs and boil a kettle theres a loo there too the club itselfs off limits but shes so scared i dont think shed risk it anyway she had led them past enough obstacles for a game of crazy golf and now they were close to the front of the building there were some small window panes here forming a long thin arch they were filthy but provided a little more light millie its only me mairie peered into the gloom rebuss eyes had become accustomed to the dark but even so there were places enough she could be hiding shes not here mairie said there was a sleeping bag on the floor rebus recognised it from the first time hed met millie beside it lay a torch rebus picked it up and switched it on a paperback book lay face down on the floor wheres her bag her bag didnt she have a bag of stuff yes mairie looked around i dont see it shes gone said rebus but why would she leave the sleepingbag book and torch he moved the beam around the walls this place is a junk shop an old red rubberised firehose snaked cross the floor rebus followed it with the beam all the way to a pair of feet he moved the beam up past splayed legs to the rest of the body she was propped against the corner in a sitting position stay here he ordered approaching the body trying to keep the torch steady the firehose was coiled around millie dochertys neck someone had tried strangling her with it but they hadnt succeeded the perished rubber had snapped so instead theyd taken the brass nozzle and stuffed it down her throat it was still there looking like the mouth of a funnel and thats what theyd used it as rebus put his nose close to the funnel and sniffed he couldnt be sure but he thought theyd used acid theyd tipped it down into her while shed been choking on the nozzle if he looked closer hed see her throat burnt away he didnt look he shone the torch on the floor instead her bag was lying there its contents emptied onto the floorboards there was something small and crumpled beside a wooden chest he picked it up and flattened it out it was the sleeve for a computer disk written on it were the letters sas looks like they got what they wanted he said nobody was dancing in the crazy hose saloon everyone had been sent home because the hose was in tollcross it was c divisions business theyd sent officers out from torphichen place john rebus one of the cid men said you get around more than a jehovahs witness but i never try to sell you religion shug rebus watched di shug davidson climb onto the stage and disappear through the door they were all upstairs the action was upstairs they were setting up halogen lamps on tripods to assist the photographers no key could be found for the first floor padlock so theyd taken a sledgehammer to it rebus didnt like to ask who or what they thought theyd find hidden behind a door padlocked from the outside he doubted it would be germane to the case only one thing was germane and it was standing at the bar near the spittoon drinking a long cold drink rebus walked over have you talked to your boss yet kevin i keep getting his answering machine bad one kevin strang nearly bit through the glass how do you mean bad for business aye right enough mairie tells me you and her are friends went to school together she was a couple of years above me but we were both in the school orchestra thats good youll have something to fall back on eh if bothwell sacks you you can always busk for a living did you ever see her talk to her kevin knew who he meant he was shaking his head before rebus had finished asking no rebus persisted you werent even a wee bit curious didnt want to see what she looked like never thought about it rebus looked across to the distant table where mairie was being questioned by one of the torphichen squad with a wpc in close attendance bad one he said again he leaned closer to kevin strang just between us kevin who did you tell i didnt tell anyone then youre going down son how do you mean they didnt find her by accident kevin they knew she was there only two people could have provided that information mairie or you c division are hard bastards theyll want to know all about you kevin youre about the only suspect theyve got im not a suspect she died about six hours ago kevin where were you six hours ago rebus was making this up they wouldnt know for sure until the pathologist took body temperature readings but he reckoned it was a fair guess all the same im telling you nothing rebus smiled youre just snot kevin worse youre hired snot he made to pat kevin strangs face but strang flinched staggered back and hit the spittoon they watched it tip with a crash to the floor rock to and fro and then lie there nothing happened for a second then with a wet sucking sound a thick roll of something barely liquid oozed out everyone looked away the only thing strang found to look at was rebus he swallowed look i had to tell mr bothwell just to cover myself if i hadnt told him and hed found out what did he say he just shrugged said she was my responsibility he shuddered at the memory where were you when you told him in the office off the foyer this morning strang nodded tell me kevin did mr bothwell go check out the lodger strang looked down at his empty glass it was answer enough for rebus there were strict rules covering the investigation of a serious crime such as murder for one rebus should talk to the officer in charge and tell him everything he knew about millie docherty for two he should also mention his conversation with kevin strang for three he should then leave well alone and let c division get on with it but at two in the morning he was parked outside frankie bothwells house in ravelston dykes giving serious thought to going and ringing the doorbell if nothing else he might learn whether bothwells night attire was as gaudy as his daywear but he dismissed the idea for one thing c division would be speaking with bothwell before the night was out always supposing they managed to get hold of him they would not want to be told by bothwell that rebus had beaten them to it for another he was too late he heard the garage doors lift automatically and saw the dipped headlights as bothwells car a glossblack merc with custom bodywork bounced down off the kerb onto the road and sped away so hed finally got the message and was on his way to the hose either that or he was fleeing rebus made a mental note to do yet more digging on lee francis bothwell but for now he was relieved the situation had been taken out of his hands he drove back to oxford terrace at a sedate pace trying hard not to fall asleep at the wheel no one was waiting in ambush outside so he let himself in quietly and went to the living room his body too tired to stay awake but his mind too busy for sleep well he had a cure for that a mug of milky tea with a dollop of whisky in it but there was a note on the sofa in patiences handwriting her writing was better than most doctors but not by much eventually rebus deciphered it picked up the phone and called brian holmes sorry brian but the note said to call whatever the time hold on a sec he could hear holmes getting out of bed taking the cordless phone with him rebus imagined nell stapleton awake in the bed rolling back over to sleep and cursing his name the bedroom door closed okay said holmes i can talk now whats so urgent is it about our friend no alls quiet on that front ill tell you about it in the morning but i was wondering if youd heard the news i was the one who found her rebus heard a fridge opening a bottle being taken out something poured into a glass found who brian asked millie docherty isnt that what were talking about but of course it wasnt brian couldnt possibly know so soon shes dead murdered theyre piling up arent they what happened to her its not a bedtime story so whats your news a breakout from barlinnie well from a van actually stopped between barlinnie and a hospital the whole thing was planned rebus sat down on the sofa cafferty he does a good impersonation of a perforated ulcer it happened this evening the prison van was sandwiched between two lorries masks sawnoffs and a miracle recovery oh christ dont worry there are patrols all up and down the m if hes coming back to edinburgh thats the last road hell use you think hell come back get a grip brian of course hes coming back hes going to have to kill whoever butchered his son he didnt get much sleep that night in spite of the tea and whisky he sat by the recessed bedroom window wondering when cafferty would come he kept his eyes on the stairwell outside until dawn came his mind made up he started packing patience sat up in bed i hope youve left a note she said were both leaving only not together whats the score in an emergency my dream was making more sense than this say you had to go away at very short notice she was rubbing her hair yawning someone would cover for me what did you have in mind elopement ill put the kettle on when he came back from the kitchen carrying two mugs of coffee she was in the shower whats happening she asked afterwards rubbing herself dry youre going to your sisters he told her so drink your coffee phone her get dressed and start packing she took the mug from him in that order any order you like and where are you going somewhere else wholl feed the pets ill get someone to do it dont worry im not worried she took a sip of coffee yes i am what is going on a bad mans coming to town something struck him there you are thats another old film i like high noon rebus booked into a small hotel in bruntsfield he knew the night manager and phoned first checking they had a room youre lucky weve one single how come youre not full the old gent who was in it hes been coming here for years he died of a stroke yesterday afternoon oh youre not superstitious or anything not if its your only room he climbed the steps to street level and looked around when he was happy he gestured for patience to join him she carried a couple of bags rebus was already holding her small suitcase they put the stuff in the back of her car and embraced hurriedly ill call you he said dont try phoning me john trust me on this if on nothing else patience please he watched her drive off then hung around to make sure no one was following her not that he could be absolutely sure they could pick her up on queensferry road cafferty wouldnt hesitate to use her or anyone to get to him rebus got his own bag from the flat locked the flat tight and headed for his car on the way he stopped at the next door neighbours door dropping an envelope through the letterbox inside were keys to the flat and feeding instructions for lucky the cat the budgie with no name and patiences goldfish it was still early morning the quiet streets unsuitable for a tail even so he took every back route he could think of the hotel was just a big family house really converted into a small family hotel out front where a garden once separated it from the pavement tarmac had been laid making a car park for half a dozen cars but rebus drove round the back and parked where the staff parked monty the night manager brought him in the back way then led him straight up to his room it was at the top of the house all the way up one of the creakiest staircases rebus had ever climbed no one would be able to tiptoe up there without him and the woodworm knowing about it he lay on the solid bed wondering if lying on a dead mans bed was like stepping into his shoes then he started to think about caferty he knew he was taking half measures only how hard would it be for cafferty to track him down a few men staked outside fettes and st leonards and in a few wellchosen pubs and rebus would be in the gangsters hands by the end of the day fine he just didnt want patience involved or patiences home or those of his friends didnt most suicides do the same thing come to hotels so as not to involve family and friends he could have gone home of course back to his flat in marchmont but it was still full of students working in edinburgh over the summer he liked his tenants and didnt want them meeting cafferty come to that he didnt want monty the night manager meeting cafferty either hes not after me he kept reminding himself hands behind his head as he stared at the ceiling there was a clock radio by the bed and he switched it on catching the news police were still searching for morris gerald cafferty hes not after me he repeated but in a sense cafferty was hed know rebus was his best bet to finding the killers there was a short item about the body at the crazy hose though no gruesome details not yet anyway when the news finished he washed and went downstairs he got a black cab to take him to st leonards once told the destination the driver switched off his meter on the house he said rebus nodded and sat back hed commandeer someones car during the course of the day either that or find a spare car from the pool no one would complain they all knew whod put cafferty in barlinnie at st leonards he walked smartly into the station and went straight to the computer tapping into brains brains had a direct link to pnc the uk mainland police database at hendon as hed expected there wasnt much on lee francis bothwell but there was a note referring him to files kept by strathclyde police in partick the officer he talked to in partick was not thrilled all that old stuffs in the attic he told rebus ill tell you one of these days the ceilingll come down just go take a look eh fax it to me save yourself a phone call an hour later rebus was handed several fax sheets relating to activities of the tartan army and the workers party in the early s both groups had enjoyed short anarchic lives robbing banks to finance their arms purchases the tartan army had wanted independence for scotland at any price what the workers party had wanted rebus couldnt recall and there was no mention of their objectives in the fax the tartan army had been the bigger terror of the two breaking into explosives stores and army bases building up an arms cache for an insurrection which never came frankie bothwell was mentioned as a tartan army supporter but with no evidence against him of illegal acts rebus reckoned this would be just before his move to the orkneys and rebirth as cuchullain cuchullain of the red hand arch gowrie was probably at breakfast when rebus caught him he could hear the clink of cutlery on plate sorry to disturb you so early sir more questions inspector maybe i should start charging a consultancy fee i was hoping you could help me with a name gowrie made a noncommittal noise or maybe he was just chewing lee francis bothwell frankie bothwell you know him i used to he was a member of the orange lodge yes he was but he got kicked out not quite he left voluntarily might i ask why sir you might there was a pause he was unpredictable had a temper on him most of the time he was fine he coached the youth football teams for a couple of district lodges he seemed to enjoy that was he interested in history yes scottish and irish history cuchullain amongst other things i think he wrote a couple of articles for ulster thats the magazine of the uda he did them under a pseudonym so we couldnt discipline him but the style was his loyalists inspector are very interested in irish prehistory bothwell was writing about the cruithin he was very bright like that but he did he have any links with the orange loyal brigade not that i know of but it wouldnt surprise me gavin macmurrays interested in prehistory too gowrie sighed frankie left the orange lodge because he didnt feel we went far enough thats as much as ill say but maybe it tells you something about him it does mr gowrie yes thanks for your help rebus put the phone down and thought it over then he shook his head sadly you picked some place to hide her mairie some fucking place his desk now looked like a skip and he decided to do something about it he filled his waste bin with empty cups plates crumpled papers and packets until only slightly buried he came to an asize manila envelope his name was written on it in black marker pen the envelope was fat it hadnt been opened who left this here but nobody seemed to know they were too busy discussing another call made to the newspaper by the lunatic with the irish accent nobody knew about the shield of course not the way rebus knew the media had stuck to the theory that the body in mary kings close was that of the caller a rogue from an ira unit whod been disciplined by his masters it didnt make any sense now but that didnt matter thered been another call now another morning headline shut the whole thing down says threat man rebus had considered what benefit sas could derive from disrupting the festival answer none he looked at the envelope a final time then ran his finger under the flap and eased out a dozen sheets of paper photocopies of reports news stories american the lot of them though whoever had done the copying had been careful leaving off letter headings addresses phone numbers as rebus read he couldnt be sure where half the stories originated but one thing was clear they were all about one man clyde moncur there were no messages nothing handwritten nothing to identify the sender rebus checked the envelope it hadnt been posted it had been delivered by hand he asked around again but nobody owned up to having ever seen the thing before mairie was the only source he could think of but she wouldnt have sent the stuff like this he read through the file anyway it reinforced his impression of clyde moncur the man was a snake he ran drugs up into vancouver and across to ontario his boats brought in immigrants from the far east or often didnt though they were known to have picked up travellers along the way what happened to them these people who paid to be transported to a better life the bottom of the deep blue sea seemed to be the inference there were other murky areas to moncurs life like his undeclared interest in a fish processing plant outside toronto toronto home of the shield the us internal revenue had been trying for years to get to the bottom of it all and failing buried in all the clippings was the briefest mention of a scottish salmon farm moncur had imported scottish smoked salmon into the usa though the canadian stuff was just a mite closer to hand the salmon farm he used was just north of kyle of lochalsh its name struck home rebus had come across the name very recently he went back to the files on cafferty and there it was cafferty had been legitimate partowner of the farm in the s and early s around the time him and jinky johnson were washing and drying dirty money for the uvf this is beautiful rebus said to himself he hadnt just squared the circle hed created an unholy triangle out of it he got a patrol car to take him to the garb from the back seat he had a more relaxed view of the whole of pilmuir clyde moncur had talked about the early scottish settlers the new settlers of course took on just as tough a life moving into the private estates which were being built around and even in pilmuir this was a frontier life complete with marauding natives who wanted the intruders gone border skirmishes and wilderness experiences aplenty these estates provided starter homes for those making the move from the rented sector they also provided starter courses in basic survival rebus wished the settlers well when they got to the garb rebus gave the uniforms their instructions and sat in the back seat enjoying the stares of passersby they were away a while but when they came back one of them was pulling a boy by his forearm and pushing the boys bike the other one had two kids no bikes rebus looked at them he recognised the one with the bike you can let the others go he said but him i want in here with me the boy got into the car reluctantly his pals ran as soon as the officers released them when they were far enough away they turned to watch they wanted to know what would happen whats your name son rebus asked jock maybe it was true and maybe it wasnt rebus wasnt bothered shouldnt you be at school jock weve no started back yet this too could be true rebus didnt know do you remember me son it wasnae me did your tyres rebus shook his head thats all right im not here about that but you remember when i came here the boy nodded remember you were with a pal and he thought i was someone else remember he asked me where my flash car was the boy shook his head and you told him that i wasnt who he thought i was who did he think i was son i dont know yes you do i dont but someone a bit like me eh similar build age height fancier clothes though ill bet maybe what about his car the swanky car a custom merc rebus smiled there were some things boys just had eyes and a memory for what colour merc black all of it the windows too seen him here a lot dont know nice car though eh the boy shrugged right son on you go the boy knew from the pleased look on the policemans face that hed made a mistake that hed somehow helped his cheeks burned with shame he snatched his bike from the constable and ran with it looking back from time to time his pals were waiting to question him get what you were looking for sir asked one of the uniforms getting back into the car exactly what i was looking for said rebus he went to see mairie but a friend was looking after her and mairie herself was sleeping the doctor had given her a few sleeping pills left alone in the flat with an unconscious mairie he could have gone through her notes and computer files but the friend didnt even let him over the threshold she had a pinched face with prominent cheeks and a few too many teeth in her quiet but determined mouth tell her i called rebus said giving up he had retrieved his car from the back of the hotel cafferty would find him with or without the rustbucket to point the way he drove to fettes where dci kilpatrick had an update on the clyde moncur surveillance hes acting the tourist john no more or less he and his wife are admiring the sights taking bus tours buying souvenirs kilpatrick sat back in his chair the men i put on it are restless like they say its hardly likely hes here on business when his wifes with him or else its the perfect cover a couple more days john thats all we can give it i i appreciate it sir what about this body at the crazy hose millie docherty sir yes any ideas rebus just shrugged kilpatrick didnt seem to expect an answer part of his mind was still on calumn smylie they were about to open an internal inquiry there would be questions to answer about the whole investigation i hear you had a run in with smylie kilpatrick said so ormiston had been talking just one of those things sir watch out for smylie john thats all i seem to do these days sir watch out for people but he knew now that smylie was the least of his problems at st leonards del lauderdale was fighting his corner arguing that his team should take on the millie docherty investigation from c division so he was too busy to come bothering rebus and that was fine by rebus officers were out at lachlan murdocks fiat talking to him he was being treated as a serious suspect now you didnt lose two flatmates to hideous deaths and not come under the microscope murdock would be on the petri dish from now till the case reached some kind of conclusion rebus returned to his desk since hed last been there earlier in the day people had started using it as a rubbish bin again he phoned london and waited to be passed along the line it was not a call he could have made from fettes abernethy speaking about bloody time its di rebus here well well i wondered if id hear from you rebus could imagine abernethy leaning back in his chair maybe his feet were up on the desk in front of him i must have left a dozen messages abernethy ive been busy what about you rebus stayed silent so inspector rebus how can i help ive got a few questions how much stuff is the army losing youve lost me i dont think so someone walking past offered rebus a cigarette without thinking he accepted it but then the donor walked away leaving rebus without a light he sucked on the filter anyway i think you know what im talking about he opened the desk drawers looking for matches or a lighter well i dont i think material has been going missing really yes really rebus waited he didnt want to speculate too wildly and he certainly didnt want abernethy to know any more than was necessary but there was silence on the other end of the line or you suspect its going missing that would be a matter for army intelligence or the security service yes but youre special branch arent you youre the public arm of the security service i think you came up here in a hurry because you damned well know whats going on the question is why did you disappear again in such a hurry too youve lost me again maybe id better pack my bag for a trip what do you say rebus didnt say anything he just put down the phone anyone got a light someone tossed a box of matches onto the desk cheers he lit the cigarette and inhaled the smoke rattling his nerves like they were dice in a cup he knew abernethy would come he kept moving the most difficult kind of target he was trusting to his instincts after all he had to trust something dr curt was in his office at the university to get to the once you had to walk past a row of wooden boxes marked with the words place frozen sections here rebus had never looked in the boxes in the pathology building you kept your eyes front and your nostrils tight they were doing some work in the quadrangle scaffolding had been erected and a couple of workmen were belying their name by sitting on it smoking cigarettes and sharing a newspaper busy busy busy curt said when rebus reached his office you know most of the university staff are on holiday ive had postcards from the gambia queensland florida he sighed i am cursed with a vocation while others get a vacation i bet you were awake all night thinking up that one i was awake half the night thanks to your discovery at the crazy hose saloon postmortem not yet complete it was a corrosive of some kind the lab will tell us exactly which i am constantly surprised by the methods murderers will resort to the fire hose was new to me well it stops the job becoming routine i suppose hows caroline id forgotten all about her you must pray that shell let you i stopped praying a long time ago he walked back down the stairs and out into the quadrangle wondering if it was too soon in the day for a drink at sandy bells the pub was just round the corner and he hadnt been there in months he noticed someone standing in front of the frozen sections boxes they had the flap open like theyd just made a deposit then they turned around towards rebus and smiled it was cafferty dear god cafferty closed the flap he was dressed in a baggy black suit and opennecked white shirt like an undertaker on his break hello strawman the old nickname it was like an icepack on rebuss spine lets talk there were two men behind rebus the two from the churchyard the two whod watched him taking a beating they escorted him back to a newish rover parked in the quadrangle he caught the licence number but felt caffertys hand land on his shoulder well change plates this afternoon strawman someone was getting out of the car it was weaselface rebus and cafferty got into the back of the car weaselface and one of the heavies into the front the other heavy stood outside blocking rebuss door he looked towards where the scaffolding stood the workmen had vanished there was a sign on the scaffolding just the name of a firm and their telephone number a light came on in practically the last dark room in rebuss head big ger cafferty had made no effort at disguise his clothes didnt look quite right a bit large and not his style but his face and hair were unchanged a couple of students one asian and one oriental walked across the quadrangle towards the pathology building they didnt so much as glance at the car i see your stomach cleared up cafferty smiled fresh air and exercise strawman you look like you could do with both youre crazy coming back here we both know i had to well have you inside again in a matter of days maybe i only need a few days how close are you rebus stared through the windscreen he felt caffertys hand cover his knee speaking as one father to another you leave my daughter out of this shes in london isnt she ive a lot of friends in london and ill tear them to shreds if she so much as stubs a toe cafferty smiled see see how easy it is to get worked up when its family its not family with you cafferty you said so yourself its business we could do a trade cafferty looked out of his window as though thinking say someones been bothering you could be an old flame lets say shes been disrupting your life making things awkward he paused making you see red rebus nodded to himself so weaselface had witnessed the little scene with the spraycan my problem not yours cafferty sighed sometimes i wonder how hard you really are he looked at rebus id like to find out try me i will strawman one day trust me on that why not now just you and me cafferty laughed a square go i havent the time you used to shuffle cash around for the uvf didnt you the question caught cafferty unaware did i till jinky johnson disappeared you were in pretty tight with the terrorists maybe thats where you heard of the sas billy was a member caffertys eyes were glassy i dont know what youre saying no but you know what im talking about ever heard the name clyde moncur no that sounds like another lie to me what about alan fowler now cafferty nodded he was uvf not now he isnt now hes sas and hes here theyre both here why are you telling me rebus didnt answer cafferty moved his face closer its not because youre scared theres something else whats on your mind rebus rebus stayed silent he saw dr curt coming out of the pathology building curts car a blue saab was parked three cars away from the rover youve been busy cafferty said now curt was looking over towards the rover at the big man standing there and the men seated inside any more names cafferty was beginning to sound impatient losing all his cool veneer i want all of them his right hand lashed around rebuss throat his left hand pushing him deep into the corner of the seat tell me all of it all of it curt had turned as though forgetting something and was walking back towards the building rebus blinked away the water in his eyes the stooge outside thumped on the bodywork cafferty released his grip and watched curt going back into pathology he used both hands to grasp rebuss face turning it towards his holding rebus with the pressure of his palms on rebuss cheekbones well meet again rebus only it wont be like in the song rebus felt like his head was going to crack but then the pressure stopped the heavy outside opened the door and he got out fast as the heavy got in the driver gunned the engine the back window went down cafferty looking at him saying nothing the car sped off tyres screeching as it turned into the oneway traffic on teviot place dr curt appeared in the pathology doorway then came briskly across the quadrangle are you all right ive just phoned the police do me a favour when they get here tell them you were mistaken what tell them anything but dont tell them it was me rebus started to move off maybe hed have that drink at sandy bells maybe hed have three im not a very good liar dr curt called after him then the practice will be good for you rebus called back frankie bothwell shook his head again ive already spoken with the gentlemen from torphichen place you want to ask anyone ask them he was being difficult hed had a difficult night what with being dragged from his bed and then staying up till all hours dealing with the police answering their questions explaining the stash of cased spirits theyd found on the first floor he didnt need this but you knew miss docherty was upstairs rebus persisted is that right bothwell wriggled on his barstool and tipped ash onto the floor you were told she was upstairs was i your manager told you youve only got his word for that you deny he said it maybe if we could get the two of you together you can do what you like hes out on his ear anyway i sacked him first thing cant have people dossing upstairs like that bad for the clubs image let them sleep on the streets like everyone else rebus tried to imagine what resemblance the kid at the garb had seen between himself and frankie bothwell he was here because he was feeling reckless plus hed put a few whiskies away in sandy bells he was here because he quite fancied beating lee francis bothwell to a bloody mush on the dance floor stripped of music and flashing lights and drink and dancers the crazy hose had as much life as a warehouse full of last years fashions bothwell appearing to dismiss rebus from his mind lifted one foot and began to rub some dust from a cowboy boot rebus feared the white trousers would either split or else eviscerate their wearer the boot was black and soft with small puckers covering it like miniature moon craters bothwell caught rebus looking at it ostrich skin he explained meaning the craters were where each feather had been plucked look like a lot of little arseholes rebus said admiringly bothwell straightened up look mr bothwell all i want are a couple of answers is that so much to ask and then youll leave straight out the door bothwell sighed and flicked more ash onto the floor okay then rebus smiled his appreciation he rested his hand on the bar and leaned towards bothwell two questions he said why did you kill her and whos got the disk bothwell stared at him then laughed get out of here rebus lifted his hand from the bar im going he said but he stopped at the doors to the foyer holding them open you know caffertys in town never heard of him thats not the point the point is has he heard of you your father was a minister did you ever learn latin what nemo me impune lacessit bothwell didnt even blink never mind it wont worry cafferty one way or the other see you didnt just meddle with him you meddled with his family he let the doors swing shut behind him this was the way he should have worked it throughout using cafferty the mere threat of cafferty to do his work for him but would cafferty be enough to scare the american and the ulsterman somehow john rebus doubted it back at st leonards rebus first phoned the scaffolding company then placed a call to peter cave something ive been meaning to ask you sir he said yes cave sounded tired deep down inside since the church stopped supporting the youth club how do you survive we manage everyone who comes along has to pay is it enough no youre not subsidising the place out of your own pocket cave laughed at this what then sponsorship in a way yes what sort of way just someone who saw the good the club was doing someone you know never met him as a matter of fact rebus took a stab francis bothwell how did you know that someone told me rebus lied davey so davey soutar did know bothwell yes it figured maybe from a district lodge football team maybe some other way time to change track what does davey do by the way works in an abattoir hes not a builder then no one last thing mr cave i got a name from a scaffolding company malky haston hes eighteen lives in the garb i know malky inspector and he knows you hows that heavy metal fan always wears a band tshirt youve spoken with him black tshirt thought rebus davey soutars pal with white flecks in his hair that rebus had mistaken for dandruff thank you mr cave rebus said i think thats everything everything he needed a uniform approached as he put down the phone and handed rebus the information hed requested on recent and not sorecent breakins rebus knew what he was looking for and it didnt take long acid wasnt that easy to come by not unless you had a plausible reason for wanting it easier to steal the stuff if you could and where could you find acid breakins at craigie comprehensive school were fairly standard it was like preemployment training for the unrulier pupils they learned to slip a windowcatch and jemmy open a door some graduated to lockpicking and others became fences for the stolen goods it was always a buyers market but then economics was not a strong point with these junior careerists three months back craigie had been entered at the dead of night and the tuck shop emptied theyd also broken into the science rooms physics and chemistry the chemistry stock room had a different lock but they took that out too and made off with a large jar of methylated spirits a few other choice cocktail ingredients and three thick glass jars of various acids the caretaker who lived in a small prefabricated house on the school grounds saw and heard nothing hed been watching a special comedy night on the television probably he wouldnt have ventured out of doors anyway craigie comprehensive wasnt exactly full of pupils with a sense of humour or love for their elders what could you expect from a school whose catchment area included the infamous garibaldi estate he was putting the pieces together when chief inspector lauderdale came over as if were not stretched thin enough lauderdale complained whats that another anonymous threat thats twice today he says our times up shame i was just beginning to enjoy myself any specifics lauderdale nodded distractedly a bomb he didnt say where he says its so big therell be no hiding place festivals nearly over rebus said i know thats what worries me yes it worried rebus too lauderdale turned to walk away just as rebuss phone rang inspector my names blairfish you wont remember me of course i remember you mr blairfish have you called to apologise about your grandnephew again oh no nothing like that but im a bit of a local historian you see yes and i was contacted by matthew vanderhyde he said you wanted some information about sword and shield good old vanderhyde rebus had given up on him go on please its taken me a while there was thirty years of detritus to wade through what have you got mr blairfish well ive got notes of some meetings a treasurers report minutes and things like that plus the membership lists im afraid theyre not complete rebus sat forward in his chair mr blairfish id like to send someone over to collect everything from you would that be all right rebus was reaching for pen and paper well i suppose i dont see why not lets look on it as final atonement for your grandnephew now if youll just give me your address locals called it the meat market because it was sited close to the slaughterhouse workers from the slaughterhouses wandered in at lunchtime for pints pies and cigarettes sometimes they wore flecks of blood the owner didnt mind hed been one of them once working the jetair gun at a chicken factory the pistol hooked up to a compressor had taken the heads off several hundred stunned chickens per hour he ran the meat market with the same unruffled facility it wasnt lunchtime so the market was quiet two old men drinking slow half pints at opposite ends of the bar ignoring one another so studiously that there had to be a grudge between them and two unemployed youths shooting pool and trying to make each game last their pauses between shots the stuff of chess games finally there was a man with sparks in his eyes the proprietor was keeping a watch on him he knew trouble when he saw it the man was drinking whisky and water he looked the sort of drinker when he was mortal you wouldnt want to get in his way he wasnt getting mortal just now he was making the one drink last but he didnt look like he was enjoying anything about it finally he finished the quarter gill take care the proprietor said thanks said john rebus heading for the door slaughterhouse workers are a different breed they worked amid brain and offal thick blood and shit in a sanitised environment of whitewash and piped radio music a huge electrical unit reached down from the ceiling to suck the smell away and pump in fresh air the young man hosing blood into a drain did so expertly spraying none of the liquid anywhere other than where he wanted it and afterwards he turned down the pressure at the nozzle and hosed off his black rubber boots he wore a white rubberised apron round his neck and stretching down to his knees as did most of those around him aprons to rebus meant barmen masons and butchers he was reminded only of this last as he walked across the floor they were working with cattle the cows looked young and fearful eyes bulging theyd probably already been injected with muscle relaxants so moved drunkenly along the line a jolt of electricity behind either ear numbed them and quickly the wielder of the boltgun took aim with the cold muzzle hard against each skull their back legs seemed to crumple first already the light was vanishing from behind their eyes hed been told davey soutar was working near the back of the operation so he had to pick his way around the routine men and women speckled with blood smiled and nodded as he passed they all wore hats to keep their hair off the meat or perhaps to keep the meat off their hair soutar was by the back wall resting easily against it hands tucked into the front of his apron he was talking to a girl chatting her up perhaps so romance isnt dead thought rebus then soutar saw him just as rebus slipped on a wet patch of floor soutar placed him immediately and seemed to raise his head and roll his eyes in defeat then he ran forward and picked something up from a shiny metal table he was fumbling with it as rebus advanced it was only when soutar took aim and the girl screamed that rebus realised it was a boltgun there was the sound of a two pound hammer hitting a girder the bolt flew but rebus dodged it soutar threw the gun at him and dived for the rear wall hitting the bar of the emergency exit the door swung open then closed again behind him the girl was still screaming as rebus ran towards her pushed the horizontal bar to unlock the door and stumbled into the abattoirs back yard there were a couple of large transporters in the middle of disgorging their doomed cargo the animals were sending out distress calls as they were fed into holding pens the entire rear area was walled in so nobody from the outside world could glimpse the spectacle but if you went around the transporters a lane led back to the front of the building rebus was about to head that way when the blow felled him it had come from behind on his hands and knees he halfturned his head to see his attacker soutar had been hiding behind the door he was holding a long metal stick a cattle prod it was this which he had swung at rebuss head catching him on the left ear blood dropped onto the ground soutar lunged with the pole but rebus caught it and managed to pull himself up soutar kept moving forwards but though wiry and young he did not possess the older mans bulk and strength rebus twisted the pole from his hands then dodged the kick which soutar aimed at him kickfighting wasnt so easy with rubber boots on rebus wanted to get close enough to land a good punch or kick of his own or even to wrestle soutar to the ground but soutar reached into his apron and came out with a goldcoloured butterfly knife flicking its two moulded wings to make a handle for the vicious looking blade theres more than one way to skin a pig he said grinning breathing hard i like it when theres an audience rebus said soutar turned for a second to take in the sight of the cattle herders all of whom had stopped work to watch the fight by the time he looked back rebus had caught the knife hand with the toe of his shoe sending the knife clattering to the ground soutar came straight for him then butting him on the bridge of the nose it was a good hit rebuss eyes filled with tears he felt energy earth out of him into the ground and blood ran down his lips and chin youre dead soutar screamed you just dont know it yet he picked up his knife but rebus had the metal pole and swung it in a wide arc soutar hesitated then ran for it he took a short cut climbing the rail which funnelled the cattle into the pens then leaping one of the cows and clearing the rail at the other side stop him rebus called spraying blood im a police officer but by then davey soutar was out of sight all you could hear were his rubber boots flapping as he ran the doctor at the infirmary had seen rebus several times before and tutted as usual before getting to work she confirmed what he knew the nose was not broken hed been lucky the cut to his ear required two stitches which she did there and then the thread she used was thick and black and ugly whatever happened to invisible mending it wasnt a deterrent fair point if it stings you can always get your girlfriend to lick your wounds rebus smiled was that a chatup line well he had enough problems without adding another to the inventory so he didnt say anything he acted the good patient then went to fettes and filed the assault you look like ken buchanan on a good night said ormiston heres the stuff you wanted claverhouse has gone off in a huff he didnt like being turned into a messenger boy ormiston patted the heavy package on rebuss desk it was a large brown cardboard box smelling of dust and old paper rebus opened it and took out the ledger book which served as a membership record for the original sword and shield the blue fountainink had faded but each surname was in capitals so it didnt take him long he sat staring at the two names managing a shortlived smile not that hed anything to smile about not really there was nothing to be proud of his desk drawer didnt lock but ormistons did he took the ledger with him has the chief seen this ormiston shook his head hes been out of the office since before it arrived i want it kept safe can you lock it in your drawer he watched ormiston open the deep drawer drop the package in then shut it again and lock it tighter than a virgins ormiston confirmed thanks listen im going out hunting ormiston drew the key out of the lock and pocketed it count me in he said not that rebus expected to find davey soutar at home he doubted soutar was quite that daft but he did want to take a look and now he had the excuse he also had ormiston who looked threatening enough to dissuade anyone who might look like complaining ormiston cheered by the story of how rebus came by his cuts and bruises his eyes were purpling and swelling nicely a consequence of the head butt was further cheered by the news that they were headed for the garb they should open the place as a safari park he opined remember those places they used to tell you to keep your car doors locked and your windows rolled up same advice id give to anyone driving through the garb you never know when the baboons will stick their arses in your face did you ever find anything about sword and shield you never expected us to ormiston said when rebus looked at him he laughed coldly i might look daft but im not youre not daft either are you way youre acting id say you think youve cracked it paramilitaries in the garb rebus said quietly keeping his eyes on the road and soutars in it up to his neck and beyond he killed calumn could be a knifes his style not billy cunningham though no he didnt kill billy why are you telling me all this rebus turned to him for a moment maybe i just want someone else to know ormiston weighed this remark you think youre in trouble i can think of half a dozen people whod throw confetti at my funeral you should take this to the chief maybe would you ormiston thought about this i havent known him long but i heard good things from glasgow and he seems pretty straight he expects us to show initiative work off our own backs thats what i like about scs the leeway i hear you like a bit of leeway yourself that reminds me lee francis bothwell know him he owns that club the one with the body in it thats him i know he should change the music what to acid house it was worth a laugh but rebus didnt oblige hes an acquaintance of my assailant what is he slumming it id like to ask him but i cant see him answering hes been putting money into the youth club rebus was measuring each utterance wondering how much to feed ormiston very civic minded of him especially for someone who got kicked out of the orange lodge on grounds of zeal ormiston frowned how are you doing for evidence the youth club leaders admitted the connection some kids i spoke to a while back thought i was bothwell only my car wasnt flash enough he drives a customised merc how do you read it i think peter cave blundered with good intention into something that was already happening i think something very bad is happening in the garb they had to take a chance on parking the car and leaving it if rebus had thought about it hed have brought one other man someone to guard the wheels there were kids loitering by the parking bays but not the same kids whod done his tyres before so he handed over a couple of quid and promised a couple more when he came back its dearer than the parking in town ormiston complained as they headed for the highrises the soutars highrise had been renovated with a sturdy main door added to stop undesirables congregating in the entrance hall or on the stairwells the entrance hall had been decorated with a green and red mural not that you would know any of this to look at the place the lock had been smashed and the door hung loosely on its hinges the mural had been all but blocked out by penned graffiti and thick black coils of spray paint which floor are they on ormiston asked the third then well take the stairs i dont trust the lifts in these places the stairs were at the end of the hall their walls had become a winding scribblepad but they didnt smell too bad at each turn in the stairs lay empty cider cans and cigarette stubs what do they need a youth club for when theyve got the stairwell ormiston asked whatve you got against the lift sometimes the kidsll wait till youre between floors then shut off the power he looked at rebus my sister lives in one of those hblocks in oxgangs they entered the third floor at the end of along hallway which seemed to be doubling as a wind tunnel there were fewer scribbles on the walls but there were also smeared patches evidence that the inhabitants had been cleaning the stuff off some of the doors offered polished brass nameplaques and bristle doormats but most were also protected by a barred iron gate kept locked shut when the flats were empty each flat had a mortice deadlock as well as a yale and a spyhole ive been in jails with laxer security but conspicuously the door with the name soutar on it had no extra security no gate or spyhole this fact alone told rebus a lot about davey soutar or at least about his reputation amongst his peers nobody was going to break into daveys flat there was neither bell nor knocker so rebus banged his fist against the meat of the door after a wait a woman answered she peered out through a chink then opened the door wide fuckin polis she said it was a statement of fact rather than a judgment davey i suppose its davey said rebus he did that to you she meant rebuss face so he nodded and what were you doing to him just the usual mrs soutar ormiston interrupted a length of lead pipe on the soles of the feet a wet towel over the face you know how it is rebus nearly said something but ormiston had judged her right mrs soutar smiled tiredly and stepped back into her hall youd better come in a bit of steak would stop those eyes swelling but all ive got is half a pound of mince and its the economy stuff youd get more meat from a butchers pencil this is my man dod she had led them along the short narrow hall and into a small living room where a venerable threepiece suite took up too much space along the sofa his shoeless feet resting on one arm of it lay an unshaven man in his forties or perhaps even badly nurtured thirties he was reading a war comic his lips moving with the words on the page hiy dod mrs soutar said loudly these are the polls daveys just put the heid on one of them good for him dod said without looking up no offence like none taken rebus had wandered over to the window wondering what the view was like the window however was a botched piece of double glazing condensation had crept between the panes frosting the glass it wasnt much of a view to start with mrs soutar said he turned and smiled at her he didnt doubt she would see through any scheme any lie she was a short stronglooking woman big boned with a chiselled jaw but a pleasant face if she didnt smile often it was because she had to protect herself she couldnt afford to look weak in the garb the weak didnt last long rebus wondered how much influence shed had over her son while he was growing up here a lot hed say but then the father would be an influence too she kept her arms folded while she talked unfolding them only long enough to slap dods feet off the end of the sofa so she could sit herself down on the arm so whats he done this time dod put down his comic and reached into his packet of cigarettes lighting one for himself and handing the pack to mrs soutar hes assaulted a police officer for a start rebus said thats a pretty serious offence mrs soutar it could land him a spell in the carpentry shop you mean the jail dod pronounced it jyle thats what i mean dod stood up then half doubled over seized by a cough which crackled with phlegm he went into the kitchenette separated from the living room by a breakfast bar and spat into the sink run the tap mrs soutar ordered rebus was looking at her she was looking sad but resilient it took her only a moment to shrug off the idea of the prison sentence hed be better off in jail hows that this is the garb or hadnt you noticed it does things to you to the young ones especially daveyd be better off out of the place what has it done to him mrs soutar she stared at him considering how long an answer to give nothing she said finally ormiston was standing by the wall unit studying a pile of cassettes next to the cheaphifi system put some music on if you like she told him might cheer us up okay said ormiston opening a cassette case i was joking but ormiston just smiled slammed the tape home and pressed play rebus wondered what he was up to then the music started an accordion at first joined by flutes and drums and then a quavering voice using vibrato in place of skill the song was the sash ormiston handed the cassette case to rebus the cover was a cheap xeroxed drawing of the red hand of ulster the bands name scratched on it in black ink they were called the proud red hand marching band though it was hard to conceive of anyone marching to an accordion dod who had returned from the sink started whistling along and clapping his hands its a grand old tune eh what do you want to put that on for mrs soutar asked ormiston he shrugged saying nothing aye a grand old tune dod collapsed onto the sofa the woman glared at him its bigotrys what it is ive nothing against the catholics well neither have i dod countered he winked at ormiston but theres no shame in being proud of your roots what about davey mr soutar does he have anything against catholics no no he seems to run around with protestant gangs its the garb mr soutar said you have to belong rebus knew what he was saying dod soutar sat forward on the sofa ye see its history isnt it the protestants have run ulster for hundreds of years nobodys going to give that up are they not if the other lot are sniping away and planting bombs and that he realised that ormiston had turned off the tape well isnt that right its a religious war you cant deny it ever been there ormiston asked dod shook his head then what the fuck do you know about it dod gave a challenging look and stood up i know pal dont think i dont aye right ormiston said i thought you were here to talk about my davey we are talking about davey mrs soutar rebus said quietly in a roundabout way he turned to dod soutar theres a lot of you in your son mr soutar dod soutar turned his combative gaze from ormiston oh aye rebus nodded im sorry but there it is dod soutars face creased into an angry scowl wait a fuckn minute pal think you can walk in here and fuckn people like you terrify me rebus said coolly he meant it too dod soutar hacking cough and all was a more horrifying prospect than a dozen caffertys you couldnt change him couldnt argue with him couldnt touch his mind in any way he was a closed shop and the management had all gone home my sons a good boy brought up the right way soutar was saying gave him everything i could some folk are just born lucky said ormiston that did it soutar launched himself across the narrow width of the room he went for ormiston with his head low and both fists out in front of him but collided with the shelf unit when ormiston stepped smartly aside he turned back towards the two policemen swinging wildly swearing barely coherent phrases when he went for rebus and rebus arched back so that the swipe missed rebus decided hed had enough he kneed soutar in the crotch queensferry rules he said as the man went down dod mrs soutar ran to her husband rebus gestured to ormiston get out of my house mrs soutar screamed after them she came to the front door and kept on yelling and crying then she went indoors and slammed her door the cassette was a nice touch rebus said on his way downstairs thought youd appreciate it where to now while were here said rebus maybe the youth club they walked outside and didnt hear anything until the vase hit the ground beside them smashing into a thousand pieces of shrapnel mrs soutar was at her window missed rebus yelled at her jesus christ ormiston said as they walked away the usual lacklustre teenagers sat around outside the community hall propping their backs against its door and walls rebus didnt bother to ask about davey soutar he knew what the response would be it had been drilled into them like catechism his ear was tingling not hurting exactly but there was a dull throbbing pain in his nose when they recognised rebus the gang got to their feet afternoon ormiston said youre right to stand up by the way sitting on concrete gives you piles in the hall jim hay and his theatre group were sitting on the stage hay too recognised rebus guess what he said we have to mount a guard otherwise they rip the stuff off rebus didnt know whether to believe him or not he was more interested in the youth sitting next to hay remember me malky malky haston shook his head ive got a few questions for you malky want to do it here or down the station haston laughed you couldnt take me out of here not if i didnt want to go he had a point well do it here then said rebus he turned to hay who raised his hands i know you want us to take a fag break he got up and led his troupe away ormiston went to the door to stop anyone else coming in rebus sat on the stage next to haston getting close making the teenager uncomfortable ive done nothing and im saying nothing have you known davey a while haston said nothing id imagine since you were kids rebus answered remember the first time we met you had bits in your hair i thought it was dandruff but it was plaster i spoke to scotscaf they hire out scaffolding to building contractors and when it comes back its your job to clean it isnt that right haston just looked at him youre under orders not to talk eh well i dont mind rebus stood up facing haston there was scotscaf scaffolding at the two murder sites billys and calumn smylies you told davey didnt you you knew where building work was going on empty sites all that he leaned close to hastons face you knew that makes you an accessory at the very least and that means were going to throw you in jail well pick out a nice catholic wing for you malky dont worry plenty of the green and white rebus turned his back and lit a cigarette when he turned back to haston he offered him one ormiston was having a bit of bother at the door the gang wanted in haston took a cigarette rebus lit it for him doesnt matter what you do malky you can run you can lie you can say nothing at all youre going away and were the only friends youll ever have he turned away and walked towards ormiston let them in he ordered the gang came crashing through the doors fanning out across the hall they could see malky haston was all right though he was sitting very still on the edge of the stage rebus called to him thanks for the chat malky well talk again any time you want then he turned to the gang malkys got his head screwed on he told them he knows when to talk lying bastard haston roared as rebus and ormiston walked into the daylight rebus met lachlan murdock at the crazy hose despite bothwells protests murdocks uncombed hair was wilder than ever his clothes sloppy he was waiting in the foyer when rebus arrived they all think i had something to do with it murdock protested as rebus led him into the dancehall well you did in a way rebus said what come on i want to show you something he led murdock up to the attic in the daytime the attic was a lot lighter even so rebus had brought a torch he didnt want murdock to miss anything this he said is where i found her shed suffered believe me already murdock was close to fresh tears but sympathy could wait the truth couldnt i found this on the floor he handed over the disk cover this is what they killed her for a computer disk same size as would fit your machine at home he walked up close to murdocks slouched figure they killed her for this he hissed he waited a moment then moved away towards the windows i thought maybe shed have made a copy she wasnt daft was she but i went to the shop and theres nothing there maybe in your fiat murdock just sniffed i cant believe she there was a copy murdock groaned i wiped it rebus walked back towards him why murdock shook his head i didnt think it he took a deep breath it reminded me rebus nodded ah yes billy cunningham it reminded you of the pair of them when did you begin to suspect murdock shook his head again see said rebus i know most of it i know enough but i dont know it all did you look at the files on the disk i looked he wiped his redrimmed eyes it was billys disk not hers but a lot of the stuff on it was hers i dont understand murdock managed a weak smile youre right i did know about the two of them i didnt want to know but i knew all the same when i wiped the disk i was angry i was so angry he turned to look at rebus i dont think he could have done it without millie you need quite a setup to hack into the kinds of systems they were dealing with hacking they probably used the stuff in her shop they hacked into army and police computers bypassed security invaded datafiles then marched out again without leaving any trace so what did they do murdock was talking now enjoying the release he wiped tears from below his glasses they monitored a couple of police investigations and altered a few inventories believe me once they were in they could have done a lot more the way murdock went on to explain it it was almost ludicrously simple you could steal from the army with inside assistance there had to be inside assistance and then erase the theft by altering the computer records to show stocks as they stood not as they had been then if scs or scotland yard or anyone else took an interest you could monitor their progress or lack of it millie millie had been the key throughout whether or not she knew what she was doing she got billy cunningham in he placed her in the lock and turned the disk had contained instructions on their hacking procedures tips for bypassing security checks the works rebus didnt doubt that the further billy cunningham got in the more he wanted out hed been killed because he wanted out hed probably mentioned his little insurance policy in the hope they would let him leave quietly instead theyd tried to torture its whereabouts out of him before delivering the final silencing bullet of course the shield knew billy wasnt hacking alone it wouldnt have taken them long to get to millie docherty billy had stayed silent to protect her she must have known thats why shed run there was stuff about this group too the shield murdock was saying i thought they were just a bunch of hackers rebus tried him with a few names davey soutar and jamesie macmurray hit home rebus reckoned that in an interview room he could crack jamesie like a walnut under a hammer but davey soutar well he might need a real hammer for that the final file on the computer was all about davey soutar and the garb this soutar murdock said billy seemed to think hed been skimming that was the word he used theres some stuff stashed in a lockup out at currie currie the lockup would belong to the macmurrays murdock looked at rebus he didnt say what was being skimmed is it money i underestimated you davey rebus said aloud all down the line it might be too late now but i swear i wont underestimate you again he thought of how davey and his kind hated the festival hated it with a vengeance he thought of the anonymous threats not money mr murdock weapons and explosives come on lets get out of here jamesie talked like a man coming out of silent retreat especially when his father hearing the story from rebus ordered him to gavin macmurray was incensed not that his son should be in trouble but that the orange loyal brigade hadnt been enough for him it was a betrayal jamesie led rebus and the other officers to a row of wooden garages on a piece of land behind macmurrays garage two army men were on hand they checked for booby traps and trip wires and it took them nearly half an hour to get round to going in even then they did not enter by the door instead they climbed a ladder to the roof and cut through the asphalt covering then dropped through and into the lockup a minute later they gave the all clear and a police constable broke open the door with a crowbar gavin macmurray was with them i havent been in here for years he said hed said it before as if they didnt believe him i never use these garages they had a good took round jamesie didnt know the precise location of the cache only that davey had said he needed a place to keep it the garage had operated as a motorcycle workshop that was how billy cunningham had got to know jamesie and through him davey soutar in the first place there were long rickety wooden shelves groaning with obscure metal parts a lot of them rusted brown with age tools covered with dust and cobwebs and tins of paint and solvent each tin had to be opened each tool examined if you could hide semtex in a transistor radio you could certainly hide it in a tool shed the army had offered a specialised sniffer dog but it would have to come from aldershot so instead they used their own eyes and noses and instinct hanging from nails on the walls were old tyres and wheels and chains forks and handlebars lay on the floor along with engine parts and mouldy boxes of nuts bolts and screws they scraped at the floor but found no buried boxes there was a lot of oil on the ground this place is clean said a smudged army man rebus nodded agreement hes been and cleared the place out how much was there jamesie but jamesie macmurray had been asked this before and he didnt know i swear i dont i just said he could use the space he got his own padlock fitted and everything rebus stared at him these young hard men rebus had been dealing with them all his life and they were pathetic like husks in suits of armour jamesie was about as hard as the sun crossword and he never showed you jamesie shook his head never his father was staring at him furiously you stupid wee bastard gavin macmurray said you stupid stupid wee fool well have to take jamesie down the station mr macmurray i know that then gavin macmurray slapped his sons face with a hand callused by years of mechanical work he loosened teeth and sent blood curdling from jamesies mouth jamesie spat on the dirt floor but said nothing rebus knew jamesie was going to tell them everything he knew outside one of the army men smiled in relief im glad we didnt find anything why keeping the stuff in an environment like that its bound to be unstable just like the guy whos got it unstable rebus thought of unstable from dunstable confessing to the st stephen street killing raving to di flower about curry and cars he walked back into the garage and pointed to the stain on the floor thats not oil he said not all of it what everybody out i want this place secured they all got out flower should have listened to unstable from dunstable the tramp had been talking about currie not curry and hed said cars because of the garages he must have been sleeping rough nearby and seen or heard something that night what is it sir one of the officers asked rebus if im right this is where they killed calumn smylie that evening rebus moved out of the hotel and back into patiences flat he felt exhausted like a tool that had lost its edge the stain on the garage floor had been a mixture of oil and blood they were trying to separate the two so they could dnatest the blood against calumn smylies rebus knew already what theyd find it all made sense when you thought about it he poured a drink then thought better of it instead he phoned patience and told her she could come home in the next day or two but she was determined to return in the morning so he told her why she shouldnt she was very quiet for a moment be careful john im still here arent i lets keep it that way he rang off when he heard the doorbell the manhunt for davey soutar was in full swing under the control of ci lauderdale at st leonards arms would be issued as and when necessary though they didnt know the extent of soutars cache no chances would be taken rebus had been asked if hed like a bodyguard ill trust to my guardian angel hed said the doorbell rang again he felt naked as he walked down the long straight hall towards the door the door itself was inchandahalf thick wood but most guns could cope with that and still leave enough velocity in the bullet to puncture human flesh he listened for a second then put his eye to the spyhole he let his breath out and unlocked the door youve got things to tell me he said opening the door wide abernethy produced a bottle of whisky from behind his back and ive brought some antiseptic for those cuts internal use only rebus suggested the money it cost me you better believe it still a nice drop of scotch is worth all the tea in china we call it whisky up here rebus closed the door and led abernethy back down the hall into the living room abernethy was impressed been taking a few backhanders i live with a doctor its her flat my mum always wanted me to be a doctor a respectable job she called it got some glasses rebus fetched two large glasses from the kitchen frankie bothwell couldnt afford to close the crazy hose the festival and fringe had only a couple more days to go all too soon the tourists would be leaving but over the past fortnight hed really been packing them in advertising and word of mouth helped as had a threenight residency by an american country singer the club was making more money than ever before but it wouldnt last the crazy hose was unique every bit as unique as frankie himself it deserved to do well it had to do well frankie bothwell had commitments financial commitments they couldnt be broken or excused because of low takings every week needed to be a good week so he was not best pleased to see rebus and another cop walk into the bar you could see it in his eyes and the smile as frozen as a crazy hose daiquiri inspector how can i help you mr bothwell this is di abernethy wed like a word its a bit hectic just now i havent had a chance to replace kevin strang we insist said abernethy with two conspicuous police officers on the premises trade at the bars wasnt exactly brisk and nobody was dancing they were all waiting for something to happen bothwell took this in lets go to my office abernethy waved byebye to the crowd as he followed rebus and bothwell into the foyer they went behind the admission desk and bothwell unlocked a door he sat behind his desk and watched them squeeze their way into the space that was left a big office is a waste of space he said by way of apology the place was like a cleaning cupboard there were spare till rolls and boxes of glasses on a shelf above bothwells head framed cowboy posters stacked against a wall bricabrac and debris like everything had just spilled out of a collision at a car boot sale we might be more comfortable talking in the toilets rebus said or down the station offered abernethy i dont think weve met bothwell said to him affably enough i usually only meet shit when i wipe my arse that took the smile off bothwells face inspector abernethy rebus said is special branch hes here investigating the shield the shield no need to be coy mr bothwell youre not being charged not yet we just want you to know were on to you in a big way and were not about to let go abernethy said on cue though it might help your case if you told us about davey soutar rebus placed his hands in his lap and waited abernethy lit a cigarette and blew the smoke across the strewn desk frankie bothwell looked from one man to the other and back again is this a joke i mean its a bit early for halloween thats when youre supposed to scare people without any reason rebus shook his head wrong answer what you should have said was whos davey soutar bothwell sat back in his chair all right then whos davey soutar im glad you asked me that said rebus hes your lieutenant maybe hes also your recruiting ofcer and now hes on the run did you know hes been keeping back some of the explosives and guns for himself weve got a confession it was a blatant lie and caused bothwell to smile that smile sealed bothwells guilt in rebuss mind why have you been funding the garb youth centre he asked is it a useful recruiting station you took the name cuchullain when you were an anarchist hes the great ulster hero the original red hand that was no accident you were dismissed from the orange lodge for being a bit overzealous in the early s your name was linked to the tartan army they used to break into army bases and steal weapons maybe thats what gave you the idea bothwell was still smiling as he asked what idea you know inspector i havent understood a word youve said no then understand this were a bollockhairs breadth away from you but more importantly we want to find davey soutar because if hes gone rogue with rifles and plastic explosives i still dont know what youre rebus jumped from his seat and grabbed bothwells lapels pulling him tight against the desk bothwells smile evaporated ive been to belfast bothwell ive spent time in the north the last thing that place needs is cowboys like you so put away your forked tongue and tell us where he is bothwell wrenched himself out of rebuss grip his lapel tearing down the middle in the process his face was purple eyes blazing he stood with his knuckles on the edge of the desk leaning over it his face close to rebuss nobody meddles wi me he spat thats my motto aye said rebus and you know the latin for it too did you get a kick that night in mary kings close youre crazy were the police abernethy said lazily were paid to be crazy whats your excuse bothwell considered the two of them and sat down slowly i dont know anyone called davey soutar i dont know anything about bombs or sword and shield or mary kings close i didnt say sword and shield said rebus i just said the shield bothwell sat in silence but now you mention it i see your father the minister was in the original sword and shield his names on file it was an offshoot of the scottish national party i dont suppose you know anything about it nothing no funny you were in the youth league was i did your dad get you interested in ulster bothwell shook his head slowly you never stop do you never said rebus the door opened the two bouncers from the main door stood there hands clasped in front of them legs apart theyd obviously been to the bouncers school of etiquette and just as obviously bothwell had summoned them with some button beneath the lip of his desk escort these bastards off the premises he ordered nobody escorts me anywhere said abernethy not unless shes wearing a tight skirt and ive paid for her he got up and faced the bouncers one of them made to take his arm abernethy grabbed the bouncer at the wrist and twisted hard the man fell to his knees there wasnt much room for the other bouncer and he looked undecided he was still looking blank as rebus pulled him into the room and threw him over the desk bothwell was smothered beneath him abernethy let the other bouncer go and followed rebus outside with a real spring in his step breathing deeply of edinburghs warm summer air i enjoyed that aye me too but do you think it worked lets hope so were making liabilities of them i get the feeling theyre going to implode well that was the plan every good plan however had a fallback theirs was big ger cafferty is it too late to grab a curry abernethy added youre not in the sticks now the nights young but as rebus led abernethy towards a good curry house he was thinking about liabilities and risks and dreading tomorrows showdown the day dawned bright with blue skies and a breeze which would soon warm it was expected to stay good all day with a clear night for the fireworks princes street would be bursting at the seams but it was quiet as dci kilpatrick drove along it he was an early riser but even he had been caught by rebuss wakeup call the industrial estate was quiet too after being cleared by the guard on the gate he drove up to the warehouse and parked next to rebuss car the car was empty but the warehouse door stood open kilpatrick went inside morning sir rebus was standing in front of the hgv morning john whats with all the cloak and dagger sorry about that sir i hope i can explain i hope so too going without breakfast never puts me in the best of moods its just that theres something i had to tell you and this seems as quiet a place as any well what is it rebus had started walking around the lorry kilpatrick following him when they were at the back of the vehicle rebus pulled on the lever and swung the door wide open on top of the boxes inside sat abernethy you didnt warn me it was a party kilpatrick said here let me help you up kilpatrick looked at rebus im not a pensioner and he pulled himself into the back rebus clambering after him hello again sir abernethy said putting his hand out for kilpatrick to shake kilpatrick folded his arms instead whats this all about abernethy but abernethy shrugged and nodded towards rebus notice anything sir said rebus i mean about the load kilpatrick put on a thoughtful face and looked around no he said finally adding i never was one for party games no games sir tell me what happens to all this stuff if were not going to use it in a sting operation it goes to be destroyed thats what i thought and the papers go with it dont they of course but since the stuff has been under our stewardship those papers will be from the city of edinburgh police i suppose so i cant see you will sir when the stuff came here there was a record with it detailing what it was and how much of it there was but we replace that record with one of our own dont we and if the first record goes astray well theres always our record rebus tapped one of the boxes theres less here than there was what rebus lifted the lid from a crate when you showed me around before with smylie there were more ak s than this kilpatrick looked horrified are you sure he looked inside the crate yet the current inventory shows twelve ak s and thats how many are here twelve abernethy confirmed as rebus got out the sheet of paper and handed it to kilpatrick then you must have made a mistake said kilpatrick no sir said rebus with all due respect ive checked with special branch they hold a record of the original delivery two dozen ak s the other dozen are missing theres other stuff too a rocket launcher some of the ammo you see sir said abernethy normally nobody would bother to backtrack would they the stuff is going for disposal and theres a chitty says everything checks no one ever looks back down the line but its impossible kilpatrick still held the sheet of paper but he wasnt looking at it no sir said rebus its dead easy if you can alter the record youre in charge of this load its your name on the sheet what are you saying rebus shrugged and slipped his hands into his pockets the surveillance on the american that was your operation too sir as requested by you inspector rebus nodded and i appreciated it its just i cant understand a few things such as how your trusted team from glasgow didnt spot me and a friend of mine having a drink with clyde moncur and his wife what the details you gave me sir there was nothing about that i didnt think there would be thats partly why i did it nor was there any mention of a meeting between clyde moncur and frankie bothwell all your men say is that moncur and his wife go for walks see the sights act the perfect tourists but there is no surveillance is there i know because i put a couple of colleagues onto moncur myself you see i knew something was up the minute i met inspector abernethy here you put an unofficial surveillance on moncur and ive the pictures to prove it on cue abernethy rustled a white paper bag one side of which was clear cellophane the black and white photos could be seen inside theres even one here abernethy said of you meeting moncur in gullane maybe you were talking about golf you must have promised the shield some of these arms before i came along rebus went on you brought me into the investigation to keep an eye on me but why would i bring you here in the first place because ken smylie asked you to and you didnt want to raise his suspicions theres not much gets past ken rebus had expected kilpatrick to deflate but he didnt if anything he grew bigger he plunged his hands into his jacket pockets and slid his shoulders back his face showed no emotion and he wasnt about to talk weve been looking at you for a while abernethy continued those prod terrorists you let slip through your fingers in glasgow he shook his head slowly thats one reason we moved you from glasgow to see if you could still operate when news of the sixpack reached me i knew you were still lending a hand to your friends in the shield theyve always relied on inside help and by christ theyve been getting it you thought it was a drugs hit kilpatrick argued abernethy shrugged im a good actor when you seconded inspector rebus i knew it was because you saw him as a threat you needed to keep an eye on him luckily he came to the same conclusion abernethy peered into the bag of photographsand heres the result funny sir said rebus when we were talking about sword and shield the old sword and shield i mean you never mentioned that you were a member what you didnt think there were any records but i managed to track some down back in the early s you were in their youth league same time frankie bothwell was like i say funny you never mentioned it i didnt think it was relevant then i was attacked by someone trying to put me out of the game the man was a pro id swear to that a streetslugger with a cutthroat razor he had a glasgow accent you must have met a few hard men during your stint over there you think i hired him with all respect rebus locked eyes with kilpatrick you must be off your rocker madness comes from the head not the blood not the heart kilpatrick rested against a box you think you can trust abernethy john well good luck to you im waiting for what your next gimmick he smiled if you wanted to make a case against me we wouldnt be meeting like this you know as well as i do that a filing mistake and an innocent photograph dont make a case they dont make anything you could be kicked off the force with my record no i might retire early say on health grounds but no ones going to sack me it doesnt happen that way i thought two experienced officers would know that now answer me this inspector rebus you set up an illicit surveillance how much trouble can that get you in with your record of insubordination and bucking the rules we could kick you off the force for not wiping your arse properly he rose from the box and walked to the edge of the lorry then dropped to the ground and turned towards them you havent proved anything to me if you want to try your act with someone else be my guests you cold bastard abernethy said he made it sound like a compliment he walked to the edge of the lorry and faced kilpatrick then slowly began to pull his shirt out from his trousers he lifted it up showing bare flesh and sticking plasters and wires he was miked up kilpatrick stared back at him anything to add sir abernethy said kilpatrick turned and walked away abernethy turned to rebus quiet all of a sudden isnt it rebus leapt from the lorry and walked briskly to the door kilpatrick was getting into his car but stopped when he saw him three murders so far rebus said including a police officer one of your own thats a madness of the blood that wasnt me kilpatrick said quietly yes it was rebus said thered be none of it without you i dont know how they got to calumn smylie they hack into computers your secretary uses one kilpatrick nodded and theres a file on the operation in the computer he shook his head slowly look rebus but kilpatrick stopped himself he shook his head again and got into the car shutting the door rebus bent down to the driversside window and waited for kilpatrick to wind it down abernethys told me what its about why the loyalists are suddenly arming themselves its harland and wolff this being a shipyard one of the biggest employers in the province its workforce predominantly protestant they think its going to be wound up dont they the loyalists are taking it as a symbol if the british government lets harland and wolff go to the wall then its washing its hands of the ulster protestants basically its pulling out hard to know whether kilpatrick was listening he was staring through the windscreen hands on the steering wheel at which point rebus went on anyway the loyalists are set to explode youre arming them for civil war but worse than that youve armed davey soutar hes a walking antipersonnel mine kilpatricks voice was hard unfeeling soutars not my problem frankie bothwell cant help maybe he could control soutar once upon a time but not now theres only one person soutar respects kilpatrick said quietly alan fowler the uvf man kilpatrick had started the engine wait a minute said rebus as kilpatrick moved off rebus kept a grip of the windowframe kilpatrick turned to him nine tonight he said at the garb then he sped out of the compound abernethy was just behind rebus what was he telling you he asked nine oclock at the garb sounds like a nice little trap to me not if we take the cavalry john abernethy said with a grin ive got all the cavalry well need rebus turned to face him youve been playing me like a pinball machine havent you that first time we met all that stuff you told me about computers being the future of crime you knew back then abernethy shrugged he pulled up his shirt again and started to pull off the wires all i did was point you in the general direction look at the way i got on your tits that first time thats how i knew i could trust you i nettled you and you let it show youd nothing to hide he nodded to himself yes i knew ive known for a long time proving it was the bugger abernethy looked at the compound gates but kilpatricks got enemies remember that not just you and me any more what do you mean but abernethy just winked and tapped his nose enemies he said rebus had pulled siobhan clarke off the moncur surveillance and put her on to frankie bothwell but frankie bothwell had disappeared she apologised but rebus only shrugged holmes had kept with clyde moncur but moncur and his wife were off on some bus tour a twoday trip to the highlands moncur could always get off the bus and double back but rebus discontinued the tail anyway you seem a bit glum sir siobhan clarke told him maybe she was right the world seemed upside down hed seen bad cops before of course he had but he had never before seen anything like kilpatricks lack of an explanation or a decent defence it was as if he didnt feel he needed one as if hed just been doing the right thing in the wrong way perhaps but the right thing all the same abernethy had told him how deep the suspicions went how long theyd been accumulating but it was hard to investigate a policeman who on the surface seemed to be doing nearly everything right investigation required cooperation and the cooperation wasnt there until rebus had come along at the garb lockups outside the blocks of flats police and army experts were opening doors just in case the stolen cache was inside one of the garages door to door inquiries were going on trying to pin down daveys friends trying to get someone to talk or to admit they were hiding him meantime jamesie macmurray was already being charged but they were minnows their flesh not enough to merit the hook kilpatrick too had disappeared rebus had phoned ormiston and found that the ci hadnt returned to his office and no one answered at his home holines and clarke returned from the warrant search of soutars home holmes toting a plain cardboard box obviously not empty holmes put the box on rebuss desk lets start holmes said with a jar of acid carefully concealbd under soutars bed his mother says he never lets her in to clean his room clarke explained hes got a padlock on the door to prove it we had to break the lock his mum wasnt best pleased shes a lovely woman isnt she said rebus did you meet the dad he was at the bookies lucky for you what else have you got typhoid probably holmes complained the place was like a calcutta rubbish tip clarke dipped in and pulled out a few small polythene bags everything in the box had been wrapped first and labelled weve got knives most of them illegal one still with what looks like dried blood on it some of it calumn smylies blood rebus didnt doubt she dipped in again mogadon tablets about a hundred of them and some unopened cans of cola and beer the can gang clarke nodded looks like it there are wallets credit cards itll take us two minutes to check oh and we found this little booklet she held it up for him it was poorly xeroxed with its asized sheets folded in half and stapled rebus read the title the total anarchy primer wonder who gave him this looks like its been translated from another language maybe german some of the words they couldnt find the english for so theyve left them in the original some primer it tells you how to make bombs said clarke in case you were wondering mostly fertiliser bombs but theres a section on timers and detonators just in case you found yourself with any plastique the perfect christmas gift are they checking the bedroom for traces holmes nodded they were at it when we left rebus nodded a special forensic unit had been sent in to test for traces of explosive materials the same unit had been working at the macmurray lockup they knew now that the garage had held a quantity of plastic explosive probably semtex but they couldnt say how much usually as one of the team had explained semtex was quite difficult to prove being colourless and fairly scentless but it looked like soutar had been playing with his toys unwrapping at least one of the packages the better to have a look at it traces had been left on the surface of the workbench were there detonators in the cache rebus asked thats the question holmes and clarke looked at one another a rhetorical one rebus added the city was definitely coming out to play it was the start of september and therefore the beginning of that slow slide into chill autumn and long dark winter the festival was winding down for another year and everyone was celebrating it was on days like this that the city so often submerged like atlantis or some sub aqua brigadoon bubbled to the surface the buildings seemed less dour and the people smiled as though cloud and rain were unknowns rebus might have been driving through a thunderstorm for all the notice he took he was a hunter and hunters didnt smile abernethy had just admitted being maries anonymous caller the one whod put her on to calumn smylie you knew you were putting his life in danger rebus asked maybe i thought i was saving it how did you know about mairie anyway i mean how did you know to contact her abernethy just smiled you sent me that stuff about clyde moncur didnt you yes you could have warned me what i was getting into you were more effective the way you were ive been a walking punchbag but youre still here i bet youd lose a lot of sleep if i wasnt the sun had finally given up the street lights were on there were a lot of people on the streets tonight hogmanay apart it was the citys biggest night of the year the traffic was all headed into town where most of the parking spaces had been grabbed hours ago families rebus explained on their way to the fireworks i thought we were on our way to the fireworks abernethy said smiling again we are said rebus quietly there were never signposts to places like the garb the inference being that if you wanted to go there you must already know the place people didnt just visit on a whim rebus took the sliproad past the gable end enjoy your visit to the garb and turned into the access road nine oclock he said abernethy checked his watch nine it is but rebus wasnt listening he was watching a van roaring towards them the road was barely wide enough for two vehicles and the van driver didnt seem to be paying much attention he was crouched down eyes on his wing mirror rebus slammed on the brakes and the horn and whipped the steering wheel around the rust bucket slew sideways like it was on ice that was the problem with bald tyres out rebus called abernethy didnt need telling twice the driver had finally seen them the van was skidding to an uncertain stop it hit the drivers side door shuddered and was still rebus pulled open the van door and hauled out jim hay hed heard of people looking white as a sheet white as a ghost but jim hay looked whiter than that rebus held him upright hes gone off his fucking headl hay yelled who has soutar hay was looking behind him back down the road which curled snakelike into the garb im only the delivery man not this not this dusting himself off abernethy joined them hed lost the knees out of his denims you deliver the stuff rebus was saying to hay the explosives the arms hay nodded yes the perfect delivery man in his little theatre van all boxes and props costumes and sets guns and grenades delivered east coast to west where another connection would be made another switch hold him rebus ordered abernethy looked like he didnt understand hold him then rebus let jim hay go got into the van and reversed it out of his cars bodywork and back into the garb when he reached the car park he turned the van and bumped it at speed onto the grass heading for the youth centre there was nobody about not a soul the doortodoor had been wound up for the day having yielded nothing the garb simply didnt speak to the polls it was a rule of life like remembering to breathe rebus was breathing hard the garages he passed had been searched and declared safe though one of them had contained a suspicious number of tv sets videos and camcorders and another showed evidence of sniffed glue and smoked crack no neighbours were out discussing the days events there was even silence at the community centre he doubted the garb tribe were the kind to be attracted to a firework display not normally the doors were open so rebus walked in a bright trail of blood led in an arc across the floor from the stage to the far wall kilpatrick was slumped against the wall almost but not quite sitting up hed removed his necktie halfway across the room maybe to help him breathe he was still alive but hed lost maybe a pint of blood already when rebus crouched down beside him kilpatrick clutched at him with wet red fingers leaving a bloody handprint on rebuss shirt his other hand was protecting his own stomach source of the wound i tried to stop him he whispered rebus looked around him was the stuff hidden here under the stage rebus looked at the small stage a stage hed sat on and stood on hays gone to fetch an ambulance kilpatrick said he was running like a rabbit rebus said kilpatrick forced a smile i thought he might he licked his lips they were cracked edged with white like missed toothpaste theyve gone with him who his gang theyll follow davey soutar to hell he made those phone calls he told me so just before he did this kilpatrick tried to look down at his stomach the effort was almost too much for him rebus stood up blood flushed around his system making him dizzy the fireworks hes going to blow up the fireworks he ran out of the hall and into the nearest tower block the first front door he came to he kicked it in it took him three good hits then he marched into the living room wheretwo terrified pensioners were watching tv wheres your phone we dinnae have one the man eventually said rebus walked back out and kicked in the next door same procedure this time the single mother with the two shrieking kids did have a phone she hurled abuse at rebus as he pressed the buttons im the police he told her it made her angrier still she quietened though when she heard rebus order an ambulance she was shushing the kids as he made his second call its di rebus here he said davey soutar and his gang are on their way to princes street with a load of high explosives we need that area sealed he halfsmiled an apology as he left the flat and halfran back to the van still nobody had come to investigate to see what all the noise and the fuss were like edinburghers of old they could become invisible to trouble in olden times theyd hidden in the catacombs below the castle and the high street now they just shut their windows and turned up the tv they were rebuss employers whose taxes paid his salary they were the people he was paid to protect he felt like telling them all to go to hell when he got back to his car abernethy was standing there with jim hay not a clue what to do with him rebus yanked the steering wheel and pulled the van onto the grass an ambulance is on its way he said trying to pull open his car door it groaned like something in a scrapyard crusher but eventually gave and he squeezed through the gap into his seat brushing aside the glass chippings where are you going abernethy asked stay here with him rebus said starting the car and reversing back up the access road the glenlivet fireworks every year there was a firework display from the castle ramparts accompanied by a chamber orchestra in princes street gardens bandstand and watched by crowds in the gardens and packed into princes street itself the concert usually started around tenfifteen tenthirty it was now ten oclock on a balmy dry evening the area would be full to bursting wild davey soutar he and his kind detested the festival it took away from them their edinburgh and propped something else in its place a facade of culture which they didnt need and couldnt understand there was no underclass in edinburgh theyd all been pushed out into schemes on the city boundaries isolated exiled they had every right to resent the city centre with its tourist traps and temporary playtime not that thats why soutar was doing it rebus thought soutar had some simpler reasons he was showing off he was showing even his elders in the shield that they couldnt control him that he was the boss he was in fact quite mad make a run for it davey rebus said to himself get a grip use your sense just but he couldnt think of the words he didnt often drive fast dangerously almost never it was car smashes that did it being on the scene at car smashes you saw heads so messed up you didnt know which side was the face until it opened its mouth to scream nevertheless rebus drove back into town like he was attempting the landspeed record his car seemed to sense the absolute urgency the necessity and for once didnt black out or choke up it whined its own argument but kept moving princes street and the three main streets leading down to it from george street had been cordoned off as a matter of course stopping traffic from coming anywhere near the thousands of spectators on a night like this thered be quarter of a million souls watching the display the majority of them in and around princes street rebus took his car as far as he could then simply stopped in the middle of the road got out and ran police were setting up new barriers lauderdale and flower were there he made straight for them any news he spat lauderdale nodded there was a convoy of cars on west coates running red lights travelling at speed thats them weve put up a diversion to bring them here rebus looked around wiping sweat from his eyes the street was lined with shops at street level offices above uniformed officers were moving civilians out of the area an army vehicle sat roadside bomb disposal lauderdale explained remember weve been ready for this more barriers were being erected and rebus saw van doors open and half a dozen police marksmen appear their chests covered by black body armour is kilpatrick okay lauderdale asked should be depends on the ambulance how much stuff does soutar have rebus tried to remember its not just explosives hes probably toting ak s pistols and ammo maybe grenades christ almighty lauderdale spoke into his radio where are they the radio crackled to life cant you see them yet no theyre right in front of you rebus looked up yes here they came maybe they were expecting a trap maybe not whichever it was still a suicide mission they might get in but they werent going to get out ready lauderdale called the marksmen checked their guns and pointed them ahead there were police cars behind the barriers the uniforms had stopped moving people away they wanted to watch more onlookers were arriving all the time keen for this preliminary event in the lead car davey soutar was alone he seemed to think about ramming the barricade then braked hard instead bringing his car to a stop behind him four other cars slowed and halted davey sat frozen in his seat lauderdale lifted a megaphone bring your hands where we can see them the car doors behind davey were opening metal clattered to the ground as guns were thrown down some of the garb started to run for it others seeing the armed police got out slowly with hands held high others were awaiting instructions one of them a young kid no older than fourteen lost his nerve and ran straight for the police lines overhead the first fireworks burst into brief life with a noise like oldfashioned gunfire and mortar the sky sizzled the glow lighting the scene at the first noise most people flinched instinctively the armed police dropped to a crouch others spread themselves on the ground the kid whod been running towards the barriers started screaming in fright then fell to his hands and knees behind him davey soutars car was empty hed shuffled into the passenger seat opened the door and made a dash to the pavement running low it took him only seconds to disappear into the mass of pedestrians did anyone see did he have a gun the army personnel moved in warily on the lead car while police started rounding up the garb more weapons were jettisoned lauderdale moved in to supervise his men and john rebus was after soutar the one place there wasnt much of a crowd was george street you couldnt see the fireworks from there so rebus had little trouble following soutar the sky turned from red to green to blue with small pops and the occasional huge explosion each explosion had rebus squirming thinking of the bomb disposal unit busy back at soutars car when the wind changed it carried with it wafts of musical accompaniment from the orchestra in the gardens chase music it wasnt soutar ran with loose energy almost bouncing he covered a lot of ground but it wasnt a straight line he did a lot of weaving from side to side covering most of the width of the pavement rebus concentrated on closing the gap moving forwards like he was on rails his eyes were on soutars hands as long as he could see those hands see they werent carrying anything he was content for all soutars crazy progress rebus was losing ground on the younger man except when soutar turned to look back at his pursuer thats what he was doing when he ran out into the road and bounced off a taxi cab the cab was on st andrews square the driver stuck his head out the window then pulled it in again fast when soutar drew his gun it looked like a service revolver to rebus soutar fired a shot through the cab window then started running again he was slower now with a slouch announcing a damaged right leg rebus glanced in at the cab driver hed thrown up all over his knees but was unhurt give it up rebus thought his lungs on fire give it up but soutar kept moving he ran through the bus station dodging the singledeckers as they moved in and out of their ranks the few waiting passengers could see he was armed and stared in horror as he flew past them jacket flapping for all the world like a scarecrow come to life rebus followed him up james craig walk across the top of leith street and into waterloo place soutar stopped for a moment as though trying to come to a decision his right hand still gripped the revolver he saw rebus moving steadily in his direction and dropped to one knee taking twohanded aim with the revolver rebus stepped into a doorway and waited for a shot that didnt come when he peered out again soutar had vanished rebus walked slowly towards where soutar had been he was nowhere on the street but a couple of yards further on was a gateway and beyond it some steps the steps led to the top of calton hill rebus took a final deep breath and accepted the challenge the rough steps up to the summit were busy with people climbing and descending most of them were young and had been drinking rebus couldnt even summon the breath to yell something stop him or get out of his way he knew if he tried to spit the stuff would be like paste all he could do was follow at the top calton hill was crowded with people sitting on the grass all eyes turned towards the castle the view would have been breathtaking had rebus had any breath to spare the music was being piped up here too smoke drifted south across the city followed by more tinsel colour and rockets it was like being the onlooker at a medieval siege a lot of people were drunk some were stoned it wasnt gunpowder you could smell up here rebus had a good look around hed lost davey soutar there was no street lighting here and crowds of people mostly young and dressed in denim easy to lose someone too damned easy soutar could be heading down the other side of the hill or snaking back down the roadway to waterloo place or he could be hiding amongst people who looked just like him except that the night air was chill rebus could feel it turning his sweat cold and soutar was only wearing a denim jacket as a huge firework burst over the castle and everyone stared up at the sky and gasped and cheered rebus looked for the one person who wasnt watching the one person with his head down the one person shivering like hed never get warm again he was sitting on the grass verge next to a couple of girls who were drinking from cans andwaving what looked like luminous rubber tubes the girls had moved away from him a little so that he looked the way he was all alone in the world behind him on the grass was a gang of bikers all muscle and gut they were shouting and swearing proclaiming hate of the english and all things foreign rebus walked up to davey soutar and davey soutar looked up and it wasnt him this kid was a couple of years younger strung out on something his eyes unable to focus hey one of the bikers yelled you trying to pick up my pal rebus held up his hands my mistake he said he turned around fast davey soutar was behind him hed slipped off his jacket and had wound it around his right arm all the way down to the wrist and the hand rebus knew what was in the hand disguised now by the grubby denim okay pigmeat lets walk rebus knew he had to get soutar away from the crowd there were probably five bullets still in the revolver rebus didnt want any more bodies not if he could help it they walked to the car park there was a hotfood van doing good business and a few cars their drivers and passengers biting into burgers it was darker here and quieter there wasnt much action here davey rebus said coming to a stop this as far as you want to go soutar said hed turned to face rebus no point me answering that davey youre in charge now ive been in charge all along rebus nodded thats right skimming without your bosses knowing about it planning all this he nodded towards the fireworks could have been quite something soutar soured his face you couldnt let it go could you kilpatrick knew you were trouble you didnt have to stab him a car was making its way slowly up to the car park from regent road soutar had his back to it but rebus could see it it was a marked police car its headlights off he tried to stop me soutar sneered no guts if the music was anything to go by the fireworks were coming to their climax rebus fixed his eyes on soutar watching the face turn from gold to green to blue put the gun away davey its finished not till i say so look enough just put it down the police car was at the top of the rise now davey soutar unwound the jacket from his arm and threw it to the ground a girl at the hotfood van started to scream behind soutar the police driver switched his headlamps on fullbeam lighting soutar and rebus like they were on stage the passenger door was open someone leaning out of it rebus recognised abernethy soutar pivoted aiming the gun it was all the incentive abernethy needed the report from his gun was as loud as anything from the castle meantime the crowd was applauding again unaware of the drama behind them soutar was knocked backwards taking rebus with him they fell in a heap rebus feeling the young mans damp hair brushing his face his lips he swore impressively as he pulled himself out from under the suddenly prone suddenly still figure abernethy was pulling the revolver from soutars hand his foot heavy on the youths wrist no need for that rebus hissed hes dead looks like said abernethy putting away his own gun so heres my story i saw a flash heard a bang and assumed hed fired sound reasonable are you authorised to carry that cannon what do you think i think youre as bad as him abernethy raised an eyebrow i dont think so and hey dont mention it what saving your fucking life after that stunt you pulled leaving me in the garb he paused youve got blood on you rebus looked there was plenty of blood there goes another shirt trust a jock to make a comment like that the police driver had got out of the car to look and a useful crowd was growing now that the fireworks had finished abernethy began to check soutars pockets best get it over with while the body was warm it was more pleasant that way when he got to his feet again rebus was gone and so was the car he looked in disbelief at his driver not again yes again rebus had the police radio on as he drove the bomb disposal team were halfway through lifting five small packages from the boot of soutars car the packages had been fitted with detonators and the semtex was of advanced age possibly unstable there were pistols automatic and boltaction rifles too god knew what hed been planning to use them for the fireworks over the buildings no longer glowed theyd returned to their normal sooty hue crowds were moving through the streets making their way home or towards last drinks late suppers people were smiling wrapping arms around themselves to keep warm theyd all enjoyed a good night out rebus didnt like to think about how close the whole night had come to disaster he switched on his siren and emergency lights to clear people from the roadway then pulled past the line of cars in front of him it was a few minutes before he realised he was shivering he pulled the damp shirt away from his back and turned up the heating in the car not that heat would stop him shivering he wasnt shivering from cold he was headed for tollcross the crazy hose he was headed for final business but when he arrived siren and lights off he saw smoke seeping out through the front doors he pulled his car hard onto the pavement and ran to the doors kicking them open it wasnt rule one in the firefighters manual but he didnt have much choice the fire was in the dancehall only the smoke had so far reached the foyer and beyond there was no one about a sign on the front door gave abrupt notice that the club was closed due to unforeseen circumstances thats me thought rebus im unforeseen circumstances he headed for frankie bothwells office where else was he going to go bothwell was sitting in his chair prevented from movement by a sudden case of death his neck flopped over to one side in a way necks shouldnt rebus had seen broken necks before there was bruising on the throat strangulation he hadnt been dead long his forehead was still warm but then it was getting warm in the office it was getting warm everywhere the new fire station was at the top of the road rebus wondered where the fire crew was as he came back into the foyer he saw that more smoke was belching from the dance hall the door had been opened clyde moncur was dragging himself into the foyer he was still alive and wanted to stay that way rebus checked moncur wasnt carrying a gun then got hold of him by the neck of his jacket and hauled him across the floor moncur was trying hard to breathe he was having a little trouble he felt light as rebus dragged him he kicked open the doors and deposited moncur at the top of the steps then he went in again yes the blaze had started here here in the dance hall flames had taken control of the walls and ceiling all bothwells gewgaws and furnishings were melting or turning to ash the carpet in the seating area had caught the bottles of alcohol hadnt exploded yet but they would rebus looked around but couldnt see much the smoke was too thick there was too much of it he wrapped his handkerchief around his face but even so he couldnt stop coughing he could hear a rhythmic thumping sound coming from somewhere somewhere up ahead it was the little selfcontained box where the dj sat over beyond the stage there was someone in there now he tried the door it was locked so sign of a key he took a few steps back so he could run at it then the door flew open rebus recognised the ulsterman alan fowler hes used his head to butt the door open his arms being tied firmly to the back of a chair they were still tied to the chair as head low he came barrelling from the box he caught rebus a blow to the stomach and rebus went down rebus rolled and came to his knees but fowler was up too and he was blind mad for all he knew it was rebus who was trying to roast him he butted rebus again this time in the face it was a sore one but rebus had ridden a glasgow kiss before the blow caught him on his cheek the power of it snapped rebuss head back sending him staggering fowler was like a bull the chair legs sticking up like swords from his back now that he was more or less upright he went for rebus with his feet one caught rebus on his damaged ear tearing it sending a white jab of pain bouncing through his brain that gave fowler time for another kick and this one was going to shatter rebuss knee until a blow in the face with an empty bottle knocked him sideways rebus looked up to see his saviour his knight in shining armour big ger cafferty was still wearing his funeral suit and open shirt he was busy making sure fowler was down and out then he took one look at rebus and produced the hint of a smile looking every bit as amused as a butcher who finds the carcass hes working on is still alive he spent a precious few seconds life and death second weighing up his options then he slung rebuss arm over his shoulder and walked with him out of the dance hall through the foyer and into the night air the clean breathable air rebus took in huge gulps of it falling onto the pavement sitting there head bowed his feet on the road cafferty sat down beside him he seemed to be studying his own hands rebus knew why too and now the fire engines were arriving men leaping out of cabs doing things with hoses one of them complained about the police car the keys were in the ignition so the fireman backed it up at last rebus could speak you did that he asked it was a stupid question hadnt he given cafferty nearly all the information hed needed i saw you going in cafferty said his voice raw you were gone a long time you could have let me die cafferty looked at him i didnt come in for you i came in to stop you bringing out that bastard fowler as it is moncurs done a runner he cant run far he better try he knows i wont give up you knew him didnt you moncur i mean hes an old pal of alan powlers when fowler was uvf the uvf laundered money using your salmon farm moncur bought the salmon with his good us dollars you never stop its my business well said cafferty glancing back at the club this was business too only sometimes you have to cut a few corners i know you have rebus was wiping his face problem is cafferty when you cut a corner it bleeds cafferty studied him there was blood on rebuss ear sweat cloying his hair davey soutars blood still spattered his shirt mixed now with smoke and kilpatricks handprint was still there cafferty stood up not thinking of going anywhere rebus said you going to stop me you know ill try a car drew up in it were caffertys men the two from the kirkyard plus weaselface cafferty walked to the car rebus was still sitting on the pavement he got up slowly now and walked towards the police car he heard caffertys car door shutting and looked at it noting the licence plate as the car passed him cafferty was looking at the road ahead rebus opened his own car and got on the radio giving out the licence number he thought about starting his engine and giving chase but just sat there instead watching the firemen go about their business i played it by the rules he thought i cautioned him and then i called in it didnt say in the rules that you had to have a go when there were four of them and only one of you yes hed played it by the rules the good feeling started to wear off after only minutes and damned few minutes at that they finally picked clyde moncur up at a ferry port special branch in london were dealing with him abernethy was dealing with him before hed left rebus had asked a simple question will it happen will what happen civil war what do you think so much for that the story was simple moncur was visiting town to see how the money from us shield was being spent fowler was around to make sure moncur was happy the festival had seemed the perfect cover for moncurs trip maybe billy had been executed to show the american just how ruthless sas could be in hospital recovering from his stab wounds dci kilpatrick was smothered to death with his pillow two of his ribs had been cracked from the weight of his attacker pressing down on him mustve been the size of a grizzly dr curt announced not many grizzlies about these days said rebus he phoned the procurator fiscals office just to check on caro rattray after all cafferty had spoken of her he just wanted to know she was okay maybe cafferty was out there tying up a lot of loose ends but caro had gone what do you mean some private practice in glasgow offered her a partnership its a big step up she grabbed it anyone would which office is it funny it was the office of caffertys own lawyers it might mean something or nothing after all rebus had given cafferty some names mairie henderson had gone down to london to try to follow up the moncur story abernethy phoned rebus one night to say he thought she was terrific yes said rebus youd make a lovely couple except she hates my guts abernethy paused but she might listen to you spit it out just dont tell her too much all right remember jump cantona will take most of the credit anyway and wee mairies been paid upfront she doesnt have to bust a gut most of what shed say wouldnt get past the libel lawyers and the official secrets act anyway rebus had stopped listening how do you know about jump cantona he could almost hear abernethy easing his feet up onto the desk leaning back in his chair the fbi have used cantona before to put out a story and youre in with the fbi ill send them a report dont cover yourself with too much glory abernethy youll get a mention inspector but not star billing thats how you knew about mairie isnt it cantona told the fbi its how you had all the stuff on clyde moncur to hand does it matter probably not rebus broke the connection anyway he shopped for a coming home meal pushing the trolley around a supermarket close to fettes hq he wouldnt be going back to fettes hed phoned his farewell to ormiston and told him to tell blackwood to cut off his remaining strands of hair and be done with it hed have a seizure if i told him that said ormiston here what about the chief you dont think but rebus had rung off he didnt want to talk about ken smylie didnt want to think about it he knew as much as he needed to kilpatrick had been on the fringe he was more useful to the shield that way bothwell was the executioner hed killed billy cunningham and hed ordered the deaths of millie docherty and calumn smylie soutar had done his masters bidding in both cases except millie had proved messy and soutar had left her where hed killed her bothwell must have been furious about that but of course davey soutar had other things on his mind other plans bigger things rebus bought the makings for the meal and added bottles of rose champagne malt whisky and gin to the trolley a mile and a half to the north the shops on the garb estate would be closing for the evening pulling down heavy metal shutters fixing padlocks doublechecking alarm systems he paid with plastic at the checkout and drove back up the hill to oxford terrace curiously the rust bucket was sounding healthier these days maybe that knock from hays van had put something back into alignment rebus had replaced the glass but was still debating the doorframe at the fiat patience was waiting for him back from perth earlier than expected whats this she said it was meant to be a surprise he put down the bags and kissed her she drew away from him slowly afterwards you look an absolute mess she said he shrugged it was true hed seen boxers in better shape after fifteen rounds hed seen punchbags in better shape so its over she said finishes today i dont mean the festival i know you dont he pulled her to him again its over did i hear a clink from one of those bags rebus smiled gin or champagne gin and orange they took the bags into the kitchen patience got ice and orange juice from the fridge while rebus rinsed two glasses i missed you she said i missed you too who else do i know who tells awful jokes seems a while since i told a joke its a while since i heard one well my sister told me one youll love it she arched back her head thinking god how does it go rebus unscrewed the top from the gin bottle and poured liberally whoah patience said you dont want us getting mortal he splashed in some orange maybe i do she kissed him again then pulled away and clapped her hands yes ive got it now theres this octopus in a restaurant and its ive heard it said rebus dropping ice into her glass
