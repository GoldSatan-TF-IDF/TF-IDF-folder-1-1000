because the night james ellroy i must take charge of the liquid fire and storm the cities of human desire w h auden the liquor store stood at the tail end of a long stretch of neon where the hollywood freeway cut across sunset the dividing line between bright lights and residential darkness the man in the yellow toyota pulled into the bushes beside the onramp twisting the wheel outward and snapping on the emergency brake in a single deft motion he took a bigbore revolver from the glove compartment and stuck it inside a foldedup newspaper with the grip and trigger guard extended then turned the ignition key to accessory and opened the car door breathing shallowly he whispered beyond the beyond and walked up to the blinking fluorescent sign that spelled liquor the dividing line between his old life of fear and his new life of power when he walked through the open door the man behind the counter noticed his expensive sports clothes and folded wall street journal and decided he was a class scotch buyerchivas or walker black at the least he was about to offer assistance when the customer leaned over the counter jabbed the newspaper at his chest and said fortyonecaliber special load dont make me prove it give me the money the proprietor complied keeping his eyes on the cash register to avoid memorizing the robbers features and giving him a reason to kill he felt the mans finger on the trigger and caught the shadow of his head circling the store as he fumbled the cash into a paper bag he was about to look up when he heard a sob behind him near the refrigerator case followed by the sound of the robber cocking his gun when he did look up the wall street journal was gone and a huge black barrel was descending and then there was a cracking behind his ear and blood in his eyes the gunman leaped behind the counter and dragged the man kicking and flailing to the rear of the store then crept to the cardboard beer display that stood next to the refrigerator case he kicked the display over and saw a young woman in a navy pea coat huddled behind an old man in coveralls the robber weaved on his feet nothing he had been taught had prepared him for three his eyes shifted back and forth between the two whimpering in front of him and the counterman off to his left searching for a neutral ground to tell him what to do his vision crisscrossed the store picking up geometric stacks of bottles shelves piled with junk food cutouts of girls in bikinis drinking rum punch and spanada nothing a scream was building in his throat when he saw the beige curtain that separated the store from the living quarters behind it when a gust of wind ruffled the curtain he did screamwatching as the cotton folds assumed the shape of bars and hangmans nooses now he knew he jerked the girl and the old man to their feet and shoved them to the curtain when they were trembling in front of it he dragged the counterman over and stationed him beside them muttering green door green door he paced out five yards wheeled and squeezed off three perfect head shots the horrible beige curtain exploded into crimson detective sergeant lloyd hopkins stared across the desk at his best friend and mentor captain arthur peltz wondering when the dutchman would end his preliminaries and get down to the reason why he had called him here everything from the lapds touch football league to recent robbery bulletins had been discussed lloyd knew that since janice and the girls had left him dutch had to fish for conversational openershe could never be direct when he wanted something the rearing of families had always been their icebreaker but now that lloyd was familyless dutch had to establish parities by roundabout means growing impatient and feeling ashamed of it lloyd looked out the window at the nightwatch revving up their blackandwhites and said youre troubled dutch tell me what it is and ill help dutch put down the quartz bookend he was fingering jungle jack herzog ring a bell lloyd shook his head no handing him a manila folder dutch said officer jacob herzog age thirtyfour thirteen years on the job an exemplary cop balls like you wouldnt believe looked like a wimp bench pressed twofifty worked metro worked intelligence division plants worked solo on vice loanouts to every squad room in the city three citations for bravery known as the alchemist because he could fake anything he could be an old crippled man a drunk marine a fag a low rider you name it lloyds eyes bored in and and hes been missing for three weeks you remember marty bergen old yellowstreak i know two jigs blew his partner in half with a tengauge and bergen dropped his gun and ran like hell i know he faced a trial board for cowardice under fire and got shitcanned from the department i know he published some short stories when he was working hollenbeck patrol and that hes been churning out anticop bullshit for the big orange insider since he was fired how does he figure in this dutch pointed to the folder bergen was herzogs best friend herzog spoke up for him at the trial board made a big stink dared the department to fire him the chief himself had him yanked off the streets assigned to a desk job downtownclerking at personnel records but jungle jack was too good to be put to pasture hes been working undercover on requests from half the vice commanders on this side of the hill hed been here at hollywood for the past couple of months walt perkins requested him paid him cash out of the snitch fund to glom liquor violators jack was knocking them dead where walts guys couldnt get in the door without being recognized lloyd picked up the folder and put it in his jacket pocket missing persons report family friends all negative lloyd herzog was a stone loner no family except an elderly father his landlord hasnt seen him in over a month he hasnt shown up here or at his personnel job downtown booze dope a pussy hound dutch sighed i would say that he was what youd call an ascetic intellectual and the department doesnt seem to carewalt and i are the first ones to even note his absence hes been a sullen hardass since bergen was canned lloyd sighed back youve been using the past tense to describe herzog dutchman you think hes dead yeah dont you lloyds answer was interrupted by shouting from the downstairs muster room there was the sound of footsteps in the hall and seconds later a uniformed cop stuck his head in the doorway liquor store on sunset and wilton skipper three people shot to death lloyd began to tingle his body going alternately hot and cold im going he said the man in the yellow toyota turned off topanga canyon road and drove north on the pacific coast highway dawdling at stoplights so that his arrival at the doctors beach house would coincide exactly with dusk as always the dimming of daylight brought relief brought the feeling of another gauntlet run and conquered with darkness came his reward for being the doctors unexpendable right arm the one person aside from the night tripper who knew just how far his lonelies could be tapped dredged milked and exploited spring was a sweet enemy he thought there were torturously long bouts of sunshine to contend with transits that made nightfall that much more satisfying this morning he had been up at dawn running an eighthour string of telephone credit checks on the names gleaned from the john books of the doctors hooker patients a full day with hopefully a fuller evening in store his first grouping since taking three people for the mortal coil shuffle and maybe later a run to the south bay singles bars to trawl for more rich lonelies the mans timing was perfect he pulled off pch and down the access road just as the doctors introductory music wafted across the parking area six carssix lonelies a full house he would have to run for the speaker room before the night tripper got impatient inside the house the man ignored the baroque quartet issuing over the central speakers and made for a small rectangular room lined with acoustical padding the walls held a master recording console with six speakers one for each upstairs bedroom with microphone jacks for each outlet and six pairs of headphones and an enormous twelvespooled tape deck capable of recording the activity in all the bedrooms with the flick of a single switch he went to work first turning on the power amp then hitting the volume on all six speakers at once a cacophony of chanting struck his ears and he turned the sound down the lonelies were still shouting their mantras working themselves into the trancelike state that was a necessary precondition to the doctors counseling getting out his notebook and pen the man settled into a leather chair facing the console waiting for the red lights on the amplifier to flashhis signal to listen in record and assess from his standpoint as dr john havillands executive officer he had held that position for two years two years spent prowling los angeles for human prey the doctor had taught him to control his compulsions and in payment for that service he had become the instrument that brought about realization of havillands own obsession as the doctor explained it a consciousness implosion had replaced the consciousness explosion of the s resulting in large numbers of people abandoning the old american gospels of home hearth and country and the counterculture revelations of the sixties three exploitable facts remained one indigenous to the naive presixties psyche two to the jaded post god sex and drugs given the right people the variations on those three themes would be infinite his assignment was to find the right people havilland described his prototypical chess piece as white of either gender the offspring of big money who never fit in and never grew up weak scared bored to death and without purpose but given to a mystical bent they should be orphaned and living on trust funds or investment capital or severely estranged from their families and living on remittances they should accede to the concept of the spiritual master without the slightest awareness that what they really want is someone to tell them what to do they should love drugs and possess marked sexuality they should consider themselves rebels but their rebelliousness should always have been actualized as timid participation in mass movements find these people for me it will be easier than you might think because as you search for them they will be searching for me the search took him to singles bars consciousness workshops the ashrams of a half dozen gurus and lectures on everything from new left social mobilization to macrobiotic midwifery and resulted in six people who met havillands criteria straight down the line and who fell for his charisma hook line and sinker along the way he served the doctor in other capacities burglarizing the homes of his legitimate patients reconnoitering for information that would lead to the recruitment of more lonelies screening sex ads in the underground tabloids for rich older people to pimp the lonelies to planning his training sessions and keeping his elaborately crossreferenced files he had moved forward with the doctor indispensable as his procuror of human clay soon havilland would embark on his most ambitious project with him at his side last night he had proved his mettle superbly but the headaches the light above speaker number one flashed on causing the man to drop his pen and reach for the headphones he had managed to adjust them and plug in the jack when he heard the doctor coughhis signal that it was time to pay careful attention and make notes about anything that seemed special or particularly useful first came a profusion of amenities followed by the two lonelies praising the bedrooms decor the man could hear the doctor poohpoohing the rococo tapestries assuring his charges that such surroundings were their birthright get to it doc the man muttered as if in answer the doctor said so much for light conversation were here to break through the prosaic not dawdle in it how did your menage in santa barbara work out did you learn anything about yourselves exorcise any demons a soft male voice answered the man recognized the voice immediately and recalled his recruitment the gay bar in west hollywood the plump executive type whose wary mien was a virtual neon sign announcing frightened firsttimer seeking sexual identity the seduction had been easy and the seducee had met all the doctors criteria we used the coke to get things started the soft voice said our client was old and afraid of displaying his body but the coke got his juices running i a womans voice interrupted i got the old geezers juices going he wasnt even down to his skivvies when i grabbed his crotch he wanted the woman to take the lead i sensed that as soon as we walked in the door and i saw all that science fiction art on the wallsamazons with chains and whips all that shit he the soft male voice rose to a wail i was savoring the leadin doctor said to take it slow the guy wasnt prescreened we got him from the sex ads and doctor said that bullshit the woman barked you wanted to get coked yourself and you wanted the old guy to like you because you were the one with the dope and if we played it your way the whole assignment would have been a cocaine tea party the man put down his pen as the executive type started to blubber after a short interval of silence the doctor whispered hush billy hush go out and sit in the hallway i want to talk to jane alone there were the sounds of footsteps over a hardwood floor and of a door slammed in rage the man smiled in anticipation of some vintage havilland when the doctors voice came over the speaker he took up his pen with a glee akin to love youre letting your anger run you jane i know doctor the woman said your power lies in exercising it judiciously i know was the assignment fulfilling yes i chose the sex and made them like it but it felt hollow afterwards yes and no it was satisfying but billy and the old man were so weak hush janey you deserve to traffic with stronger egos ill keep my eye on the highline personals well find you some feisty intellectuals to butt heads with and a partner with balls nooo youll go solo next time the man heard jane weep in gratitude shaking his head in loathing he listened to the doctor deliver his coup de grace he paid you the full five thousand yes doctor did you do something nice for yourself with your gratuity i bought myself a sweater you could have done better than that ii wanted you to have the money doctor i took the sweater just as a symbol of the assignment thank you jane everything else all right reciting your fear mantras following the program yes doctor good then leave the money with me ill call you at the pay phone later this week yes doctor the sounds of departure forced the man to catch up with his notetaking as if on cue the doctor clapped his hands and said jesus what an ugly creature speaker three goff efficacy training goff plugged a jack into speaker number three and hit the record switch when the tape spool began to spin he tiptoed upstairs to watch this would be his first visual auditing since blasting his beyond to hell and he had to see how far the night tripper was taking his recruits only one of them was capable of approaching his own degree of extremity and all his instincts told him that havilland was just about to push him to it goff was wrong peering through a crack in the door he saw the professor and the bookworm kneeling on gym mats facing the mirror that covered the entire west wall their hands were clasped as if in prayer and havilland was standing over them murmuring words of encouragement with billy boy and the bull dagger already counseled it meant that the doctor was saving the foxy redhead and the real psycho for last goff pressed himself into the wall and stared into the bedroom just as the two men on the mats pulled off their undershirts and began shouting their fear mantras patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum with each repetition of the phrase they smashed their hands into their chests each time harder shouting louder and louder as the blows hit home throughout they retained eyetoeye contact with their own mirror images never flinching even as blooddotted welts rose on their torsos goff checked the second hand of his watch one minute two three just when he thought the chanters would have to collapse he heard the word stop havilland knelt on the mat facing the men goff watched them move their eyes from the mirror to the eyes of the doctor then extend their right arms and squeeze their hands into fists havilland reached into the pocket of his lab coat and withdrew a disposable syringe and a handful of cotton balls first he injected the bookworm then he wiped the needle and injected the professor both lonelies swayed on their knees but remained upright the doctor got to his feet smiled and said think pure efficacy robert you have been placed in a very wealthy home on assignment a couple an older man and woman are drooling for your favors the phone rings they both go to answer it where do you go robert stammered tto the bbathroom to check for drugs havilland shook his head no you have drugs on the brain its a weak point of yours monte what would you do monte wiped sweat from his chest and twisted to stare at himself in the mirror i would wonder why the call was so important that they both had to run for the phone especially when i was there looking so groovy so what i would do would be to run for an extension and pick it up the very second that the old fucker did then listen in and see if there was any salient info i could get from the call havilland smiled and said bravo then slapped monte across the face and whispered bravo but always look at me when you answer if you look at yourself you get the notion that you thought independently do you see the fallacy in that kind of thinking monte lowered his eyes then brought them up to meet havillands yes doctor good robert a hypothetical question for you think pure efficacy and answer candidly my supply of legally obtained pharmaceutical drugs runs out because of new laws passed limiting hypnotics and the like to physicians with hospital affiliations you crave them and come to realize that they are what you like most about being in my tutelage what do you do the bookworm pondered the question shifting his gaze back and forth from the mirror to the doctor goff grinned when he realized that havilland had given the lonelies a pentothal jolt finally robert whispered it would never happen to you it just couldnt havilland put his hands on roberts shoulders and gave them a gentle squeeze the perfect answer monte would have intellectualized it but your response was pure candor and pure heart and of course you were right i want you to both chant your mantras now hold eye contact with yourself but think of me when havilland started for the door goff padded downstairs and back to the speaker room he rewound the efficacy training tape and placed the spool in a large manila envelope then plugged his headphones into the middle speaker just in time to hear malefemale sexual grunting move into strangled sighs and girlish giggles the giggle became a highpitched smokers cough and goff himself laughed it was the tight little redhead he had picked up at the lingerie club the one who had devastated him with her kundalini yoga positions he had been lucky to get out of her bunker hill towers condo alive the doctor was the first to speak bravo bravo his monotone sent the woman into new gales of laughter the man she had coupled with was still trying to catch his breath goff imagined him lying on the bed on the verge of a coronary the doctor spoke again later helen i want to check the victims pulse you may have gone too far this time beyond the beyond helen said isnt that our motto doctor touche the doctor said ill call you thursday when a full five minutes of silence followed the sound of little helen skipping gaily out the bedroom door goffs gut clenched he knew that the male lover was the real psycho and that the night tripper was taking him a major step closer to his brink thus the shattering of glass and the obscenities that came in the wake of the stillness were expected as were the expressions of concern from the doctor its all right richard it really is sometimes beyond the beyond means hating first you have to accept that reality then you have to work through it you cant hate yourself for being what you are you are basically good and powerful or you wouldnt be with me now you just happen to have an exceptionally high violence threshold to overcome in order to achieve your selfhood thomas goff shifted into memories of richard oldfields recruitment beginning with the crippled whore with the threehundreddollaraday smack habit he had met at platos retreat west she had told him of the stockbrokerbodybuilderremittance man who paid five cnotes a pop to work her over because of her resemblance to the governess who had tortured him as a child the approach at the health club had had the thrust of a nightmare oldfield looked enough like goff to be taken for his fraternal twin and he was deadlifting four hundred pounds but the bodybuilder had capitulated to the doctors machinations like a baby going for its mothers tit more breaking glass oldfield weeping havilland alternately whistling a tune and murmuring there there goff knew that the reversal was coming it arrived in the form of a slap in the face that filled the speaker with static you weakling dr john havilland hissed you picayune poseur you sycophantic whoremonger i give you the best fuck in our program promise to take you where your chickenshit conscience would never permit you to stray and you respond by smashing windows and bawling doctor please richard oldfield whimpered please what richard pleyou know you have to say it pleplease take me as far as i can go the doctor sighed soon richard im going to be collecting a great deal of information and it should yield the name of a woman suitable for you think of that when you go through your fear mantras thank you doctor john dont thank me richard your green doors are my green doors go home now im tired and im going to dismiss the grouping early goff heard the doctor escort oldfield to the door the tape machine recorded a hissing silence the night trippers executive officer imagined it as being inhabited by nightmares in repose manifested in cold manila folders spilling out data that would transform human beings into chess pieces the alchemist and his six offerings were just the beginning a series of havillands slogans caused goff to shudder back the headache that was burning behind a beige curtain in his mind last night three what if the data keepers couldnt be bought the headache throbbed through the curtain like a hungry worm eating at his brain doors slamming above him periods of stillness followed by the staggered departures of the lonelies mercedes and audis pulling out onto pch and more silence suddenly goff was terrified bad thoughts thomas goff swung around in his chair knocking his shorthand pad to the floor he looked up into the light brown eyes of dr john havilland locking his own eyes into them exactly as the doctor had taught him just thoughts doctor good the papers are full of you how does it feel it feels dark and quiet good does the psycho killer speculation disturb you no it amuses me because its so far from the truth you had to take out three yes ii remembered your efficacy training somesometime i might have to do it again a cold gun untraceable cold city i stole it good how are the headaches not too bad i chant if they really start to hurt good if your vision starts to blur again see me immediately ill give you an injection dreams sometimes i dream about the alchemist he was good wasnt he he was superb thomas but hes gone i scared him off the face of the earth havilland handed goff a slip of paper shes a legitimate patientshe phoned the office for an appointment i checked her out with some girls in the life shes a thousand dollars a night check out her john bookanyone who can afford her can afford us goff looked at the slip linda wilhite wilshire blvd w he smiled its an easy building ive hit it before havilland smiled back good thomas go home now and enjoy your dreams how do you know ill enjoy them i know your dreams i made them goff watched the doctor aboutface and walk to the latticework patio that overlooked the beach he let the doctors exit line linger in his mind then turned off the tape console and walked outside to his car he was about to hit the ignition when he noticed a mound of wadded up plastic on top of the dashboard he grabbed at it and screamed because he knew that it was beige plastic and that meant that he knew goff ripped the plastic trashbag to shreds then slammed his fists into the dashboard until the pain numbed the screaming in his mind turning on the headlights he saw something white under his windshield wiper he got out of the car and examined it the embossed business card of john r havilland md practice in psychiatry stared at him he turned the card over neatly printed on the back were the words i know your nightmares after thirtysix nonstop hours on the liquor store case lloyd hopkins fell asleep in his cubicle at parker center and dreamed of annihilation sound waves bombarded him predator birds attacked the willfully shutoff part of his brain where the man he had killed in the watts riot and the man he had tried to kill last year resided the birds tore open jagged sections of sky letting in crystals the color of blood when he awakened he bludgeoned the images with quiet stilllifes of janice and the girls in san francisco waiting for time to heal the wounds or reinforce the division the liquor storecharnel house memory took over from there pushing family love back into the safety compartment with his nightmares lloyd was relieved the death scene expanded in his mind chalked like a forensic technicians marking grid off to his left were an open cash register a counter scattered with tens and twenties broken liquor bottles all along the lower shelves heel marks where the proprietor had been dragged to his execution the right hand grid revealed an overturned cardboard beer display and heel marks where the two other victims had probably crouched to hide from the killer bisecting the grids was the crimson wind tunnel into the stores rear room three bodies crumpled across a once beige curtain that was torn free from the doorway by the muzzle velocity of three hollow point slugs smashing through three cranial vaults there were no discernible trajectory or spatter marks exploded brain and bone debris had rendered the tiny stockroom a slaughterhouse lloyd shook himself further awake thinking psychopath he walks into the store pulls out a monster handcannon and demands the money then sees or hears something that flips his switch enraged he hops over the counter and drags the proprietor by the hair over to the doorway the girl and the old man betray their presence he knocks over the display cutout and makes them walk to the curtain then he takes them out with three bullseyes from a topheavy unvented revolver with monster recoil leaving the money on the counter a volcano with icewater fuel injection lloyd stood up and stretched feeling the last residue of sleep dissipate he walked down the hall to the mens room and stood before the sink alternately staring at himself in the mirror and running cold water over his face he ignored the sound of early arriving officers laughing and primping quietly around him aware for a split second that they were keeping their voices at a low register out of deference to his reputation and wellknown hatred of loud noise feeling his rage start to peak he defined his killer with selfrighteous cop invective psychopathic scumbag take him out before his switch flips again the first thirtysix hours of his investigation had been spent thinking and chasing computer type after noticing a no parking zone outside the liquor store and extending all the way down the block lloyd theorized that the killer had either walked to the location or had parked in the bushes beside the freeway onramp his latter thesis had been rewardedunder fluorescent arc lights the forensic technicians had found fresh tire tracks in the soft dirt and minute yellow paint scrapings stuck to the tips of sharp branches four hours later the lapds scientific investigation division completed its tests on the paint and announced the results of the technicians plaster of paris moldings of the tire tracks the car was a japanese import late model the paint the standard brand in every japanese automotive plant the tires standard equipment radialsused solely by japanese manufacturers r ampi and a computer crosscheck of recent armed robbery and homicide bulletins revealed that there were no yellow japanese imports registered to convicted and paroled armed robbers or murderers and that none had been mentioned as figuring in any robberies or homicides dating back over a year the california department of motor vehicles supplied the most frustrating information there were yellow japanese automobiles to models registered in los angeles county making a concerted check for criminal records a clerical impossibility even the la county hot sheet yielded zilcha total of eight yellow toyotas subarus and hondas had been reported stolen over the past six weeks and all eight had been recovered the car was a dead end which left the gun lloyd considered the still awaited latent print workup a foregone conclusion smudges streaks partials and at best a few completes belonging to local juiceheads who patronized the store let the three officers he had assigned to run background checks on the victims have carte blanche there fingerprint mania or the kill three to get one angle his superiors at robberyhomicide had told him to stress were as dead as the car every ounce of lloyds instinct told him that just as every ounce had told him that the trinity of this case was the killers psychosis his cool his gun the ballistics report and the autopsy protocol were rife with flatout wonderment henry mcguire wallace chamales and susan wischer were killed by a revolver fired from a distance of twelve to fifteen feet all three slugs hitting them square between the eyes the killer was a marksman the gun an anomaly fortyone revolvers predated the wild west days going out of manufacture before the civil war they were too unwieldy too heavy and had a marked tendency toward misfiring fortyone ammunition was even worse hardball or hollow point its unpredictable reports were capable of jerking the shooters arm seemingly out of its socket or of going off like a soggy popcorn kernel whoever had shot the three people at freeway liquor had mastered a difficult antique handgun with antique ammo and had exercised his mastery under a state of extreme duress lloyd stared deeper at his own mirror image wondering what to do now that he had already sent stolen gun queries to every police agency in california and had personally questioned every antique gun dealer in the central yellow pages negative answers all the way down the linenos in stock let alone purchased and it would probably be another twentyfour hours before the responses to his queries began trickling in all the paperwork was digested all the facts were lodged there was nothing he could do but wait and waiting was antithetical to his nature lloyd walked back to his cubicle and stared at the walls snapshots of his daughters formed a spray around the feds ten most wanted a pincushion map of la county showed that homicides were up in hollywood south central and the east valley on the freeway liquor case the obvious next step was a call to hollywood dicks to see what their snitches had come up with looking for something to perk his mental juices he picked up the file that dutch peltz had given him just before the start of the frantic thirtysix hours herzog jacob michael was typed on the front of the manila folder and inside were xerox copies of statistical records forms fitness reports commendation certificates and odd memoranda from superior officers thinking of herzog as a dead man and of the folder as his epitaph lloyd pulled up a chair and read every word in it five times a singular man emerged jungle jack herzog had a iq barely met the lapds height and weight requirements and was born in beirut lebanon he was fluent in three middle eastern languages and had protested the vietnam war in college before joining the air national guard he had graduated twelfth in his academy class and received scrolls in scholarship marksmanship and physical training his first four years on the job had been spent working wilshire patrol and wilshire vice receiving class a fitness reports earning praise from all superior officers save one vice squad lieutenant who shunted him back into uniform for refusing to serve in a public restroom deployment to catch persons engaged in homosexual acts that same lieutenant had then recanted his criticismlater requesting that herzog train his men in operating bookmaking and prostitution surveillances heavily emphasizing the use of disguise herzogs seminars had been so successful that he gained consultant status training plainclothes officers citywide staying in demand while doing four and three year tours of duty at west la and venice divisions jungle jack became known as the alchemist a reference to his ability to transform himself and render himself virtually invisible on the street he was also spectacularly bravetwice resolving hostage situations the first time by offering himself to the gunman who had taken over a bar he was staking out for liquor violations the gunman had grabbed a young prostitute and was holding a knife to her throat while his accomplice tapped the cash register and grabbed the purses and billfolds of the bars patrons herzog in the guise of a crippled drunk taunted the knife wielder to release the girl and take him in her stead screaming obscenities at him inching closer as the blade drew a trickle of blood at the girls throat when he was two feet away the gunman shoved the prostitute aside and grabbed herzog screaming when jungle jacks elbow crashed into his windpipe herzog disabled the man with a flathanded karate chop and took off after his accomplice catching him after a fiveblock foot pursuit the second hostage situation was resolved even more boldly a man known to local officers as a heavy angel dust user had snatched a little girl and was holding her at gunpoint while a crowd gathered around him jack herzog in uniform walked through the crowd and up to the man who dropped the little girl and fired at him three times the shots missed and herzog blew the mans brains out at pointblank range herzogs reputation grew within the department requests from vice squad and plainclothes commanders multiplied then sergeant martin bergen herzogs best friend committed an act of cowardice as noteworthy as herzogs acts of bravery a trial board followed and herzog went to the wall for his friend calling in favors in hope of saving bergens career testifying as a character witness at his trial decrying the lapds hero mentality from his standpoint as one of its greatest heroes martin bergen was banished from the department in disgrace and jungle jack herzog was banished to a file clerk joba defeat as ignominious as bergens even a hero shouldnt fuck with the bosses lloyd put the folder down when he realized that a shadow had fallen across the pages he looked up to find officer artie cranfield from sid staring at him hello lloyd hows tricks tricky you need a shave i know any leads on the liquor store job no im waiting on queries ever hear of a cop named jungle jack herzog yeah who hasnt a real gunslinger ever hear of an excop named marty bergen what is this a guessing game everyone knows old yellowstreak and that toilet paper tabloid he writes for why herzog and bergen were best buddies mr guts and mr chickenshit you like it not particularly you look sardonic lloyd waiting makes me feel sardonic not sleeping makes me look sardonic are you going home to sleep no im going to look for mr guts artie shook his head before you go say something macho about the liquor store asshole lloyd smiled how about his ass is grass and im the fucking lawnmower i like it i like it i thought you would lloyd drove to jack herzogs last known address a twentyunit apartment house on the valley side of the hollywood hills the pink stucco building was sandwiched between two shopping malls and featured a video game arcade in the front lobby the directory listed herzog as living in apartment lloyd walked up four flights of stairs and checked the hallway in both directions then jimmied the lock with a credit card and closed the door behind him almost stumbling over the pile of unopened mail that was spread out on the floor he flipped a light switch and let his eyes fall on the first thing that greeted them a trophy case filled with award scrolls and loving cups the ink on herzogs death certificate was the scouring powder wipe marks that covered the wood and glass surfaces a quick check of the rest of the apartment revealed that wipe marks streaked with abrasive powder were spread over every surface capable of sustaining latent prints it was the job of a conscientious professional lloyd leafed through the envelopes on the floor no personal letters or postcardsevery piece was either a utility bill or junk mail letting his eyes stray over the living room walls he saw an impersonal habitat come into focusno artwork of any kind no masculine disarray furniture that had probably come with the lease the award scrolls and loving cups had the look of handmedowns and when he squinted to read the names and dates embossed on them lloyd saw that they were track and field awards won by herzogs father in lebanon during the late s the kitchen was even more sparedishes and silverware stacked neatly by the drainboard no food of any kind in the refrigerator or on the shelves only the bedroom bore signs of personality a closet stuffed with lapd uniforms and a huge supply of civilian clothes outfits ranging from ragpicker overcoats to skinnylapel pimp suits to outlaw motorcycle leathers beside the bed were tall shelves crammed with books lloyd scanned the spines all the titles were biographies the lives of generals conquerors and religious iconoclasts predominating one whole shelf was devoted to works on richard the lion hearted and martin luther another to books on peter the great romantic plunderers despots and mad visionaries lloyd felt a wave of love for jungle jack herzog after checking out the bathroom lloyd found the phone and called dutch peltz at the hollywood station when dutch came on the line he said im at herzogs pad its been wiped by a pro you can scratch herzog for real but dont let anyone know okay all right was the pad trashed no i get the feeling the killer was just being cautious covering his ass from all standpoints can you do me a few favors name them when the vice squad comes on find out from walt perkins what bars herzog was working glom any reports he may have filed im going to check out marty bergen myself and ill come back here and interview herzogs neighbors tonight ill call you at home around seven sounds good oh and dutch have your guys feel out their snitches on antique gun freaks or any assholes known to use violence whove been taking up guns lately even if its just street bullshit and jive i want to know about it youre fishing lloyd i know ill call you at seven lloyd walked through jungle jack herzogs barren dwelling place locking the door behind him he said you poor noble sonofabitch why the fuck did you have to prove yourself so hard it took lloyd half an hour to drive to the west hollywood office of the big orange insider heat smog and lack of sleep combined to produce a head pounding that had the pavement wobbling before his eyes to combat it he rolled up the windows and turned the air conditioning on full shivering as a fresh adrenaline rush overtook him two new cases three dead and one presumed dead no sleep for at least another twelve hours the big orange insider occupied the first floor of a pseudo artdeco chateau on san vicente a block south of sunset lloyd walked in bypassing the receptionist knowing she made him for a cop and would be instantly buzzing the editorial offices to tell them the enemy was coming he walked into a large room crammed with desks and smiled as suspicious eyes darted up from typewriters to appraise him when the eyes turned hostile he bowed and blew the assembly a kiss he was beginning to feel at ease when two women waved back then he felt a tugging at his sleeve and turned to see a tall young man pressed into him who let you back here the young man demanded no one lloyd said are you a policeman im a defector ive quit the cops and im seeking asylum with the counterculture fourth estate i want to peddle my memoirs take me to your wisest ghost writer you have thirty seconds to vacate the premises lloyd took a step toward the young man the young man took two steps backward seeing the fear in his eyes lloyd said shit detective sergeant hopkins lapd im here to see marty bergen tell him its about jack herzog ill be waiting by the reception desk he walked back to the reception area the woman at the desk gave him a deadpan stare so he busied himself by perusing the enlarged and framed editorial cartoons that adorned the four walls the lapd and la county sheriffs were attacked in vicious caricatures fat porcinefeatured policemen cloaked in american flags poked sleeping drunks with tridents chief gates was dangled on a puppets string by two men in ku klux klan robes wolffaced cops herded black prostitutes into a paddy wagon while the officer at the wheel guzzled liquor a speech balloon elaborating his thoughts wow police work sure is exciting i hope these bimbos are holding some cash my car payment is overdue ill admit its a bit hyperbolic lloyd turned to face the voice openly sizing up the man who owned it martin bergen was over six feet tall blonde with a once strong body going to flab his florid face was contorted into a look of mirthless mirth and his pale blue eyes were liquid but on target his breath was equal parts whiskey and mint mouthwash you should know you had what thirteen or fourteen years on the job i had sixteen hopkins youve got what eighteen and a half pulling the pin at twenty no i see whats this about jack herzog lloyd stepped back in order to get a fullbody reaction herzogs been missing for over three weeks his pad has been wiped he was working personnel records downtown and on a loanout to hollywood vice no one at parker center or hollywood station has seen him what does that tell you marty bergen began to tremble his red face turned pale and his hands plucked at his pants legs he backed into the wall and slid down into a folding metal chair the woman at the desk brought over a glass of water then hesitated and hurried off into the ladies room when she saw lloyd shake his head lloyd sat down beside bergen and said when did you see herzog last bergens voice was calm about a month ago we still hung out jack didnt blame me for what i did he knew we were different that way he didnt judge me what was his state of mind quiet nohe was always quiet but lately hed been moody up one minute down the next what did you talk about stuff shit books mostly my novel the one ive been writing did you and herzog discuss his assignments we never talked police work ive heard herzog described as a stone loner is that accurate yes can you name any of his other friends no women he had a girlfriend he saw occasionally i dont know her name lloyd leaned closer to bergen what about enemies what about men within the department who hated him for the way he stood by you you know the rankandfile cop mentality as well as i do herzog must have engendered resentment the only resentment that jack engendered was in me he was so much better than me at everything that i always loved him the most when i hated him the most we were so so different when we talked last jack said that he was going to exonerate me but i ran i was guilty bergen started to sob lloyd got up and walked to the door looking back on the hack writer weeping underneath framed excoriations of what he had once been bergen was serving a life sentence with no means of atonement lloyd shuddered under the weight of the thought the return trip to the valley eased lloyds fatigue snug in his airconditioned cocoon he let his mind run with images of herzog and bergen intellectual cop buddies two men who his instincts told him were as much alike as bergen said they were different the freeway liquor case receded temporarily to a back burner and when he parked in front of jack herzogs building he felt his mental second wind go physical he smiled knowing he would have the juice for a long stretch of hunting herzogs neighbors began returning home from work shortly after five lloyd sized the first several of them up from his car noting that their common denominator was the weary lower middle class look indigenous to valley residents of both genders prime meat for the insurance payoff ploy he pulled a stack of phony business cards from the glove compartment and practiced his gladhander insurance man smile preparing for a performance that would secure him the knowledge of just how much a loner jungle jack herzog was three hours later with two dozen impromptu interviews behind him lloyd felt herzog move from loner to cipher none of the people he had talked to recalled even seeing the resident of apartment assuming that the unit was kept vacant for some reason the obvious candor of their statements was like a kick in the teeth the fact that several had mentioned that the landlordmanager would be out of town for another week was the finishing blow it was a solid investigatory angle shot to hell lloyd drove to a pay phone and called dutch peltz dutch answered on the first ring peltz whos this anyone ever tell you you answer the phone like a cop dutch laughed yeah you got a pencil shoot herzog was working two singles bars the first avenue west and jackie ds both on highland north of the boulevard he was specifically looking for bartenders taking bribes to serve minors and hookers giving head in the hatcheck room wed had a dozen complaints he worked those joints for over six weeks never blowing his cover always calling narco or patrol from a pay phone when he saw something coming down he figured in six coke busts and one for prostitution as a result the abc has both joints up for suspension of their liquor licenses lloyd whistled what about the reports he filed no reports lloyd walt perkinss orders the arresting officers filed walt didnt want jack compromised shit that means you can scratch revenge as a motive yeah at least as far as his recent arrest record is concerned what happened with bergen nothing bergen hasnt seen herzog in over a month says he was moody troubled he took the news hard he was drunk at two in the after noon poor bastard were going to have a file a missing persons report lloyd i know let internal affairs handle it which means you and walt perkins are going to catch shit for not reporting it earlier and probably even heavier shit for working herzog off the payroll you might get the case if it goes to robberyhomicide theyll never find the stiff dutch this job is pro all the way iad will go at it sub rosa then stonewall it let me give it another fortyeight hours before you call them okay okay what have you got from your snitches on the liquor store job nothing yet i sent out a memo to all officers on it its still too early for a response whats next on herzog barhopping dutchman yours truly as a swinging single have fun lloyd laughed and said fuck you then hung up bombarded by disco music lloyd competed for floor and bar space at first avenue west showing his insurance agents business card and jack herzogs personnel file photo to three bartenders four cocktail waitresses and two dozen singles he got negative responses distinguished only by hostile looks and shakes of the head from lowrider types who made him for fuzz and annoyed brushoffs from young women who didnt like his style lloyd walked out the door angrily shaking his head as the washout continued jackie ds three doors down was almost deserted lloyd counted heads as he took a seat at the bar a couple doing a slow grind on the dance floor and two overaged swingers feeding coins to the jukebox the bartender slipped a napkin in front of him and explained why twofers at first avenue west every tuesday night i get killed first ave can afford it i cant i keep my prices low to do volume and i still get killed is there no mercy in this life none lloyd said i just wanted a confirmation what are you drinking lloyd put a dollar bill on the bar ginger ale the bartender snorted you see what i mean no mercy lloyd took out the snapshot of jack herzog have you seen this man the bartender scrutinized the photo then filled lloyds glass and nod ded yeah i seen him around here a lot lloyds skin prickled when a while back a month six weeks maybe two months ago right before those abc cocksuckers filed on me you a cop thats right hollywood vice robberyhomicide tell me about the man in the picture whats to tell he came in he drank he tipped well he didnt hit on the chicks ever talk to him not really did he ever come in with or leave with anyone the bartender screwed his face into a memory search then said yeah he had a buddy a sandyhaired guy medium height maybe early thirties did he meet him here that i cant tell you lloyd walked over to the pay phone outside the mens room and called hollywood station requesting lieutenant perkins when he came on the line lloyd said walt this is lloyd hopkins ive got a question hit me did herzog work his bar assignments alone there was a long moment of silence finally perkins said im not really sure lloyd my guess is sometimes yes sometimes no ive always given jack carte blanche any arrangements he made with individual squad members would be up to him shall i ask around tomorrow night at roll call yes what about a sandyhaired man medium height early thirties herzog might have worked with him thats half our squad lloyd there was another stretch of silence finally lloyd said hes dead ill be in touch and replaced the receiver the barman looked up as he strode toward the door theres no mercy he called out battered by sleeplessness and dwindling options lloyd drove downtown to parker center hoping to find an easily intimidated nightwatch supervisor on duty at personnel records when he saw the man behind the records counter dozing in his chair with a science fiction novel lying on his chest he knew he was home excuse me officer the records supervisor jerked awake and stared at lloyds badge hopkins robberyhomicide lloyd said jack herzog left some files for me in his desk will you show me where it is the supervisor yawned then pointed to a bank of plexiglas enclosed cubicles herzogs daywatch so i dont know exactly where his desk is but you go help yourself sergeant the names are on the doors lloyd walked into the plexiglas maze noting with relief that herzogs cubicle was well out of the supervisors sight finding the door unlocked he rummaged through the desk drawers feeling another impersonal habitat come into focus as pencils notepads and a series of blank office forms were revealed one drawer two drawers three drawers herzog the cipher lloyd was raising his fist to slam the desktop when he noticed the edges of several slips of paper on the floor wedged into the juncture where the wall met the carpet squatting he pulled them out going cold when he saw file requisition slips with the officers name rank date of birth and badge number on top and the requesting officers name and division below squinting he read over the five slips the officers names were unknown to him but the requesting officers name wasnt captain frederick t gaffaney internal affairs division had requested all five files old bornagain christian fred who had given him grief as a robberyhomicide lieutenant squinting harder lloyd felt the coldness run up his spine into his brain he knew gaffaneys signature these were blatant forgeries lloyd got out his notebook and wrote down the names of the officers whose files had been requested tucker duane w lieutenant wilshire division murray daniel x captain central division rolando john l lieutenant devonshire division kaiser steven a captain west valley division christie howard j lieutenant rampart division he stared at the names then on impulse ran his hand under the carpet again coming away with a last slip of paper going dead ice cold when he read the name printed on top hopkins lloyd w sergeant robberyhomicide division thomas goffs surveillance photographs had not prepared him for the womans beauty nothing in goffs oral and written reports came close to describing her aura of refinement a thousanddollaranight whore in a thousanddollar raw silk dress dr john havilland leaned back in his chair pretending to be tonguetied give the woman the temporary upper hand let her think her charisma had dented his professionalism when linda wilhite didnt fidget under his gaze he broke the long introductory silence will you tell me something about yourself ms wilhite the reasons why youve decided to enter therapy linda wilhites eyes circled the office her hands smoothed the arms of her chair brilliantly varnished oak walls a framed edward hopper original no couch the chairs she and the doctor were sitting in were upholstered in pure cashmere you love nice things she said havilland smiled so do you thats a very beautiful dress thank you why do most people come to see you because they want to change their lives of course can you guess what i do for a living yes youre a prostitute how exactly did you know that you called my service and made an appointment without asking to speak to me personally and you wouldnt say who referred you when a woman contacts me in that manner i assume that shes in the life ive counseled a great many prostitutes and ive published several monographs on my findings without ever violating the anonymity of my patients in criminal parlance im a standup guy i dont have a receptionist or a secretary because i dont trust such people women in the life trust me for these reasons linda traced patterns on her silk and the doctors cashmere this dress cost thirteen hundred dollars my shoes cost six hundred i love nice things and you love nice things and we both make a lot of money but what i do to make money is killing me and i have to stop havilland leaned forward as the womans words settled in on him he brought his voice down to its lowest register and said are you ready to sacrifice picayune shit like thirteen hundred dollar dresses to achieve your true power are you ready to dig through your past to find out why you need creature comforts at the expense of your integrity are you willing to break yourself down to ground zero in order to help me take you as far as you can go linda flinched at the battery of questions yes she said havilland stood up stretched and decided to go in full bore sitting back down he said linda my brand of therapy is a twoway street what you think i need to know and what i need to know may well be two different things i would like this first session to consist of questions and answers ill throw out some educated guesses and assumptions about you and you tell me how accurate i am what i want to establish is some kind of instinctive rapport do you follow me her voice quavering linda said how far is as far as i can go dr john havilland threw back his head and laughed my educated guess is that you can hit the ball out of the ballpark and into the next county linda smiled then lets do it she said havilland got up and walked to the window glancing down on the jetstream of cars and people twentysix stories below him he coughed and pressed the activator button inlaid on the window ledge sending current to the tape recorder housed behind a section of wall panel turning to face linda wilhite he said youre thirtyone or two large family northern midwestmichigan or wisconsin the best and brightest of your siblings adored by your brothers despised by your sisters your parents are new money uneasy about it terrified of losing their hardearned status you dropped out of college in your senior year and worked at odd jobs before a series of disillusionments led you slowly into the life how close am i linda was already shaking her head im twentynine from la an only child my parents died when i was ten i lived in a series of foster homes until i graduated from high school i never attended college my parents were semipoor i made a conscious decision to become a prostitute just as ive made a conscious decision to quit being one please dont consider me typical circling the office his eyes shifting back and forth between linda wilhite and the persian rug that cushioned his footfalls havilland said is being typical a crime no dont answer let me continue you enjoy sex with certain kinds of older men among your customers and it hurts you if they sleep with anyone else if you find a customer attractive then you fantasize about him and hate yourself for it afterwards you despise hookers who consider themselves therapists and the like your basic dilemma is a conservative nature one grounded in the work ethic undercut with the knowledge that what you do is shit antithetical to every decent moral instinct you possess you have rationalized this contradiction for years bolstered yourself with selfhelp books and spiritual tracts but now it wont wash anymore and you came to me touche ms wilhite the doctors voice had risen higher and higher little crescendos of truth that linda knew would grow in scope and intimacy without the mans resonance ever cracking her hands fluttered over her lap looking for something of and by herself to touch when they descended on green paisley silk she jerked them back and said yes yes yes how did you know those things dr john havilland sat back down and stretched his legs until his feet dangled a few inches from lindas alligator shoes linda im the best there is to be blunt i am a work of fucking art linda laughed until she felt a blush creep up from her bodice ive got a john who says the same thing to me he collects colombian art so i know its an informed opinion and you know the funny thing he calls me a work of fucking art and he never fucks mehe just takes pictures of me isnt that a hoot havilland laughed along first uproariously then sedately when his laughter wound down he said what does this man do with the photographs of you he has them blown up then he frames them and hangs them in his bedroom linda said how do you feel about that worshiped adored ii feel worthy of my beauty did your parents recognize your beauty early on did they fawn over you because of it my father did did your parents take photographs of you linda flinched at the word photographs she stammered nno havilland leaned forward and put his hand on her knee youve gone pale linda why flinching again linda said this is happening so fast i wasnt going to tell you today because most of the time it seems so remote my father was a violent man he was a longshoreman and he used to fight bare knuckles for money on the docks at san pedro hed win or hed lose and hed always bet heavily on himself so if he won he showered mother and me with gifts and if he lost he brooded and smashed things most of the time it was fiftyfifty win lose win loseso that i never knew what to expect then when i was ten daddy hit a losing streak he brooded worse than ever and punched out all the windows in our house it was winter and we were broke and the heat was shut off and cold air blew in through the broken windows ill never forget the day it happened i came home from school and there were police cars in front of the house a detective took me aside and told me what happened daddy had put a pillow over mothers head and shot her in the face then he stuck the gun in his mouth and shot himself i was sent to juvenile hall and a couple of days later a matron told me i had to identify the bodies she showed me photographs from the autopsydaddy and mother with half their faces blown away i cried and i cried but i couldnt stop looking at the pictures and linda havilland whispered linda said and i went to live with an elderly couple who treated me like a princess i swiped the pictures the matron showed me and forced myself to laugh and gloat over them those pictures gave me freedom from the shitty life i had and laughing at them was like getting revenge on my parents i havilland raised a hand in interruption let me finish your foster parents caught you laughing over the photographs and punished you it was never the same with them after that yes linda said the doctor circled his office again running light fingertips over the oak walls a few more questions then well end the session is the type of manof customerthat youre attracted to large and physical possessed of intelligence and breeding but also possessed of a certain aura of violence lindas whisper was astonished yes havilland smiled worldclass progress in one session does the day after tomorrowfridaysuit you for our next one say tenthirty linda wilhite stood up surprised to find her legs steady she smoothed the front of her dress and said yes ill be here thank you havilland took her arm and walked her to his outer office door it was my pleasure after linda wilhite was gone the doctor armed with her image and facts from goffs reconnaissance turned off the lights and played the timetravel game when linda was two and living in a san pedro dive with her whitetrash parents he was twelve and gaining clandestine access to wealthy homes in bronxville and scarsdale new york exorcising his nocturnal heart by delivering himself to the quiet muse of other peoples dwellings sometimes stealing sometimes not when linda was fourteen and sexually experimenting with surfer morons in huntington beach he was twentyfour and graduating from harvard medical school at the top of his class the legendary doctor john the night tripper the genius dope chemistabortionist who held instructors rapt with his digressions on the theories of kinsey pomeroy and havelock ellis when linda was growing into her exquisite beauty in a series of foster homes filled with wonder at her parents deaths and the apostasy that their bloodletting had spawned he the time machine screeched shuddered and ground to a halt a green door opened to reveal a man in a gray uniform standing beside a salmonpink ford victoria ragtop little girls in party dresses thronged the car and just before it exploded into flames they turned to point and laugh at him the night tripper walked to the wall and turned on the light seeking confirmation he found it in glassencased tributes framed diplomas from new york university and harvard med and st vincent and castleford hospitalsparchment that spelled out plainly that he was the best the dates on them told him why the time machine had malfunctioned linda was powerful linda had sustained a catastrophe as he had and required that he juxtapose his story against hers from the beginning scarsdale new york johnny havilland age eleven known as spaz wimpdick and shitstick sherryguzzling mother with the inbred look indigenous to highline wasps who have never had to work for a living big bucks father a hunter whose shotgun volleys have decimated the varmint population of six new york counties johnny hates school johnny hates to play ball johnny loves to dream and listen to music on his portable radio johnnys father considers him a wimp and decrees a rite to prompt his manhood shoot the familys senile golden retriever johnny refuses and is sent by his father to a training school run by an extremist sect of nuns the nuns lock johnny in a basement full of rats with no food or water and only a shovel for protection two days go by johnny huddles in a corner and screams himself hoarse as the rats nip at his legs on the third day he falls asleep on the floor and wakes up to find a large rat scampering off with a chunk of his lip johnny screams picks up the shovel and beats every rat in the basement to death johnnys father takes him home the following day tousling his hair and calling him dads little ratter johnny goes straight for his fathers gun rack grabs a twelvegauge pump and strides outside to the kennel where five labradors and shorthaired pointers frolic behind barbed wire johnny blows the dogs to kingdom come and turns to face his father who turns white and faints weeks go by his father shuns him johnny knows that his father has given him a precious gift that is far more valuable than standard manhood johnny loves his father and wants to please him with his newfound strength green door by jim lowe climbs the hit parade and fills johnny with portents of dark secrets midnight one more night without sleeping watching till the morning comes creeping green door whats that secret youre keeping johnny wants to know the secret so he can tell his father and make him love him the quest for the secret begins with a shinny up a drainpipe into a neighbors darkened attic johnny finds coyotes mounted on rollerskate wheels and department store mannequins the mannequins have been gouged in the facial and genital regions and red paint has been daubed in the holes and left to trickle off in

father is terrified of him johnnys housebreaking career continues the spacious homes of westchester county become his teacher and friend thoughts of earning his fathers love grow mute beside the haphazard tides of passion that he assimilates in shadowshrouded bedrooms and hallways green door after green door after green door bursts open and then there was the next to the last door and the man in the uniform and the last door opening on a pitchblack void the darkness deepened as the time machine suffered its final malfunction its chronograph needle stuck permanently on june the void stretched into months the callow johnny havilland who entered was only a shell compared to the selfsufficient john who emerged always this memory gap the night tripper thought father was there when he entered and gone when his recollections again assumed a linear sequence he took goffs photographs of linda wilhite from his desk and fanned them like a deck of cards linda came briefly to life the slash of her mouth speaking bewilderment she wanted to know why he was as great as he was havilland ruffled the photos again making linda beg for the answer he smiled he would tell her and he would not need the time machine to help him father had been gone for months mother in a perpetual sherry haze didnt seem to care checks came in bimonthly drawn from the taxexempt trust funds that fathers father had started almost half a century before it was as if a giant puppetmaster had snatched the man into eternity leaving his material wealth as wonder bait to ensure that johnny could have anything he wanted johnny wanted knowledge he wanted knowledge because he knew it would give him sovereignty over the psychic pain that all the human race save himself was subject to his grief over his fathers disappearance had transmogrified into armor sheathed in oneway transparent glass he could look out and see all no one could look in and see him thus invulnerable johnny havilland sought knowledge he found it in john havilland graduated from scarsdale high school number one in his class hailed by the schools principal as a human encyclopedia nyu and more scholastic honors followed culminating in a phi beta kappa key summa cum laude graduation and a full scholarship to harvard medical school it was at harvard med that john havilland was able to combine his knowledgelust and dominion over human feelings into dominion over other people like his early burglary career it began with a shinny up a drainpipe and a vault into an open window but where before he had come away with knickknacks to please his father this time he came away with questions and answers that he knew would make him the spiritual patriarch to scores of pliant souls the window yielded tape recordings of confidential interviews conducted by alfred kinsey in and the interviewees were described in terse sentences and were then asked to describe themselves the variance factor was astonishingthe people almost always defined themselves by some physical abnormality the q and a sessions that followed proceeded along uniform patterns revealing mundane matterslust guilt and adulterythings which john havillands immune system had surmounted in early adolescence after over two hundred hours of listening to the tapes john knew two things one that kinsey was an astute interviewer a scholar who considered factual admissions illuminating in themselves and two that that knowledge was not enough and that kinsey had failed because he could not get his interviewees to talk openly about fantasies beyond variations of fucking and sucking he could elicit no admissions of dark grandeur because he felt none himself his interviewees were hicks who didnt know shit from shinola kinsey operated from the freudianhumanist ethic provide knowledge of behavior patterns to enable the subject a viewpoint of objectivity in which to relegate his neuroses to a scrap heap of things that dont work show him that his fears and most extreme fantasies are irrational and convince him to be a loving boring happy human being after over six hundred hours of listening john knew two more things that the most profound truth lay in the labyrinths that coiled behind a green door in the interviewees mind the very second that alfred kinsey said tell me about your fantasies and two that with the proper information and the correct stimuli he could get carefully chosen people to break through those doors and act out their fantasies past moral strictures and the boundaries of conscience taking him past his already absolute knowledge of mankinds unutterable stupidity into a new night realm that he as yet was incapable of imagining because the night was there to be plundered and only someone above its laws could exact its bounty and survive now armed with a mission there remained only to discover and actuate the means toward its fulfillment it was drugs and hard rock flooded harvard yard spawned by a backwash of students townies and traveling hippies willing to protest anything try anything and ingest anything in order to gain themselves lose themselves or achieve a transcendental experience social change was in the wind producing a consciousness explosion that john havilland considered fatuous and propagated by failures many of whom would not live to see the period dwindle out of its own emptiness replaced by a new reactionary fervor giving the youth culture a life expectancy of two years at the most he decided to become one of its icons people would follow him they would have no choice two abortions performed gratis in his antiseptically clean beacon hill apartment gained him a hushed reputation among harvard undergrads a record heard at a pot party provided him with a powerful sobriquet doctor john the night tripper was a creole who shrieked odes to dope and sex backed up by two saxes drums and an electric organ at the party a heavily stoned anthropology professor shoved an album cover in john havillands face and yelled thats you man your name is john and youre in med school dig it the nickname stuck fueled by the young doctors forays into manufacturing lsd and liquid methamphetamine drug concocting med students were commonplace but a dope doc who gave the stuff away with no strings was the subject of much speculation people started to come around to his apartment seeking his knowledge he told them what they wanted to hear a hodgepodge of counterculture thought combed from all their heroes they never knew they were being bullshitted not even when the night tripper revealed that there were indeed strings the experiments began do you really want to find out who you are dr john would ask his wouldbe subject do you really want to find out the depth of your potential do you understand that my exploring your most secret fantasies will gain for you in one weekend what psychoanalysis will never discover the subjects were all prescreened dropins at the beacon hill apartment they were male and female all of a type aesthetes devoid of original thought richkid spiritual seekers whose rebellious streaks cloaked long histories of overdependence on their parents a weekend to help out dr john with his med school thesis sure the weekends would begin with high quality marijuana and jokingly phrased sex questionnaires more weed and oral questions followed the doctor regaling the subjects with madeup sexual anecdotes of his own when the subjects were plied almost to sleep with weed and music dr john would give them a skin pop of sodium pentothal and tell them horror stories and gauge their responses if they responded with glee he would go straight for the fantasy jugular interweaving his horror stories with the subjects own creating tapestries ranging from family slaughter to wholesale sexual conquest when the subject fell asleep the night tripper would fall asleep at his side savoring the feel of clothed bodies almost touching in the fellowship of nightmares increasingly smaller doses of sodium pentothal accompanied by visual aids took up the rest of the weekend bringing the subject to the fantasyreality juncture point where they had some cognizance of what they had revealed antiwar activists guffawed over photographs of napalmbarbecued babies felt momentary remorse then laughed it off in the joy of newfound freedom the doctor described beloved parents in postures of debasement with barnyard creatures the subjects supplied gory and humorous embellishments psyches broke through green doors retreated into normalcy and left their weekend revelations to simmer benignly waiting for the right time or the right catalyst or waiting for nothing after four months of weekends dr john discontinued his experiments they had become boringly repetitive and he had reached the point where he could unfailingly predict the responses of his subjects he had quantum leaps to take in his mission but he knew those leaps were years away upon graduation from medical school in havilland was assigned to the intern program at st vincents hospital in the bronx new york where he spent twelvehour shifts tending to the needs of welfare families it was boring medicine and he grew more restive by the day sending out resumes to every hospital in the metropolitan new york area known to have a lackluster psychiatric staff a threeyear residency was required of all physicians training in psychiatry and he wanted to be sure that he would be able to dominate his instructorseven at entry level sixteen applications sent out sixteen acceptances three months of detective work conclusion castleford hospital one hour north of new york city low pay alcoholics in key administrative posts a psychiatric staff of four aged doctors and a pillhead rn heavy medicaid contracts with the new york state parole board which meant plenty of courtreferred criminal types he would play the game with all the finesse he was capable of and they would give him carte blanche on march dr john havilland moved into his new quarters outside the main administration building at castleford hospital in nyack new york knowing that something was about to happen he was right after six months of counseling dreary lowlifes he met thomas goff at their first counseling session goff had been hyperkinetic and witty even under the stress of a migraine headache my goal in life used to be to do nothing exceedingly well my downfall was the fact that i liked to do it in stolen cars ill do anything to keep from going back to prison from skindiving for rotorooter to servicing jewish spinsters in miami beach what do you recommend doc grow gills or get circumcised jesus fucking christ these daylight headaches are killing me havilland had felt instincts clicking into place telling him to act now obeying those instincts he gave goff a large intravenous shot of demerol while goff was off on a painless dope cloud he asked him questions and found out that goff liked to hurt people and that he never talked about it because they put you in jail for that he had hurt lots of people but the trashbag man had been his cellie at attica and the headaches had started about then and wasnt that wild psychedelic ceiling beige give me back my headaches havilland had put him completely out reading his file while he was unconscious thomas lewis goff dob light brown and blue high school dropout iq car thief burglar pimp suspect in three aggravated assault cases cases dismissed when the women victims refused to testify convicted of first degree auto theft with two priors sentenced to five years in state prison sent to attica on considered a model prisoner paroled after the recent riots when psychiatrists at the prison judged that he would go psychotic if he remained incarcerated psychosomatic headaches and terror of daylight chief symptoms dating from the time of the riot when he was shut in a secluded cell block with one paul mandarano a convicted murderer known as the trashbag killer mandarano had committed suicide by hanging himself from the cell bars and goff had remained in the cell with his body until the riot was quelled no presence of neurological damage judged an excellent parole risk fate embraced dr john havilland when thomas goff regained consciousness he said its going to be all right thomas please trust me the night tripper stalked goffs nightmares then blunted them with drugs and fantasies until goff wasnt sure that attica and the trashbag man had really happened under sodium pentothal and age regression hypnosis the doctor took him back to the trauma flux point learning that paul mandarano had hanged himself with a beige plastic trashbag and that a blower fan stationed outside the cell block had blown the loose ends of the bag continually over the bars acting in concert with safety arc lights turning the cell where goff had huddled with a rotting body into an alternately brightly lit and pitchblack horror show classic symbolism light magnified the terror darkness diminished it after seven months of therapy sessions in a cool dim room thomas goffs fear of daylight abated to the point where it became tolerable ill always hate oysters doc but sometimes ill have to watch other people eat them daylight is pretty unavoidable but as nietzsche said what does not destroy me makes me stronger right doc the night tripper felt tremors of love at goffs words it was right for goff to love him but the reverse was not tolerable yes thomas nietzsche was right youll find that out even more as we continue our journey together that journey was interrupted for over ten years thomas goff disappeared gone into mists that would always be at best a witches brew of fantasy and reality the doctor grieved for the loss of his wouldbe right hand and concentrated on practicing the craft of psychiatry specializing in counseling criminals and prostitutes at castleford and then in private practice in los angeles seeking and storing knowledge writing and publishing monographs and establishing a reputation of maverick brilliance that grew and grew as his designs for conquest seethed within him and then one day thomas goff was at his door whimpering that the headaches were back and would the doctor please help him fate snapped its fingers yes dr john havilland said neuro scans electroencephalograms blood tests and extensive therapy followed each physical and mental probe another step toward the starting gate of the night trippers mission thomas goffs last ten years had been extraordinary havilland described them in his journal since my previous analysis of the subject he has gone on to assume classic criminal behavior patterns exemplifying the paranoic sociopathic textbook personality but with one notable exception his criminal behavior is pathologically derived but not pathologically executed goff shows great adaptability in subjugating his violent urges to circumspection in the choosing of his victims and he always stops short of inflicting great bodily harm or murder he has committed nighttime burglaries all over the east coast for a decade and has never been caught he has performed an estimated two hundred assaults on women experiencing simultaneous sexual release without reverting to the mayhem that characterized his assault career prior to our counselings since goff is in the truest sense a psychopath this restraint and his pride in it that he attributes to my earlier counseling is beyond extraordinaryit is almost unbelievable it is evident that he credits me with saving his life ie alleviating his terror of daylight and blunting his memory of the suicide he witnessed at attica and that implicitly he credits me with teaching him the restraint that has armed him with a virtual criminal carte blanche in fact goff a iq says that i have taught him to think it is evident that this brilliant criminal is seeking a fatherson bonding with me and that his headaches are a psychosomatic device to bring the two of us together to achieve the purposes he senses i have planned his attraction to me is not either overtly or covertly homosexual goff simply equates me on the sensorystimuli level with peace tranquility and the fulfillment of dreams three weeks into the new counseling with goffs recurring headaches quelled with hallucinogenlaced codeine the night tripper went in full tilt and gained complete capitulation do you know that i love you thomas yes do you know that i am here to take you as far as you can go yes will you help me to help other people to bring them out the way ive brought you out you know i will will you help me gain knowledge name it point the finger ill do it would you kill for me yes that night the doctor outlined goffs role in his mission recruit lonely men and women journeymen spiritual seekers spineless new agers with no family and plenty of money the counterculture consciousness circuit and singles nightspots should be rife with them goff was to judge their susceptibility draw them out and bring them to him utilizing the greatest discretion and caution employing no physical violence he was also to perform burglaryreconnaissance forays entering the homes of the doctors hooker patients checking their john books for the names of wealthy customersthe objective being men with weak wills and monogamous relationships with their whores be slow and cautious thomas havilland said this is a lifetime process that process yielded three lonelies in the first year havilland was satisfied with the progress he was making with their psyches but frustrated by the lack of pure knowledge he was reaping eight more months passed another three lonelies were recruited the doctor refined his techniques and filled up hundreds of pages on what he had learned yet still he hungered for pure data molding clay that he could hold in his hands savor and then mix into the human tapestry he was creating the frustration had him slamming his desk in rage beseeching time warps in his past for the answer to unanswerable questions then two events coincided and provided an answer despite medication thomas goffs headaches grew worse havilland ran a new series of tests and found his psychosomatic diagnosis rebuked goff had leptomeningitis a chronic brain inflammation it was the cause of his headaches and had probably been a contributing factor to his violent behavior throughout the years for the first time in his professional life the doctor found himself in a crisis leptomeningitis could be cured by surgery and a wide assortment of drugs his executive officer could be restored to health and it would be business as usual leptomeningitis was also known to induce homicidal rages in normally peaceful men and women yet somehow thomas goff a violent sociopathic criminal had sustained the disease for over a decade without letting it push him across the line into mindless slaughter without treatment goff would soon go insane and die of a massive cerebral hemorrhage but if through a careful application of antibiotics and painkillers goffs disease could be deescalated and escalated to suit his whims he would possess his very own terminal man and it would provide him with the opportunity to observe an absolutely emotionless human machine run gauntlets of stress unparalleled in psychiatric history and if need be goff could be put to use as the ultimate killing machine the night tripper decided to sacrifice his executive officerprotegeson to the god of knowledge then the alchemist appeared goffs leptomeningitis was three weeks into a remission when he told the doctor of the vice cop he had met the disguiseartist reader of hero biographies who he could tell was just dying to bend to someone havilland had at first been warythe man was after all a police officerbut then after seven counseling sessions devoted to bringing the alchemist through his obvious green door the cop supplied the last piece of the night trippers longsought puzzle cruel merciless data levers of manipulation that would allow him to bend hundreds of people like twigs the six folders that he offered in acquiescence to the doctors charisma were the first key four data keepers and two police legends the alchemist had tried very hard to please him and in his gratitude the doctor had brought him through his green door much too fast and he had run from the selfdiscoveries that were unfolding before him now the alchemist was gone only his legacy of potential knowledge remained back in the present the night tripper let his mind play over the files in his wall safe cops men used to violence as a way of life goff would have to be his gobetween but he was approaching his terminusthe lepto would become uncontrollable within a few months his training mission was unsettling a violation of his efficacy counseling he should have searched the liquor store for possible witnesses then retreated until the proprietor was alone one killing was perfection three was dangerous havilland walked to his window and looked out watching the microcosmic progression of the people below him scuttling like laboratory animals in an observation maze he wondered if they would ever know that at odd moments he loved them seventytwo hours into the liquor store case over two thousand man hours spent probing every possible scientific angle yield zero extensive background checks on the three victims zero multiplied by the silence of the random factordecent people at the wrong place at the wrong time loved ones importuning god for the reason why the unearthing of dull facts leading nowhere the fingerprint report was a pastiche of swirls streaks and smudges the heel marks and fabric elements found at the death scene were all attributed to the victims the snitch reports that filtered back to hollywood division officers had the air of hyperbole and were inimical to lloyds concept of the killer as being very smart and very cool and not at all interested in reaping renown for his handiwork if the queries on stolen revolvers came back negative the only remaining option would be to initiate nationwide gun queries and have a team of computer jockeys and astute paperwork detectives run through the over three hundred thousand automobile registration records for yellow japanese imports crosschecking them with criminal records and records of known criminal affiliates looking for combustion points if no two facts struck sparks and if the gun queries washed out the case would be shunted into the bureaucratic backlog lloyd recoiled at the knowledge that time was running out seated at dutch peltzs desk savoring the feel of a silent hollywood station drifting toward dusk he read over xeroxes of the field interrogation reports he had requisitioned citywide on the night of april eleven yellow japanese cars had been stopped for traffic violations andor suspicious behavior four of the people cited and detained had been women five had been ghetto black men two with no criminal record three with misdemeanor records for possession of drugs and nonpayment of child support the two remaining white men were a lawyer stopped and ultimately arrested for drunk driving and a teenager popped for driving under the influence of a narcotic substance which the arresting officer surmised to be airplane glue no sparks lloyd yelled shit and stormed through his makeshift command post looking for a pen and paper finding a yellow legal pad and a stack of pencils atop dutchs bookcase he wrote dutchmantime running out theres a shitload of hotel stickups downtown so ill probably get yanked to a robbery assignment soon the fis and the snitch feedback are gooseegg will you do the following for me have another team of uniformed officers housetohouse block radius the area surrounding freeway liquor have them ask about a yellow jap cars recently seen in area lic b recent loiterers c recent conversations with the three deceased all victs were locals did they mention anything suspicious d have officers check previous canvass report filed by patrolmen who housetohoused the night of the killings have them check residences of people who were not home that night e tell the men that robberyhomicide has allocated unlimited overtime on this casetheyll get the in their next check glom all hw div fis for past mos mentioning yellow jap autos set aside all incoming fis featuring same and collate all incoming rob amp homicide bulletins mentioning same re herzog ive got a weird feeling about thiseven beyond the fact jh stole my file i want some kind of handle on it before we call iad have you run your grapevines on the officers are the files still missing im going to sleep at jhs pad for the next several nights see what happensalso if the robhom brass cant find me they cant reassign melh there was a knock at the door followed by the sound of coughing lloyd put his memo under dutchs quartz bookend and called out enter lieutenant walt perkins walked in and shut the door behind him when he shuffled his feet nervously lloyd said looking for me or the dutchman walt you perkins said lloyd pointed to a chair perkins ignored it i checked with the squad he said herzog always worked alone a lot of the men wanted to work with him because of his rep but jack always nixed it he used to joke that ninetyfive percent of all vice cops were alcoholics he perkins faltered as lloyd came alive with tension the sandyhaired man was not a cop perkins shuffled his feet again drawing figure eights on the floor lloyd i dont want iad nosing around the squad why lloyd asked the worst youll get is a reprimand vice commanders have been working herzog off the payroll for years its common knowledge its not that then what is it perkins ceased his figure eights and forced himself to stare at lloyd its you i know the whole story of what happened with you last year i got it straight from a deputy chief i admire you for what you did thats not it its just that i know the promotion board has a standing order not to ever promote you or dutch and i lloyds peripheral vision throbbed with black swallowing to keep his voice down he said and you want me to sit on this a brother officer murdered shaking his head and lowering his eyes perkins whispered no i paid off a clerk at personnel records hes going to carry herzog present for another week or so then report him missing therell be an investigation lloyd kicked out at a metal wastebasket sending a mound of wadded paper onto perkinss pants legs the lieutenant flinched back into the door and brought his eyes up the bornagains in iad have a hardon for you hopkins gaffaney especially youre a great cop but you dont give a fuck about other cops and the people close to you get hurt look at what youve done to dutch peltz can you blame me for wanting to cover my ass lloyd released the hands he had coiled into fists its all a tradeoff youre an administrator im a hunter youre a well liked superior officer which means that the guys you command are shaking down hookers for head jobs and ripping off dope dealers for their shit and slopping up free booze all over hollywood im not so well liked and i get strange scary ideas sometimes but im willing to pay the price and you arent so dont judge me and get out of the way if you dont want to get hurt because im seeing this thing through lloyd pretended to fiddle with the papers on dutchs desk the second he averted his eyes perkins slipped out the door an hour later when the last remnants of twilight dissolved into night lloyd drove to jackie ds bar the barman he had talked to two nights before was on duty and the place was still empty the barman had the same weary look and automatically put down a napkin as lloyd took a seat at the bar shaking his head and saying no mercy the ginger ale drinkers always return there is no mercy whats the complaint this time lloyd asked wet tshirt contest next door first i gotta compete with free booze now i gotta compete with free tits i heard the guy who owns that puspocket is gonna throw in female mud wrestling maybe female bush shaving maybe female dick measuring make a bundle and go into something stable like pushing heroin no mercy isnt his liquor license up for suspension too yeah but hes young and hes got the chutzpah to think big and diversify you know a fortystory swingers condo shaped like a dick with an underground garage shaped like a snatch you drive in and an electric beam shoots you an orgasm no mercy there is mercy im here to prove it the barman poured lloyd a ginger ale cops do not give mercy they give grief lloyd drew a paper bag from his jacket pocket you remember the man i was asking you about the other night you said you saw him here with another man sandy haired early thirties yeah i remember good were going to create a little picture of that guy youre going to be the artist come over on this side of the bar lloyd spread out his wares on the bartop this is called an identikit little composite facial features that we put together from a witnesss description we start with the forehead and work down weve got over thirty nose types and so forth see how the slots fit together the barman fingered cardboard eyebrows chins and mouths and said yeah i just put these pieces together until it looks like the guy right right then i put the finishing touches in with a pencil you got it do i look dumb you look like rembrandt whos he a bartender who drew pictures on the side it took the barman half an hour of sifting comparing rejecting and appraising to come up with a composite lloyd looked at the portrait and said not bad a goodlooking guy with a mean streak you agree with that yeah the barman said now that you mention it he did look kinda mean okay now show me what these composite pieces have missed lloyd took out a pencil and poised it over the identikit picture the barman studied his portrait from several different angles then grabbed the pencil and went to work himself shading the cheeks broadening the nose adding a thin line of malevolence to the lips finishing with a flourish he said there that is the cocksucker in the flesh holding the cardboard up to the light lloyd saw a vividly lean countenance come into focus the thin mouth rendering the handsomeness ice cold he smiled and felt the barman tugging at his sleeve wheres this fucking mercy you were telling me about lloyd stuck the portrait in his pocket call the abc tomorrow at ten oclock theyll tell you the complaints against you have been removed and that youre no longer facing a license suspension youve got that kinda clout yeah mercy mercy prevails driving over the cahuenga pass to jack herzogs apartment lloyd thought only the hunt prevails trace all evidential links backward and forward in time and you will find that you are in the exact place that you were in four or eight or sixteen years ago chasing ghouls too twisted to be called human and too sad to be called anything else finding or not finding them holding surveillance on patterns of hatred and fear imparting morally ambiguous justice running headlong into epiphanies that were as everchanging as your need to know them was immutable that the hunt was always conducted on the same landscape was the safest mark of permanence los angeles county was thousands of miles of blacktop neon and scrubbrushdotted hillside arteries twisting in and around and back on themselves creating human migrations that would unfailingly erupt in blood stain the topography and leave it both changed and the same lloyd looked out the window knowing by offramp signs exactly where he was he strained his eyes to see ray beckers tropics a bar he had worked as a vice officer fifteen years before it wasnt there the whole block had been razed the tropics was now a coin laundry and the texaco station on the corner was a korean church a thought crossed his mind if the city became unrecognizable and the blood eruptions became the only sign of permanence would he go insane the entrance foyer of herzogs building was crowded with teenagers playing pacman lloyd walked past them to the elevator and took it up to the fourth floor the corridor was again deserted with a wide assortment of music and tv noise blasting behind closed doors he walked to the door of and listened hearing nothing he picked the lock and moved inside flipping the wall switch he saw the same sterile apartment illuminated the only addition since his previous entry a fresh stack of junk mail and final notices from bell telephone and la county water and power knowing the bedroom and the kitchen would be the same lloyd sat down on the couch to be still and think his mind was doing tictactoe revolvers and herzogs file requisition slips as xs and os when the phone rang lloyd picked up the receiver and slurred into the mouthpiece hello dutch lloyd shit expecting someone else not really id forgotten i left the number anything new on herzog a good composite id on a man herzog was seen with thats it ive got some feedback on those file slips got a pencil lloyd dug a pen and spiral notebook out of his pocket shoot okay dutch said first off all the files are still missing second they were not requisitioned from anywhere within the department third all the six officers are in good standing in the depart lloyd cut in what about common denominators im the only one of the six below lieutenant have you i was getting to that okay six files one theres you regarded as the best homicide dick in the lapd two theres johnny rolando youve heard of himhes been a technical advisor on half a dozen tv shows both of you fall into what you might call the legendarycop category now the other fourtucker murray christie and kaiserare just hardworking uniformed brass with over twenty years on the job what lloyd interrupted thats all youve got dutch sighed just listen okay the other four have one thing in common moonlight gigs as head of security for industrial firms you know the kind of dealplants that hire lots of cheap labor lots of dopers and excons on the payroll lots of pilfering lots of chemicals lying around that can be used to manufacture dope so you have to keep the lid onlet the employees only rip you off so much that kind of thing lloyds mental wheels turned how did you grapevine this info dutch through a friend on the feds he said the four firmsavonoco fiberglass junior miss cosmetics jahelka auto king and surferdawn plastics are what youd call semisleazy shitkicker security guards who couldnt make the cops files with lots of juicy dirt on their employees to use as levers in case they go batshit from sniffing too much paint thinner heavy files on the workers at avonocotheyve got a classtwo security rating they make fasteners for the space program at andrews air force base and they pay the minimum wage to everyone below management level you like it i dont know whats the theory behind it hire legit cops as figureheads keep the shitkickers in line have them act as gobetweens if a wayward employee gets busted dutch yawned basically yeah id say thats it any hard dirt on the officers themselves not really johnny rolando screws tv stars christie the avonoco fiberglass security man has a history of compulsive gambling and psychiatric care you like to give superior officers shit and never go home to sleep just a random sampling of las finest lloyd didnt know whether to laugh or take offense at the remark suddenly regret coiled around him and forced the words out ill apologize to perkins dutch said good you owe him ill move on your liquor store memo and ill give you another fortyeight on herzog after that im reporting him missing herzogs father is old lloyd we owe it to him to give him the word yeah whats perkins afraid of dutch none of the stuff you hit him with he runs one of the cleanest vice squads in the city what then you a fortytwoyearold hardcharger cop with nothing to lose is a scary fucking thing sometimes you even scare me lloyds regret settled like a stone at the center of his heart good night dutch good night kid lloyd replaced the receiver immediately thinking of new angles on the case his mental xs and os were settling around blackmail but his eyes kept straying back to the phone call janice and the girls in san francisco tell them that the house was sealed off almost exactly the way they had left it that he only used the den and the kitchen preserving the rest of the rooms as a testament to what they had once had and could have again his phone conversations with janice had at last progressed beyond civility was this the time to push for the fullest possible restoration of the familys past the job provided the answer no the officers who took over the formal investigation of herzogs disappearance would check his phone bill and discover the long distance call janices snotty offandon livein lover would probably not accept a collect call fucked again by the verities of being a cop stretching out on the couch lloyd dug in for a long stint of mental machinations he was at it for half an hour playing variations on blackmail themes when there was a rapping on the door followed by a womans softly spoken words jack jack are you there lloyd walked to the door and opened it a tall blonde woman was framed by the hall light her eyes were blurry and her blouse and designer jeans were rumpled she looked up at him and asked are you marty bergen is jack here lloyd pointed the woman inside scrutinizing her openly early thirties a softstrong face informed with intelligence a lean body clenched against stress and bringing it off with grace play her soft when she was standing by the couch he said my name is hopkins im a police officer jack herzog has been missing from both his work assignments for close to a month im looking for him the woman took a reflexive step backward bumping the couch with her heels and then sitting down her hands flew to her face then grasped her thighs lloyd watched her fingers turn white sitting down beside her he asked whats your name the woman released her hands then rubbed her eyes and stared at him meg barnes taking her steady voice as a signal to press the interrogation lloyd said ive got a lot of personal questions then ask them meg barnes answered lloyd smiled when did you see herzog last about a month ago what was the basis of your relationship friends occasionally lovers the sexual part came and went neither of us pushed it the last time i saw jack he told me he wanted to be alone for a while i told him id come by in a month or so which you did tonight yes did herzog contact you at any time during the month no was the sexual part of your relationship on immediately before you saw herzog last meg flinched and said no it wasnt but what does this have to do with jacks disappearing herzog is an exceptional man miss barnes everything ive discovered about him has pointed that out im just trying to get a handle on his state of mind around the time he disappeared i can tell you about that she said jack was either exhilarated or depressed like he was on a rollercoaster ride most of his conversation had to do with vindicating marty bergen he said he was going to fuck the lapd high brass for what they did to him why did you think i was bergen lloyd asked because bergen and i are the only friends jack has in the world and youre big the way jack described bergen lloyd spent a silent minute mustering his thoughts finally he asked did herzog say specifically how he was going to vindicate bergen or fuck the high brass no never can you give me some specific instances of his exhilarated or depressed behavior meg barnes pondered the question then said jack was either very quiet or hed laugh at absolutely everything whether it was funny or not he used to laugh hysterically about someone or something called doctor john the night tripper the last time i saw him he said he was really scared and that it felt good lloyd took out his identikit portrait have you ever seen this man she shook her head no do the names howard christie john rolando duane tucker daniel murray or steven kaiser mean anything to you no avonoco fiberglass jahelka auto king surferdawn plastics junior miss cosmetics no what are they never mind what about my namelloyd hopkins no why are you asking me these things lloyd didnt answer he got up from the couch and tossed the upholstered pillow he was leaning against on the floor then carried the coffee table over to the wall when he turned around meg barnes was staring at him jacks dead she said yes murdered yes are you going to get the person who did it lloyd shuddered back a chill yes meg pointed to the floor are you sleeping here acceptance had taken the controlled edge off her voice lloyds voice sounded numb to his own ears yes your wife kick you out something like that you could come home with me i cant i dont make that offer all the time i know she got up and walked to the door lloyd saw her strides as a race between her legs and her tears when she touched the door handle he asked what kind of man was herzog meg barness words and tears finished in a dead heat a kind man afraid of being vulnerable a tender man afraid of his tenderness disguising it with a badge and a gun a gentle man the door slammed shut as tears rendered words unnecessary lloyd turned off the lights and stared out the window at the neonbracketed darkness tell me about your dreams linda wilhite measured the doctors words wondering whether he meant waking or sleeping deciding the latter she plucked at the hem of her faded levi skirt and said i rarely dream havilland inched his chair closer to linda and formed his fingers into a steeple people who rarely dream usually have active fantasy lives is that true in your case when lindas eyelids twitched at the question he thrust the steeple up to within a foot of her face please answer linda linda slapped at the steeple only to find the doctors hands in his lap dont push so hard she said be specific havilland said think exactly what you want to say linda breathed the words out slowly were barely into the session and you start taking command i had some things i wanted to discuss things that ive had on my mind lately and you barge right in with questions i dont like aggressive behavior the doctor collapsed the steeple and clasped his hands yet youre attracted to aggressive men yes but what does that have to do with it havilland slumped forward in his chair touche linda but let me state my case before i apologize youre paying me a hundred and fifteen dollars an hour which you can afford because you earn a great deal of money doing something you despise i see this therapy as an exercise in pure pragmatism find out why youre a hooker then terminate the therapy once you stop hooking you wont need me or be able to afford me and well go our separate ways i feel for your dilemma linda so please forgive my haste linda felt a little piece of her heart melt at the brilliant mans apology im sorry i barked she said i know youre on my side and i know your methods work soin answer to your question yes i do have an active fantasy life will you elaborate havilland asked about six years ago i posed for a series of clothed and seminude photographs that ultimately became this artyfarty coffee table book there was this awful team of gay photographers and technicians and they posed me in front of air conditioners to blow my hair and give me goose bumps and beside a heater to make me sweat buckets and they turned me and threw me around like a rag doll and it was worse than fucking a three hundred pound drunk and havilland whispered and i used to fantasize murdering those fags and having someone film it then renting a big movie theater and filling it with girls in the life theyd applaud the movie and applaud me like i was fellini the doctor laughed that wasnt so hard was it no is that a recurring fantasy wellno but variations of it recur linda smiled and said you should have been a cop doctor people would tell you whatever you wanted to know okay theres this sort of upbeat version of the movie fantasy you dont have to be a genius to see that it derives from my parents deaths im behind a camera a man beats a woman to death then shoots himself i film it and its real and it isnt real what i mean is of course what happens is real only the people arent permanently dead thats how i justify the fantasy what i think i the doctor cut in interpret the fantasy let me finish linda blurted out lowering her voice she said i was going to say that somehow it all leads to love these real or imaginary or whatever people die so that i can figure out what my fuckedup childhood meant then i meet this big roughhewn man a lonely nobullshit type of man hes had the same kind of life as me and i show him the film and we fall in love end of fantasy isnt it syrupy and awful looking straight at the doctor linda saw that his features had softened and that his eyes were an almost translucent light brown when he didnt answer she got up and walked over to the framed diplomas on the wall on impulse she asked wheres your family doctor i dont really have a family havilland said my father disappeared when i was an adolescent and my mother is in a sanitarium in new york turning to face him linda said im sorry dont be sorry just tell me what youre feeling right now linda laughed i feel like i want a cigarette i quit eight months ago one of my little control trips and now im dying for one havilland laughed in return tell me more about the man you fall in love with linda walked around the office running her fingertips along the oak walls basically all i know is that he wears a size fortyfour sweater i know that because i had a john once who had the perfect body and he wore that sizefor some reason i looked at the label while he was getting dressed when i first started having these fantasies i used to picture the johns facethen i made myself forget his face because it interfered with my fantasy once i even drove downtown to brooks brothers and spent two hundred dollars on a size fortyfour navy blue cashmere sweater linda sat down and drummed the arms of her chair do you think thats a sad story doctor havillands voice was very soft i think im going to enjoy taking you beyond your beyond whats that just a catch phrase of mine dealing with patients potentialities well talk more about that later before we conclude please give me a quick response to a hypothetical situation among my patients is a young man who wants to kill wouldnt it be terrible if he met a young woman who wanted to die and if someone were there with a camera to record it linda slammed the arms of her chair the floor reverberated with her words yes but why does that idea titillate me so havilland got up and pointed to the clock no souls saved after fifty minutes monday at the same time linda took his hand on the way to the door ill be here she said her voice receding to a whisper havilland drove home to his condominiumsanctuary in beverly hills and went straight to his inner sanctum the only one of the six rooms not walled from floor to ceiling with metal shelves spilling psychology texts the night tripper thought of his three dwellings as a wheel of knowledge exploration with himself as the hub his century city office was the induction spoke his condo the fount of study and contemplation the malibu beach house the spoke of dispatch where he sent his lonelies beyond their beyonds but the central point of his work was here behind a door he had personally stripped of varnish and painted an incongruous bright green it was the control room of the time machine a swivel chair and a desk holding a telephone were centered in the room affording a swivel view of four informationcovered walls one wall held a huge map of los angeles county red pins signified the addresses of his lonelies blue pins denoted the pay phones where he contacted thema safety buffer he had devised green pins indicated homes where the lonelies had been placed on assignment and plastic stick figures marked thomas goff ever mobile in his quest to find more red pins two walls comprised a depth gauge to probe the night trippers childhood void serving as markings on the gauge were wcbs topforty surveys from spring attached to the walls with red and blue pins and a shelf containing rollerskate wheels that were once the feet of dead animals lockets of soft brown hair stolen from inside a family bible and a swatch of carpet stained with blood clues the remaining wall was covered with typed quotations from inhabitants of the void taped on in approximate chronological order december motheryour father was a

rays and other tests taken at harvard indicate no aphasiac lesions walls of clues hubs within the hub of himself and all the spokes of his wheels havilland swiveled in his chair pushing off with his feet spinning himself faster and faster until the room was a blur and the four walls and their clues metamorphosed into rapidfire images of linda wilhite and her home movie fantasies he shut his eyes and richard oldfield was standing nude in front of a movie camera with other lonelies laboring over arc lights and sound equipment the chair was close to toppling off its casters when the phone rang and froze the moment deep breathing to bail out of his reverie the night tripper let the chair come to a halt when he was certain his voice would be calm he picked up the phone and said is this good news thomas goffs voice was both selfsatisfied and hoarse with tension bingo junior miss cosmetics i never even had to contact the cop i played one of his stooges like an accordion murray wont know anything about it have you got them tonight goff said its only costing us a grand and some pharmaceutical coke where i want to know the exact time and place why you told me this was my baby tell me thomas hearing the hoarseness in his own voice havilland coated his words with sugar youve done brilliantly and it is your baby i just want to be able to picture your triumph goff went silent the doctor pictured a proud child afraid to express his gratitude at being wooed with cheap praise finally the child bowed to the father at tenthirty tonight the end of nichols canyon road in the little park with the picnic benches havilland smiled throw the child a crumb beyond brilliant perfection ill meet you at your apartment at eleven well celebrate the occasion by planning our next grouping i need your feedback yes doctor goffs voice was one step above groveling havilland hung up the phone and replayed the conversation realizing that linda wilhite had remained a half step back in his mind the whole time waiting at ninethirty havilland drove to nichols canyon and parked behind a stand of sycamore trees adjacent to the picnic area he was shielded from view by mounds of scrubcovered rock which still allowed him visual access to goffs meeting spot the lights that were kept on all night to thwart off gay assignations would frame the picture and unless goff and the security stooge spoke in a whisper their voices would carry up to his hiding place it was perfection at ten past ten goffs yellow toyota pulled up havilland watched his executive officer get out and stretch his legs then withdraw a large revolver from his waistband and go into a gunfighters pirouette swiveling in all directions blowing away imaginary adversaries the overhead lights illuminated a throbbing network of veins in his forehead the storm warning of a lepto attack havilland could almost feel goffs speededup heartbeat and respiration when the sound of another car approaching hit his ears and goff stuck his gun back and covered the butt with his windbreaker havilland felt his body go cold with sweat a battered primergray chevy appeared doing a little fishtail as the driver applied the brakes a fat black man in a skintight uniform of pale blue shirt khaki pants and sam browne belt got out making a big show of slamming the door and chugging from a pint of whiskey havilland shuddered as he recalled one of goffs favorite death fantasies drawing down on niggers the black man sauntered up to goff and offered him the bottle goff declined with a shake of the head and said you brought them havilland squinted and saw that goffs fingers were trembling and involuntarily plucking at his waistband the black man knocked back a long drink and giggled if you got the money ive got the honey if you got the dope i got the shit i cant rhyme that one you look nervous homeboy you been tootin a little too much of your own product goff took a step backward his whole left side was alive with tremors havilland could see his left leg buckle as though straining to kick out at a right angle the black man raised his hands in a supplicating gesture fear in his eyes as he saw goffs face contort spastically man you reelin with the feelin i get you the stuff and you pay me off and we do this all real slow all right goff found his voice willing it even made his tremors subside rock steady leroy you want it slow you got it slow my name aint leroy the black man said you dig i dig you amos now cut the shit and bring me the stuff you dig goffs thumbs were hooked in his belt loops his hands twitched in the direction of the gun havilland saw the black man bristle then smile for a k note and two grams of righteous blow you can call me anything short of sambo he walked to his car and reached into the backseat coming away with two large cardboard suitcases returning to goff and putting them down at his feet he said fresh off the xerox machine nobody but me knows about it come up green homeboy goff stuck a shaking hand into his windbreaker and pulled out a plastic baggie then tossed it in the dirt beside the black mans car ride leroy buy yourself a cadillac and get your hair processed on me the black man picked up the baggie and balled it in his fist then killed the pint and threw it at goffs toyota when it hit the trunk and shattered goff grabbed at his waistband then stifled a shriek and jerked his gun hand to his mouth and bit it havilland stifled his own outcry and watched the black man raise his hands and back up slowly toward his car murmuring ill be rockin steady rockin steady real slow reeeal slow his back touched the drivers side door and he squirmed in behind the wheel rolled up the window and gunned the car in reverse when the dust from his exit cleared havilland could see thomas goff weeping aiming his handcannon at the moon an hour after goffs sobbing departure the doctor drove to his underlings apartment in the los feliz district the moon catching the edge of his vision constantly drawing his eyes from the road parking outside goffs building he checked the contents of his black leather truth kit sodium pentothal ampules ten cc bottles of liquid morphine and an assortment of disposable syringes he would quash goffs pain and gauge the degree of his slippage goff opened the door on the first knock he was stripped to the waist his torso oozing sweat havilland stepped inside and felt the chill of an airconditioner on full blast he looked at goff his extremities were tensed as if to contain earthquakes and his eyes were a feverish yellow doing a quick hypothetical runthrough based on observation and carefully studied case histories he gave his pawn a month to live when the door closed on his diagnosis the doctor took goff by the arm and led him to the couch the two cardboard suitcases rested by the coffee table unopened goff smiled through his tremors and pointed to them were on our way doctor john havilland smiled in return and opened his leather bag he withdrew a fresh syringe and a morphine bottle poking the needle through the porous rubber top extracting just enough dope for an enticing mainline goff wet his lips and said its the worst its ever been ive been doing some more reading on migraines they get worse in a persons thirties i think im really scared the doctor took a bead on a large pulsating vein behind goffs left ear he formed a tourniquet with the flat of his hand placing it just above goffs collarbone whispering easy thomas easy he inserted the needle square into the vein and depressed the stopper a sharp jet of blood squirted out as the morphine entered goffs features unclenched in relief and havilland smiled and amended his death sentence a small dose still brought comfort sixty days goffs limbs went languorous and the veins in his forehead receded to their normal dimensions havilland studied his patient and devised a spur of the moment contingency plan if the pain began again within the next half hour give goff thirty days of maintenance doses risk him on one more securityfile run then take him out of la to terminate and go solo on the remaining runs if the pain remains abated give him sixty days of tether for two more runs play the truth game with him to explain the tension with the jigaboo the problem was covered goff closed his eyes and drifted off into a dopeexhaustion cloudbank havilland got up and walked around the living room purposely averting his eyes from the suitcases the low ceiling was painted black and the walls were painted a military brown goffs therapycontrolled brightness phobia had driven him to turn a cheery dwelling place into a neuroses decompression chamber every time he visited the apartment the doctor looked for splotches of color indicators that he had at long last instigated a total failure of memory thereby giving goff some peace of mind to go with his total acquiescence but everything that could be purchased or rendered dark remained that way room carpeting to cabinet hardware the doctor surveyed the decompression chamber from a possible farewell standpoint various shades of darkness hit his senses producing a pleasant vertigo that resurrected a childhood memory of a ferris wheel at a bronx amusement park the wheel was about to grab him when a burst of nonsequitur pink threw a wrench into its gears snapping back to the present havilland saw that it was a pink slip of paper on the end table near the bedroom door partially covered by a black ceramic ashtray he picked it up and felt the room reel it was an lapd release slip issued to thomas goff upon the presentation of sixtyfive dollars bail money the charge was failure to appear in traffic court the doctor read the heavily abbreviated type at the bottom and crumpled the paper in his hand his executive officer had been arrested for nonpayment of jaywalking citations the ferris wheel stopped at the top of its circuit then plummeted to earth dropping him into a land of treason he looked over at goff who stirred in his stupor kneading his shoulders into the couch the doctor felt a wave of rage and loathing hit him like a onetwo punch in the solar plexus to combat it he breathed inout inout until the counterproductive emotions leveled off into professional calm when he was certain he could maintain his decorum he arrayed the tools of his truth kit on the coffee table filling one syringe with morphine and another with sodium pentothal as goffs stirrings became more violent he reached over and pinched his nostrils shut and counted slowly to ten at nine goff jerked fully awake and screamed havilland took his hand from his nostrils and clamped it over his mouth pinning his head to the wall whispering easy thomas easy he took the morphine syringe and skinpopped goff in his left arm and left pectoral muscle seeing that goffs relief was instantaneous he released his hand and said you didnt tell me that you were arrested last month goff shook his head until his body shook with it all the way down to his toes i havent been in the slam since attica you know that doc it was the hoarse rasp of a terrified man speaking the perfect truth havilland smiled and whispered your left forearm thomas when goff obeyed he jammed a cc jolt of sodium pentothal into the largest vein at the crook of his elbow goff gasped and began to giggle havilland withdrew the needle and leaned back on the couch tell me about the junior miss file transaction he said goff giggled and fixed his glazed eyes on the far wall i scoped out the security bimbos from the bar across from the parking lot he slurred all white trash and niggers the niggers looked too shifty so i settled on this okie type i asked some of the regulars about him casual like they said he was a coke fiend but controlled and a closedmouthed type he sounded like prime meat so i brought him out slowly and closed the deal yesterday i met him a couple of hours ago those two suitcases are the files havilland felt his mind buzz like someone had stuck a live wire into his brain goff was so far gone that he was now immune even to massive doses of hypnotic drugs time was running out for his executive officerhe had two weeks to live at best thomas goff continued to squeal with laughter his hands dancing over his body havilland examined the pink release slip no vehicle license plate mentioned goff had obviously been stopped for questioning while on foot a routine warrant check turning up his old jaywalking tickets he waved the slip in front of goffs eyes goff ignored the flash of brightness and laughed even harder havilland got to his feet and swung a roundhouse open hand at goffs face goff screeched no please as the blow made contact then wrapped his head in his hands and curled into a fetal ball on the couch the doctor squatted beside him and put a hand on his shoulder you need a rest thomas he said the migraines are sapping your strength were going to take a little vacation together im going to confer with some specialists about your headaches then treat you myself i want you to stay home and rest then call me in fortyeight hours all right goff twisted to look at the doctor he wiped a trickle of blood from his nose and whimpered yes but what about the next grouping we were going to plan it remember well have to postpone it the important thing now is to deal with your migraines thomas goffs eyes clouded with tears the doctor extracted a bottle of tetracyclinemorphine mixture from his bag and prepped a syringe antibiotics he said in case your migraines have gone viral goff nodded as havilland found a vein in his wrist and inserted the needle his tears spilled over at the act of mercy and by the time the doctor withdrew the syringe he was asleep dr john havilland picked up the two suitcases surprised to find that he wasnt thinking of the merciless information inside as he turned off the light and shut the door behind him he was thinking of a black vinyl vietnam body bag he had won as a joke prize at a med school beer bust and of dogs exploding into red behind a barbed wire fence lloyd awoke in his den already calculating hours before he was fully conscious thirtysix since dutchs ultimatum and no new leadsreport herzog missing well over a hundred hours since the liquor store slaughterall leads deadended start crosschecking the three hundred thousand yellow jap cars and begin hauling in known armed robbers leaning on them hard squeezing all known and suspected pressure points in hope of securing information shit work all the way down the line lloyd stretched and rolled off the convertible bed in one motion then walked into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator letting the cold air bring him to full consciousness when goose bumps formed beneath his tshirt and boxer shorts he shivered and dug out a half consumed container of cottage cheese eating with the spoon that was still stuck inside almost gagging on the sticky blandness he looked around the three small rooms he had allotted himself in his familys absence den to sleep think and study in kitchen for the preparing of such gourmet fare as cottage cheese and cold chili from the can the downstairs bathroom for hygiene when he started doing calculations as to the number of hours since janice and the girls had left his mental calculator quit in midtransaction if you start running tabs youll go crazy and do something crazy to get them back let it be if you stalk them theyll know you havent changed its a penance waiting game finishing his breakfast lloyd showered hot and cold then dressed in a day old buttondown shirt and his only clean suit an unseasonable summer pinstripe murmuring now or never he sat down at his desk dug out a spiral notebook and wrote to chief of detectives from det sergeant lloyd hopkins robhom div sir four days ago i was contacted by my friend captain arthur peltz the commander of hollywood division he told me that officer jacob herzog a personnel records clerk at parker center who was working on a subrosa loanout to hollywood vice had been missing for nearly a month captain peltz asked me to investigate and in doing so i discovered that herzogs intact apartment had been professionally wiped of fingerprints i questioned herzogs best friend former lapd sergeant martin bergen who told me that he hadnt seen herzog in over a month and that herzog had been moody at the time of their last meeting an interview with herzogs girlfriend confirms his month long absence and moody behavior my opinion is that herzog is the victim of a wellplanned homicide and that his disappearance should be immediately and fully investigated i realize that i should have reported this earlier but my sole purpose in not reporting was to first establish evidence however circumstantial of wrongdoing captain peltz ordered me to report to you immediately but i violated that order respectfully lloyd hopkins lloyd read over his words strangely satisfied at having taken the bulk of the risk in incurring high brass wrath he ripped the page out of the notebook and put it in his inside jacket pocket then clipped on his and handcuffs and made for the front door he had his hand on the doorknob when the phone rang he let it ring ten times before answeringonly penny pursued a phone call that persistently speak its your dime pennys giggle came over the wire no its not daddy its my dollarforty lloyd laughed excuse me i forgot inflation whats the scoop penguin the same old same old what about you are you getting any lloyd feigned shock penny hopkins im surprised at you no youre not you told me i was jaded in my crib you didnt answer my question daddy very well in answer to your question i am not getting any pennys giggle went up an octave good mom read me that first letter of yours you know we were talking about it the other night she said it was excessive that you

with roger but she talks about you one of these nights im going to get her stoned and get her to admit youre her main love ill report her words to you verbatim lloyd felt a little piece of his heart work itself loose and drift up to san francisco i want all of you back penguin i know i want to come back and so does anne thats two votes for you mom and caroline want to stay in frisco dead heat annie and caroline are okay anne is big into vegetarianism and eastern thought and caroline is in love with this punk rock fool next door hes a high school dropout gross lloyd laughed par for the teenage course let me hit you with something doctor john the night tripper ring any bells ancient ones daddy the sixties he was this wild rock and roller caroline has one of his recordsbad boogaloo thats it yeah why a case im on dutch is on it too its probably nothing pennys voice went low and shrewd daddy when are you going to tell me about what happened right after the breakup im no dummy i know you were shot uncle dutch practically admitted it to mom lloyd sighed as their conversation came to its usual conclusion give it another couple of years babe when youre a worldweary fifteen ill spill my guts right now all it means is that i owe a lot of people owe what daddy i dont know babe thats the tricky part will you tell me when you figure it out youll be the first to know i love you penny i love you too ive got to go so do i love love love likewise bye bye with owe what daddy trailing in his mind lloyd drove downtown to parker center his memo to the chief of detectives rested like a hot coal in his jacket pocket deciding to check his incoming basket before dropping it with the chiefs secretary he took the elevator to the sixth floor and strode down the hall to his cubicle seeing the note affixed to his door immediately hopkinscall det dentinger bhpd re gun query lloyd grabbed his phone and dialed the seven familiar digits of the beverly hills police department saying detective dentinger when the switchboard operator came on the line there was the sound of the call being transferred then a mans perfunctory voice dentinger talk lloyd was brusque detective sergeant hopkins lapd what have you got on my gun query dentinger muttered shit to himself then said into the mouthpiece we got a burglary from two weeks ago unsolved no prints a fortyonecaliber revolver was listed on the report of missing items the reason you didnt get a quicker response on this is because the burglary dicks who originally investigated think that the report was padded you know for insurance purposes a bunch of shit was reported stolen but the burglars access was this little basement window he couldnt have hauled all the shit out it wouldnt have fit ive been assigned to investigate the deal see if we should file on this joker for submitting a false crime report ill give you the sp lloyd cut in do you think there was a burglary dentinger sighed ill give you my scenario yes there was a burglary small items were stolen like the jewelry on the report the gun and probably some shit the victim didnt report like cocaineive got him figured for a stone snowbird really whacked out you know the clincher the guy owns two of these antique guns mounted in presentation cases with original ammo from the civil war but he only reports one stolen i dont doubt that the fucker was stolen but any intelligent insurance padder would stash the other gun and report it stolen too am i right lloyd said right give me the information on the victim okay dentinger said morris epstein age fortyfour eightonesixseven elevado he calls himself a literary agent but hes got that hollywood big bucks flybynight look you know live high on credit and bullshit never know where your next buck is coming from personally i think these lloyd didnt wait for dentinger to finish his spiel he hung up the phone and ran for the elevator elevado was a salmon pink spanishstyle house in the beverly hills residential district lloyd sat in his car at the curb and saw dentingers big bucks flybynight label confirmed the lawn needed mowing the hedges needed trimming and the chocolate brown mercedes in the driveway needed a bath he walked up and knocked on the door moments later a small middleaged man with finely sculpted saltandpepper hair threw the door open when he saw lloyd he reached for the zipper at the front of his jumpsuit and zipped up his chest youre not from roll your own productions are you he asked lloyd flashed his badge and id card im from the lapd are you morris epstein the man shuffled back into his entrance foyer lloyd followed him isnt this out of your jurisdiction the man said lloyd closed the door behind them ill make it easy on you epstein i have reason to believe that the fortyone revolver you reported stolen might have been used in a triple homicide i want to borrow your other fortyone for comparison tests cooperate and ill tell the beverly hills cops that your insurance report was exaggerated not padded you dig morris epstein went livid spittle formed at the corners of his mouth he flung an angry arm in the direction of the door and hissed leave this house before i have you sued for police harassment i have friends in the aclu theyll fix your wagon for real flatfoot lloyd pushed past epsteins arm into an artdeco living room festooned with framed movie posters and outsized giltedged mirrors a glass coffee table held a singleedged razor blade and traces of white powder there was a large cabinet against the wall by the fireplace lloyd opened and shut drawers until he found the glassine bag filled with powder he turned to see epstein standing beside him with the telephone in his hand when he held the bag in front of epsteins eyes the little man said you cant bluff me this is illegal search and seizure im personal friends with jerry brown ive got clout one phone call and you are adios motherfucker lloyd grabbed the telephone from epsteins hand jerked the cord out of the wall and tossed it on the coffee table the table shattered sending glass shards exploding up to the ceiling epstein backed into the wall and whispered now look pal we can bargain this out we can lloyd said were past the bargaining stage bring me the gun do it now epstein unzipped the top of his jumpsuit and kneaded his chest i still say this is illegal search and seizure this is a legal search and seizure coincident to the course of a felony investigation bring me the gunin its case dont touch the gun itself morris epstein capitulated with an angry upward tug of his zipper when he left the room lloyd gave it a quick toss searching the remaining drawers wondering whether or not he should go to the beverly hills station and check out the burglary report dentinger had said that no prints were found but maybe there were fis on yellow jap imports or other indicators to jog his brain he went through the last drawer then turned his attention to the mantel above the fireplace he could hear epsteins returning footsteps as his eyes caught a cutglass bowl filled with matchbooks he grabbed a handful they were all from first avenue westone of the two bars that jungle jack herzog was working heres your gun shamus lloyd turned around and saw epstein holding a highly varnished rosewood box he walked to him and took the box from his hands opening the lid he saw a large blue steel revolver with motherofpearl grips mounted on red velvet arranged in a circle around it were copperjacketed softnosed bullets taking a pen from his pocket he inserted it into the barrel and raised the gun upward clearly etched on the barrels underside were the numbers satisfied epstein said lloyd lowered the barrel and closed the lid of the box im satisfied where did you get the guns i bought them cheap from the producer of this civil war miniseries i packaged last year do you know the serial number of the other gun no but i know the two guns had consecutive numbers listen do the beverly hills fuzz really think i padded that burglary report yes but ill slip them the word about how you cooperated i saw some matches here from first avenue west do you go there a lot yeah why lloyd took a photograph of jack herzog from his billfold ever see this man epstein shook his head no withdrawing a photocopy of his identikit portrait of the man seen with herzog lloyd said what about him epstein looked at the picture then flinched man this is fucking weird i did some blow with this guy outside brunos serendipity one night this is a great fucking likeness lloyd felt two divergent evidential lines intersect in an incredible revelation did this man tell you his name he asked no we just did the blow and split company but it was funny he was a weird persistent kind of guy he kept asking me these questions about my family and if i was into meeting this really incredibly smart dude he knew whats the matter shamus you look pale lloyd gripped the gun box so hard that he could hear his finger tendons cracking did you tell him your name no but i gave him my card did you tell him about your guns epstein swallowed yeah when did you talk to the man maybe two three months ago have you seen him since no i havent been back to brunos it sucks did you see the man get into a car yeah a little yellow job make and model it was foreign thats all i know listen whats this all about you come in here and hassle me break my coffee table epstein stopped when he saw lloyd run for the door he called out hey shamus come back and shmooze sometime i could package a badass fuzz like you into a series running roof lights and siren lloyd made it back to parker center in a record twentyfive minutes cradling the gun box in the crook of his arm he ran the three flights of stairs up to the offices of the scientific indentification division then pushed through a series of doors until he was face to face with officer artie cranfield who put down his copy of penthouse and said man do you look jazzed lloyd caught his breath and said i am jazzed and i need some favors this box contains a gun can you dust it for latents real quick after you do that we need a ballistics comparison this is a suspected murder weapon no but its a consecutive serial number to the gun i think is the liquor store murder weapon since the ammo in this box and the murder ammo is antique probably from the same casting im hoping that the rifling marks will be so similar that we can assume th we cant make those kinds of assumptions artie interjected that kind of theorizing wont hold up in court lloyd handed artie the gun box artie ill lay you twenty to one that this one gets settled on the street now will you please dust this baby for me artie took a pencil from his desk and propped open the lid of the box then stuck another pencil in the barrel of the revolver the end affixed to the upper hinge of the box forming a wedge that held the gun steady when the box and gun were secure he took out a small brush and a vial of fingerprint powder and spread it over every blue steel motherofpearl and rosewood surface finishing he shook his head and said smooth glove prints on the grip streak prints on the barrel i dusted the box for kicks smudged latents that are probably you glove prints that indicate that the box was carefully opened youre dealing with a pro lloyd lloyd shook his head i really didnt think wed find anything good he stole the companion gun but i figured he might have touched this one too he did with surgical rubber gloves artie started to laugh lloyd said fuck you lets take this monster down to the tank and see how it kicks artie led lloyd through the crime lab to a small room where water and tuftedcottonlayered ballistics tanks were sunk into the floor lloyd slipped three slugs into thes chamber and fired into the top layer of water there was the sound of muffled ricocheting then artie squatted and opened up a vent on the tanks side withdrawing the catcher layer of cotton he pulled out the three expended rounds and said perfect ive got a comparison microscope in my office well sign for the liquor store shells and run them lloyd signed a crime lab chit for the three rounds taken from the bodies of the liquor store victims and brought them in a vinyl evidence bag to arties office artie placed them on the left plate of a large doubleeyepieced microscope then placed the three ballistics tank rounds on the right plate and studied both sets individually and collectively for over half an hour finally he got up rubbed his eyes and voiced his findings discounting the fact that the set of rounds fired at the liquor store were flattened by their contact with human skulls while the tank rounds were intact and the fact that the impact of the liquor store rounds altered the rifling marks i would say that the basic land and groove patterns are as identical as slugs fired from two different guns can be nail the bastard lloyd give him the big one where it hurts the most brunos serendipity was a singles barbackgammon club on rodeo drive in the heart of beverly hillss boutique strip the clubs interior was dark and plush with a long sequinstudded black leather bar dominating one half of the floor space and lounge chairs and lighted backgammon boards the other a sequined velvet curtain divided the two areas with a raised platform just inside the doorway that was visible from both sides of the room lloyd smiled as he approached the bar it was a perfect logistical setup the bartender was a skinny youth with a punk haircut lloyd sat down at the bar and took out his billfold removing a ten dollar bill and his identikit portrait and letting the bartender see his badge all in one motion when the youth said yes sir what can i get you lloyd tucked the ten into his vest pocket and handed him the photocopy lapd have you seen this man here before take it over to the light and look at it carefully the bartender complied switching on a lamp by the cash register he studied the picture then shook his head and said sure lots of times kind of an intense dude i think he swings both ways i mean ive seen him in these really intense conversations with both men and women what did he do lloyd gave the youth a stern look he molests little boys when was the last time you saw him jesus last week sometime this guys a chicken hawk thats right what time does he usually show up the bartender pointed in the direction of the backgammon tables you see how dead it is nobody shows up here much before eight we only open up this early because we usually get some businessmen boozehounds in the late afternoon lloyd said i noticed that you dont have a parking lot have you got any kind of valet parking setup the youth shook his head we dont need one plenty of street parking after the boutiques close he pointed to the platform inside the doorway youll be able to see him real good though after dark every time the door opens disco music goes on and colored lights flash down from the ceiling white then blue and red you know to let people know whos arriving youll be able to see him real good lloyd put a dollar bill on the counter then walked to a stool at the far end of the bar ginger ale with lime and bring me some peanuts or something i forgot to eat lunch for six hours lloyd drank ginger ale and plumbed logic for something to explain his two cases converging into a single narrative line nothing but a sense of his own fitness for the unraveling emerged from his ruminations which were accompanied by a disco light show at the clubs front door from six oclock on every person who entered was centered in a flashing light show that was stereosynced to upbeat arrangements of tunes from saturday night fever most of the people were young and stylishly dressed and did a brief dance step before heading for the bar or backgammon tables lloyd scrutinized every male face as the first white light hit it no one even vaguely resembled his suspect gradually the male and female faces merged into an androgynous swirl that made his eyes ache combining with the noise of subtle and blatant mating overtures to tilt all his senses out of focus at eleven oclock lloyd went to the mens room and soaked his head in a sink filled with cold water revived he dried himself with paper towels and walked back into the club proper he was about to take his seat at the bar when the identikit portrait walked past him in the flesh lloyds skin prickled and he had to ball his gun hand to kill a reflex reach for his the mens eyes locked for a split second lloyd averting his first thinking take him outside at his car then he heard a hoarse gasp behind him followed by a clicking of metal on metal both men turned at the same instant lloyd saw the identikit man raise his monster handgun and sight it straight at him he ducked to his knees as the muzzle burst with red and the report of the shot slammed his ears bottles exploded behind the bar as the shot went wide screams filled the room lloyd rolled on the floor toward the sequined divider curtain drawing his and attempting to aim from a backward roll as odd parts of frantic bodies blocked a shot at his target two more thunderous explosions the bar mirror shattering the screaming reaching toward a crescendo lloyd rolled free of the curtain crashing into a backgammon table he got to his feet as another shot hit the curtain housing and sent the curtain crashing to the floor people were huddling under tables pressing together in a tangle of arms and legs muzzle smoke covered the bar area but through it lloyd could see his adversary arcing his pistol looking for his target lloyd extended his gun arm his left hand holding his wrist steady he fired twice too high and saw the identikit man turn and run back in the direction of the restrooms stumbling over an obstacle course of trembling bodies lloyd pursued flattening himself to the wall outside the mens room nudging the door inward with his foot he heard strained breathing inside and pushed the door open firing blindly at chest level jerking himself backward just as a return shot blew the door in half lloyd slid to the floor counting expended rounds five for psycho three for himself charge him and kill him he fumbled three shells from his belt into the chamber of his snub nose then fired into the bathroom in hope of getting a return shot in panic when none came he pushed through the halfdestroyed door catching a blurry glimpse of a pair of legs pulling themselves up and out of a narrow window above the toilet stripping off his jacket lloyd leaped up and tried to squeeze out the window his shoulders jammed and splintered the woodwork but even by squirming and contracting every inch of his body he wouldnt fit jumping down he ran back through the club proper now a wasteland of shattered glass upended furniture and shelterseeking mounds of people he was only a few feet from the entrance promenade when the door burst open and three patrolmen with pump shotguns came up in front of him and aimed their weapons at his head seeing the fear in their eyes and sensing their fingers worrying the triggers lloyd let his drop to the floor lapd he said softly my badge and id are in my jacket pocket the middle cop poked lloyd in the chest with the muzzle of his shotgun you aint got a jacket asshole turn around and put your hands on the wall above your head then spread your legs do it real slow lloyd obeyed in the slowest of slow motion he felt rough hands give him a thorough frisking in the distance he could hear the wail of sirens drawing nearer when his hands were pinned behind his back and cuffed he said my jacket is in the bathroom i was here on a homicide stakeout youve got to issue an apb and a vehicle detain order its a yellow japan a heavy object crashed into the small of his back lloyd twisted around and saw the middle cop holding his shotgun butt extended the other two cops hung a few feet back looking bewildered one of them whispered hes got a cross draw holster ill check the bathroom the middle cop silenced him shitcan it well take him in you check these people look for anyone wounded take statements the meat wagon will be here in a second so you help the paramedics jensen and i will take asshole in lloyd squinted and read the leader cops nameplateburnside straining to keep his voice steady he said burnside you are letting a mass murderer and probable cop killer walk just go into the bathroom and get my jacket burnside spun lloyd around and shoved him out the door and into a patrol car at curbside lloyd looked out the window and saw other beverly hills blackandwhites and paramedic vans pull up directly on the sidewalk as the patrol car accelerated he looked in vain for a yellow japanese import and felt his whole body smolder like dry ice the ride to the beverly hills station took two minutes burnside and jensen hustled lloyd up the back stairs and led him down a dingy hallway to a wire mesh holding tank shoving him inside still cuffed burnside said to his partner this bust feels like fat city any legit lapd dick would have taken one of our guys with him on a stakeout lets go get the skipper when the two cops locked the cage door and ran off down the hallway lloyd leaned back against the wire wall and listened to the laughing and shouting coming from the drunk tank at the far end of the corridor letting his mind go blank he gradually assimilated a mental replay of the events at brunos serendipity one thought dominated somehow the identikit man had instantly seized upon him as his enemy true his size and outdated business suit would alert any streetwise fool but the ik man had glimpsed him for only a brief moment in a crowded artificially lighted environment lloyd held the thought testing it for leaks finding none something was way off the usual criminal ken you fucked up sergeant lloyd shifted his gaze to see who had spoken it was a beverly hills captain in uniform he was holding his suit coat and and shaking his head slowly let me out and give me my jacket and gun lloyd said the captain shook his head a last time then slid a key into the cage door and swung it open he took a handcuff key from his pocket and unlocked lloyds cuffs lloyd rubbed his wrists and took his coat and gun out of the captains hands realizing that the man was at least a half dozen years his junior yeah i fucked up he said nice to hear the legendary lloyd hopkins admit to fallibility the captain said why didnt you notify the head of our detective squad of your stakeout he would have given you a backup officer it happened too fast i was going to wait for the suspect outside by his car i would have called for one of your units to assist me but he made me for a cop and freaked out what are you sixfour twotwentyfive it doesnt take a genius to figure out what you do for a living yeah your own officers couldnt figure it out too well the captain flushed officer burnside will apologize to you lloyd said goody in the meantime a stone psychopathic killer drives out of beverly hills a free man an apb and a vehicle detain order might have gotten him dont try my patience hopkins just be grateful that no one at brunos was hurt if you had been responsible for the injury or death of a constituent of mine i would have crucified you as it stands ill let your own department deal with you lloyds vision pulsed with red he shut his eyes to keep the throbbing localized and said do you want to hear the whole story no i want a complete report in triplicate go upstairs and find a desk and write it now ive informed your superiors at robberyhomicide you are to report to the chief of detectives tomorrow morning at ten good night sergeant fuming lloyd watched the captain walk away he gave himself ten minutes to cool down then took an elevator to the thirdfloor vehicle registration office a night clerk gave him a yellow legal pad and a pen and over the next two hours he block printed three reports detailing the events at brunos and summarizing his investigations into the liquor store homicides and the disappearance of officer jack herzog copying over his unsubmitted memo to the chief of detectives verbatim in hopes that it would be construed as an effort at team play when he finished he left the pages with the night desk officer and headed for the parking lot he was almost out the door when an intercom voice jerked him back in urgent call for sergeant hopkins paging sergeant hopkins lloyd walked to the night desk and picked up the phone yes its dutch lloyd what happened lots of shit who told you thad braverton youre supposed to see him tomorrow i know is he pissed depends on what you have to say what happened lloyd laughed through his anger and fatigue you wont believe what happened the same guy did the liquor store job and killed jack herzog im sure of it he fired on me with his liquor store piece we did our best to destroy a beverly hills singles bar it was wild dutch shouted what tomorrow partner ill call you after i talk to braverton dutchs voice was soft jesus fucking christ lloyds was softer yeah on a popsicle stick you got any good news for me i could use some dutch said two items one i checked around on that weird name you asked about doctor john the night tripper he was a rock bimbo from years ago and its also the nickname of a psychiatrist who does lots of counseling of hookers and courtreferred criminal types hes very well respected his real name is john havilland and his office is in century city two youre in good shape with iad i called fred gaffaney this morning and reported herzog missing i took the grief which consisted of gaffaney screaming fuck a few times lloyd memorized the first item and laughed at the second good work partner ill talk to you tomorrow dutch laughed back stay alive kid lloyd hung up and walked out into the parking lot threading his way through a maze of erratically parked blackandwhites and unmarked cruisers when he got to the sidewalk he saw officer burnside striding toward him burnside snickered as he passed and lloyd halted and tapped him on the shoulder you got something to say to me burnside turned and said yeah aint you a little old to be hotdogging outside your jurisdiction lloyd smiled and drove a short right hand into burnsides midsection burnside gasped and doubled over lloyd propped up his chin with his left hand then swung a full force right at the bridge of his nose feeling it crack beneath his fist burnside flew back onto the pavement moaning and drawing himself into a ball to escape more blows lloyd walked to his car feeling old and numb and tired of his profession the night tripper was on his fourth reading of the junior miss cosmetics files when the phone in his private study rang twentyfour hours before goffs next scheduled call picturing his terminal man straining against a bacterial fever he picked up the receiver and whispered youre early thomas what is it goffs reply came out in series of gasps cop big man from the cop files i tried to wax him like the liquor store scum but he the gasps became a horrified wailing havilland envisioned goff hyperventilating and frothing and burning up the phone booth with his fever and bewildered rage passing sentence in his mind he said aloud go home thomas can you understand that go home and wait for me draw in three breaths and tell me youll go home will you do that for me the three breaths drew out the semblance of a human voice yes yes please hurry the doctor replaced the receiver and held his hands in front of his eyes they were perfectly steady he walked into the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror his light brown eyes were unwavering in their knowledge that although goff had fallen he was invulnerable he reached below the sink and picked up the death kit he had prepared the previous night then went back to his study and stuffed it inside the old leather briefcase he had saved since med school squatting down he pulled up a section of loose carpeting and opened his floor safe extracting a single manila folder thinking for a split second that the man in the photo attached to the first page looked exactly like his father thus armed for mercy he left his apartment and walked out to the street to look for a cab one cruised by a few minutes later michaels restaurant on los feliz and hillhurst havilland told the driver and please hurry the driver sped through the late evening traffic never looking back at his passenger pulling up in front of the restaurant he said fast enough for you the doctor smiled and handed him a twenty keep the change he said when the cab drove away havilland walked the four blocks to goffs apartment noting with relief that all the lights in the adjoining units were off he rapped softly on the door hearing otherworldly moans respond to his knock the inside chain was withdrawn and goff was framed in the doorway beseeching him with terrified eyes and hands pressed together in prayer the doctor stared at the hands as they trembled a few inches in front of him the fingers were bloody stubs as if goffs animal panic had driven him to try to dig a way out of his life looking at the inside of the door he saw gouge marks and trickles of blood havilland put gentle hands on goffs shoulders and pushed him back into the living room seeing his corditestinking handgun on the coffee table shutting and bolting the door he pointed goff to the couch then rummaged in his briefcase for his instruments of accusation and mercy laying the manila folder face down on the floor and filling a syringe from a lab vial of strychnine he whispered two questions before i sedate you thomas one did the police see your car goff shook his head and tried to form no with his lips the doctor looked into his eyes probable truth whispering good good he clasped his left hand over goffs mouth and pressed his head to the wall with all his strength goffs eyes bulged but remained locked into the eyes of his master havilland took the manila folder from the floor and slipped off the front page photograph holding it up for goff to see he said is this the policeman goffs eyes widened the pupils dilated a scream rose in his throat and he twisted his head and bit at the doctors hand havilland pushed forward with all his weight flailing with his free arm for the syringe finding it just as goffs teeth grazed his palm throwing himself across goffs squirming torso he stabbed the needle into his neck missing his target vein pulling it free as the point struck muscle tissue aiming again he saw his father and the cop in the photo fuse into one persona just as the ferris wheel at the bronx amusement park began its descent the spike struck home his thumb worked the plunger the poison entered goffs back arched as his feet twisted and pushed off the wall in a huge fullbody seizure both master and minion were thrown to the floor goff writhed foam at his mouth havilland got to his knees seeing his father and the cop separate into individual entities replaced by a little girl in a fiftiesstyle party dress laughing at him he shook his head to destroy the vision then heard goffs vertebrae popping as he attempted to turn himself insideout getting to his feet he saw a door opening on blackness and headstones behind a barbed wire fence then he held his hands in front of his face and saw that they were steady he looked down on the floor and saw thomas goff dead frozen in a final configuration of anguish father the night tripper whispered father father now only the disposal remained the doctor dug through his briefcase removing the black vinyl body bag and laying it out lengthwise on the floor zipped open he tossed goffs handgun into the bottom then stuffed in goff himself and zipped the bag up goffs car keys were on the coffee table havilland pocketed them then squatted down and hoisted the painfree goff onto his right shoulder picking up his briefcase and flicking off the ceiling light he shut the door and walked outside to the street goffs toyota was parked four buildings down havilland unlocked the trunk and wedged the dead man inside securing the body bag by placing a spare tire and bumper jack across goffs midsection satisfied with the concealment the doctor slammed the trunk shut and drove him to his final resting place thomas goffs grave was the basement maintenance area of a storage garage in the east los angeles industrial district it was owned by one of the doctors former criminal counselees currently doing ten to life for a third armed robbery conviction havilland paid the taxes and sent the mans wife a quarterly check the gloomy old redbrick fortress would be his for at least another eight years it took the night tripper ten minutes to secure the gravesite rummaging through the ring of keys his counselee had given him opening up a series of double padlocked doors driving through an obstacle course of mildewed cartons and rotting lumber until he was in the pitch black bowels of the building wiping the car free of his fingerprints and retracing his steps in the dark he felt a sense of satisfaction and completion hit him harder with each padlock he snapped shut thomas goff had spent his adult life seeking the absence of light and the doctor had promised to help now he would have layer upon layer of darkness to cradle his eternity when the street door lock was fastened behind him the night tripper walked toward downtown la and shifted his thoughts to the future with goff dead he was flying solo all the file runs were his it was time to put off his current lonelies with talk of forthcoming ultimate assignments and concentrate on the acquisition of data and his possible combat with the policeman who so resembled his father crossing the third street bridge the lights of the downtown business monoliths hovering in front of him havilland thought of chess moves richard oldfield clinically insane yet superbly cautious who resembled the late thomas goff like a twin brother pawn to queen linda wilhite the hooker who fantasized snuff films and who desired a life of blissful domesticity with a big roughhewn man queen to king and finally the highly tarnished king himself detective sergeant lloyd hopkins the outsized la cop with the offthecharts iq the man of whom the alchemist had said i glommed his file because he is simply the best there is if he werent such an upfront womanizer and so outlaw in his methods hed be chief of detectives hes got close to complete autonomy within the department because the high brass knows hes the best and because they think hes slightly off his nut he was the one who closed the hollywood slaughterer case last year no one really knows what happened but the rumor is that hopkins simply went out and killed the bastard havilland replayed the words in his mind juxtaposing them with the superlative arrest record and erratic home life detailed in the folder checkmate staring deeper into the lights before him he thought of unlocking the door to his childhood void with symbolic patricide before we start i want you to read this mornings big orange insider lloyd shifted in his chair and lowered his eyes wondering if thad braverton bought his look of phony contrition their handshake had been a good start but bravertons eyes were pinpoints of barely controlled rage belying the authoritative calm of his voice martin bergens byline lloyd asked the chief of detectives shook his head no surprisingly it was written by some other cophating hack just read it hopkins the comments of one officer burnside are particularly interesting lloyd stood up and took the folded tabloid from the chief handing him his neatly typed report on the liquor storeherzog case in return sitting back down he read the insiders hyperbolized account of the shootout at brunos serendipity the threecolumn piece was written as an indictment of gunslinger justice and heavily emphasized the innocent young singles whose lives were placed in jeopardy by a triggerhappy lapd detective the concluding paragraph featured the observations of beverly hills officer carl d burnside twentyfour whose nose was in a splint from a recent jogging accident sergeant hopkins attempted to arrest his suspect in a room filled with innocent people even though he knew the guy was armed and dangerous he should have had a beverly hills officer go with him his callous disregard for the safety of beverly hills citizens is disgusting hotdog cops like hopkins give sensitive safetyconscious policemen like me a bad name lloyd stifled a burst of laughter by wadding up the tabloid and watching the chief of detectives read his report he had labored over it at home for five hours detailing his two cases from their beginnings charting their convergence step by step underlining his certainty of martin bergens innocence in jack herzogs presumed death herzogs theft of the six lapd personnel files and how the identikit man had to have seen those filesit was the only way he could have identified him as a policeman in a crowded smoky room the last page was the clincher the evidence documentation that lloyd hoped would bowl thad braverton over and save him the ignominy of departmental censure at dawn he had driven back to brunos serendipity and had bribed the two workmen cleaning up the previous nights damage into letting him make a check for expended rounds by charting approximate trajectories and scanning the walls with a flashlight he had been able to recover two flattened slugs artie cranfield and his comparison microscope had done the rest of the work delivering the irrefutable ballistics confirmation the three liquor store rounds and the two rounds extracted from the walls at brunos serendipity had been fired by the same gun thad braverton finished reading the report and fixed lloyd with a deadpan stare muted bravos hopkins i was going to suspend you but in the light of this ill let you slide with a reprimand do not ever go into another departments jurisdiction without greasing the skids with their watch commander do you understand me lloyd screwed his face into a semblance of sheepishness yes chief braverton laughed dont try to act contrite you look like a high school kid who just got laid youre the official robbery homicide supervisor on the liquor store job right right good stay on that full time im turning over the herzog case to iad theyll go at it covertly which is essential if herzog was engaged in any criminal activity i dont want it getting back to the media theyre also better equipped to check out the file angle discreetlythose security firms are big bucks and i dont want you stepping on their toes comprende lloyd flushed yes good ill set up some sort of liaison so that you and iad can compare notes whats your next move i want a fullscale effort to identify this asshole the identikit portrait is an exceptional likeness and i want every cop in the county to have a look at it heres what im thinking a closed briefing here at the center this afternoon representatives of every lapd and sheriffs division to attend no media shitheads ill get up about ten thousand copies of the ik portrait and tell the men to distribute them at their roll calls ill brief the men on my experience with the suspect and offer my observations on his psych makeup and mo every cop in la county will be looking for him once we get a positive id we can issue an apb and take it from there thad braverton slammed his desk with both palms and said youve got it ill have my secretary start phoning the various divisions immediately hows twothirty sound that will allow time for the men to go back to their stations and put out the copies before nightwatch you can take care of getting them in the meantime lloyd got to his feet and said thanks you could have given me a lot of grief but you didnt he started to walk for the door then turned around and added why braverton said you really want to know yes the chief of detectives sighed then ill tell you only four men know exactly what happened with you last year you and dutch peltz obviously and the big chief and myself im sure you know that rumors have circulated and that some cops admire you for what you did while other cops think you should be in camarillo for it i love you for what you did im a hard ass with most people but ill take a lot of shit from the people i love lloyd ducked out the door at the chiefs last words he didnt want him to see that he was a half step away from tears four hours later lloyd stood behind the lectern at the front of parker centers main briefing room staring out at what he estimated to be two hundred uniformed and plainclothes police personnel every man and woman present had been issued a manila folder upon entering the room each folder contained fifty copies of the identikit portrait of the man designated and motyped as multiple homicide suspect wm lt brn eye color unknown drives late model yellow japanese import armed with antique handgun known to frequent singles bars and use cocaine this man is the perpetrator of the april hollywood liquor store killings consider him armed and extremely dangerous when the last latearriving officers took their seats lloyd held up a copy of the los angeles times and spoke into the microphone good afternoon please give me your complete attention on page two of todays times there is an accurate report of my encounter last night with the man whose portrait you are now holding the only reason i am alive today is because this man uses a singleaction revolver i heard him cock the hammer before he fired at me and was able to avoid his first shot had he been using a more practical doubleaction weapon i would be dead lloyd let his eyes circuit the audience feeling them securely in his hand he continued after exchanging fire with me the man escaped all the hard facts regarding him are on your identikit pictures the portrait by the way is a superb likenessit was put together by an intelligent witness and was immediately confirmed by two others that is our man what i would like to add are my observations of this killer he paused and watched the assembled officers study their folders and take out pens and notepads when there was a gradual shifting of eyes to the lectern he said last week this man killed three people with clean head shots worthy of a practiced marksman last night he fired at me from a distance of ten feet and missed his four subsequent rounds were wild fired in panic i believe that this man is psychotic and will kill until he himself is killed or captured there must be a concerted effort to identify him i want these portraits distributed to every officer in la county and every trustworthy snitch he uses coke and frequents singles bars so every vice and narco officer should utilize their snitches and question their bar sources witnesses have said that he has mentioned an incredibly smart dude he knows so our suspect may have a partner i want men strongly resembling this suspect to be carefully detained for questioning at gunpoint all suspects detained should be brought to the central division jail ill be there from five oclock on with a legal officer and a stack of false arrest waivers some innocent men are going to be rousted but thats unavoidable direct all queries from police and nonpolice sources to me sergeant lloyd hopkins at central division extension fiveonenine lloyd let the officers catch up on their note taking knowing that up to now their rapt attention had been on a purely professional level clearing his throat and tapping the microphone he went straight for their purely personal jugulars ive given you ample reasons why the apprehension of this suspect is the number one police priority in southern california but ill go a notch better this man is the prime suspect in the disappearance and probable murder of a los angeles police officer lets nail the motherfucker good day it took lloyd two hours to establish a command post at the central division jails booking facility anticipating a deluge of phone calls he had first appropriated three unused telephones from the robberyhomicide clerical supply office plugging them into empty phone jacks adjacent to the jails attorney room securing an immediate hookup to the existing extension number by intimidating a series of bell telephone supervisors central division switchboard operators were instructed to screen incoming calls and give all police and civilian calls regarding the identitkit picture first priority in the event of tiedup lines any live suspects brought in were to be placed in a soundproof interrogation room walled with oneway glass once lloyds negative identification certified their innocence they were to be gently coerced into signing false arrest waivers by central divisions ad hoc legal officer a patrolman who had graduated law school but had failed the california bar exam four times the detainee would then be driven back to his point of arrest and released lloyd settled in for a long tour of duty setting out notepads and sharpened pencils for jotting information and a large thermos of coffee for fuel when his brain wound down every angle had been covered the two officers working under him on the liquor store case had been yanked from their current duties and told to compile a list of all singles bars in the lapds jurisdiction once this was accomplished they were to phone vice squad commanders citywide and have them deploy surveillance teams watch commanders had been instructed to highlight the identikit man at evening roll call and to order all units to approach all suspects with their pump riot guns if the ik man was on the street there was a good chance of taking him but not alive lloyd thought ruffling through the false arrest forms on his desk he knew that his killer would not give up without a fight and that on this night the odds of innocent blood being spilled were at their optimum a panicky overeager cop might fire on a halfdrunk and belligerent businessman who resembled the ik suspect an overly cautious officer might approach a yellow jap import with a placating smile and get that smile blown off his face by a hollow point the detainidentifyrelease approach was desperationany experienced homicide dick would know it implicitly at six oclock the first call came in lloyd guessed the source immediately nightwatch units had been on the street for an hour and scores of patrolmen had been putting out the word to their snitches he was right a selfdescribed righteous dope dealer was the caller the man told lloyd how he was certain the liquor store killer was a nigger with a dye job who wasted the three people as part of a black power conspiracy he then went on to offer his definition of black power four coons pushing a cadillac into a gas station for fifty cents worth of gas lloyd told the man that his definition would have been amusing in and hung up more calls followed lloyd juggled the three phone lines sifting through the ramblings of drunks dopers and jilted lovers writing down every piece of information that issued from a reasonably coherent voice the offerings were of the third and fourthhand varietysomeone who knew someone who said that someone saw or knew or felt this or that it was in all probability a labyrinth of misinformation but it had to be written down at ten after four hours on the phones lloyd had filled up one entire legal pad all with nonpolice input he was beginning to despair of ever again dealing with a fellow professional when a pair of callowlooking newton street division patrolmen brought in the nights first hard suspect a railthin sixfootsix blonde youth in his early twenties the officers acted as though they had death by the tail each of them clasping a whiteknuckled hand around the suspects biceps lloyd took one look at the terrified trio said take off the cuffs and handed the youth a false arrest waiver he signed it as lloyd told the officers to take their killer wherever he wanted and to buy him a bottle of booze on the way the three young men departed try to stay alive lloyd called after them within the next two hours three reasonable suspect facsimiles were brought in two by hollywood division patrol teams one by sheriffs detectives working out of the san dimas substation each time lloyd shook his head said cut him loose and forcefed the suspect a hard look a waiver and a pen each time they signed willingly lloyd imagined them envisioning every innocent man falsely imprisoned movie ever made as they hurriedly scrawled their names midnight came and went the calls dwindled lloyd switched from coffee to chewing gum when his stomach started to rumble thinking that the twelve oclock change of watch would allow him a hiatus from the phones he settled back in his chair and let the normal jail noises cut through his caffeine fatigue and lull him into a half sleep full sleep was approaching when a voice jerked him awake sergeant hopkins lloyd swiveled his chair an lapd motorcycle officer was standing in front of him holding an r ampi computer printout im confrey rampart motor the officer said i just came on duty and saw your id kit want i popped a guy who looks exactly like it last month jaywalking warrants i remembered him because he had this weirdness about him i got his r ampi sheet and his dmv record theres a mug shot from my warrant bust lloyd took the sheet and slipped off the mugshot strip the identikit man jumped out at him every plane and angle of his face coming into focus like a paintbynumbers portrait finally completed is it him confrey whispered lloyd said yes and stared at the fullface and profile shots of the man who had almost killed him trembling as he read the cold facts that described a monster thomas lewis goff wm dob brn blu pres add melbourne la crim rec ny state agg asslt arrstdiss convst deg auto theftsent yrs paroled calif state failure to appbail paid calif dr lic vehic toyota sed yellow lic jle no mov viol lloyd put the printout down and said whos the morning watch boss at rampart confrey stammered lulieutenant praeger good call him up and tell him weve got the big one on melbourne and hillhurst hold him for me ill be right back while confrey made the call lloyd ran down the hall to the central division armory and grabbed an ithaca pump and box of shells from the duty officer when he returned to the jail area confrey handed him the phone and whispered talk slow the loot is an edgy type lloyd took a deep breath and spoke into the mouthpiece lieutenant this is hopkins robberyhomicide can you set something up for me yes a taut voice answered tell me what you need i need a half dozen unmarked units to check the area around melbourne and hillhurst for a yellow nineteeneighty toyota license jle ohthreefive no approachsit on it i need the thirtyone hundred block of melbourne sealed at both ends in exactly forty minutes i want five experienced squad room dicks to meet me at melbourne and hillhurst in exactly forty minutes tell them to wear vests and to bring shotguns have them bring a vest for me i want no blackandwhites inside the area can you implement this now lloyd didnt wait for an answer he handed the phone back to confrey and ran for his car by zigzagging through traffic and running red lights lloyd made it to melbourne and hillhurst in twenty minutes no other unmarked cruisers were yet on the scene but he could feel the too perfect silence that preceded impending explosions all around him he knew that the silence would soon be broken by approaching headlights twoway radio crackle and the hum of powerful engines held at idle last name introductions and his orders would follow leaving nothing but the explosion itself parking under a streetlamp at the edge of the intersection lloyd turned on his emergency flashers as a signal to the other officers and jacked shells into his shotgun pumping one into the chamber and setting the choke on full grabbing his flashlight he walked down melbourne staying close to the trees that bordered the sidewalk grateful that there were no late night strollers or dog walkers out the street was a solid mass of twostory apartment buildings identical in their sideways exposures and secondstory landings threeoneninethree was in the middle of the block a dark gray stucco with wroughtiron railings and recessed door without screens lloyd flashed his light on the bank of mailboxes at the front of the building t goffapt true to the r ampi printout he counted mail slots then stepped back and counted the doorways themselves playing his beam over them to illuminate the numerals embossed at eye level ten units five up five down apartment six was the first unit on the second story lloyd shivered when he saw muted light glowing behind drawn curtains he walked back to hillhurst scanning parked cars en route no yellow toyotas were stationed at curbside when he got to the intersection he found it blocked off by sawhorse detour signs affixed with blinking red lights radio static broke the silence followed by hoarse whispers lloyd squinted and saw three unmarked matadors parked crossways behind the barricade he blinked his flashlight at the closest one getting a double blink in return then there was the opening of car doors and five men wearing bulletproof vests and holding shotguns were standing in front of him hopkins lloyd said getting henderson martinez penzler monroe and olander in return a vest was handed to him he slipped into it and said vehicle five negative head shakes answered him at once one of the officers added no yellow toyotas in an eight block radius lloyd shrugged no matter the target building is halfway down the block second story light on henderson and i are going in the door martinez and penzler you stand point downstairs monroe and olander you hold a bead on the back window feeling a huge grin take over his face he bowed and whispered now gentlemen the men formed a wedge and ran down melbourne to when they were on the sidewalk in front of the building lloyd pointed to the first upstairs back window the only one on the second story burning a light monroe and olander nodded and hung back as martinez and penzler automatically took up their positions at the bottom of the stairs lloyd nudged henderson with his gun butt and gestured upwards whispering opposite sides of the door one kick with lloyd at the lead they tiptoed up the stairs and fanned out to cover both sides of the door to apartment henderson put his ear to the doorjamb and formed nothing with his lips and tongue lloyd nodded and stepped back and raised his shotgun henderson took up an identical position beside him both men raised their right feet simultaneously and kicked out at the same instant the door burst inward ripped loose at both sides dangling from one remaining hinge lloyd and henderson pressed into the wall at the sound of the implosion listening for reflex movement within the apartment hearing nothing but the creaking of the door they stepped inside lloyd would never forget what he saw while henderson ran ahead to check the other rooms he stood in the doorway unable to take his eyes from the nightmare hieroglyphics that surrounded him on all sides the living room walls were painted dark brown the ceiling was painted black taped across the walls were photographs of nude men obviously clipped from gay porno books the bodies were composites formed of mismatching torsos heads and genital areas the figures linked by magazine photos of antique handguns each collage had a slogan above it block printed in contrasting yellow paint chaos redux deaths kingdom charnel kong and blitzkrieg lloyd studied the printing two of the slogans were in an unmistakable lefthanders slant the other two in a straight up righthanded motion squinting at the wall area around the cutouts he saw that they were bracketed by abrasive powder wipe marks he ran his fingers over the walls in random circles a film of white powder stuck to them like jack herzogs apartment this place had been professionally secured against latent print identification henderson came up behind lloyd startling him jesus sarge you ever see anything like it lloyd said yes very softly where lloyd shook his head no dont ask me again what are the other rooms like like a normal pad except for the colors of the wall and ceiling paint all the surfaces have been wiped though ajax or some shit like that this motherfucker is whacked out but smart lloyd walked to the door and looked out martinez and penzler were still stationed downstairs and there was as yet no general awakening of the other tenants he turned and said to henderson go round up the other men then wake up the citizens he handed him the mugshot strip of thomas goff and added show this to every person and ask them when they saw the bastard last bring anyone whos seen him in the past twentyfour hours to me henderson nodded and went downstairs lloyd counted to ten to clear his mind of any preconceived notions of what he should look for and let his eyes take a quick inventory of the living room thinking darkness beyond the aesthetic limits of the most avant garde interior decorator black naugahyde sofa charcoal gray deeppile rug black plasticene hightech coffee table the curtains were a thick olive drab velour capable of shutting out the brightest sunlight and the one floor lamp was sheathed in black plastic the overall effect was one of containment although the living room was spacious for a small apartment the absence of color gave it a stiflingly claustrophobic weight lloyd felt like he was enclosed in the palm of an angry fist in reflex against the feeling he slipped off his bulletproof vest surprised to find that he was drenched in sweat the kitchen and bathroom were extensions of the darkness motif every wall appliance and fixture had been brushstroked with a thick coat of black enamel paint lloyd scrutinized potential printsustaining surfaces every square inch had been wiped he walked into the bedroom it was the disarrayed heart of the angry fist a small black rectangle almost completely eclipsed at floor level by a large box spring and mattress covered by a purple velour bedspread lloyd stripped the bedspread off the dark blue patterned sheets were crumpled and rank with sweat male clothing varied in color was strewn across them squatting to examine it he saw that the pants and shirts were stylish and expensive and conformed in size to thomas goffs dimensions an overturned cardboard box lay next to the front of the bed upending it lloyd sifted through a top layer of male toiletries and a second layer of paperback science fiction novels coming to a tightly wedged stack of battered record albums on the bottom he thumbed through them reading the titles on the jackets dozens of albums by the beatles rolling stones and jefferson airplane all bearing the block printed warning beware property of tom goff hands off beware lloyd held two albums up and examined the printing it was righthand formed and identical to the printing on the living room walls smiling at the confirmation he read through the remaining records knowing that the common denominator of goffs musical taste was the s going cold when he saw a garish album entitled doctor john the night tripperbayou dreams lloyd studied the jacket a frizzyhaired white man wearing red satin bell bottoms was honking a saxophone at a snarling alligator the song titles listed on the back were the typical sixties dope sex and rebellion pap almost nostalgic in their naivete putting the album down he wondered if it were a herzoggoff link beyond general aesthetic strangenessa link that could be plumbed for evidence there was a rapping on the wall behind him lloyd stood up and turned around seeing henderson and a small man in a terrycloth bathrobe the man was casting unbelieving eyes over the black walls mashing shaky hands together inside the pockets of his robe this guys the manager sarge said he saw our buddy this afternoon lloyd smiled at the man my names hopkins whats yours fred pellegrino whos going to pay for my busted door and this crazy paint job your insurance company lloyd said when did you see thomas goff last fred pellegrino pulled rosary beads from his pocket and fondled them around five oclock he was carrying a suitcase he smiled at me and hotfooted it out to the street see you soon he said you didnt ask him where he was going fuck no hes paid up three months in advance was he alone yeah how long has he lived here about a year and a half or so good tenant the best no noise no complaints always paid his rent on time did he pay by check no always cash job he said he was selfemployed what about his friends what friends i never seen him with nobody what if my insurance company dont pay for this batshit paint job lloyd ignored pellegrino and motioned henderson over to the far side of the room what did the other tenants have to say he asked the same spiel as pops henderson said nice quiet solitary fellow who never said much besides good morning or good night and no one else has seen him today no one else has seen the scumbag in the past week this is depressing i wanted to eightysix the copkiller motherfucker didnt you lloyd gave a noncommittal shrug and took goffs r ampi printout from his pocket he handed it to henderson and said go back to rampart and give this to praeger apb all police network tell him to add armed and extremely dangerous and has lefthanded male partner and to call the new york state police and have them wire me all their existing info on goff tell pellegrino that im spending the night here as a safety precaution and shoo him back to his pad youre gonna crash here henderson was slackjawed with disbelief lloyd stared at him thats right so move it henderson walked away shaking his head taking a pliant fred pellegrino by the arm and leading him out of the apartment when they were gone lloyd walked to the landing and looked down on the knot of people milling in the driveway bulletproof vested cops with shotguns were assuring pajamaclad civilians that everything was going to be all right after a few minutes the scene dispersed the citizens walking back to their dwellings the cops to their unmarked matadors when henderson pointed a finger at his head and twirled it then pointed upstairs lloyd dragged the sofa over to the devastated front door and barricaded himself in to think two divergent cases had merged into one and had now yielded one known perpetrator and one accomplice an unknown quantity whose only known crime thus far was defacing rented property with an apb in effect and iad covering the personnel file angle his job was to deduce thomas goffs behavior and go where less intelligent cops wouldnt think to look lloyd let his eyes circuit the living room knowing that it would merge with another horror chamber the very second he closed them knowing that it was essential to juxtapose the imagery and see what emerged he did it shuddering against the memory of teddy verplancks baywindowed apartment deciding that it was worse because he had known the extent of the hollywood slaughterers carnage and that he was driving to be destroyed thomas goffs home bespoke a more subtle drivethe drive of a seasoned street criminal who had very probably not been arrested for anything since a man with a partner who might well be a restraining influence a man who spread his insanity all over his walls and walked away saying see you soon a few hours ahead of a massive police dragnet lloyd walked through the apartment again letting little observations snap into place and work in concert with his instincts the photos of nude men and guns spoke homosexual but somehow that seemed wrong there was no telephone which confirmed goff as a basic loner the lack of dishes cooking utensils and food were typical of exconvicts men who were used to being served and who often developed a craving for cafeteria food the incredible darkness of the rooms was sheer insanity all indicators pointing to the enormous question of motive lloyd had almost completed his runthrough of the apartment when he noticed a builtin wall cupboard in the hall between the living room and bedroom it had been painted over like the rest of the wall but cracks in the paint by the wooden opener knob indicated that it had been put to use he swung the cupboard door open and recoiled when he saw what was affixed to the back there was a magazine cutout of a blue uniformed policeman with his hands upraised as if to placate an attacker surrounding the cop were outsized porno book penises studded with large metal staples a circle of handgun cutouts framed the scene and square in the middle of the cops chest was a gluedon white paper facsimile of an lapd badge complete with a drawing of city hall the words police officer and the number lloyd slammed the cupboard with his fist jack herzogs badge number burned in front of his eyes he tore the door off by the hinges and hurled it into the living room just then pennys owe what daddy hit him like a pile driver and he knew that getting thomas goff would be the closeout on all his debts of grief the night tripper stared at the stunning female beauty that now adorned the walls of his outer office thomas goffs surveillance photographs of linda wilhite were blown up and framed behind glass woman bait that would lure his policemanadversary into a trap that would be sprung by his own sexual impulses the doctor walked into his private office and thought of how he had planned over a decade in advance creating a series of buffers that would prevent anyone from knowing that he and thomas goff had ever met he had destroyed goffs file at castleford hospital he had even stolen his prison file while visiting attica on a psychiatric seminar returning it three weeks later altered to show a straight noparole release he had never been seen with goff and they had always communicated via pay phones the only possible connection was several times removedthrough his lonelies all of whom goff had recruited if the manhunt for his former executive officer received pervasive media play one of them might snap to a newspaper or tv photograph accompanied by scare rhetoric yet even that avenue of discovery was probably closed havilland thought picking up the morning editions of the la times and la examiner there was no further mention of the shootout at brunos serendipity and no mention of the late night raid on goffs apartment if hopkins had initiated some sort of media stonewall to keep a lid of secrecy on his investigation then his complicity in his own destruction would reach epic proportions the night tripper trembled as he recalled the past thirtysix hours and his acts of courage after disposing of goffs body he had walked through downtown la thinking of the probable course of events that had led hopkins to at least identify goff at the level of physical description one thing emerged as a reasonable certainty it was the alchemists disappearance and presumed death not the liquor store killings that had led the policeman to goff goff and herzog had spent a good deal of time together at bars and some perceptive witness had probably provided hopkins with the description that took him to brunos serendipity thus hours later after he had smeared goffs walls with homosexual bait he had left the albums that goff had stashed at castleford in seventyone and added the touch that would arouse hopkins cop rectitude pique his rage with the faggot image of the alchemist pique his brain with the wipe marks diverse script styles and goffs old copy of bayou dreams the most thrilling act of courage had been in implementing richard oldfield dressing him in a bulky sweater that downplayed his musculature and a tweed cap that was very much in thomas goffs style yet shielded his upper face and nongoff haircut he had pumped him up for hours promising him his very own handpicked victim as his ultimate assignment then had watched from a parked rental car across the street as oldfield went through his impersonation perfectly fooling goffs landlord dead to rights with hopkins and his dragnet only hours away havilland unlocked his desk drawer and dug out the junior miss cosmetics file he had been studying hoping that fresh work and thoughts of the future would quiet the sense of excitement that made him want to live in the hours just past it didnt help he kept recalling the flashlights approaching and how he knew that he was now inside the police cordon how he had hunkered down in the car seat and had heard the officers repeat goffs license number over and over one of them whispering that crazy lloyd was leading the raid his partner replying with something about crazy lloyd going after that hollywood psycho with a thirtyoughtsix and a fortyfour mag when the raid itself transpired a half hour later he could see hopkins across the street holding a shotgun much taller than any of the men he led looking exactly like his father it had taken monumental selfcontrol to drive away from the scene without confronting the policeman face to face with an effort the night tripper returned to the cosmetics file reading notations on the life and sleazy times of the woman who he was certain would become his next pawn sherry shroeder was a thirtyoneyearold former assembly line worker at junior miss cosmetics recently fired for stealing chemicals used in the manufacture of angel dust it had been her fourth and final pilfering arrest within the company resulting in her dismissal under threats of criminal prosecution daniel murray the lapd captain who moonlighted as the junior miss security chief had made her sign a confession and had told her that it would not be submitted to the police if she signed a waiver stating that she would not apply for unemployment benefits or workmens compensation her three previous arrests had been resolved through daniel murrays coercion sherry shroeder was a frequent costar of low budget pornographic films murray had obtained a print of one of her features and had threatened to show it to her parents should she fail to return the chemicals she had stolen sherry agreed eager to retain her fourdollaranhour job and spare her parents the grief of viewing her performance there was no photograph attached to the folder but her vital statistics of fiveseven blonde hair and blue eyes were enticing enough there was a final notation in the file stating that since her dismissal sherry shroeder had been seen almost daily in the bars across the street from junior miss drinking with her former fellow employees and turning tricks in the back of her van on paydays havilland wrote down sherry shroeders address and phone number and put it in his pocket relieved that his next move was ready to be implemented he let his thoughts return to lloyd hopkins making a spur of the moment decision that felt uncommonly sound if the policeman didnt come his way within fortyeight hours he would initiate the confrontation himself after a twentyfour hour stint of robberyhomicide conferences and paper chasing at parker center lloyd drove to century city to grasp at the wildest of straws getting honest with himself en route his investigation was stymied every cop in southern california was shaking the trees for thomas goff and he the supervising officer and legendary big brain did not yet have a psychological mockup to work from if he could use the legendary criminal shrinks nickname as his entree he could probably interest him in the goff case and get him to offer his observations it was slim but at least it was movement the twentyfour hours at the center had yielded nothing but negative feedback the new york state police had reacted promptly to his inquiry on thomas goff issuing the lapd a teletype that ran to six pages lloyd learned that goff was a sadist who picked women up in bars seduced and then beat them that he liked to steal late model convertibles that he had no known associates and was given a noparole release from attica most likely a bureaucratic stratagem to encourage his departure from new york state the days major frustration had been at a late afternoon conference in thad bravertons office where the chief of detectives had read a strongly worded memo from the big chief stating that there was to be a total media blackout on the goff case for reasons of public safety lloyd had laughed aloud then had sat fuming as braverton and his old nemesis captain fred gaffaney of iad gave him the fisheye he knew that public safety translated to public relations and that the media kibosh was undertaken out of apprehension regarding jack herzogs possible criminal activities and his relationship with the disgraced cop marty bergen the icing on that cake was the industrial firms and the brass hats who were moonlighting for them it would not do to step on their toes a media blitz might flush goff out but the department was covering its ass lloyd parked in a subterranean facility on olympic and century park east then took an elevator up to ground level and found the shrinks building a glass and steel skyscraper fronted by an astroturf courtyard the directory in the foyer placed john havilland md in suite lloyd took a glassencased elevator to the twentysixth floor and walked down a long hallway to an oak door embossed with the psychiatrists name he pushed the door open expecting to be confronted by the saccharine smile of a medical receptionist instead he was transfixed by photographic images of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen she was obviously tall and slender with classic facial lines offset by little flaws that made her that much more striking that much less the trite physical ideal her nose was a shade too pointed her chin bore a middle cleft that gave her whole face an air of resoluteness dark hair cascaded at the edge of soft cheekbones and formed a complement with large eyes whose focus was intense but somehow indecipherable walking up to the wall to examine the photographs at close range lloyd saw that they were candid shots and that much more stunning for the fact closing his eyes he tried to picture the woman nude when new images wouldnt coalesce he knew why her beauty rendered all attempts at fantasy stillborn this woman demanded to be seen naked in reality or not at all shes exquisite isnt she the words didnt dent lloyds reverie he opened his eyes and saw and heard and felt nothing but the feminine power captured in front of him when he felt a tap on his shoulder he turned around and saw a slight man in a navy blazer and gray flannel slacks staring up at him hand outstretched light brown eyes amused by his reaction to the photographs im john havilland the man said what can i do for you lloyd snapped back into a professional posture taking the mans hand and grasping it firmly detective sergeant hopkins los angeles police department could i have a few minutes of your time dr john havilland smiled and said sure well go into my office he pointed toward an oak door and added ive got over half an hour until my next session youre blushing sergeant but i dont blame you lloyd said who is she a counselee of mine havilland said sometimes i think shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen i was thinking the same thing what does she think about being your pinup girl havillands cheeks reddened lloyd saw that the man was smitten beyond the bounds of professionalism forget i asked doctor ill keep it to business from here on in the doctor lowered his eyes and led lloyd into an oak paneled inner office pointing him to a chair taking an identical seat a few feet away raising his eyes he said is this personal or an official police inquiry lloyd stared openly at the psychiatrist when havilland didnt flinch he realized that he was in the company of an equal its both doctor the starting point is your nickname i havilland was already shaking his head its a secondhand nickname he said doctor john the night tripper was a sixties rock and roller i was given the monicker in med school because my name was john and i did a certain amount of night tripping ive also counseled a great many criminals court referred and otherwise these people have perpetuated the nickname frankly i like it lloyd smiled and said it does have a certain ring he dug two snapshots out of his jacket pocket and handed them to havilland have you ever counseled either of these men the doctor looked at the photos and handed them back no i havent who are they lloyd ignored the question and said if you had treated them would you have told me havilland formed his fingers into a steeple and placed the point on his chin i would have given you a yes or no answer then asked why do you want to know good direct answer lloyd said ill reciprocate the lighthaired man recently walked into a liquor store and blew three people to shit the darkhaired man is an la policeman missing and presumed dead before he disappeared he was hysterical and obsessed with your nickname im certain that the lighthaired man killed him old lighthair is a worldclass psycho two days ago we shot it out in a beverly hills singles bar you probably read about it in the papers he escaped i want to cancel his ticket atascadero or the morgue preferably the latter lloyd leaned back and loosened his necktie chagrined that he had raised his voice and probably blown his professional parity with the psychiatrist he felt a headache coming on and shut his eyes to forestall it when he opened his eyes dr john havilland was beaming from ear to ear and shaking his head in delight i love macho sergeant its one of my weak points as a headshrinker since weve established a certain base of candor can i ask a few candid questions lloyd grinned shoot doc all right one did you honestly think that i knew these two men lloyd shook his head no then is it safe to assume that you came to exploit my renowned knowledge of criminal behavior lloyds grin widened yes the doctor grinned back good ill be glad to offer my observations but will you phrase your case or questions or whatever nonhypothetically give me the literal information as succinctly as possible then let me ask questions lloyd said youve got it then walked to the window and looked down on the street twentysix stories below him with his back to the doctor he spoke for ten uninterrupted minutes recounting a streamlined version of the herzoggoff investigation excluding mention of the security files and herzogs relationship with marty bergen but describing the melbourne avenue horror show in detail when he concluded the doctor whispered god what a story why hasnt there been mention of this man goff on tv wouldnt that help flush him out turning to face havilland lloyd said the high brass have ordered a total media blackout public safety public relations take your picki dont want to go into it also my options are dwindling i havent got the slightest handle on goffs partner the apb is hit or miss ill be staking out some bars myself but thats needle in a haystack stuff if i dont get any leads soon ill have to fly to new york and interview people who knew goff there which frankly seems futile run with the ball doc what im interested in are your assumptions on goffs relationship with his partner and the condition of his apartment what do you think havilland got up and paced the room lloyd sat down and watched him circuit the office finally the doctor stopped and said i buy your appraisal of goffs basic psychoses and the lefthanded man as a restraining influence but only to a degree also i dont think that the men are homosexual lovers despite the symbolism of the wall cutouts i think youre dealing with subliminally exposited false clues the nude men and the slogans especially the slogans are reminiscent of the sixtiesmaybe goff and his friend were inspired by the sloganeering of the manson family i think that the leftbehind record albums point to the subliminality of the subterfuge because every single record was some kind of sixties musical archetype the apartment was cleaned out thoroughly yet these albums were left behind that strikes me as odd now one thing is obviousgoffs cover was blown after his gunplay with you he knew he had to run that he would be positively identified very soon so his friend wiped the walls to eliminate his own fingerprints probably after goff had vacatedbut he didnt remove the cutouts because they pointed only to goffs psychoses he didnt see the cupboard cutout that bore the missing officers badge number because it was an inside surface that he himself had never touched and because he didnt know that goff had created it the other wall clues could be construed as ambiguous but not the cupboard cutout it pointed to the murder of a los angeles policeman had goffs friend known of it he would have destroyed it what do you think sergeant riveted by the brilliantly informed hypothesis lloyd said it floats on all levels i was thinking along similar lines but you took it two steps further can you wrap the whole package up for me the doctor sat down facing lloyd drawing his chair up so that their knees were almost touching he said i think that the basic motivational clues subliminal and overt are the nude men which represent not homosexual tendencies but a desire to destroy male power i think that goffs friend is highly disturbed while goff himself is psychotic i think both men are highly intelligent highly motivated pathological cop haters lloyd let the words sink in retaining eye contact with the doctor the thesis was sound but what was the next investigative step finally havilland lowered his eyes and spoke id like to help you sergeant i have lots of informed criminal sources my own minigrapevine so to speak id appreciate it lloyd said taking a business card from his jacket pocket this has my office and home numbers on it you can call me regardless of the time he handed havilland the card havilland pocketed it and said could i have that picture of goff id like to show it to some of my counselees lloyd nodded dont mention that goff is a homicide suspect he said as he placed the snapshot in the doctors hand try to sound casual if your patients think this is a big deal they might try to exploit the situation for money or favors of course havilland said its the only professional way to do it by the same token let me state this flat out i cannot and will not jeopardize the anonymity of my sources under any circumstances i wouldnt expect you to good what will you do next hit the bricks chew on your thesis go over the existing paperwork forty or fifty times until something bites me havilland laughed i hope the bite wont be fatal you know its funny all of a sudden you look very grave and just like my father bad thoughts lloyd laughed until his sides ached and tears ran down his cheeks havilland chuckled along forming a series of steeples with his fingers regaining his breath lloyd said god that feels good i was laughing at how ironic your question was for a solid week ive had nothing but homicide on my brain but when you said bad thoughts i was thinking of that incredible woman on your walls laughing wildly himself the doctor blurted out linda wilhite has that effect on a man she can tur he caught himself in midsentence stopped and said she can move men to the point of wanting to speak her name out loud forget what i said hopkins my counselees anonymity is sacred it was unprofessional of me lloyd got to his feet thinking that the poor bastard was in love beyond rhyme or reason with a woman who probably caused traffic jams when she walked down the street to buy a newspaper he smiled and stuck out his hand when havilland took it he said i do unprofessional things all the time doc guys with our kind of juice should fuck up once in a while out of noblesse oblige thanks for your help dr john havilland smiled lloyd walked out of his office willing his eyes rigid away from the photographs of linda wilhite the night tripper began to hyperventilate the very second that lloyd hopkins walked out his door the suppressed tension that had fueled his performance his brilliant performance started to seep out through his pores causing him to shiver uncontrollably and grab at his desk to fight his vertigo he held the desktop until his knuckles turned white and cramps ran up his arms to his shoulders concentrating on his own physiology to bring his control back to normal he calculated his heartbeat at one twentyfive and his blood pressure as stratospheric this professional detachment in the face of extreme fearelation calmed and soothed him within seconds he could feel his vital signs recede to something approaching normalcy father father father dr john havilland whispered when his physical and mental calm united the doctor replayed his performance and assessed the policeman astonished to find that he was not the rightwing plunderer he had expected but rather a likable fellow with a sense of humor that was offset by the violence he held in check just below the surface of his intellect lloyd hopkins was a bad man to fuck with so was he he had taken their first round easily running on instinct round two would have to be meticulously planned checking his desk calendar the doctor saw that he had no patients for the rest of the day and that linda wilhites next session was still two days off thoughts of linda spawned a long series of mental chess moves hopkins would be leaving for new york unless he discovered evidence to keep him in los angeles it would not do to have crazy lloyd talk to the administrators at attica round two would have to be initiated today but how just then it hit him at their first session linda had spoken of a client who collected colombian art and who took nude photos of her and hung them in his bedroom another pawn havilland opened the wall safe hidden behind his edward hopper original and took out thomas goffs verbatim transcription of lindas john bookjournal he sifted through pages of sexual facts figures and ruminations before he found mention of the man stanley rudolph montana at bundy referred by pn a truly ambivalent man he lives in a condo full of colombian art aesthetic that he claims he buys dirt cheap from doper ripoff bimbos macho obnoxiousness the statues were atavistic virile wonderful stanley talks them up so much prior to business that i know he wants something other than straight fuckingespecially when he starts calling me a work of fucking art lead in to of course a photography session reading between the linesstan baby is impotent digs nudie shots juxtaposed against his phallic statues stan takes his shots no beaversactually tastefulstan the aesthetethen tells me stories about all the women who beg for his donkey dick stan the macho buffoon i lounge around nude trying to keep from cracking up ambivalent stan has become a regular at per i am now framed on his walls in naked splendor weird i wish my breasts were bigger havilland replaced the transcript in his safe and thought of another faceless pawn living a sleazy life in the valley industrial district then locked up his office and went looking for her junior miss cosmetics was situated at the northeast edge of the san fernando valley a squat green stucco building enclosed by rusted cyclone fencing outside the wire perimeter was a huge dirt lot filled with carelessly parked cars and across the street stood an entire city block of cocktail lounges all of them flashing neon signs at three oclock in the afternoon parking underneath a sign advertising nude workingmans lunch dr john havilland felt like he had just entered hell the doctor locked his car and counted neon blinking doorways all the way up the block ending with a total of nine he walked into the first door wincing against a blast of country western music squinting until he could make out a bandstand and an overweight redhead doing a listless nude boogie there was a horseshoeshaped bar off to his left steeling himself for his role havilland took a twenty dollar bill from his money clip and walked over the bartender looked up as he approached you drinking or you want the lunch he asked havilland placed the twenty flat on the bar and willed his voice to suit the environment im looking for sherry shroeder a buddy of mine says she hangs out here sherrys eightysix the bartender said she gets coked or juiced and gets rowdy you looking to pour some pork the doctor gawked then said what the bartender spoke slowly as if to an idiot child you know push the bush slake the snake drain the train siphon the python havilland swallowed and took another twenty from his pocket yes all those things where can i find her please tell me snatching up the two bills the bartender leaned over and spoke into the doctors ear go down the street to the loafer gopher sherry should show up there sooner or later sit at the bar and sooner or later shell come up and try to sit on your face and buddy keep your roll to yourself they got some righteous shitkickers down there the loafer gopher was dark and featured punk rock havilland sat at the bar and sipped scotch and soda while cindy and the sinners sang their repertoire of prison of your love nine inches of your love and gimme your love over and over he arrayed a stack of one dollar bills in front of him and tried to avoid eye contact with the topless barmaid who considered eyetoeye meetings a signal to refresh drinks playing mozart in his mind to kill the hideous music and conversation surrounding him the doctor waited the waiting extended into hours havilland sat at the bar buying a drink every twenty minutes nursing the top then unseen dumping the rest on the floor when mental mozart began to pall he fantasized sherry shroeder as everything from a nordic ice maiden to a platinumcoiffed slattern using her security file statistics as his physical spark point he was nearing the limits of both his patience and imagination when coy fingers caressed his neck and a coy female voice asked care to buy a lady a drink havilland swiveled his stool to face the comeon the woman who had delivered it looked like a burnedout beach bunny her face was seamed from too much sun and chemical ingestion with deep furrows around the mouth and eyes that bespoke many desperate attempts to be fetching and an equal number of rejections her blonde hair was set in a lopsided frizzy style that added to her look of anxiousness but her features were pretty and her designer jean and tanktopclad body was lean and womanly if this was his actress richard oldfield would love her im sherry the woman said havilland signaled the barmaid and smiled at his pawn im lloyd she giggled as the barmaid placed a tall drink in front of her and grabbed two of the doctors one dollar bills as payment she took a long sip and said thats a good name it goes with your blazer you dont really dress for the gopher but thats okay cause theres so many bars on this strip that you cant go home and change every time you hop one can you i mean is that the truth thats the truth havilland said i dress conservatively because the bigwigs at the studio demand it im just like you i cant go home and change every time i go out on a talent search sherrys eyes widened she gulped the rest of her drink and stammered ararare you an agent im an independent movie producer havilland said snapping his fingers at the barmaid and pointing to sherrys empty glass i sell art movies to a combine of millionaires who screen the films in their special screening rooms as a matter of fact im here looking for actresses sherry downed her fresh drink in three fast swallows havilland watched her eyes expand and bodice flush im an actress she said in a rush of breath ive done extra work and ive done loops and other stuff do you think you havilland silenced her with a finger to her lips then looked around the bar no one seemed interested in their business lets go outside and talk he said this place is too loud sherry led him across the street to the junior miss parking lot and her battered vw van i used to work there she said as she unlocked the passenger door they fired me because i was overqualified they found out i had a bigger iq than the president of the company so they let me go havilland sat down in the passenger seat and made a mental note not to touch anything inside the vehicle sherry walked around the front of the van and squeezed in behind the wheel when she looked at him importuningly the doctor said sherry ill be frank i produce highbudget adult films normally i would not advise a serious young actress like yourself to appear in such a movie but in this case i wouldbecause only a private audience of hollywood bigshots will be viewing it now let me ask you have you had experience in adult films sherrys answer came out in a ginfueled torrent of words yeah and this is perfect because before i did loops and the camera guy said my mom and dad would never know we shot in the boys gym at pacoima junior high cause the camera guy knew the janitor and he had the key and we had to shoot late at night cause then nobody would be around ritchie valens went to pacoima junior high but he got killed with buddy holly on february i was just a little girl then but i remember the final memory numbed the doctor he took out his billfold and said well be shooting in two days or so at a big house in the hollywood hills two performersyou and a very handsome young man your pay is a thousand dollars would you like an advance now sherry shroeder threw her arms around havilland and buried her head in his neck when he felt her tongue in his ear he grabbed her shoulders and pushed her away please sherry im married sherry gave a mock pout married men are the best can i have a cnote now havilland took three hundreds from his billfold he handed them to sherry and whispered please keep quiet about this if word gets out other actresses will be bothering me for parts and i think i want to stick with you exclusively all right all right havilland smiled i need your phone number sherry reached in the glove compartment then flicked on the dashboard light and handed the doctor a red metallic flaked business card bearing the words sherrylets party incall and outcall havilland put the card in his pocket and nudged the passenger door open with his shoulder he smiled and said ill be in touch sherry said party hearty lloyd baby and gunned her engine the doctor watched the vw van peel rubber into the night the night tripper drove to a pay phone and called richard oldfield at his home speaking a single sentence and hanging up before oldfield could reply satisfied with the force of his words he drove to the hollywood hills and his third stellar performance of the day oldfield had left the front door unlocked the night tripper walked through it to find his pawn kneeling on the living room floor in his efficacy training posture head thrust out and eyes closed hands clasped behind his back he was stripped to the waist and his pectoral muscles were twitching from a recent workout havilland walked up and flung a whiplike backhand at oldfields face gashing his cheek with his harvard signet ring oldfield leaned into the blow and remained mute havilland reared back and swung again catching his pawn on the bridge of the nose ripping flesh and severing a vein below his left eye when oldfield betrayed no pain the doctor unleashed a whirlwind of open palms and backhands until his pawns face contorted and a single tear escaped from each eye and merged with the blood from his lashings are you ready to hurt and twist and loathe and gouge the woman who ruined you as a child the night tripper hissed are you ready to go as far as you can go are you ready to enter a realm of pure power and relegate the rest of the world to the shit heap that it really is yes richard oldfield sobbed the doctor took a silk handkerchief from his blazer pocket and swabbed his counselees face then you shall have all of it now listen and dont ask questions the time is two days from now the place is here dont go out of the house until i tell you because a policeman is looking for someone who looks exactly like you do you understand all these things yes oldfield said havilland walked to the phone and dialed seven digits he had memorized early that afternoon when a weary voice answered yes he said sergeant this is john havilland listen ive got a line on your suspect its rather vague but i think i credit the information jesus fucking christ lloyd hopkins said where did you get it no havilland said i cant tell you that i can tell you thisthe man is righthanded and in my professional opinion he knows nothing about any homicides or about goffs whereabouts lloyd said ive got my notebook doc talk slowly all right this man says he met goff last year at a singles bar they pulled a burglary together he forgets the location and stole some art objects goff had a customer for the stuff my man says his name was either rudolph stanley or stanley rudolph he had a condo in brentwood somewhere near bundy and montana thats it yes my counselee is a basically decent very disturbed young man sergeant please dont press me for his identity i wont yield on that dont sweat it doc but if i get goff on your info be prepared for the best dinner of your life i look forward to it havilland waited for a reply but the policeman had already hung up putting down the phone he saw that richard oldfield had not budged from his supplicant position he looked at the blood on his hands twist the cop gouge him maim him make him pay for the childhood darkness and infuse the void with light at dawn lloyd was stationed in his car at the southeast corner of bundy and montana armed with skintight rubber gloves and a selection of burglars picks after receiving havillands phone call he had made a battery of his own calls to the lapds r ampi the all police computer network the feds and the california department of motor vehicles night information line the results were only halfway satisfying a man named stanley rudolph lived at montana but he possessed no criminal record and had never been cited for anything more serious than running a red light a solid citizen type who in all probability would scream for his attorney when confronted with the fact that he was a receiver of stolen goods there was only the triedandtrue and highly illegal daylight recon run rudolphs dmv application had yielded the facts that he was unmarried worked as a broker at the downtown stock exchange and was the owner of a light blue cadillac seville bearing the personalized license plate big stan which was now parked directly across the street lloyd fidgeted and looked at his watch the exchange would be opening at seven big stan would have to leave soon or be late for work sipping coffee directly from the thermos he thought of his other nonprofessional telephone inquiries against his better judgment he had called r ampi and the dmv to learn what he could about linda wilhite the information gleaned was lackluster date of birth physical stats address and phone number and the facts that she was selfemployed drove a mercedes and had no criminal record but the act of pursuit was thrilling fueled by fantasies of what it would be like to need and be needed by a woman that beautiful thoughts of linda wilhite had competed with thoughts of his investigation for control of his mind and it was only havillands astonishing phone call that bludgeoned them to second place at a portly man wearing a threepiece business suit trotted up to the cadillac holding a sweet roll in one hand and a briefcase in the other he got in the car and gunned it southbound on bundy lloyd waited for three minutes then walked over to montana and took the elevator up to the tenth floor was at the end of a long carpeted corridor lloyd looked in both directions then rang the bell when thirty seconds went by without an answer he studied the twin locks on the door and jammed his breaker pick into the top mechanism feeling a very slight click as a bolt loosened he leaned his shoulder into the door accentuating the give of the top lock with his free hand he stuck a needlethin skeleton pick into the bottom keyhole and twisted it side to side seconds later the bottom lock slid open and the door snapped inward lloyd stepped inside and closed the door behind him when his eyes became adjusted to the darkness he found himself in a treasure trove of primitive art there were shelves filled with colombian fertility statues and african wood carvings covering the tops of empty bookcases windowsills and ottomans held mayan pottery and the walls were festooned with framed oil paintings of peruvian indians and shrines in the andes the living room carpeting and furniture were bargain basement quality but the artwork looked to be worth a small fortune lloyd slipped on his rubber gloves and reconnoitered the rest of the condo coming to one nonincriminating conclusion except for the artwork and the late model cadillac big stan lived on the cheap his clothing was off the rack and his refrigerator was stuffed with tv dinners he shined his own shoes and owned nothing electronic or mechanical except the builtin appliances that came with the pad and an inexpensive mm camera stanley rudolph was a man obsessed lloyd took a generic brand cola from the refrigerator and sat down on a threadbare sofa to consider his options realizing that it would be impossible to secure latent prints from any art objects that goff or havillands anonymous source might have touched stanley rudolph had probably fondled the statues and pottery repeatedly and the shrink had said that his source was both righthanded and innocent of knowledge of goffs whereabouts and homicides in general havilland was a pro his assessments could be trusted this left three approaches lean hard on big stan himself toss the pad for levers of intimidation and find his address book and run the names through r ampi since big stan was unavailable only the last two approaches were practical lloyd killed his soft drink and went to work it took him three hours to comb every inch of the condo and confirm his conclusion that stanley rudolph was a lonely man who lived solely to collect art his clothes were poorly laundered his bathroom was a mess and the bedroom walls were blanketed with dust except for rectangular patches where paintings had obviously recently hung the sadnessobsessiveness combo made lloyd want to send up a mercy plea for the entire fuckedup human race this left the address book resting beside the telephone on the living room floor lloyd leafed through it noting that it contained only names and phone numbers turning to the gs he saw that there was no mention of thomas goff and that stanley rudolphs scrawl was unmistakably righthanded sighing he thumbed back to the as and got out his notepad and pen and began copying down every name and phone number in the book when he got to laurel benson lloyd felt a little tremor drift up his spine laurel benson was a highpriced call girl he had rousted while working west la vice over ten years before thinking that it was merely a coincidence and that it was nice to know that big stan got laid occasionally he continued his transcribing until he hit polly marks and put down his pen and laughed out loud thus far the only two women listed in the book were hookers no wonder rudolph had to shine his own shoes and drink generic soda pophe had two expensive habits the n through v section contained the names of over fifty men and only four women two of them hookers that lloyd had heard about from vice squad buddies writers cramp was coming on when he turned to the final page and saw linda wilhite this time the little tremor became a earthquake lloyd replaced the address book and left the obsessive little condo before he had time to think of his next destination and what it all meant parked outside linda wilhites plush highrise on wilshire and beverly glen lloyd ran through literal and instinctive chronologies in an attempt to logically explain the remarkable coincidence that had just fallen into his lap dr john havilland was in love with linda wilhite who was probably a very expensive prostitute one who had tricked with stanley rudolph who had bought stolen goods from thomas goff and the doctors anonymous source havilland did not know goff or rudolph but did know wilhite and the source the coincidence factor was strong but did not reek of malfeasance unanswered questions did linda wilhite know goff or the source or the wild cardwas the shrink who had the air of a man in love protecting linda wilhite the real source by giving him correct information from a bogus informant this way protecting both his professional ethics and the woman he loved was the doctor playing a roundabout game wanting to aid in a homicide investigation yet not wanting to relinquish confidential information lloyd felt anger overtake his initial sex flush if linda wilhite knew anything about thomas goff or his lefthanded friend he would shake it out of her he ran into the highrise and bolted three flights of service stairs when he raised his hand to knock on the door of linda wilhites apartment he saw that he was shaking a security peephole slid open yes a womans voice said lloyd put his badge up in front of the hole lapd he said could i speak to you for a moment miss wilhite whats this about lloyd felt his shaking go internal its about stanley rudolph will you open up please there was the sound of locks being unlatched and then she was there wearing an anklelength paisley caftan lloyd tried to stare past her into the apartment but linda wilhite held the center of his vision and rendered the background dull black what about stanley rudolph she asked lloyd walked into the apartment uninvited taking a quick inventory of the entrance hall and living room it was still hazy background stuff but he knew that everything was tasteful and expensive dont be shy make yourself right at home linda wilhite said coming up behind lloyd and pointing him toward a floralpatterned easy chair ill have the butler bring you a mint julep lloyd laughed nice pad linda out of the lowrent district linda feigned a return laugh dont be formal call me suspect lloyd stuck his hand in his jacket pocket and pulled out snapshots of thomas goff and jungle jack herzog he handed them to linda and said okay suspect have you seen either of these men before linda looked the photos over and returned them to lloyd there was not the slightest flicker of recognition in her eyes or her handsonhips pose no whats this about stan rudolph are you with vice lloyd sat down in the easy chair and stretched his legs thats right whats the basis of your relationship with rudolph lindas eyes went cold her voice followed i think you know will you state your purpose ask your questions and get out lloyd shook his head what do you know that youre no fucking vice cop linda shouted you got a snappy comeback for that one lloyds voice was his softest the voice he saved for his daughters yeah youre no hooker linda sat down across from him everything in this apartment calls you a liar ive been called worse than that lloyd said such as some of the choicer shots have included urban barracuda male chauvinist porker fascist cocksucker wasp running dog and pussy hound scumbag i appreciate articulate invective motherfucker and pig get to be boring linda wilhite laughed and poked a finger at lloyds wedding ring youre married what does your wife call you long distance what were separated serious splitsville im not sure its been a year and shes got a lover but i intend to outlast the bastard linda stretched out her legs matching lloyds pose but in the opposite direction do you always discuss intimate family matters with total strangers lloyd laughed and stilled an urge to reach over and touch her knee sometimes its good therapy im in therapy linda said why lloyd asked thats your first dumb question linda said everyone has problems and people who have money and want to get rid of them go to shrinks comprende lloyd shook his head most troubled people are swamped by petty neuroses stuff that they havent got the slightest handle on offhand id say that youre not that kind of person offhand id say that some sort of catalyst led you to the couch my shrink doesnt have a couch hes too hip thats a strange thing to call a psychiatrist all right hip translates to brilliant concerned dedicated and brutally honest are you in love with him no hes not my type look this conversation is getting a little weird and a bit far afield you are a cop arent you that wasnt a dimestore badge you showed me or anything like that was it lloyd saw a large stack of newspapers lying on top of a coffee table an arms length away he pointed to them and said if youve got tuesdays times look at the second page shootout at beverly hills nightclub linda went to the table and leafed through the papers then read the article standing up when she turned around to face lloyd he had his badge and id card extended linda took the leatherette holder and examined it then smiled from ear to ear so youre sergeant lloyd hopkins and one of those pictures is the unidentified homicide suspect you shot it out with very impressive but what do stan rudolph and i have to do with it lloyd mulled the question over as linda sat back down without relinquishing the id holder deciding on an abridged version of the truth he said an informant told me that thomas goff my previously unidentified homicide suspect sold stanley rudolph some art objects aided by a still unidentified partner i came across rudolphs address book and noticed the names of several call girls id busted years ago i also noticed your name and concluded that since the only other women in the book were in the life you had to be also i needed an outside lever to pry some information out of rudolph and since the other women probably still hate me for busting them i decided on you linda handed the id holder back are you that fucking brash lloyd smiled yes he said why dont you just question stan baby yourself because hed probably want an attorney present because any admission of knowing goff is an implicit admission of receiving stolen goods accessory to first degree burglary and criminal conspiracy what kind of man is rudolph a pathetic little nerd who gets his rocks off taking nude pictures a loudmouthed buffoon what specifically did this guy goff do hes murdered at least three people linda went pale jesus and you want me to pry information about him out of stan baby yes and about his partner who im certain is lefthanded does rudolph ever talk about his art collection and how he acquired it linda tapped lloyds arm and said yes his art collection is his favorite topic of conversation its all tied in to his sex mo hes told me a dozen times that he buys his stuff from ripoff guys thats as specific as he gets he used to have nude photographs of me on his bedroom walls but he took them down because he was expecting some more colombian statues i havent tricked with him in six weeks or so so maybe he and goff got together recently lloyd thought of the rectangular patches on rudolphs bedroom wall imagining the nude linda he could have seen had he pulled his b ampe a few months before linda do you think you linda wilhite silenced him with a breathtaking coconspirators smile yes ill call stan baby and set up a date hopefully for tonight call me around one am and dont worry ill be very cool lloyds conspiratorial smile felt like a blush thank you my pleasure you were right you know i did enter therapy for a reason what was it i want to quit the life then i was right on two counts what do you mean i told you you were no hooker lloyd got up and walked out of the apartment letting his exit line linger with the stanley rudolph angle covered lloyd remembered an investigatory approach so rudimentary that he knew its very simplicity was the reason he had forgotten to explore it cursing himself for his oversight he drove to a pay phone and called dutch peltz at the hollywood station asking him to go across the street to the hollywood municipal court and secure a subpoena for jack herzogs bank records dutch agreed to the errand on the proviso that lloyd fill him in at length on the case when he came by the station to pick up the paperwork lloyd agreed in return and drove to herzogs apartment house in the valley thinking of linda wilhite all the way at herzogs building lloyd went straight to the managers apartment flashed his badge and asked him what bank the missing officers rent checks were drawn on without hesitation the frail old man said securitypacific encino branch then launched into a spiel on how other officers had been by the previous day and had sealed the nice mr herzogs nice apartment after thanking the manager lloyd drove back over the cahuenga pass to the hollywood station he found dutch peltz in his office muttering yes yes into the telephone dutch looked up drew a finger across his throat and whispered iad lloyd took a chair across from him and put his feet up on the desk dutch muttered yes fred ill tell him and hung up he turned to lloyd and said good news and bad news which would you prefer first take your pick lloyd said dutch smiled and poked lloyds crossed ankles with a pencil the good news is that judge bitowf issued your subpoena with no questions asked wasnt that nice of him lloyd took in dutchs grin and raised his feet as if to kick his precious quartz bookend off the desk tell me what fred gaffaney had to say omit nothing more good news and bad news dutch said the good news is that i am your official liaison to iad on all matters pertaining to the goffherzog case the bad news is that gaffaney just reiterated in the strongest possible language that you are to go nowhere near the officers working the moonlight gigs or go near the firms themselves gaffaney is preparing an approach strategy and he and his top men will be conducting interviews within a few days i will be given xeroxes of their reports you can get copies from me gaffaney also stated that if you violate these orders you will be suspended immediately and given a trial board you like it lloyd reached over and patted the bookend no i dont like it but you do dutch flashed a shark grin i like anything that keeps you reasonably restrained and thereby a continued member of the los angeles police department i would hate to see you get shitcanned and go on welfare youd be drinking tbird and sleeping in the weeds within six months lloyd stood up and grabbed the subpoena off dutchs desk he laid the notebook containing the names from stanley rudolphs address book in its place and said i know why youre acting so sardonic dutchman you had a martini with your lunch you have one drink a year and your low tolerance gets you plowed im a detective you cant fool me dutch laughed fuck you whats with this notebook and where do you think youre going you were going to fill me in on the case remember lloyd took a playful jab at the bookend fuck you twice i dont confide in alcoholics have one of your minions run those names through r ampi will you ill think about it hey lloydy how come you took my bad news so easy i expected you to throw something lloyd tried to imitate dutchs shark grin but knew immediately that it came out a blush i think im in love he said lloyd drove back to the valley highballing it northbound on the ventura freeway in order to hit the encino branch of the securitypacific bank before closing time making it with two minutes to spare he showed his id and the subpoena to the manager a middleaged japanese man who led him to the privacy of a safe deposit box examination room returning five minutes later with a computer printout and a thick transaction file bowing the manager closed the door leaving lloyd in impeccable silence that silence soon became inhabited by dates and figures that detailed an atypical cop life jack herzogs savings and checking accounts went back five years lloyd started at the beginning of the transaction file and waded through paychecks deposited twice monthly rent checks drawn monthly and savings stipends deposited every third la city pay period jack herzog was a frugal man there were no large withdrawals indicating spending sprees no checks for amounts exceeding his monthly rent payment of and out of every third paycheck he deposited in a growth savings account when herzog opened his dual accounts in his total balance was less than six hundred dollars at the transaction files last entry date four months before he was worth noting that the last entry was on lloyd turned to the computer sheet hoping it contained facts updating herzogs two accounts to the present it did the same depositcheck withdrawal motif continued this time detailed in hardtoread computer type lloyd was about to shake his head at the sadness of close to nineteen grand belonging to a dead man when the final transaction came into focus grabbing him by the throat on march around the time of his disappearance jack herzog closed out both his accounts and purchased an interbranch bank draft for his total balance of there was a photocopy of the draft clipped to the computer sheet it stated that the above amount was to be transferred to the west hollywood branch of securitypacific to the savings account of martin d bergen lloyd let the facts sink in then walked slowly out of the examination room and through the bank proper bowing to the bank manager and running as soon as he hit the sidewalk by speeding through the hollywood hills lloyd was able to reach the big orange insider office in just under half an hour the same receptionist gave him the same startled look as he pushed through the connecting door to the editorial department and seconds later the young man he had tangled with on his previous visit attempted to block his progress by standing in his path with his legs dug in like a linebacker i told you before you cant come back here he said lloyd took a bead on his head then caught himself marty bergen he said official police business go get him the young man wrapped his arms around his chest marty is on vacation leave now lloyd took the bank subpoena from his pocket and rolled it up then tickled the underside of the young mans chin with the end when he jerked backward lloyd said this is a court order to search bergens desk if you dont comply with it ill get an order to search the entire premises do you dig me daddyo turning beet red then pale the youth flung an arm toward the back of the room the last desk against the wall and let me see that court order lloyd handed the subpoena over and weaved through a crammed maze of desks ignoring the stares of the people sitting at them bergens desk was covered with a pile of papers lloyd leafed through them pushing the stack aside when he saw that every page contained notes scrawled in an indecipherable shorthand he was about to go through the drawers when a womans voice interrupted him officer is marty all right lloyd turned around a tall black woman wearing an inkstained printers smock was standing beside the desk holding a long roll of tabloid galley paper is marty all right she repeated no lloyd said i dont think so why do you ask you sound concerned the woman fretted the roll in her hands hes been gone since the last time you were here she said he hasnt been at his apartment and nobody from the orange has seen him and right before he took off he grabbed all his columns for the following week except one im the head typesetter and i needed to set those issues marty really screwed the orange and thats not like him has he taken off like this before the woman shook her head no i mean sometimes he rents a motel room and goes on a toot but he always leaves copies of his column for the time he expects to be gone this time was weird because he took back his columns and they were really weird to begin with lloyd motioned the woman to sit down tell me about those columns he said try to remember everything you can they were just weird the woman said slowly one was called moonlight malfeasance it was about these bigshot la cops who had these figurehead jobs bossing around all these lowlife rentacops weird the other columns were offshoots on that one about the lapd manipulating the media because they got all the inside dirt from the moonlight cops weird i mean the oranges meat is its antifuzz policy but this stuff was weird even for marty bergen who was a lovable dude but weird himself lloyd felt fragments of his case burst into a strange new light marty bergen had seen the missing lapd personnel files swallowing to hold his voice steady he said you told me that bergen let you keep one of the columns have you still got it the woman nodded and rolled out her galley sheet on the desk marty gave real specific instructions on how to set it she said he said it had to have a heavy black border and that it had to run on may the third because that was the birthday of this buddy of his weird she located the section and jabbed it with her finger there read it for yourself the blackbordered piece was entitled night train to the big nowhere lloyd read it over three times feeling his case move from its strange new light into a stranger darkness when a cop jumps on the night train to the big nowhere he doesnt care about its exact destination because any terminus is preferable to living inside his own head with its awful knowledge of how the solar age will never penetrate the big iceberg when my friend jumped on the night train to the big nowhere he probably foresaw only relief from his lockedin knowledge of the big nightmare and the vise grip of the new nightmare that spelled out his role to play in the shroud dance that owns us all that you didnt purchase your ticket with your gun spoke volumes like me you were a bluesuit sham you did not use that tool of your trade in your nihilist last hurrah reaffirming your masquerade instead you strangled on a pink cloud of chemical silence giving yourself time to think of all the puzzles you had solved and of the cruelty of your final jigsaw revelations at the end you confronted and knew it was your most conscious act of courage in a life vulgarized by fearful displays of bravery i love you for it and offer you this twentyone gun verse valedictory resurrect the dead on this day open the doors where they dare not to stray cancel all tickets to the horror shroud dance burn down the night in the rage of a trance lloyd handed the sheet back to the bewildered typesetter print it he said redeem your piece of shit newspaper the woman said it aint the new york times but its a regular gig lloyd nodded but didnt reply when he walked out of the office the strident young man was scrutinizing the bank subpoena with a magnifying glass knowing that he couldnt bear to recon marty bergens apartment lloyd drove home and called the west hollywood sheriffs briefly explaining the case and relegating the job to them omitting his knowledge of the bank draft telling them to make a check of local motels and to detain bergen if they found him new questions burned in the morass that the herzoggoff case had become was jungle jack herzog a suicide if so where was his body who had disposed of it and who had wiped his apartment free of fingerprints marty bergens weird columns indicated that he had seen the files herzog had stolen where were the files what was the literal gist of the suicide column where was bergen and what was the extent of his involvement in the case when nothing came together for him lloyd knew that he was overamped undernourished and coming unconnected and that the only antidote was an evening of rest after a dinner of cold sliced ham and a pint of cottage cheese he sat down on his porch to watch the twilight dwindle into darkness warming to the idea of not thinking but he thought he thought of the terraced hills of the old neighborhood and of sleepless fifties nights spent listening to the howling of dogs imprisoned in the animal shelter two blocks away the shelter had given his section of silverlake the nickname of dogtown and for the years of fiftyfive and fiftysix when he had been a peewee member of the dogtown flats gang it had supplied him with the sobriquets of dogman and savior the constant howling plaintive as it was had been mysterious and romantic dream fuel but sometimes the dogs chewed and clawed their way to freedom only to get obliterated by latenight hotrodders playing chicken on the blind curve blacktop outside his bedroom window even though the corpses were removed by the time he left for school in the morning with the pavement hosed down by old mr hernandez next door lloyd could feel and smell and almost taste the blood and after a while his nights were spent not listening but cringing in anticipation of coming impacts lack of sleep drew lloyd gaunt that fall of fiftysix and he knew that he had to act to reclaim the wonder he had always felt after dark because the night was there to provide comfort and the nourishing of brave dreams and only someone willing to fight for its sanctity deserved to claim it as his citadel lloyd began his assault against death first blocking off dead dog curve at both ends with homemade sawhorse detour signs to prevent access to chicken players the stratagem worked for two nights until a gluesniffing member of the first street flats crashed his fiftyone chevy through the barricade sideswiping a series of parked cars as he lost control finally coming to a halt by rearending an lapd blackandwhite out on bail the next day the driver went looking for the puto who had put up the sawhorse smiling when dogtown buddies told him it was a crazy fourteenyearold kid called dogman and savior a loco who was planning to flop in a sleeping bag by dead dog curve to make sure that nobody played chicken on his turf that night fourteenyearold lloyd hopkins six foot one and a hundred and eighty pounds began the series of mano a mano chooseoffs that rendered the nicknames dogman and savior passe and earned him a new title conquistador the fights continued for ten nights straight costing him a twice broken nose and a total of a hundred stitches but ending chicken on griffith park and st elmo forever when his nose was set for the second time and his swollen hands returned to their normal size lloyd quit the dogtown flats he knew he was going to become a policeman and it would not do to have a gang affiliation on his record the ringing of a telephone jerked him back to the present he walked into the kitchen and picked it up yes hopkins this is linda what are you spaced out or something linda wilhite lloyd laughed yeah i am spaced out hows tricks not funny hopkins but ill let you slide because youre spaced listen i did just trick with stanley and i very subtly pried some not too encouraging info out of him such as such as you were misinformed somehow stan baby has never heard of goff i described the picture you showed me to him and he doesnt know anyone resembling it ditto any lefthanded man stan said he buys his stuff from a black guy who works solo he did buy some stuff from a white guy once last year but the guy charged too much sorry i couldnt be of more help you were a lot of help how did you get my phone number linda laughed you are spaced from the phone book listen will you let me know how this turns out yes and thanks linda my pleasure and by the way if you feel like calling you dont have to have a reason though im sure youll think one up are you telling me im devious no just lonely and a bit guiltridden and you lonely and a bit curious bye hopkins goodbye linda after a handshake and brief salutations linda wilhite took her seat across from the doctor and began to talk when havilland heard vague selfanalysis fill the air he clicked off his conscious listening power and shifted into an automatic overdrive that allowed him to juxtapose lindas beauty against the single most important aspect of his life thinking one step ahead of lloyd hopkins since they were both geniuses this kept the night trippers mental engine pushed to its maximum horsepower searching for loopholes and overlooked flaws in the logical progression of his game with his physical concentration zeroed in on linda he thought of the games one possible trouble spot jungle jack herzog their relationship had been based on mutual respectherzogs genuine the doctors feigned the alchemist was a classic psychiatric prototypethe seeker after truth who retreats into a cocoon of rationalization when confronted with harrowing selftruths thus the doctor had played into his pathetic fantasy of using the stolen files to create an lapd credibility gap that would by implication exonerate his friend marty bergen while at the same time plumbing the basis of his attraction to a man whose cowardly actions he despised the truth had finally become too strong and herzog had run to some unknown terminus of machodriven shame goff had wiped his apartment shortly after he disappeared and the odds against his leaving records or contacting bergen or lapd colleagues were astronomicalhis shameful new selfknowledge would preclude it yet hopkins had tied in herzog to the late thomas goff although he had not mentioned the missing files that was potentially damaging although herzog had had no knowledge of his hard criminal activity the most important part of the game was now to convince hopkins that he was shielding someone close to goff that he was strangling on the horns of an ethical dilemma he would play the role of every wimpy liberal man of conscience that policemen hated and crazy lloyd would buy ithook line and sinker the night tripper mentally decelerated catching bits of psychobabble sloganeering as lindas monologue wound down knowing that she would expect him to respond he made brief mental notes to contact and placate his lonelies with excuses for his absence then smiled and said i let you go on like that without interjecting questions because such thinking is living in the problem not the solution youve got to be able to exposit facts gauge them for their basic truths and nuances solicit my feedback accept it or reject it then move on the next fact youve obviously read every lunatic and wellintentioned selfhelp book ever written and its mired you down with a great deal of useless food for thought give me facts linda flushed clenched her jaw and slammed the arms of her chair facts she said you want facts then ill give you facts fact im lonely fact im horny fact i just met a very interesting man fact i can tell that hes turned on to me fact hes mooning for his estranged wife and will probably not hit on yours truly as much as hed like to fact im pissed off about it havilland smiled the litany sounded like his fish swallowing a huge chunk of bait tell me about the man facts physical and otherwise then your conclusions linda smoothed the hem of her skirt and smiled back all right hes about forty and very large with intense gray eyes and dark brown hair sort of unkempt ruddy complexion his clothes are out of style hes funny and arrogant and sarcastic hes very smart but theres nothing contrived or academic about it he just has it hes a natural at lindas last words the doctor felt his fish gobble the bait then inexplicably start to chew through the line when he spoke his voice sounded disembodied as if it had been filtered through an echo chamber he has it hes a natural those arent facts linda be more specific dont get angry linda said you wanted conclusions havilland leaned back in his chair feeling his own line snap with the realization that he had displayed anger im sorry i raised my voice he said sometimes nonspecific information makes me angry dont apologize doctor you know human emotions better than i do yes more facts then please linda stared at her clenched hands then counted facts on her fingers hes a cop hes proud to a fault hes lonely heoh shit he just has it havilland felt barbedwire hooks gouge his jugular lindas beauty the hook wielder her voice supplied a verbal gouging that honed the hooks to razor sharpness i just dont feel factual about this man doctor its weird meeting him so soon after entering therapy and nothing will probably come of it but my only facts are my intuitions doctor are you all right havilland stared through linda to a mental chessboard he had constructed to resurrect his professional cool kings queens and knights toppled and in the wake of their fall he was able to dredge up a smile and a calm voice im sorry linda one of my little bouts of vertigo im also sorry for impugning your intuitions one thing struck me when you were describing this fellow and thats that he sounds very much like your size fortyfour sweater fantasy man has that occurred to you linda covered her mouth and laughed maybe the rolling stones were wrong what do you mean youre obviously not a rock fan linda said i was referring to an old stones tune called you cant always get what you want although they could be right because if lloydpoo doesnt want to be had then im sure that he will not be had thats part of his charm havilland made a steeple and brought it up to his face framing linda inside the triangle how has he affected your fantasy life linda gave the doctor a rueful smile you dont miss much yes this man is the basic fortyfour sweater prototype yes he possesses that certain aura of violence i mentioned earlier yes i have cast him as the man who watches my gory home movies with me i also like the fact that hes a cop and you know why because he doesnt judge me for being a prostitute cops and hookers work the same street so to speak collapsing the steeple into his lap the doctor said for the record linda youve made a great deal of progress in only three sessions so much so that im considering a rather avantgarde visual aid session a week or so down the line would you be up for that sure youre the doctor yes havilland said i am and doctors have certain results that they must achieve mine involve confronting my counselees most hideous secrets and fears taking them through their green doors and beyond their beyonds you know that your confrontations are going to be particularly painful dont you linda linda stood up and adjusted the pleats in her skirt then slung her handbag over her shoulder no pain no gain im tough doctor i can handle all the truth you can hit me with friday at tenthirty havilland got to his feet and took lindas hand yes one thing before you go what were your parents wearing at the time of their deaths linda held the doctors hand while she pondered the question finally she said my father was wearing khaki pants a plaid lumberjack shirt and a dodger baseball cap i remember the pictures the policemen showed me the detectives were amazed that he could blow his brains out and still keep the cap on his head my mother was doing parttime practical nursing then and she was wearing a white nurses uniform why havilland lowered her hand symbolic therapy thank you for digging up such an unpleasant memory no pain no gain linda said as she waved goodbye alone in his office with the scent of lindas perfume the night tripper wondered why validation of his most audacious move should cause such a bizarre reaction he played back the session in his mind and got nothing but a static hiss that sounded like an airraid siren about to screech its doom warning reflexively he grabbed his desk phone and dialed one of his pawns numbers getting a recorded message hi lover this is sherry im out right now but if you want to party or just rap talk to the machine bye he put down the receiver knowing immediately that he had made a mistake sherry shroeder lived in the valley he had made a toll call that would appear on his phone bill havilland took a deep breath and closed his eyes searching for a train of thought to provide a counteraction to the blunder it arrived in the form of facts the remaining junior miss cosmetics files were boring they were boring because they detailed unimaginative sleaze thus a higher class line of confidential dirt should be procured the avonoco fiberglass company had a class two security rating the alchemist had said if you cut a fart theyve got a file on you they hire lots of parolees and work furlough inmates as part of an la county kickback scam the lapd file on their security chief had described him as a compulsive gambler with a history of psychiatric counseling choice meat for thomas goff choicer meat for a trained psychiatrist the night tripper locked up his office and took the elevator down to the bank of pay phones in the lobby he was leafing through the yellow pages when the reason for his erratic behavior stunned him with its implications of cheap emotion he was jealous of linda wilhites attraction to lloyd hopkins lloyd spent the morning at the west hollywood sheriffs substation reading over the report filed by the team of detectives who had searched marty bergens apartment the report ran a total of eight pages and contained both the officers observations regarding the apartments condition and a sixpage inventory of items found on the premises there was no mention of the personnel files or any other official police document and nothing that pointed to jack herzog or his murdersuicidedisappearance what emerged was a clipped word portrait of an alcoholic excop reaching the end of his tether on the ambiguous pretext of a routine check the detectives had learned from bergens landlady that she had not seen her tenant in over a week and that in her opinion he was holed up swacko in some motel on the strip the state of bergens apartment confirmed this appraisal empty scotch bottles were strewn across the floor and there were no clothes or toilet articles to be found all four rooms reeked of booze and waste and a portable typewriter lay smashed to pieces on the kitchen floor the officers had followed the landladys advice and had checked every motel and cocktail bar on the length of the sunset strip showing bergens big orange insider byline photo to every desk clerk and bartender they encountered many recognized bergen as a frequent heavy binger but none had seen him in over two weeks deciding to sit on the information before assigning lapd detectives to search for the excopwriter lloyd drove to west la and his last remaining uncharted link to the whole twisted mess wondering if his motives were entirely professional linda wilhite opened her door on the second knock catching lloyd in the act of straightening his necktie pointing him inside she looked at her watch and said noon fourteen hours after my call and youre here in person got a good reason lloyd sat down on a floralpatterned sofa i came to cop a plea he said i havent been entirely honest with you and i linda silenced him by leaning over and adjusting the knot in his tie and you want something right right so tell me linda said sitting down beside him lloyd gave her an unrepentant stare dr john havilland put me on to you unconsciously i saw those pictures of you in his outer office then he linda grabbed his arm what the framed photographs of you dont you know about that linda shook her head angrily then sadly that poor wonderful man i told him about this artyfarty picture book i posed for and he went out and bought it how sad i figured he was some sort of ascetic asexual then this morning i told him about a man im attracted to and he freaked out ive never seen anyone so jealous he blurted your name when i commented on the pictures lloyd said and he obviously takes them down before he sees you havilland counsels lots of criminal types in the course of my investigation i blundered onto his name and decided to exploit his expertise in matters of the criminal psyche as i suspected he had his own underworld grapevine he queried his source and came up with a man who along with thomas goff sold stanley rudolph some art objects i snuck into rudolphs pad and found your name in his phone book even though rudolph himself doesnt know goff this anonymous man does the whole rudolph connection was a weird bunch of information and misinformation which doesnt alter the fact that havillands source knows goff lloyd paused when he saw that lindas face had become a mask of rage lowering his voice he continued havilland is legally protected by a shitload of statutes regarding professional privilege he does not have to reveal the name of his source and all my instincts tell me that no amount of coercion would move him to divulge the name of goffs cohort lloyd put his hand on lindas shoulder she cringed at his touch then batted his hand away and hissed there are people who cant be coerced hopkins and the doctor is one of them he cant be coerced because unlike you he has principles there are also people who cant be manipulated and even though im a whore im one of them do you honestly think that id manipulate information out of a man who wants to help me and give it to a man who at best wants to fuck me you want an addition to your epithet list sergeant how about uncaring manipulative sleazebag seeing red lloyd walked out of the apartment and down to the street and his unmarked cruiser ten minutes later he was sitting in dr john havillands outer office staring at the photographs of linda wilhite and asking his seldom sought god not to let him do anything stupid the doctor appeared just as the red throbbing behind lloyds eyes began to subside he was ushering an elderly woman wearing a save the whales tshirt out of his private office cooing into her ear as she checked the contents of her purse when he saw lloyd he said one moment sergeant issued a final goodbye to his patient then turned and laughed that very rich woman thinks that she can communicate telepathically with whales what can i do for you have you made any progress in your investigation lloyd shook his head and spoke with a deliberate slowness no your source was somewhat inaccurate in his information i questioned stanley rudolph he has no knowledge guilty or otherwise of thomas goff his primary source of stolen goods is a black man who works by himself rudolph bought goods from a solo white man only once sometime last year you said that your source met goff at a singles bar did he tell you the name of it havilland sighed and sat down in an armchair across from lloyd no he didnt to be frank sergeant the young man has a drug problem an addiction that sometimes involves blackouts his memory isnt always completely trustworthy yet you believe that he knows goff yes and you credit his statement that he has no knowledge of goffs whereabouts and no knowledge regarding the liquor store homicides havilland hesitated then said yes keeping his voice deliberately slow lloyd said no you dont youre shielding someone who knows something hot about goff and youre scared you want to tell me what you know but you dont want to compromise your ethics and jeopardize your patients wellbeing i understand these things but understand me doctor youre my only shot were dealing with mass murder here not petty neuroses you have to tell me his name and i think you know it no havilland said thats absolute will you reconsider over a period of twentyfour hours ill have an attorney present when i question the man and he wont know that you informed on him ill concoct a story that would satisfy a genius havilland lowered his eyes god damn it i said no lloyd felt his slowmotion strategy burst he jammed his hands into his front pockets closing them around open handcuff ratchets and a metal studded sap staring straight at the doctor he squeezed the concealed weaponry so hard that the pain forced his words out in a wince you fuck with me and ill hit you with an irs audit and more writs petitions subpoenas and court orders than you thought existed ill initiate motions requesting the case files of every courtreferred patient who ever crossed your door ill hire shyster lawyers out of my own pocket and keep them on retainer just to dream up ways to hassle you ill have badass nigger vice cops keep your office under surveillance and scare the shit out of the rich neurotics you feed from twentyfour hours youve got my number a red tide propelled lloyd out of the office when he took his hands from his pockets he saw that they were bleeding hook line and sinker havilland walked into his private office and removed an array of bait from his wall safe ten thousand dollars in a brown paper bag and a newly typed psychiatric report accompanied by a snapshot he placed the report in his top desk drawer then looked at his watch onethirty he had six hours until his next move leaning back in his chair the night tripper closed his eyes and tried to will a dreamless sleep he succeeded and failed sleep came interspersed with semiconscious moments that he knew to be his memory as each image passed through him he felt like a surgical bonesaw was slicing his body in two leaving him the choice of going with his symbolic past or of drifting into the cloud cover of anesthesia off to his left was sleep off to his right was a bloodspattered corkboard equipped with arm and legholes a rigormortised ankle encircled by a steel manacle and the bronx ferris wheel spinning off its axis full consciousness was a pinpoint of light between his eyes an escape hatch that could trigger full sleep if concentrated upon in tandem with recitation of his mantra patria sanctorum three roads inward to wakefulness to oblivion to his childhood void feeling fearless the night tripper succumbed to memory and let his right side disengage a huge magnifying glass descended on the void serving up details mcevoyd block etched on the manacle gouged and cauterized arteries marking the ankle father whispering in his ear as the ferris wheel reached its apex suspending them above blocks of puerto rican tenements straining to read the lips of the people traversing below him he caught long snatches of conversation and shock waves of laughter then his two sides fused havilland awoke refreshed at sixfortyfive his yawn became a smile when the new void embellishments passed the credibility test by returning to his conscious mind his smile widened when he realized that his oneonone with lloyd hopkins was the catalyst that had supplied the fresh details thus fortified by sleep and memory he picked up his bag of money locked the office and drove to malibu and the acquisition of data the rendezvous point was a long stretch of parking blacktop overlooking the beach havilland left his car in the service area of a closed gas station on the land side of the pacific coast highway and took the tunnel underpass across to the bank of lighted pay phones adjoining the spot where he was to meet the avonoco fiberglass security chief he checked his watch and walked to the railing pm the last remnants of an amber sun turning the ocean pink savoring the moment he watched the ball of fire meld into a pervasive light blue when the blue died into a dark rush of waves he walked to the phone booth nearest the railing and dialed the number of his actress pawn hello havilland grimaced sherrys salutation was slurred into three stoned syllables hello whos this is that you otto you horny hound havillands grimace relaxed though loaded his pawn was lucid this is lloyd sherry how are you hi lloyd hi do you remember our deal of course baby i got ripped off to the max on steep throat and nuclear nookie im not letting this one get away havilland turned around and stretched catching a glimpse of a man hunched over the phone in the last booth at the end even though the caller was a good ten yards away he turned back and lowered his voice to a whisper good were shooting tomorrow night your costar will pick you up thats a little idea of mine you know let the stars get acquainted so that they can perform more realistically hell bring an outfit for you to wear is that your current address on your business card yeah thats my crib and ill get the rest of my money then yes your costars name is richard hell pick you up at nine ill see you on the set sherry laughed nine pm tell richard to be there or be square bye lloyd goodbye sherry havilland hung up and stared through the plexiglas booth enclosures noting with relief that the caller was gone he checked his watch again then walked to the railing and over to the approximate middle of the parking strip hopefully lieutenant howard christie would be punctual at precisely eightthirty slow footsteps echoed on the blacktop the doctor squinted and saw a man materialize out of the shadows and walk straight toward him when he was ten feet away a sudden burst of moonlight illuminated his features it was the man in the phone booth shunting that knowledge aside the doctor walked forward with his hand extended watching an archetypal cop come into focus he was a big crewcutted man going to fat he had a blunt face and cold eyes that measured the doctor up down and sideways without revealing a hint of his appraisal when they were face to face he took the extended hand and said doctor havilland i presume the words rendered the doctor mute and faint he tried to jerk his hand free it was futile the force that grasped it was crushing it into numbness the force spoke did you think you were dealing with amateurs ive been a cop for twentytwo years fourteen of them on the take i know the ropes i saw you park your car half an hour ago and ran you through the dmv the white pages told me the rest a psychiatrist very fucking unimpressive do you know how many shrinks ive gamed to get out of trouble in the department did you think id let you pull this clandestine rendezvous horseshit anonymously did you think i believed that snow job you gave me on the phone a book about secret information abuse really doctor you insult my intelligence with a final squeeze howard christie released the doctors hand then put an arm around his shoulders and led him to the railing havilland concentrated on his mantra he sat on the railing and forced an appropriately frightened laugh when christie laughed in return he felt his newfound courage click in christie took a deep breath of ocean air dont look so scared doc one thing my first shrink taught me in all relationships power bondings are established in the first five minutes i had to establish the fact that i am the power broker because i have what you want and since we are dealing with class two security clearance stuff this scam is felonious capice yes havilland said i understand but where are the files he ran his right foot nervously over the blacktop in wider and wider circles a big rock caught his toe he nudged it toward him and added does anyone else know my name or that i contacted you christie shook his head i told you i knew the ropes no one at avonoco knows and i just found out your name from a dmv clerk whos already forgotten it but listen where did you get my name lowering his head havilland saw a holstered revolver clipped to christies belt half covered by his open sports jacket iimet an lapd officer at a bar hehe told me you had a gambling problem christie slammed the railing with both palms loudmouthed motherfuckers for your info doc cops are just like crooks you cant trust any of them what was his name iidont remember honestly no problem people who go to bars forget things fast which is why they go to bars im glad im not a drunk two addictions would be too fucking much lets cut the shit and get down to business first off dont tell me why you want the filesi dont want to know second were talking about a long process of photocopying them and moving them out a few at a time if you want quick gratification tough shitdiscuss it with your shrink third your offer of ten thou doesnt cut it i owe a lot of money to some very bad dudes to owe money to i want thirty k no less capice havilland faked a coughing attack leaning over with his head between his knees when he felt christie slap his back he pretended to retch and braced his hands on the pavement palming the rock then shoving it into his right jacket pocket as he resumed a sitting position wiping his eyes he inched closer to his adversary seeing the gun butt fully exposed christies badge attached to his belt next to it christie slapped his back a last time breathe deep doc that good sea air will put hair on your chest what do you think of my terms havilland took a deep breath and stuck his hand in his pocket closing it around the rock he calculated potential arcs and slid over to where his left shoulder and christies right shoulder were brushing yes its a deal youre holding all the aces christie laughed no gambling metaphors im trying to quit he reached his arms up as if to embrace the sky then brought them down in a huge yawn im tired he said lets wrap this up for tonight heres what im thinking six payments of five k apiece the files to be very cautiously siphoned out at my discretion youll have to trust me on that im the dominant ego in this relationship but ill be benevolent about it look at it as a fatherson type of gig capice dr john havilland gasped at the worst insult ever hurled at him he recalled a quote from christies lapd file long history of overdependence upon supportive figures thinking so be it the doctor said what do you think i am an amateur dont you think i know that compulsive gamblers have a need to counterbalance their selfdestruction by asserting themselves in business relationships an unconscious ploy to overrule their awful dependency on their closest loved ones the ones who rule them and own them and give them the tit they suck on christie stood up and stammered wwwhy you little fuck just as havilland smashed the rock into his face the cop teetered on the railing grabbing it with one hand wiping blood from his eyes with the other havilland reached for his waistband and pulled the gun free then closed his eyes and aimed at where he thought christies face should be he pulled the trigger twice screaming along with the explosions then opened his eyes and saw that christies face was not a face but a charred blood basin oozing brain and skull fragments he fired four more times eyes open and not screaming ripping christies badge from his belt just as his last shot sheared off his head and sent him pitching over the railing to the rocks thirty feet below drenched in blood and inundated by horror and memory the night tripper ran at ten oclock after nine straight hours of prowling singles bars and simple drinking bars for thomas goff and marty bergen lloyd gave up surrendering himself to the idea of a trip to new york to prowl goffs old haunts the department would pay for his ticket and per diem and before he left he would consult an attorney on legal loopholes to exert against dr john havilland defeat loomed like a stark black banner lloyd succumbed to the knowledge that there was no place to go but backward in time the old neighborhood greeted him with banners that mocked his cop exigencies parking at sunset and vendome he sprinted up the cracked concrete steps to the highest point in silverlake hoping to find a reprise of old themes that would affirm the fortytwoyearold warrior persona he had paid so dearly to assume but the timeless la haze blanketed then shut down his wouldbe reverie he could not see his parents house a scant half mile away whole vistas of landmarks were covered by a witchs brew of evaporating low clouds industrial fumes and neon lloyds affirmation became a rhapsody of high prices paid for dubious conquests in the watts riot he had killed a fellow national guardsman who had fired into a storefront church filled with innocent blacks partaking of coffee and prayer no one had ever made him for the killing and two months later he entered the los angeles police academy his career as a policeman was sustained brilliance his concurrent role as husband and father a series of blundering attempts to instill his family with benign equivalents of his knowledge when the force of his will elicited anger and hurt he ran back to the job and when the job swirled him into vortexes of boredom and terror and loathing he found women who wanted to touch briefly what he was offer their innocence as barter and then get out before his hard line fervor destroyed their hardearned and fatuous sense of lifes amenities and then last year teddy verplanck merged into his path turning his universe into chaos when that symbiosis was completed death and rebirth occurred simultaneously and as his wounds healed lloyd became a hybrid warrior formed of his past and its validity and of accredited blood testimony as to where it would ultimately take him and his hard line fervor cracked and solidified leaving him to tread air in the middle of a fissure before he could consciously recall his vow of abstinence lloyd drove to wilshire and beverly glen and the only destination that gave the softer part of his fissure credibility finding the door open he walked into the entrance hall and cleared his throat to announce his presence his answer was the shuffle of feet and an unexpected giggle youre early linda called out trying to track the voice lloyd said its hopkins linda linda stepped out of a closet next to the dining room dressed in a silk robe i know it is lloyd walked forward to meet her am i that predictable nodding her head both yes and no linda said i dont know just dont apologize for this afternoon i was as out of line as you no pretexts this time no want to talk before or after after linda smiled and tilted her head toward the bedroom then let lloyd step ahead of her and walk in when his back was turned she slipped off her robe and let it fall to the floor lloyd swiveled to face the soft sound seeing linda nude framed in the doorway backlighted by the glow of a hall lamp keeping the frame at arms length he undressed wincing when his gunbelt hit the carpet linda giggled at the impact then laughed outright when he leaned over and fumbled off his shoes and socks and snagged his zipper and nearly fell out of his pants whispering something that sounded like beyond the beyond she slid past him and lay down on the bed lloyd saw her take up a beckoning position a single shaft of light fluttering across her abdomen using the light as a beacon he came to her she talked while he held her and felt her and tasted her little sighs about love and green doors when his kisses became more persistent and then trailed down to her breasts those sighs became the gasped word yes lost in the words repetition he let his lips move lower until yes crescendoed into now please now lloyd obeyed joining their two halves in a single abrupt motion then pulling back to a sustaining movement as linda coiled herself around him and pushed upward he moved slowly she with the unrestrained fervor of a graceful animal exploding with gracelessness forming a pointcounterpoint give and take that battered awareness of technique to death then he began to move with her fury and the copwhore entity pushed itself into a wordless gasping trance linda succumbed to reality first twisting her head from the crook of lloyds collarbone she traced his back with her palms and kissed his neck softly until he pulled his head from the pillow and looked down on her revealing a blank tearmottled face all she could think of to say was hopkins lloyd rolled over and took her hand when he remained silent linda said its after we were going to talk remember twisting sideways to face her lloyd said what do you want to talk about anything except what just happened it was perfect lets not mess with it lloyd positioned himself so that his eyes and lindas were only inches apart no earthshaking postcoital revelations nodding her head so that their noses rubbed linda said yes im quitting the life ive got seventy grand tucked away which should set me up in some kind of business enterprise im quitting the shrink too if i quit hooking on my own i wont need him and therapy is too expensive for a fledgling businesswoman hell be very sorry to see you go i know hes a very brilliant shrink but i shouldnt associate with men who are obsessed with me having pictures of me on the wall is just too sad even though he takes them down for my visits i still feel manipulated do you remember the pictures exactly how was i posed you werent posed they were candid type shots lindas face clouded really thats strange all the pictures in the book were posed lloyd shrugged then felt an overlooked connection hit him never underestimate your power even over hardnoses like havilland listen did you ever mention stanley rudolph to him linda said yes but not by name all i mentioned was that he liked to take nude pictures of me why i dont want to talk about your case or my clients neither do i what do you want to talk about tell me why you broke up with your wife its not a pretty story it never is lloyd turned over on his back wanting to distance himself from linda he tried to find the appropriate words to begin his story then realized that unless he looked her straight in the eye his prelude would be selfserving lies twisting back around and locking into eye contact he said it happened last year i had been neglecting my family and cheating on my wife with various women for years before that but last year was when it all exploded i was working robberyhomicide pretty much on the cases i pleased when i got an anonymous phone call that led me to a murder victim a young woman i headed the investigation and dug up information that pointed to a mass murderer who was so fucking smart that no police agency in la county connected any of his killings at the time i went to my superiors with my information he had killed at least sixteen women linda raised a hand to her face and bit the knuckles lloyd said my superiors wouldnt authorize an investigation it was too potentially embarassing to too many police departments so i went after him myself janice left me about that time taking the girls with her there was just me and the killer i found out who he wasa man named teddy verplanck he made the media very big as the hollywood slaughterer you probably heard about him i went out to get him but a woman i was seeing got in the way he killed her i went out to kill verplanck we shot each other up and another officer my best friend killed him that part of it never hit the media janice and the girls dont know exactly what happened but they do know that i was shot and that the whole episode almost cost me my career now ive got some nightmares to live with and a lot of innocent blood to atone for linda astonished lloyd by smiling i was expecting some tawdry little tale of other men and other women not a gothic epic baffled by the reaction lloyd said you almost sound titillated by it linda kissed his lips softly my father shot my mother and then blew his brains out i was ten im no neophyte sometimes my thoughts are very dark lets go to sleep on a happy note though i want us to be together lloyd got up and closed the bedroom door shutting out all traces of light so do i he said the morning began with a muffled cadence counting issuing from the living room lloyd put it off as linda gyrating to a tv exercise program and went back to sleep only to be awakened again minutes later by a firm bite on his neck he opened his eyes and saw linda squatting beside the bed in a black leotard she was sweating and holding one hand behind her back he leaned forward to kiss her only to have her dart out of the way of his lips what size sweater do you wear she asked lloyd sat up and rubbed his eyes no kiss no offer of breakfast no when will i see you again later answer my question size fortysix why linda muttered shit and handed lloyd a brooks brothers box tied with a pink ribbon he opened it and saw a carefully folded navy blue pullover sweater stroking its downy front he whistled and said cashmere did you buy this for me linda shook her head ill tell you the story some day its a size too small but please wear it standing up lloyd grabbed linda and consummated their morning kiss thank you ill lose weight so itll fit better i wouldnt put it past you whats the matter hopkins youre scowling lloyd broke the embrace delayed reaction to joy my already complicated life has just gotten much more complicated im glad its mutual what happens next im going to new york in a day or so thomas goff comes from there im going to cruise his old haunts and talk to people who knew him its my only remaining out when i get back ill call you youd better why dont you shower while i make some coffee and toast ive got my yoga class in an hour but at least we can have breakfast together lloyd showered alternating hot and cold jets of water over his body lost in the sound of the spray and the hum of music coming from the kitchen after drying off and dressing he walked into the kitchen and found linda fiddling with the radio dial i hate to be a downer she said but i just heard some bad news an la policeman was murdered in malibu i didnt get all the details but lloyd grabbed the radio and flipped the tuner to an allnews station catching static and the conclusion of a weather report he sat down and looked at linda then put a finger to her lips and said theyll repeat the story cop killings are hot news the weatherman said back to you bob and a sternvoiced announcer took over more details on that malibu killing la county sheriffs detectives have just announced that the dead man found on the beach near pacific coast highway and temescal canyon road is a twentytwoyear lapd veteran named howard christie a lieutenant assigned to the rampart division christies decapitated body was found early this morning by local surfers who called the malibu sheriffs substation to inform them of the grisly find captain michael seidman of the malibu station told reporters this is a homicide but as yet we do not know the cause of death and have no suspects we have however determined that lieutenant christie was killed in the parking lot immediately above the spot on the beach where his body was found we are now appealing to anyone who was in the vicinity of pacific coast highway and temescal canyon road last night or early this morning people who might have seen or heard something suspicious please come forward we need your assistance further details on this story as it breaks and now linda turned off the radio and stared at lloyd tell me hopkins its goff lloyd said with a deathshead grin im not going to new york if you dont hear from me in fortyeight hours send up a flare he grabbed his sweater and ran out the door linda shuddered imagining her new lovers departure as a race into hell pacific coast highway and temescal canyon road was a pandemonium of police vehicles with cherry lights flashing tv minicam crews mobs of reporters and a large crowd of rubbernecks that spilled over from the parking blacktop forcing southbound pch traffic into the middle lane lloyd pulled up to the dirt shoulder on the land side of the highway and killed his siren then pinned his badge to his jacket front and dodged cars over to a diagonal stretch of pavement sealed with a length of rope hung with official crime scene warnings the area behind the cordon was filled with plainclothes officers and technicians with evidence kits and a long bank of pay phones was crowded with uniformed sheriffs deputies calling in information at the rear of the scene a half dozen plainclothesmen squatted beside the wooden railing overlooking the cliffs and the ocean spreading fingerprint powder on a cracked piece of timber im surprised it took you this long recognizing the voice lloyd pivoted and saw captain fred gaffaney push his way through a knot of patrol deputies and plant himself in his path the two men stared at each other until gaffaney fingered his crossandflag tie bar and said this is one sensitive piece of work and i forbid you to interfere its in the sheriffs jurisdiction with iad handling any connections to collateral cases lloyd snorted collateral cases captain this is thomas goff all the way down the line gaffaney grabbed lloyds arm lloyd buckled but let himself be led over to the shadow of an empty pay phone internal affairs is moving on the other officers whose files were stolen the captain said theyre going to be interrogated and perhaps taken into protective custody along with their families except for you lets put the past aside sergeant tell me what youve got so far and if possible ill help you move on it lloyd drummed his fingers on the side of the phone booth marty bergen has at the very least seen the stolen files hes missing but some columns that he left for advance publication indicate conclusively that herzog passed the files to him i think we should issue an apb on bergen and get a court order to seize everything at the big orange insider gaffaney whistled the media will crucify us for it fuck the media ive also got a hearsay line on goff through a hotshot psychiatrist who has a patient who knows him but the cocksucker is hiding behind professional privilege and wont kick loose with the name of his source have you considered talking to nathan steiner lloyd nodded yeah im going to run by his office today what have you got the radio report said christie was decapitated which sounds like possible fortyone stuff gaffaneys hands played over his tie bar ive got an excellent reconstruction from a team of very savvy sheriffs dicks the mes verdict wont be in for hours but this is the way they see it oneyes its a gunshot homicide christie was shot over by that broken piece of railing and was blown down to the beach by the impact i saw the body it landed on some rocks up from the tide so it stayed dry i saw powder burns on his shirtfront so the shots were obviously fired pointblank twochristie was decapitated but the biggest piece of his head the technicians have been able to find so far is a skull fragment about the size of a half dollar you know why he was almost certainly killed with his own gun it wasnt found on his body or anywhere around here his badge was stolen too i talked to one of the top dogs at rampart and he told me that christie packed a threefiftyseven python on and off duty and that he kept it loaded with teflontipped dumdums gaffaney reached into his pants pocket and handed lloyd a copperjacketed slug feel the weight of that monster hopkins i took it off of christies gunbelt while the medics werent looking the expended rounds and christies head are probably halfway to catalina by now lloyd gouged the slugs teflon head with his fingernail shit those sheriffs dicks are probably right this is a much heavier load than a fortyone what else anything from avonoco christies vehicle other vehicles witnesses blood tracks on the pavement the captain put a restraining hand on lloyds chest slow down youre making me nervous theres nothing on any of that yet except a trail of blood leading from the railing across the parking lot and through the underpass to the other side of pch the trail got fainter as it went along which indicates that the killer himself wasnt wounded he was just soaked with christies blood the techs are doing their comparison tests now well know for sure soon whats your next move pump nate steiner for some legal advice hassle the shrink you captain fred gaffaney grinned interrogate the other security chiefs go over their records rattle skeletons the feds are at avonoco now christies security rating makes him a quasi federal employee so this is a collateral fbi beef stay in touch hopkins if you want transcripts of the iad interrogations call dutch peltz lloyd walked back to his car oblivious to the ghouls lining pch drinking beer and standing on their tiptoes to get a glimpse of the drama he had his hand on the door when the young man from the big orange insider drove by and flipped him the finger nathan steiner was a beverly hills attorney who specialized in defending drug dealers his forte was obstructionist tacticsfiling writs and court orders suits and countersuits and motions requesting information on prospective jurors potential witnesses and courtroom functionaries all strategies aimed at securing dismissals on the grounds of prejudiced testimony or courtroom bias these strategies often worked but more often nate the great won his cases by outlasting judges and prosecutors and by harassing them into foolish blunders with his paperwork onslaughts it was well known that many judges granted his minor petitioning requests automatically in the hope that it would keep his clients out of their courtrooms and thus save them the pain of a protracted steiner performance it was not well known that nate the great felt deep guilt over the scores of dope vultures cut loose from jail as the result of his machinations and that despite his loud advocacy of civil liberties he atoned for that guilt by advising lapd officers on ways to circumvent laws regarding probable cause and search and seizure thus when lloyd barged through his office door unannounced he was ready to listen taking a seat uninvited lloyd outlined a hypothetical case involving a doctors legal right not to divulge professionally secured information stressing that all of the doctors records would have to be seized because at this point the name of the patient was unknown concluding his case lloyd sat back and waited for an answer when steiner grunted and said give me three or four days to look at some statutes and think about it lloyd got to his feet and smiled steiner asked him what the smile meant it means that im an obstructionist too lloyd said after stopping at a taco stand and wolfing a burrito plate lloyd drove home and changed clothes outfitting himself in soiled khaki pants and shirt work boots and a baseball cap advertising miller high life satisfied with his workingmans garb and oneday stubble he rummaged through his garage and came up with a set of burglars tools he had scavenged from a central division evidence locker ten years before batterypowered hand drill with cadmium steel bits assorted hookedged chisels and a skinnyhead crowbar and mallet packing them inside a tool kit he drove to century city and the commission of a class b felony the reconnoitering took three hours parking on a residential side street a half mile from century city proper lloyd walked to olympic and century park east and found a uniformed custodian sweeping the astroturf lawn in front of his target building he explained to the man that he was here to help with a private wiring job for a firm situated on the skyscrapers twentysixth floor only one thing worried him he needed an electrical hookup with wall sockets big enough to accommodate his industrialsized tools also it would be nice to have a sink in which to scrape off rusted parts the location didnt matter he had plenty of cord was there a custodians storeroom or something like that on the twentysixth floor the man had nodded with a befuddled look in his eyes making lloyd grateful for the fact that he seemed stupid finally he gave a last nod and said that yes every floor had a custodial room in the identical spotthe northeast edge of the building would the custodian on that floor let him use it for his job lloyd asked the mans eyes clouded again he was silent for several moments then replied that the best thing to do was wait until the custodians went home at four then ask the guard in the lobby for the key to the storeroom that way everything would be cool lloyd thanked the man and walked into the building he checked the northeast corners of the third fifth and eighth floors finding identical doors marked maintenance the doors themselves looked solid but there was lots of wedge space at the lock if no witnesses were around it would be easy with two hours to kill before the custodial crew left work lloyd took service stairs down to ground level then walked to a medical supply store on pico and beverly drive and purchased a pair of surgical rubber gloves walking back slowly to century city all thoughts of the goffherzog bergenchristie labyrinth left his mind replaced by an awareness of one of his earliest insights crime was a thrill stationed in the shade of a plastic tree on the astroturf lawn in front of his target lloyd saw a dozen men wearing maintenance uniforms exit the building at exactly he waited for ten minutes and when no others appeared grabbed his toolbox and walked in straight past the guard and over to the service stairs next to the elevators donning his gloves the second he hit the privacy of the empty stairwell breathing deeply he treaded slowly up twentysix stories and pushed through a connecting doorway finding himself directly across from suite the hallway was empty and silent lloyd got his bearings and assumed a casual gait as he walked past dr john havillands door when he got to the maintenance room he scanned the hallway one time then took the crowbar from his tool kit and wedged it into the juncture of door and jamb he leaned forward with all his weight and the door snapped open the storeroom was six feet deep and packed with brooms mops and industrial chemicals lloyd stepped inside and flicked on the light switch then closed the door and loaded his hand drill with a twoinch bit squatting he pressed the start switch and jammed the bit into the door two feet above floor level pushing the drill forward and rotating it clockwise simultaneously he bored a hole that was inconspicuously small yet provided a solid amount of air hitting the kill switch he sat down and tried to get comfortable seven oclock was the earliest safe breakin time until then all he could do was wait swallowed up by darkness lloyd listened to the sounds of departing office workers checking their departures against the luminous dial of his wristwatch there was a deluge at five others at fivethirty and six after that it was uninterrupted silence at seven lloyd got up and stretched then opened the storeroom door halfway reaccustoming his eyes to light when all his senses readjusted he picked up his tool kit and walked down the hall to suite the lock was a single unit steel wraparound with the key slot inset in the doorknob lloyd tried his burglars picks first starting with the shortest and working up getting inside the keyhole but jamming short of the activator button this left the options of drilling or jimmying lloyd gauged the odds of individual suites in a security building having individual alarms and decided that the odds were in his favor he got out his skinnyhead crowbar and pried the door open darkness and silence greeted him lloyd shut the door quietly brushing slivers of cracked wood off the doorjamb and onto the outer office carpet he fumbled for the wall switch found it and lit up the waiting room linda wilhite beamed down from the walls lloyd blew her a kiss then tried the door to havillands private office it was unlocked he flicked off the waiting room light and took a penlight from his pocket letting its tiny beam serve as his directional finder whispering lets go real slow lets be real cool he walked inside playing his light over the walls lloyd caught flashes of highly varnished oak framed diplomas and the edward hopper painting he had seen on his initial visit arcing his light at waist level he circuited the entire room picking up bookcases filled with leatherbound medical texts straightbacked chairs facing each other and havillands ornate oak desk no filing cabinets thinking safe lloyd felt along the walls stopping to read the diplomas before reaching behind them harvard medical school st vincents and castleford hospitals east coast money all the way but nothing except wood paneling in back of them lloyd slid back the hopper painting and hit pay dirt then slammed the wall when he saw that the safe was an armbruster ultimate triple leadlined and impregnable it was the shrinks desk or nothing lloyd moved to the desk holding the penlight with his teeth and getting out his burglars picks he grabbed the top drawer to hold it steady for the insertion then nearly fell backward when it slid open in his hand the drawer was stuffed with pens blank paper and paper clips and a bottom layer of manila folders lloyd pulled them out and scanned the index tabs stuck to their upper right hand corners typed last names first names and middle initials patients there were five folders all of them filled with loose pages seeing that the first three bore womens names lloyd put them aside and read through the fourth learning that william a waterston iii had difficulty relating to women because of his relationship with his domineering grandmother and that he and havilland had been exploring the problem twice a week for six years at the rate of one hundred and ten dollars per hour lloyd scrutinized the photograph that accompanied the psychiatric rundown waterston did not sound or look like the type of man who would know thomas goff he looked like an aristocratic nerd who needed to get laid lloyd checked the index tab on the last file seeing that a string of aliases forced the typist to move from the tab onto the front of the folder oldfield richard aka richard brown aka richard green aka richard goff the last alias went through lloyd like a convulsion he opened the folder a color snapshot was attached to the first page a head and shoulders shot of a man who resembled thomas goff to a degree that fell just short of twinhood lloyd read through the entire fourteen pages of the file shuddering when the facts of the resemblance were made clear richard oldfield was thomas goffs illegitimate halfbrother the result of a union between goffs mother and a wealthy upstate new york textile manufacturer he had entered therapy with dr john havilland four years before his lovehate relationship with his halfbrother his salient neurosis thomas goff was a brilliant criminal richard oldfield a stockbrokerremittance man living largely on stipends shamed and coerced out of his father by goffs alcoholic mother who had raised the two boys together after wading through long paragraphs of psychiatric ruminations lloyd felt the blood theme emerge richard oldfields desire to emulate thomas goff had driven him to undertake a sporadic criminal career burglarizing homes known to contain art objects acting on information from stock exchange acquaintances hence the stanley rudolph connection obscured by havillands cowardly manipulations he wanted to surrender the goff connection to police scrutiny without divulging the name of his patient richard oldfields occasional usage of his half brothers name was what havilland termed crosspurpose identificationthe desire to assume a persons identity and act out both loved and hated aspects of their personalities thereby restoring order to their own psyches resolving the lovehatred ambivalence into an acceptable norm reading the file a second time paying close attention to the most recently dated additions lloyd learned that oldfields surrender to the goff psyche was becoming more pronounced assuming pathological dimensions goff hated women and prowled bars looking for ones to abuse oldfield paid prostitutes to let him beat them goff hated policemen and spoke often of his desire to kill them oldfield now aped his half brothers broadsides the last file entry was dated slightly over two months earlier and stated that richard oldfield was assuming the proportions of the classic paranoidschizophrenic criminal type lloyd put the folder down wondering if oldfield had discontinued therapy in february or if havilland had more data on him elsewhere he rummaged through the other drawers until he found a metal rolodex file oldfields address and phone number were right there under the os windemere hollywood lloyd sat still for a full minute fuming at the fact that his illegal entry would destroy the possibility of ever hanging an accessory rap on havilland then he thought of richard oldfield and went calm beneath his rage putting the files back in their proper place and sorting the ramifications of the b ampe he picked up the tool kit and made for the door thinking dont let havilland know that his secrets have been plundered dont give him reason to warn oldfield who might warn goff cover your tracks lloyd looked at the splintered doorjamb and calculated more odds then got out his crowbar and padded over to the door of the adjoining suite thinking just do it he pried the door open only the sound of cracking wood assailed him he hit the next door and the door after that then heard the blare of an alarm cut through the echoes of his destruction the noise grew then leveled off to a piercing drone lloyd grabbed his tool kit and ran toward the maintenance storeroom checking the elevator bank as he passed it the flashing numbers on top said that armed help was on the sixth floor and ascending rapidly lloyd opened the storeroom door then let it close halfway he paced off three yards to the service stairs across the hallway and closed the door behind him leaving himself just enough of a crack to peer through seconds later he heard the elevator door open followed by the sounds of running footsteps and strained breathing drawing nearer when he saw a single uniformed guard draw his gun and step cautiously inside the storeroom he nudged his door open and hurled himself across the hallway pushing the storeroom door shut there was a panicked what the fuck from the guard trapped inside and then six shots tore through the door and ricocheted down the hallway lloyd stepped inside the service stairs picked up his toolbox and hurtled down twentysix stories to ground level chest heaving and soaked with sweat he pushed the connecting door into the lobby open no one he walked out the door and across the astroturf lawn to century park east restraining himself by assuming a nothingtohide gait he was safely inside his unmarked cruiser when he heard the wail of sirens converge on the scene of his crime with shaking hands he drove to the hollywood hills windemere drive was a residential side street in the shadow of the hollywood bowl onestory tudor cottages dominated the block and the sidewalk was free of tree and shrub overhang it was a good surveillance spot lloyd parked at the corner and circled the block on foot no yellow toyota coming back around he flashed his penlight at the numbers stenciled on the curb was two doors down from where he had left his car on the opposite side of the street he checked his watch at the stucco and wood tudor house was pitch dark he walked back to his unmarked matador and grabbed the ithaca pump stashed under the drivers seat after jacking a shell into the chamber he walked over to and rang the doorbell no answer and no light coming from inside lloyd pressed his face to the front picture window heavy curtains blocked his vision hugging close to the walls he padded across the porch and around the driveway to the backyard no car thick drapes covering all the windows the opposite side of the house was shielded from foot access by an overgrown hedge connected to the house next door lloyd craned his neck to get a quick look glimpsing more darkened windows sounds from brightly lit neighboring dwellings underlined s lack of habitation he walked back to his car to wait slouching low in the drivers seat lloyd waited keeping a sustained eyeball fix on it was almost an hour later that a white mercedes pulled to the curb in front of the house a man too tall to be thomas goff and a woman in a white nurses uniform got out and moved into a sidebyside lovers drape the woman squealed as the man nuzzled her neck together they walked up the steps and into the house a light glowed behind the heavy curtains as the door was shut lloyd stared at the curtains and thought of the woman if she was a prostitute oldfield would probably pay her to stand his abuse but that didnt click her uniform and affectionate manner spelled girlfriend or pickup keeping his impatience at bay by concentrating on the need not to risk the womans safety lloyd settled in to wait out the night laughing voices and a burst of light cut across the night trippers field of vision casting a rainbow haze over his infrared image of lloyd hopkins slouching in the front seat of his car he put down the magnification lens he was holding to his eye and smiled hello sherry hello richard he said sherry giggled hi lloyd her uniform was a size too small and looked like it would split down the middle should she attempt anything more strenuous than walking in a straight line she sniffed back a wad of mucous and giggled again havilland smiled coked to the gills he sized up his leading man oldfield stood with his back up against the bolted door in a posture that reminded the doctor of a staunch medieval warrior trying to keep demons at bay never guessing that they resided inside him last night havilland had called him to his malibu grouping retreat and had primed him for his performance by whispering death poems in his ear while he scrubbed howard christies blood from the seats of his volvo the recitation had had a calming effect on them both and now richard oldfield was a quiet nuclear warhead sherry laughed and undid the top button of her uniform blouse oldfield walked to the middle of the living room and said ready when you are cb sherry giggled at the remark havilland could hear traces of stage fright he walked to oldfield and threw an arm around his shoulder hold on just a minute will you sherry i want to talk to your costar alone sherry nodded and kicked off her shoes the doctor led oldfield back to the bedroom and swept an arm toward its new furnishings isnt it wonderful richard one of your cocounselees helped me set it up while you were asleep out at the retreat oldfield darted his eyes over white velvet curtains shuttering the windows his mattress removed from the bedstead and centered on the middle of the floor covered with light blue silk sheets a movie camera on a tripod with its gaze zeroing downward he dry swallowed and whispered please take me as far as i can go havilland embraced him letting his lips touch his ear yes you helped me last night richard i was afraid you took me through that fear just as i have taken you through your fears just one reminder when she abuses you think of all the abuse that governess made you take as a child keep your fuel intake at optimum right up until the moment now wait here the doctor walked back into the living room sherry shroeder was sitting on the couch her uniform top completely unbuttoned i didnt know whether or not to strip she said sitting down beside her havilland said not yet button up your outfit while i give you directions he put a hand on her knee as she fumbled at her top what we are filming is a variation on the corny old nurse routine you know nurses are supposed to be very experienced because they know so much about bodies sherry laughed havilland noticed that her nervousness had subsided squeezing her knee gently he said this variation is the nurse spanking the boy who of course is richardreally a manand then getting so aroused that she has to seduce him what i want you to do is pull down richards pants and spank him hard very hard then do the most seductive striptease you are capable of after that ill give both of you more specific instructions do you understand sherry waggled her eyebrows i used to play tennis when i was a little girl ive got a great backhand she laughed and covered her mouth richards got a really sharp bod wheres the camera guy well havilland said to be frank i cant afford one so im filling in you and richard came too high so to cut costs im standing in behind the camera myself i sherry poked a teasing finger in the doctors ribs come on lloyd as gary gilmore said lets do it they walked into the bedroom oldfield was sprawled on his back across the mattress fully clothed havilland got behind the camera adjusting the tripod and swiveling the lens until the mattress was captured in a wideangle shot clearing his throat he said since this is a silent movie please feel free to talkbut quietly i dont want to upset the neighbors he turned the camera on and listened to the whir of film sherry you know what to do richard follow sherrys lead but position your face on the near side of the mattress so i can get some close shots okay action sherry sat down on the edge of the mattress facing the camera she extended her legs in front of her resting her heels on the floor patting her lap she said come on you bad boy oldfield obeyed getting to his feet and loosening his belt then lying down across sherrys legs positioning his buttocks just above her knees bad bad boy she said as she pulled down his pants and undershorts bad bad boy havilland zoomed in for a closeup reaction shot just as sherrys first slap hit naked flesh oldfield grimaced harder sherry the doctor said sherry redoubled her efforts grunting bad bad boy each time her palm made contact oldfields lensframed eyes contracted with the blows havilland hissed harder sherry harder remember your tennis stroke bad bad bad bad boy sherry brought her hand down full force oldfields eyes glazed over and dry spittle formed at the corners of his mouth havilland took his eye from the camera and saw that raised red dots were forming on his buttocks bad bad bad bad bad boy cut the doctors own shout startled him cut he repeated softly thats a print richard go wait in the hall sherry step off the mattress and do your striptease the actors obeyed oldfield drawing himself to his feet and cinching his pants without meeting sherrys eyes sherry kneading her flushed right hand when richard was outside the bedroom havilland said be your sexiest and swung the camera up now he said sherry shroeder began to undress plucking at the buttons on her uniform she took off her blouse and dropped it on the floor then snagged the zipper at the back of her skirt jerking it loose she muttered shit then caught herself and pouted at the camera stepping out of the skirt and twirling it on a finger above her head letting it drop she unhooked her bra and pulled down her stockings and panties nude she did a pelvis grinding dance step that caused her breasts to shake in opposite directions covered with goosebumps she silently mouthed song lyrics and tried to pout at the same time zooming in for a closeup the doctor thought that he could detect the words to green door cut again the doctors own voice jolted him lie down sherry he said richard you can come in now oldfield reentered the bedroom naked holding his hands over his genitals havilland pointed to the bed then shut off the camera and checked the expended film cylinder film to burn he framed a long shot of the mattress and the two performers on it then locked in the tripod and said im a little shy so ill let you pros do what comes naturally ill come back and check on you in a few minutes sherry laughed and oldfield flinched havilland flipped the automatic forward switch and walked out to the dining room poking his infrared lens through a crack in the curtains he saw his best actor perform lloyd hopkins stuffed fat with bait was still sitting inside his car still staring daggers at the house the allusions to illegal searches in his personnel file had been accuratehe was not above committing crime to solve crimes he was a hypocritical snake and a cowardly oneundoubtedly afraid of approaching his suspect for fear of jeopardizing the fair damsel in the bedroom havilland watched him yawn scratch and stretch without ever taking his eyes from the tudor cottage each tiny move was like a laser beam piercing the childhood void checking his watch the doctor saw that ten minutes had passed he walked to the bedroom sherry and richard were lying on opposite sides of the mattress he turned the camera off and stared at his performers sherry was positioned on one elbow an arm across her breasts richard lay rock still eyes closed twitching we did it soft sherry said i think we faked it pretty good richard couldnt you know but i think it still looked okay if you want we can try again and shoot some hard shots havilland walked to the bedroom closet and ran his hand over a ledge at the back coming away with a thick roll of adhesive bandage no that does it except for some clothed shots i want to get you can get dressed now really really ill give you the rest of your money in a minute richards eyes twitched open at the phrase he got to his feet and stretched then pulled on his pants and shirt and took the tape from the doctors hand thank you for helping me go beyond my beyond he said havilland looked into his eyes and saw frozen rage he focused the camera at sherry and hit the on switch sherry finished buttoning her blouse and said lloyd can we make this quick theres a party in the valley at eleventhirty and since this was quicker than i thought id like to make it havilland nodded assent and telescoped the lens so that sherrys face was held in an extreme closeup now richard he said the viewfinder went black as richard oldfield hurled himself beyond his beyond a highpitched shriek died into a struggle for breath crashing bodies caused a blank wall to sway before the cameras eye the night tripper tried to refocus then gave up richard pinned sherry to the floor with his knees one hand holding her head the other swirling tape up from her mouth to her nose when both passages were shut air tight he stood up and watched her face turn red then blue and her arms and legs flail soon her entire body became a collective gasp her torso pushing off the floor in an adrenalinefueled death throe oldfield fell to his knees and pummeled the flailing body throwing rightleft combinations at the groin and ribcage until all resistance ended in a last shudder of asphyxiation now weeping he stood up on wobbly legs and saw the doctor with the camera strapped to his shoulder bending down pulling the bandage off of sherry shroeders face now richard now richard now richard the night tripper was holding out a silencerfitted revolver richard took it in his hand then looked down seeing the dead womans face covered with a transparent plastic pillow now richard now richard now richard the camera zoomed in and whirred oldfield pressed the barrel to the pillow and pulled the trigger there was a dull plop then the hiss of escaping air then a spread of crimson as the deflated plastic filled with blood yes richard yes richard yes richard the night tripper steadied the camera pushing the eyepiece out of his way he took the gun from richards hand and flipped the cylinder open letting the spent round fall to the floor the bronx ferris wheel became a whirling corkboard he took two fresh rounds from his pocket and placed them in adjoining chambers then flicked the cylinder shut and spun it richard oldfield stood slackjawed swaying to selfcontained music the night tripper took a dodger baseball cap and howard christies badge from his jacket placing the cap on richards head pinning the badge to his left breast pocket he placed the camera back on the tripod then filmed closeups of the badge the cap and richards face thinking of linda wilhite and toppling chess pieces he picked the gun up off the floor and placed it in richards right hand getting back behind the camera he said do you feel complete now richard yes richard said articulate how you feel i feel as if ive conquered my past that ive broken through all my green doors with the promise of peace as my reward will you go one step further for me it will help a beautiful woman to resolve her nightmares yes name it stick the gun in your mouth and pull the trigger twice richard obeyed without question the hammer clicked on empty chambers the night tripper captured his finest moment on film then ran to the dining room curtains and looked out with his bloodcolored lens lloyd hopkins was asleep his head cradled into the halfopen car window lloyd awoke at dawn startled out of a dreamless sleep by a sharp cramp in his leg rubbing his calf he looked out of the car window and saw the tudor cottage and the white mercedes parked in the same spot as the night before oldfields shackup was still in progress he had time to go home and call for reinforcements to aid him in a continued surveillance and possible approach lloyd swung his matador around and pulled up behind the mercedes he wrote down the license number then called r ampi on his twoway radio and read it off requesting a complete readout on both vehicle and owner after three minutes of static crackle the operator came back on the air with her information fhm no wants no warrants registered to richard brian oldfield windemere la no wants no warrants no criminal record discouraged and exhausted despite his hours of sleep lloyd drove home thinking of a shave shower and lots of coffee a threeday accumulation of newspapers greeted him on his front porch the previous days la times bore a banner headline policeman murdered in malibu a sidebar added execution style death for lapd lieutenant lloyd kicked the papers aside and unlocked the door seeing the stapled together notebook pages on the floor immediately picking them up he read memo to lloyd from dutch read now lwhere have you been shacking i thought you turned over a new leaf im your

wearing his b ampe outfit he drove straight to a liquor store as he recalled hubert douglas was a bonded sourmash fiend a pint of jack daniels seemed like the ticket to soothe his soul and loosen his tongue after purchasing the bottle he raced downtown to parker center hubert douglas was being held in an interrogation cubicle adjoining fred gaffaneys office lloyd looked through the oneway glass and saw him sitting across a table from the captain dressed in security guards uniform replete with gold epaulets and a sam browne belt a loudspeaker about the window crackled with his story of comesanchin the chinese cocksucker gaffaney listened with his head bowed fingering his crossandflag tie bar lloyd walked in the door just as douglas delivered his punch line and doubled over with laughter slapping the table and exclaiming dig it dig it seeing lloyd he said hopkins my man and got up and extended his hand lloyd took it and said hello hubert my colleagues treating you okay douglas nodded toward gaffaney who looked up and glared at lloyd this joker keeps asking me questions i keep tellin him ill talk to you and he keeps tellin me you out of touch the heavy implication

mug shots now the captain walked into his office flushing from his neck all the way up to his crew cut returning to lloyd and handing him the mugshot strip he hissed dont make douglas any promises of leniency lloyd gave his superior officer a guileless smile no sir when gaffaney walked back to his office he entered the cubicle and flipped off the loudspeaker lets make a deal he said to hubert douglas placing the pint of jack daniels on the table between them tell me what i want to know and you walk fuck me around and i hotfoot it up to narco division and glom a pound of reefer to add to

khe sahn i seen lots of death this fucker looked worse than the terminal yellow jaundice battle fatigue walkin dead over there he was righteous fuckin death on a popsicle stick lloyd let the barrage of words settle in on him knowing that they confirmed thomas goffs melbourne avenue horror show and possibly the killing of howard christie but that they somehow contradicted the revelation of richard oldfield and his sibling rivalry with goff he said kill the jug hubert youve earned it and walked out into the hallway a secretary passed him and said captain gaffaney went to lunch sergeant he left your query reply with the duty officer lloyd thanked the woman and nonchalantly walked into gaffaneys office a plastic bag of marijuana tagged with an official evidence sticker was lying on his desk he pulled off the sticker and put it in his pocket then opened the window and hurled the bag out into the middle of los angeles street where it came to rest in the bed of a passing dodge pickup support your local police lloyd called out when only traffic noise answered him he walked by the interrogation cubicle and gave hubert douglas the thumbs up sign douglas grinned through the open doorway and raised his empty pint in farewell lloyd took the elevator down to the first floor and walked to the front information desk the duty officer did a double take on his outfit and handed him a slip of paper he leaned against the desk and read subject dob la calif driv lic issued no moving violations no wants warrants or record in cont us squeaky cleanfg lloyd felt nameless little clicks assail him he put his mind through a twentyfourhour instant replay until he hit the source of his confusion thomas goff was born and raised and sent to prison in new york state havillands psychiatric report on his halfbrother richard oldfield stated that their mother raised the two boys together presumably in new york yet this computer runthrough fixed oldfields place of birth as los angeles also oldfield was issued a california drivers license in shortly after his sixteenth birthday which at least hinted at longterm california residency lloyd grabbed the desk phone and dialed dutchs office number at the hollywood station captain peltz speaking its me dutch you busy where the hell have you been did you get my memo yeah i got it listen i need your help twoman stakeout on a pad near the hollywood bowl its got to be very cool no unmarked units nothing that smacks of heat i dont want to approach this guy just yet i only want him pinned this guy who the hell is this guy ill tell you about him when i see you can you meet me at my place in an hour i want to change clothes and grab my civilian wheels dutch sighed ive got a meeting in half an hour make it two hours lloyd sighed back deal driving home his little clicks worked themselves into the tapestry of the case assuming the shape of a man who might or might not be richard oldfield a man adept at manipulating violent men in order to achieve his purpose which now emerged as the accruing of potential blackmail knowledge fact jack herzog had stolen six lapd personnel files for his personal aim of vindicating marty bergen and had told his girlfriend that he was really scared in the days before his disappearancemurdersuicide bergen considered his best friends attempt at vindication ridiculous and had destroyed the columns the files had inspired yet thomas goff andor his still unknown hotshot really smart accomplicepartner had used the lapd information to cunningly circumvent captain dan murray wresting confidential file copies from his stooge hubert douglas killing lieutenant howard christie probably for his refusal to deliver the files or on the basis of his demands for exorbitant amounts of money this evidential and theoretical narrative line was cohesive and arrow straight but it contradicted most of his instincts regarding thomas goff goff was obsessed with his revolver he had used it on the three liquor store victims a crime still lacking a motive he had fired it at lloyd himself its singleaction clumsiness giving him away yet howard christie was killed with his own gun goff assuming he was the killer had eschewed a violent pattern in a time of stress grabbing a weapon from a seasoned police officer then shooting him with it it didnt wash the christie job had the earmarks of a killing perpetrated by a novice someone who had lulled the cop security chief into considering him harmlessnot the fever or dopedriven goff this left four potential suspectsherzog havilland bergen and oldfield the first three were ridiculous prospects herzog was a ninetynine percent sure dead man havilland a love and consciencestruck coincidental link with no motives bergen a pathetic guiltridden drunk only oldfield remained and even he was shot full of logical holes his blood relationship with goff was of course the key tiein still hearsay evidence indicated that goff was dominated by his unknown partner while havillands psychological workup portrayed oldfield as being subservient to goff and the fact that he strongly resembled goff and still walked around the streets pointed to his innocence if he were goffs accomplice he would know that every cop in southern california was looking for his mirror image he would not go out and cruise for comely nurses to bring back to his pad lloyd hit the harbor freeway southbound feeling his clicks work into truth he was dealing with two killers two men whose drives had spawned an apocalypse the chess game progressed the lonelies had been tapped for data purchasing capital and tonight with his copadversary dead he would inject himself with sodium pentothal and images of his past hours and make the void explode the homecoming was in sight the night tripper stood on his balcony and stared at the ocean then closed his eyes and let the sound of waves crashing accompany a rush of fresh images hopkins departing windemere drive at dawn the industrialsized trashbag containing sherry shroeder thumping against richard oldfields shoulder as he carried it to his car the sated look on richards face as they lowered her to her grave in the shadow of the hollywood sign satisfying moments but not as fulfilling as watching his lonely billy develop and then edit his movie into a comingling of linda wilhites childhood trauma and adult fantasy billy had at first warmed to the challenge of a rush job then had become frightened when sherry shroeder died in his developing room it had taken a brilliantly adlibbed therapy session to see him through completion of the assignment opening his eyes havilland recalled the days minor testimonials to his will the manager of his office building had called his condo with the news that he had been burglarized and that workmen were now repairing the damage to his front office door his answering service had an urgent call me message from linda wilhite those telephone tidings had been such obvious capitulations to his power that he had succumbed to their symbolism and had used the beach phone to call the lonelies with an assessment requestten thousand dollars per person they had all answered yes with doglike servility let the capitulations continue the night tripper walked over to the kitchen wall phone and punched linda wilhites number when he heard her hello he said john havilland linda my service said that you needed to speak to me lindas voice took on force doctor i realize that this is short notice but i want to let you know that im quitting therapy youve opened me up to lots of things but i want to fly solo from here on in havilland breathed the words in when he breathed his own words out they sounded appropriately choked with sentiment im very sad to hear that linda we were making such progress are you sure you want to do this im positive doctor i see would you agree to one more session a special session with visual aids its my standard procedure for final sessions and its essential to my form of therapy doctor my days are very tied up theres lots of would tonight be all right my office at seven its imperative we conclude this therapy on the right foot and the session will be free sighing linda said all right but ill pay havilland said goodbye and hung up then punched another seven digits and began hyperventilating yes hopkinss voice was expectant sergeant this is john havilland strange things have been happening my office was broken into and besides that my source just contacted me iii calm down doctor just take it slow ii was going to say that i still cant give you his name but goff contacted him because he heard that he was in need of a gun and some money goff owed him the money and the gun are in a locker box at the greyhound bus depot downtown frfrankly sergeant my source is afraid of a setup hes considering returning to therapy so i was able to get this information out of him hehe has a strange relationship with goffits frfraternal almost did he give you the number of the box yes fouronesix the key is supposed to be with the man at the candy counter directly across from the row of lockers goff gave it to him yesterday my man told me you did the right thing doctor ill take care of it dr john havilland replaced the receiver thinking of richard oldfield stationed in the bar across from box armed with lloyd hopkinss personnel file photo and an uzi submachine gun lloyd was leadfooting it northbound on the harbor freeway when he realized that he had forgotten to leave dutch a note explaining his absence he slammed the dashboard with his palm and began shouting obscenities then heard his cursing drowned out by the wail of sirens looking in his rearview mirror he saw three blackandwhites roar past with cherry lights flashing heading for the downtown exits wondering why he flipped on his twoway radio when a squelch filtered voice barked all units all units code three to the bus depot sixth and los angeles shot fired he shuddered back a wave of nausea and joined the fray sixth and los angeles streets were a solid wall of doubleparked patrol cars lloyd parked on the sidewalk outside the bus terminals south entrance and ran in past a bewilderedlooking group of patrolmen carrying shotguns they were jabbering among themselves and one tall young officer kept repeating psycho fucking psycho as he fondled the slide of his ithaca pump pushing through a knot of unkempt civilians milling around in front of the ticket counters lloyd saw a uniformed sergeant writing in a spiral notebook he tapped him on the shoulder and said hopkins robbery homicide what have we got the sergeant grinned we got a machinegun nut case a wino was checking the doors of the lockers across the walkway from the gin mill by the sixth street entrance when this psycho runs out of the bar and starts shooting the wino wasnt hit but the lockers were torn up and an old bag lady got grazed by a ricochet the meat wagon took her to central receiving the juicehounds inside the bar said it sounded like a tommy gunrattattattattattattattat my partner is at the gin mill now taking statements from the wino and potential witnesses rattattattattattattattat lloyd felt little clicks resound to the beat of the sergeants sound effects is there a candy counter directly across from the shooting scene yessir what about the suspect probably long gone the wino said he tucked the burpgun under his coat and ran out to sixth easy to get lost out there lloyd nodded and ran to the hallway by the sixth street entrance gray metal lockers with coin slots and tiny key holes covered one entire wall the opposite all inset with narrow cubicles where vendors dispensed souvenirs candy and porno magazines checking the lockers close up he saw that numbers through were riddled with bullet dents and as he had suspected the bar the gunman had run out of was directly across from crossing to the bar lloyd eyeballed the man at the candy counter catching a copwise look on his face doing a quick pivot he walked over and stuck out his hand police officer i believe someone left a key for me the candy man went pale and stammered iididnt think thered be no gunplay officer the guy just asked me if i wanted to make twenty scoots for holding on to the key then whipping it on the guy who asked for it i didnt want no part of no shooting the fury of his mental clicking made lloyd whisper are you telling me that the man who gave you the key is the man who fired off the machine gun ththats right this dont make me no kind of accessory after the fact does it lloyd took out a wellthumbed mug shot of thomas goff is this the man the candy man shook his head affirmatively and then negatively yes and no this guy looks enough like him to be his brother but the gun guy had a skinnier face and a longer nose its a real close resemblance but i gotta say no taking the key from the vendors shaking hands lloyd said with a shaking voice describe the wino the gunman fired at thats easy officer he was a big husky guy ruddy complexion dark hair he looked kinda like you the final click went off like a flashing neon sign that spelled fool patsy dupe sucker bait it was havilland the setup was for him not oldfield it was perpetrated by oldfield not goff whatever the unrevealed intricacies of the case havilland had set him up from the beginning acting on knowledge of his methods gathered from his lapd file the shrink had set up the psychiatric report on oldfield as a calculated move based on old hollywood division fitness reports that had mentioned his penchant for search methods of dubious legality he had been strung out from before their first meeting the night tripper albums and the linda wilhite office photos ploys with linda and stanley rudolph and goff and oldfield and herzog and how many others dangling on their own puppet strings as the doctors willing or unwitting accomplices the simple brilliance of it was overpowering he had pinioned himself to a steel wall with selfconstructed steel spikes before the spikes could draw more blood lloyd walked to box and inserted the key the door jammed briefly then came open inside was a colt python and a roll of twenty dollar bills held together with a rubber band he picked the gun up the cylinder was empty but the barrel exuded a faint odor of paraffin and the underside of the vent housing bore a plastic sticker reading christielapd the spikes dug in again wielded from within and without lloyd slammed the locker door shut and drove to parker center he found the sixthfloor iad offices packed with detectives and civilian personnel a uniformed officer passed him in the hallway and threw words of explanation my partner and i just brought in marty bergen grabbed him in macarthur park feeding the ducks he waived his rights some internal affairs bulls are getting ready to pump him lloyd ran to the attorney room at the end of the hall a knot of plainclothes officers were staring through the oneway glass squeezing in beside them he saw marty bergen fred gaffaney a stenographer and an unidentified woman who had the air of a deputy public defender sitting around a table covered with pencils and yellow legal pads the woman was whispering in bergens ear while the stenographer poised fingers over his machine gaffaney worried his tie bar and drummed the tabletop noticing wires running along the ceiling wainscoting lloyd nudged the officer nearest him and said is there a backup transcription going down the officer nodded tape hookup to the skippers office hes got another steno at his desk headphones speaker lloyd took out his notepad and wrote john havilland md office century park eastall phone s from business amp residence calls for past mos then walked down the hall and rapped on the glass door of fred gaffaneys outer office when his secretary opened it and gave him a harried look he handed her the notepad the captain wants me to listen in on the interview could you do me a favor and call ma bell and get this information the woman frowned the captain told me not to leave the office some marijuana that constituted evidence was stolen earlier he had to release a suspect and he was very angry about it lloyd smiled thats a rough break but this request is direct from thad braverton ill hold down the fort the womans frown deepened all right but please keep all unauthorized people out she closed her hand around the notepad and walked off in the direction of the elevator bank lloyd locked the door from the inside and moved to the captains private office a grandmotherly stenographer was sitting at the desk pecking at her machine while gaffaneys sternly enunciated words issued from a wall speaker above her head and legal counsel is present before we begin this interview mr bergen do you have anything you wish to say lloyd pulled up a chair and smiled at the stenographer who put a finger to her lips and pointed to the speaker just as a burst of electronically amplified laughter hit the room followed by marty bergens voice yeah i wish to go on the record as saying that your tie clasp sucks if the lapd were a just bureaucracy you would be indicted on five counts of aesthetic bankruptcy possession of fascist regalia and general low class proceed with your interview captain gaffaney cleared his throat thank you for that unsolicited comment mr bergen proceeding i will state some specific facts you may formally object if you consider my facts erroneous one you are martin d bergen age fortyfour you were dismissed from the los angeles police department after sixteen years of service while on the department you became friends with officer jacob m herzog currently missing are these facts correct yes bergen said good again proceeding six days ago you were questioned by an lapd detective as to the current whereabouts of officer herzog you told the officer that you had not seen herzog in approximately a month and that on the occasions of your last meetings herzog had been moody is that correct yes again proceeding do you wish to alter your statement to that officer in any way bergens voice was a cold whisper yes i do jack herzog is dead he killed himself with an overdose of barbiturates i discovered his body at his apartment along with a suicide note i buried him in a rock quarry up near san berdoo lloyd heard bergens attorney gasp and begin jabbering words of caution at her client bergen shouted no goddamn it i want to tell it there was a crescendo of voices with gaffaneys finally predominating do you remember where you buried the body yes bergen said ill take you there if you like the speaker went silent then slowly came to life with the sound of animated whispers finally gaffaney said not wanting to put words in your mouth mr bergen would you say that the previous statement you made to the police regarding officer herzog was misleading or incorrect what i told hopkins was pure bullshit bergen said when i talked to him jack was already three weeks in his grave you see i thought i could walk from all this then it started eating at me i went on a drunk to sort it out if those cops hadnt found me i would have come forward before too long this has got to be heavy shit that jack was involved in or you wouldnt have put out an apb on me i figure that youve got me for two misdemeanorssome jive charge for disposing of jacks body and receiving stolen documents so just ask your questions or let me make my statement so i can get charged and make bail okay fred baby there was another long silence this one broken by fred gaffaney talk bergen ill interject questions if i find them necessary breath noise filled the speaker lloyds body clenched in anticipation just when he thought he would snap from tension bergen said jack was always stretched very thin because he didnt have the outlets that other cops have he didnt booze or carouse or chase pussy he just read and brooded and competed with himself wanting to be like these warrior mystics he worshipped he got on mental kicks and ran wild with them for about six months prior to his death he was obsessed with this notion of exonerating me by creating this lapd credibility gapshowing the department in a bad light so that the shame of my dismissal would be diminished by comparison he talked it up and talked it up and talked it up because he was a hero and since he loved me he had to turn me from a coward into a hero to make our friendship real about this time he met some guy in a bar the guy introduced him to another guy a guy that jack called a filehappy genius this guy was some kind of guru who charged big bucks to all these sad guruworshipper types helping them with their problems and so forth he convinced jack to steal some personnel files that would suit their individual purposesjacks credibility gap and the gurus loony hunger for confidential information jack showed me the files four of them were brass working outside security gigs where more personnel files were involved one was johnny rolando the tv guy and the other was you know lloyd hopkins jack figured that the information in these files would comprise a sleazy picture of the lapd and satisfy the gurus needs do you still have the files gaffaney asked no bergen said i read them and gave them back to jack i tried to put the information to use in a series of columns as a memorial tribute to him but finally i decided that it was just a tribute to his disturbance and gave up on the idea tell me more about this socalled guru and his friend all right first off i dont know either of their names but i do know that the guru was counseling jack helping to bring him through some things that were disturbing him the guru used ambiguous phrases like beyond the beyond and behind the green door which is an old song title both those phrases were included in jacks suicide note lloyd grabbed the telephone and dialed a number that he knew was a ninetynine percent sure bet to confirm havillands complicity all the way down the line hello turning his back on the stenographer he whispered its me linda hopkins baby listen i cant talk but the other night you whispered beyond the beyond and something about green doors where did you get those phrases from dr havilland why you sound really spaced hopkins whats all this about ill tell you later when ill come by in a couple of hours stay home and wait for me okay lindas voice went grave yes its him isnt it lloyd said yes and hung up catching bergen in midsentence so from the froth around jacks mouth i knew hed odd on barbiturates he used to say that if he ever took the night train hed never do it with his gun gaffaney sighed sergeant hopkins searched herzogs apartment and said that the surface had been wiped free of prints by scouring powder when you discovered the body did you notice any wipe marks no none do you recall the exact words of herzogs suicide note in addition to those phrases you mentioned did herzog elaborate on his reasons for killing himself this is where we part company fred baby bergen said ill tell you anything you want to know except that and you havent got the juice to get it out of me the sound of palms slamming a table top rattled the speaker on that note well break for a few hours weve prepared a detention cage for you mr bergen your attorney can keep you company if she wishes to well pick up where we left off later sergeant show mr bergen to his interim housing the speaker went dead lloyd got up and walked to the outer office window catching a glimpse of a plainclothes officer hustling marty bergen and his attorney to the stairs leading to the fifth floor detention cages bergens postconfession posture signified pure exhaustion stooped shoulders glazed eyes shuffling walk lloyd saluted his back as he rounded the corner out of sight then turned to see gaffaneys secretary tapping on the door holding up a sheaf of papers for him i got your information sergeant lloyd opened the door and took the womans pages let me explain this readout she said the supervisor got me the business and residence calls up to two days ago thats as far uptodate as their computer is fed when you go through it youll notice that only a few of the numbers have names or addresses after them thats because virtually all of this persons calls were made to pay phones isnt that strange the locations of the pay phones are listed next to the number is this what you needed lloyd felt another soft click this is excellent will you do me one other favor call the top managing supervisor at bell and have her try to get me the numbers called from both phones in the past two days have her call me at robberyhomicide with the information tell her its crucial to an important murder investigation will you do that for me yes sergeant are you going to talk with the captain i know that hes interested in what youre doing lloyd shook his head no if he needs me ill be in my office im not going to bother him with this phone business until i have something conclusive he has enough to worry about gaffaneys secretary lowered her eyes yes he works much too hard lloyd jogged up to his office wondering if the bornagain witchhunter cheated on his wife closing the door he read over the list of phone numbers dialed from havillands office and beverly hills apartment feeling his clicks collide with hubert douglass snatch of thomas goff dialogue he kept callin himself a justified paranoid and said that he covered his tracks when he took a fuckin piss just to stay in fuckin practice the pay phone calling translated to havillands justified paranoia the majority of the calls were made to phone booths situated within a quarter mile radius of the homes of jack herzog thomas goff and richard oldfield the calls to herzog began last november which coincided with marty bergens statement that herzog met the guru six months ago they ended in late march around the time of herzogs suicide the goff calls ran from the beginning of the readout until the day after the liquor store slaughter the oldfield communications all the way through until the readout terminated fortyeight hours before turning his attention to the other pay phone locations lloyd got out his thomas brothers la county street map binder hoping that his theory meshed with bergens statement about the guru charging big bucks to these sad guruworshipper types phone readout to map index to map five locations five confirmations click click click click click all five pay phones were located in shopping centers in expensive residential neighborhoodslaurel canyon sherman oaks palos verdes estates san marino and the bunker hill towers complex conclusion not counting other potential worshipper types living inside his nontollcall area of century city and beverly hills dr john havilland had at least five people perhaps innocent perhaps violently disturbed that he was counseling unanswered question citing havillands justified paranoia structure it was obvious that he wanted to be heavily buffered against any kind of scrutiny then where did he meet with his patients lloyd recalled the diplomas on havillands office wall harvard medical school two hospitals from the metropolitan new york area click click click thomas goff was new york born and bred could his association with the doctor date back to his days as a psychiatric resident all the clues lay in the past cloaked in medical secrecy lloyd imagined himself as a guruworshipper type about to write a book armed with nothing but good intentions and a telephone five minutes later that telephone became a time machine hurtling toward dr john havillands past the book ploy worked years before he became dedicated to secrecy john havilland had possessed an autobiographical bent one that was captured for posterity in the form of a harvard medical school entrance essay that his faculty advisor called the very model of both excellence in english skills and the exposition of sound motives for becoming a psychiatrist from the gushing advisors recollections of havilland and his essay lloyd learned that the guru shrink was born in scarsdale new york in and that when he was twelve his father disappeared never to be seen again leaving young john and his mother lavishly well provided for after weeks of speculating on his fathers absence john sustained a head injury that left him with fragmented memories and fantasies of the man who had sired him a patchwork quilt of truth and illusion that his alcoholic mother could not illuminate in any way recurring memory symbols of good and evilloving rides on a bronx ferris wheel and the persistent questioning of police detectivestore at john and filled him with the desire to know himself by unselfishly helping others to know themselves in at age twelve john havilland set out to become the greatest psychiatrist who ever lived lloyd let the advisor gush on learning that while at harvard med havilland studied symbolic dream therapy and wrote awardwinning papers on psychological manipulation and brainwashing techniques that during his castleford hospital residency he counseled courtreferred criminals with astounding resultsfew of the criminals ever repeated their crimes after concluding with the words and the rest of dr havillands work was performed in los angeles good luck with your book the advisor waited for a reply lloyd muttered thank you and hung up calls to castleford and st vincents hospitals proved fruitless they would not divulge information on havilland and would not state whether thomas goff had ever been treated there the only remaining telephone destination was a twelveyearold boys memory symbol of evil lloyd called the scarsdale new york police department and talked to a series of desk officers and clerk typists learning that the departments records predating had been destroyed in a fire he was about to give up when a retired officer visiting the station came on the line the man told lloyd that some time back in the fifties a filthy rich scarsdale man named havilland had been the prime suspect in the murder of a sing sing prison guard named duane mcevoy who was himself a suspect in the sex murders of several young westchester county women havilland was also suspected of torching a whole block of deserted houses in an impoverished section of ossining including a ramshackle mansion that the then scarsdale police chief had described as a torture factory havilland had disappeared around the time that mcevoys knifehacked body was found floating in the hudson river so far as the retired officer knew he was never brought to justice or seen again after hanging up lloyd felt his clicking form a tight web of certainty john havilland had seized upon him as an adversary casually remarking on his resemblance to his father at their initial meeting an obsession with paternal power had led him to acquire a coterie of weakwilled offspring goff and oldfield among themthat he was molding into carriers of his own plague and dispatching on missions of horror thomas goff had probably collided with the doctor at castleford hospital some time shortly after his parole from attica havillands counseling had steered him away from the criminal tendencies that had ruled his life to that time accounting for his postattica one hundred percent clean record he had probably been havillands recruiter of guruworshipper typeshis bar prowling mo and the testimony of morris epstein and hubert douglas pointed to it lloyds clickings departed the realm of certainty and jumped into the realm of pure supposition with a wild leap that nonetheless felt right thomas goff was dead murdered by havilland after he freaked out at the liquor store with his havilland had done the interior decorating at goffs apartment leaving the doctor john the night tripper album as bait the man that goffs landlord had seen the afternoon before the police raid was oldfieldimpersonating goff havilland himself had killed howard christie fool dupe patsy chump sucker bait the reprisals jarred lloyds mind he got up and started down the hall to thad bravertons office then stopped when the door embossed with chief of detectives loomed in his path as a barrier rather than a beacon all of his evidence was circumstantial suppositional and theoretical he had no evidential basis on which to arrest dr john havilland shifting physical and mental gears lloyd walked down to the fifthfloor detention area finding marty bergen alone in the first cage staring out through the wire mesh hello marty hello hopkins come to gloat no just to say thanks for your statement it was a help to me great im sure youll make a smashing collar and carve another notch on your legend lloyd peered in at bergen the crisscrossed wire cast shadows across his face have you got any idea how big this thing is yeah i just heard most of the story too bad i cant report it who told you a source id be a shitty reporter if i didnt have sources got any leads on the guru guy lloyd nodded yes i think its almost over why didnt you tell me what you knew when i talked to you before bergen laughed because i didnt like your style i did what i had to do by coming forward hopkins so im clean dont ask me to kiss your ass lloyd gripped the wire a few inches from bergens face then kiss this motherfucker if youd talked to me before howard christie would be alive today add that one to your guilt list bergen flinched lloyd walked away letting his words hang like poisonous fallout driving west toward hollywood lloyd asked himself his remaining unanswered questions supplying instinctive answers that felt as sound as the rest of his hypothesis did john havilland know that jungle jack herzog was dead no most likely he assumed that the shame of herzogs beyond would prevent him from clueing in the world at large or the police in specific to the man who had brought him through it the wipe marks in herzogs apartment probably havilland probably the day after the liquor store murders when he realized that goff was irrevocably flipped out goff had recruited herzog so it was likely that he might have visited jungle jacks pad and left prints havilland would want that potential link to him destroyed yet the doctor had left himself vulnerable at the level of herzog lloyd forced himself to say the word out loud homosexual it was there in herzogs hero worship in his awful need to court danger as a policeman in his lack of sexual interest in his girlfriend immediately before his death bergen would not elaborate on the suicide note because that piece of paper said it explicitly illuminating havillands tragic flaw by implication he wanted jack herzog to roam the world as a testimonial to the power of a man who brought a macho cop out of the closet hatred gripped lloyd in a vice that squeezed him so hard he could feel his brains threaten to shoot out the top of his head his foot jammed the gas pedal to the floor in reflex rage and highland avenue blurred before his eyes then a line from marty bergens memorial column forced him to hit the brake and decelerate resurrect the dead on this day he smiled jungle jack herzog was going to return from beyond the beyond and frame the man who sent him to his death lloyd passed the hollywood bowl and turned onto windemere drive cursing when he saw that oldfields mercedes was not in front of his house and that a profusion of front lawn barbecues would prevent him from a quick b ampe after parking he walked over and peered in the front window finding it still covered with heavy curtains swearing again he gave the front lawn a cursory eyeballing stopping when he saw a patch of white on the otherwise green expanse he walked over the patch was a piece of adhesive bandage with a streak of what looked like congealed blood on the sticky side another soft click this one followed with a soft question mark lloyd picked the bandage up and headed south toward the purchasing of material for his frame parked outside the brass rail gun shop on la brea he took howard christies magnum from the glove compartment and checked the grips they were checkered walnut with screw fasteners at the top and bottom interchangeable but too ridged to sustain fingerprints cursing a blue streak lloyd took the gun into the shop and flashed his badge at the proprietor telling him that he wanted a large handgun with interchangeable smooth wooden grips that would also fit his magnum the proprietor got out a small screwdriver and arrayed a selection of revolvers on the counter ten minutes later lloyd was three hundred and five dollars poorer and the owner of a ruger magnum with big fat cherrywood grips the proprietor having waived the threeday waiting period on the basis of a certified police affiliation thus armed lloyd crossed his fingers and drove to a pay phone hoping that his luck was still holding it was the robberyhomicide switchboard operator had an urgent message for himcall katherine danielbell telephone extension lloyd dialed the number and seconds later was listening to a huskyvoiced woman digress on how her respect for her late policeman father had fueled her to kick ass and get him the information he needed and so i went down to the computer room and checked the current feedin on your two numbers no calls were made either yesterday or today from either the business or residence phones that got my dander up so i decided to do some checking on this guy havilland i started by checking the computer files on his phone bills going back a year and a half he paid by check on both billswith the exception of last december when a man named william nagler paid both bills i then checked this nagler guy out he paid his own bill every month plus the bill for a number in malibu he lives in laurel canyon because his checks have his address on them and his number has a laurel canyon prefix but lloyd interrupted take it slow from here on in im writing this down katherine daniel drew in a breath and said all right i was saying this guy nagler paid the bill for this number in malibufourfivetwo sixonefiveone the address is unlistedas long as nagler pays the bill on the phone there ma bell doesnt care if its in timbuctu anyway i ran a random sampling of the sixonefiveone toll calls over the past year and got a lot of the same pay phone numbers the other supervisor gave you on your earlier query i also ran the computer feedin from yesterday and today and got some toll calls all in this area code do you want them yes lloyd said slow and easy have you got names and addresses on them do you think id do a halfassed job officer lloyds forced laugh sounded hysterical to his ears no go ahead okay sixtwothree eightnineoneone helen heilbrunner bunker hill towers unit

woodbridge hollow laurel canyon foursixthree zerosixsevenzero is that it yes farewell sweet katherine husky chuckles came over the line sweating his legs weak from tension lloyd called dutchs private line at the hollywood station connecting with a desk sergeant who said that captain peltz was out for the afternoon but would be calling in hourly for his messages speaking very slowly lloyd explained what he wanted dutch was to dispatch trustworthy squadroom dicks to the following addresses and have them lay intimidating routine questioning spiels on the people who answered the door using beyond the beyond and behind the green door as buzzwords holding back william naglers name and address he read off the others having the officer repeat the message satisfied lloyd said that he would be calling back hourly to clarify the urgency of the matter with dutch and hung up now the risky part now the conscious decision to jeopardize an innocent womans life for the sake of a murder indictment an action that was an indictment of his own willingness to deny everything that had happened with teddy verplanck driving to lindas apartment lloyd prayed that she would do or say something to prove the jeopardy move right or wrong saving them both indictments on charges of cowardice or heedless will linda opened the door with a drink in one hand lloyd looked at her posture and the light in her eyes seeing indignation moving into anger a prostitute who got fucked once too often when he moved to embrace her she stepped out of his way no tell me first then dont touch me or ill lose what im feeling lloyd walked into the living room and sat down on the sofa outright scared that lindas rectitude said all systems go he pulled out the magnum and laid it on the coffee table linda took a chair and stared at the gun without flinching tell me hopkins with his eyes tuned in to every nuance of lindas reaction lloyd told the entire story of the havilland case ending with his theory of how the doctor had played off the two of them counting on at least a oneway attraction developing lindas face had remained impassive during the recounting and it was only when he finished that lloyd could tell that her gut feeling was awe jesus she said were dealing with the moby dick of psychopaths do you really think he has the hots for me or is that just part of his scam good question lloyd said i think initially it was part of the scam because he wanted to portray himself as a fellow lover of women afterwards though i think he was genuinely jealous of your attraction to me if only because he has me slotted in the role of adversary make sense you know the bastard better than i do linda considered the question then said yes my first impression of havilland was that he was essentially asexual what next hopkins and why is that gun on my table lloyd flinched inwardly linda was allaying his doubts with perfect responses and the right questions a light went on in his mind easing the constricted feeling in his chest only if she made the perfect statement voluntarily would he sanction the jeopardy gambit i have no hard evidence i cant arrest havilland and make it stick he called you today right yes how did you know that that telephone readout i mentioned what did he want i called to tell him i was quitting therapy his service forwarded the call to him he almost begged me to come for one more session i agreed when tonight at seven lloyd checked his watch one question before we get to the gun the other night you told me about your parents deaths and said that sometimes you have very dark thoughts does havilland know about that has he emphasized your parents deaths in the course of his counseling linda said yes hes obsessed with it along with some violent fantasies i have why lloyd choked back a wave of fear i need havillands fingerprints on the grips of that gun once i have them ill switch the grips to howard christies gun get havillands prints from the dmv and arrest him for murder one and make it stick while i dig up corroborative evidence i want you to take the gun to your session tonight keep it in your purse and dont touch the grips tell havilland that your fantasies are becoming more violent and that you bought a gun hand it to him nervously holding it by the cylinder housing and barrel if my reading of him is correct hell grab it by the grips showing you the proper handling procedure then give it back hold it nervously by the barrel and trigger guard and put it back in your purse after the session go home and wait for my call havilland has no idea that im on to him so youll be in no danger lindas smile reminded lloyd of penny and how she was her most beautiful in moments of rebellion you dont believe that hopkins youre shaking ill do it on one condition i want the gun loaded if havilland freaks out i want to be able to defend myself a green light flashed in response to lindas perfect voluntary statement lloyd took six shells from his jacket pocket and put them on the coffee table the moment froze and he felt himself treading air linda put a hand on his arm i think ive been waiting a long time for this she said the time machine sped backward fueled by a high octane sodium pentothal mainline calendar pages ruffled in the wind bombardments of imagery from recent gauntlets pushed the pages closer and closer until the blackonwhite type smothered him then turned him outside in saturday june johnny havilland has heard from the jds at school that an auto graveyard on the edge of ossining niggertown is a chrome treasure trove the old jig who looks after the place sells nifty hood ornaments for the price of a pint of jungle juice and if you hop the fence you can swipe something sharp and get away before he catches you jimmy vandervort got a bulldog from a mack truck for thirtynine cents fritz buckley got a gunsight hood hanger off a fortyeight buick for free flashing a moon on the spook when he demanded the scratch for some tbird johnny imagines all manner of chrome gadgetry that he could kipe and give to his father to jazz up his fiftysix ford vicky ragtop he takes a series of buses up to ossining and within an hour he is walking the streets of a negro shanty town in the shadow of sing sing prison the streets remind him of photographs he has seen of hiroshima after uncle sam slipped the japs the abomb rubble heaps on the front lawns of abandoned houses gutters filled with empty wine bottles and sewage overflow emaciated dogs looking for someone or something to bite even the negroes reinforce the abomb motif they look gaunt and suspicious like mutant creatures fried by atomic fallout johnny shivers as he recalls the spate of horror movies he has seen against his mothers wishes somehow this is scarier and because it is scarier he will become that much more of a man by stealing here johnny is about to ask one of the negroes for directions to the auto graveyard when he spots a familiar flash of color down the block he walks over and sees his fathers vicky parked outside an old woodframed house patched over with tarpaper painted obscenities and swastikas cover all sides of the house johnny climbs in through a broken window as if drawn by a magnetic force once inside standing in darkness on rotting wood planks johnnys magnet takes on the form of his fathers laughter issuing from the top of a staircase off to his left he walks over hearing his fathers baritone glee meld with the highpitched squealing of another man the whir and click of gears joins with the voices as johnny treads up the stairs holding tightly to the banister when he reaches the secondstory landing johnny sees a door and squints in the darkness to see if it is green the laughter and the gear noise grow louder then the door blows open a crack johnny tiptoes over and peers inside a stench assails him as his eyes hone in on the backs of his father and a man in a gray uniform standing in front of a whirling circular object the smell is of blood and body waste and sweat a green blanket marked off like a crap table lies on the floor covered with coins and folding money the walls and ceiling are dotted with bright red and rivulets of pale red drip toward the floor johnny squints and sees that his father is holding a chisel he moves the chisel toward the whirling object and a spritz of red liquid cuts the air the man in the gray uniform laughs and exclaims shit thats a ten pointer he steps back and sticks his hand in his pocket then drops a wad of cash on the blanket the whirling circular object comes to a halt and into view a nude woman is attached to a plywood reinforced corkboard mounted on a foundation of bricks a gear train composed of motorcycle chains and lawnmower belts stands behind it the woman is manacled at the ankles and pinioned at the top with spikes through her wrists slash wounds oozing blood cover her chest and extremities and a black rubber handball is stuck in her mouth held there by crisscrossed strips of friction tape johnny bites his hand to keep from screaming feeling his fingers crack beneath his teeth he squints at the first naked woman he has ever seen and notes her swollen belly and knows that she is pregnant his father grabs a handle at the top of the corkboard and leans his whole body into a downward pull the woman spins end over end and the man in the uniform squeals how about ten bucks on a roulette abortion johnny watches the chisel descend clamping his eyes open with selfmauled fingers knowing he has to see knowing what must be happening but seeing instead his daddy sitting beside him in the whirling ferris wheel at playland in the bronx whispering that everything would always be all right and he could go on all the rides and eat all the cotton candy he wanted and that mommy would quit drinking and they would be a real family then the uniform man was saying its a boy and he hears the sound of his own scream and the uniform man was on top of him with his chisel and then father was stabbing the uniform man with a knife and stabbing him with a needle whispering easy johnny easy beauty easy babe the time machine pushed through days of sedative haze filled with the sound of mother weeping and baxter the lawyer telling her that the money would always be there and sternlooking men in cheap summer suits asking her where father was and did he know a man named duane mcevoy mothers scream no you cannot talk to the boyhe knows nothing then baxter the lawyer takes him to a horror triple feature in white plains and tells him father is gone forever but he will be his pal midway through the curse of frankenstein images of the whirling circular object hit him it all starts to come back and thoughts of the ferris wheel die slaughtered by a cinemascope and technicolor replay of the caesarean birth its a boy johnny runs out of the theater and hitchhikes to ossining niggertown the same abomb negroes and hungry dogs maneuver on the periphery of the area but the block itself has burned to the ground but it happened here no it was a nightmare but it did happen here i dont know weeks pass the newspapers attribute the ossining fire to heedless negro children playing with matches and express gratitude that no one was hurt johnny grieves for his lost father and listens in on mothers phone calls to baxter she repeatedly tells the lawyer to buy the cops off once and for all regardless of the price baxter finally calls back and tells mother that it is all set but to be sure she should destroy everything belonging to father including everything in his safedeposit boxes johnny knows that there is nothing interesting in fathers studyonly his guns and ammo and his books but the safe deposit boxes are something he has forgotten to scope out he steals the keys to the boxes from fathers desk and forges a note to the manager of the first union bank in scarsdale village the old fart buys it hook line and sinker chuckling over the twelveyearold boy doing banking errands for his dad johnny walks away from the bank with a brown paper bag full of blue chip stocks and a black leatherbound diary that looks like a bible johnny walks to the train station intending to go to the movies in the city a very unscarsdalelike bum tries to panhandle train fare from him johnny gives him the stock certificates once on the train heading toward manhattan johnny opens up the diary and reads his fathers words the words prove conclusively that what he saw on june in ossining niggertown was for real since alone and with the aid of a sing sing prison guard named duane mcevoy father had tortured and murdered eighteen women some in westchester county some in upstate cities adjoining his favorite duck hunting preserves the mutilations sexual abuse and ultimate dismemberments are described in vivid detail johnny forces himself to read every word tears are streaming down his face and the ferris wheel memory battles the words for primacy the benevolent whirling object is winning as the train pulls into grand central station then johnny gets to the passages that prove how much his father loves him and everything goes crazy the boy is so much smarter than me that its scary brains are everything ive been able to keep duane as my lackey for so long because the dumbfuck knows that im the one who keeps him from getting caught when johnny killed the rats and shot the dogs i saw him go cold almost overnight and when i saw him go smart and wary and cautious too i knew i was scared i wanted to go to him and love him but staying away makes him stronger and more fit for life johnny boy is like an icebergcold and s below the surface hes probably afraid to kill human prey too manipulative too asexual its going to be interesting watching him hit adolescence how will he attempt to prove himself johnny walks through grand central openly weeping coming out onto nd street he throws the death bible into a storm drain and hurls a silent vow to his father he will show him that he is afraid of nothing fall johnny considers potential victims at scarsdale junior high to fulfill his fathers legacy he knows that they must be female beyond that first essential qualification he sets his own criteria all his prey must be snooty giggly and stay late after school participating in kissass extracurricular activities then walk home via the garth road underpass where he would be waiting with a razorsharp arkansas toad stabber like the one vic morrow wielded in blackboard jungle johnnys selection process narrows as he stakes out the underpass finally he settles on donna horowitz beth shields and sally burdett grinds who remain until after dark each day in the chem lab washing test tubes and brownnosing mr salcido for a good grade stab stab stab johnny sharpens his switchblade every night and wonders if father ever bagged three at once he sets the execution date november the three grinds will walk through the underpass at their usual time of to giving him twelve minutes to bump them off then hotfoot it over to the station and catch the to the city stab stab stab november at johnny is stationed on the lefthand side of the garth road underpass wearing blue jeans and a hunting vest that he has scavenged from his fathers leftbehinds the vest has loops to hold shotgun shells and hangs down to his knees the toad stabber is affixed to his belt in a plastic scabbard the three victims approach the underpass right on time donna horowitz notices johnny and starts to giggle sally burdett hoots is that johnny havilland or chucko the clown dig that crazy vest johnny draws his knife as beth shields sidles past him taunting wimpdick wimpdick he lunges and snags the stiletto on his vest pocket the blade pokes his ribcage and he screams and falls to his knees the girls gather around him and shriek with laughter johnny sees a kaleidoscope of the caesarean birth the ferris wheel and his father joining in the laughter he screams again to drown it all out when that doesnt work he bangs his head on the pavement until everything goes silent and black the banging continues when a womans voice calls out dr havilland are you there the night tripper is catapulted back to the present his office the projector and a portable movie screen come into focus the voice must belong to linda wilhite banging on his outer office door his first conscious thought of his now destroyed childhood void is appreciation for his very own god who did not give him the courage to break down the void until he had given him the courage to kill and earn his fathers love his destiny had been dealt with splitsecond accuracy dr havilland are you there its linda wilhite the doctor got to his feet and took a deep breath then rubbed his eyes his steps were rubbery from the sodium pentothal jolt but that was to be expectedhe was technically speaking a newborn creature trying his new voice he called hold on linda im coming hearing his familiar baritone he walked to the outer office door and opened it linda wilhite stood there looking uncharacteristically nervous hello linda havilland said are you all right you seem slightly on edge linda walked past the doctor into his private office and took her usual seat when havilland followed her in she said ive been having some very strange violent fantasies ive even bought a gun pointing to the movie screen and projector she added are those the visual aids you mentioned havilland sat down facing linda yes tell me about your new fantasies you look full of stress are you sure you want to quit therapy under such conditions linda twisted in her chair clutching her purse in her lap as the last fuzziness from his pentothal trip died havilland saw that underneath her nervousness she was very angry yes i still want to quit therapy you look full of stress woozy too everyone is full of stress these are stressful times dont you know that goddamn it havilland raised placating hands easy linda im on your side linda sighed im sorry i barked thats all right tell me about the new fantasies linda said theyre weird and variations on my sweater man fantasies basically im just menaced by the same type of man i used to have the hots for i fantasize being chased by men like that the fantasies always end with me shooting them she reached into her purse and pulled out a large blue steel revolver grasping it by the barrel and cylinder see doctor do you think im crazy havilland reached over and took the revolver from linda holding it firmly by the smooth wood grips sighting it at the movie screen im proud of you he said as he handed it back butt first linda returned the gun to her purse why because as you said these are stressful times youre a strong person and in stressful times strong people go beyond their beyonds move your chair over here i want to run a little home movie for you linda pulled her chair over to where it was facing the screen havilland got up and threaded a length of film through the projectors feeder device then hit the on switch and turned off the wall light a series of blank frames flashed across the screen followed by a jerky panning shot of a bedroom followed by more blank frames then a blonde woman in a nurses uniform began to undress closeup shots caught everything fallible about her body a small abdominal scar networks of varicose veins patches of cellulite when she was naked she did an awkward vamp dance then lay down on a mattress covered by a single blue sheet a nude man joined her averting his face from the camera the couple moved into an embrace broke it and moved to opposite sides of the mattress the woman looked bewildered and the man mashed his face into the sheet after holding these poses for long moments the woman rolled underneath the man and they faked intercourse linda clutched her purse and said what is this amateur porno film night i thought this was going to be a therapy session shhh havilland whispered youll catch the drift in just a few seconds the screen went blank then filled up with a long shot of the blonde woman now dressed in her nurses uniform leaning against the bedroom wall suddenly a man also clothed threw himself on top of her the screen again went blank then segued into an extreme closeup of a transparent plastic pillow the muzzle of a gun was pressed to the pillow a finger pulled the trigger and the screen was awash in red the camera caught a closeup of the mans face when linda saw the face she screamed hopkins and fumbled in her purse for the gun her finger was inside the trigger guard when the lights went on and the man from the movie jumped out of the closet and smothered her with his body lloyd slammed down the phone in response to dutchs news the two women and one man that hollywood division detectives had leaned on with behind the green door and beyond the beyond had immediately clammed up first threatening the officers with lawsuits then going into repeated recitations of the phrase patria infinitum no breakdowns no recantings of past sins just indignation at police scare tactics and the rapid expulsion of seasoned cops dutch would be deploying a new team of detectives for runs at the guru worshippers but they would probably be in mantra comas by then there was only himself linda and her magnum and the unknown quantity of william nagler lloyd checked the clock on the kitchen wall linda would still be at her therapy session he could wait and call and ease his mind or he could move the ticking of the clock became deafening he locked up the house and walked to his car headlights flashed across the driveway as he slipped behind the wheel and a panel truck pulled in front of his unmarked cruiser lloyd got out and saw marty bergen step in front of the headlights and jam his hands into his pockets a gun butt extended from his waistband my lawyer glommed me a writ he said fred gaffaney almost shit shotgun shells lloyd said amateurs shouldnt pack hardware beat it ive got no stories for you bergen laughed when i was on the job i was in love with my piece off duty i always made sure that people could see it i was in love with it until i had to use it then i dropped it and ran jacks dead hopkins tell me something i dont know its on me its all on me wrong bergen its the departments and its mine bergen kicked the grill of the matador then stumbled backward into the hood of his truck i owe goddamn you cant you see that all i ever had was what jack gave me and even that was all twisted some piece of shit took him where he shouldnt have fucking gone and made him feel things that he shouldnt have fucking felt and it was me that he felt them about and i owe dont make me say the words hopkins please dont make me say the fucking words lloyd sent up a prayer for all guiltdriven innocents seeking jeopardy what do you want bergen former lapd sergeant martin d bergen wiped tears from his eyes i just want to pay off jack then get in the car lloyd said were going to laurel canyon to good guybad guy a suspect william nagler was not at home lloyd parked across the street from his twostory redwood aframe and walked over and knocked on both the front and back doors no answer no lights burning and no sounds of habitation after checking the mailbox and finding two catalogs and a mastercard bill he returned to the car and his improbable partner are you going to open up this thing bergen asked as lloyd squeezed in behind the wheel lloyd shook his head no i dont trust the fourth estate just play the interrogation by ear you ever work plainclothes yeah venice vice im going to be the good guy right no youve got booze breath and you need a shave youre big but im bigger so i can play savior ill ask the questions you just be abusive just imagine yourself as a typical fascist pig out of the pages of the big orange insider and youll be cool bergen laughed youre the kind of joker who hands out compliments one minute then rags people who hand out compliments the next which means one of two thingsyou either love to give people shit or you dont know where your own head is at which one is it with his eyes on naglers front door lloyd said dont jerk my chain if i didnt want you here you wouldnt be here if i didnt understand what you have to do i would have busted you for carrying a concealed weapon and kicked your ass back to the slam bergen scratched his razor stubble and poked lloyd in the arm i apologize for saying i didnt like your style what i should have said was that you have style but you dont know what to do with it lloyd turned on the dashboard light and stared at bergen dont tell me about style i read some of your early stuff it was damn good you could have been something big you could have said things worth saying but you didnt know what to do with it because being really good is really scary i know fear bergen two niggers blew away your partner and you ran i can understand that and not judge you for it but you had the chance to be great and you settled for being a hack and that i cant understand bergen toyed with the knobs of the twoway radio you catholic hopkins no tough shit youre going to hear my confession anyway jack herzog taught me to write he ghosted my first published stories then edited the ones i actually did write he formed my style he was the one who had the chance to be great its weird hopkins youre supposed to be the pragmatist but i think youre really a romantic innocent with an incredible nose for shit its funny jack gave me everything i have he made me a derivative fiction stylist and a competent journalist hed been writing a novel and i was serving as his editor helping him hold it together as he got crazier and crazier ive never had the chance to be great but if i had your brains and drive and guts id be more than a gloryhound flatfoot lloyd turned on the radio and listened to code ones and twos its a stalemate marty and a life sentence for both of us but were lucky we can play the game bergen took the pistol from his waistband and rolled down the window and took a bead on the moon i believe that he said two hours passed in silence bergen dozed off and lloyd stared out the window at william naglers driveway wondering if he should make a run to a phone and call linda wondering also if havillands worshippers were in contact with each other and if the already hassled followers had alerted nagler to the approaching heat no he decided finally havilland was too well buffered the worshippers probably had no way of contacting havilland or each other besides havillands pay phone communiques which logic told him were rigidly prescheduled his investigatory parries were buffered against discovery then the truth hit he was pumping himself up with logic because linda was part of the game and part of him and if she fell the game was over forever shortly after ten oclock a silver porsche convertible pulled up in front of the aframe lloyd nudged bergen awake and said our buddy is here follow my lead and when i touch my necktie interrupt me and buzz him with behind the green door and beyond the beyond this guy had nothing to do with jack herzog so dont even mention his name you got it bergen nodded and squared his shoulders in preparation for his performance lloyd grabbed a flashlight and opened the car door just as a man got out of the porsche and crossed the sidewalk in front of the aframe bergen slammed his door causing the man to turn around at the foot of the steps police officers lloyd called out the man froze at the words then walked forward in the direction of his car lloyd flashed the light square in his face forcing him to throw up his hands to shield his eyes ititsmamy car he stammered ive got the pink in the glove compartment lloyd studied the face blonde bland and cultured were his first impressions he pointed his five cell at the ground and said im sure it is are you william nagler the man stepped off the curb and stroked the hood of the porsche touching its sleekness gave an edge of propriety to his voice yes i am what is this in regard to lloyd walked up to within inches of nagler forcing him back on the sidewalk he held up his badge and played his light on it then said lapd my name is hopkins thats sergeant bergen could we talk to you inside nagler shuffled his feet lloyd held his light on the little dance of fear and saw that the worshipper was pigeontoed to the point of deformity why have you got a warrant hey what are you doing lloyd turned around and saw marty bergen leaning into the porsche feeling under the seats nagler wrapped his arms around himself and shouted dont thats my car cool it partner lloyd said the man is cooperating so just maintain your coolness lowering his voice he said to nagler my partners a black glove cop but i keep him on a short chain can we go inside its cold out here nagler brushed a lock of lank blonde hair up from his forehead lloyd eyed him openly and added competent and smart and very scared to his initial assessment whats a black glove cop as if on cue bergen walked over and stood beside lloyd we should toss the vehicle he said this bimbos a doper i can tell what are you flying on citizen ludes smack dust give me thirty seconds inside that glove compartment and ill get us a righteous dope bust lloyd gave bergen a disgusted look this is a routine questioning of burglary victims not a narc raid so be cool mr nagler can we go inside naglers feet did another fear dance im not a burglary victim ive never been burglarized and i dont know anything about any burglaries lloyd put an arm around naglers shoulders and moved him out of bergens earshot all the houses on this block have been crawled he said sometimes the guy steals sometimes not a snitch of mine heard a tip that hes a panty freak that he checks out all the pads he crawls for lingerie what i want to do is check for fingerprints on your bedroom drawers it will only take five minutes nagler jerked himself free no i cant allow it not without a warrant pointing at bergen lloyd whispered hes the senior officer im just a forensic technician if i cant print your drawers hell go cuckoo and frame you on a drug charge his daughter odd on heroin and it flipped him out hes about one step ahead of the net so it wouldnt do to rile him please cooperate mr nagler for both our sakes nagler looked over his shoulder at marty bergen who was now squatting and examining the front wheel covers of his porsche all right officer just keep that man away from me lloyd whistled drawing bergen away from his hubcap scrutiny mr nagler is going to cooperate sergeant lets make it quick hes a busy man dopers always are bergen said walking over he gave the porsche a last glance and added ill bet its hot we should check the hot sheet we could get us a righteous gta bust leaning into lloyd in a pseudo drunks weave he whispered whats my job inside seeing that nagler was walking ahead to open the door lloyd faked a coughing attack then said sotto voce toss the pad for official papers especially anything pertaining to property in malibu see if you can find something illegal to squeeze him with be menacing nagler unlocked the door and turned on a light in the entrance foyer he pointed inside and shivered then wrapped his arms around himself and moved his inwardly bent feet together so that the toes were touching lloyd thought of a frightened animal trying to protect itself by curling into a ball and blending in with the scenery the fear in the mans eyes made him want to strangle john havilland for his complicity in that fear and strangle himself for what he might have to do he caught bergens eyes and saw that his bogus partner was thinking along parallel lines and hoped that his rage would hold for the duration of his performance when he felt his own rage subside in a wave of pity he resurrected it by thinking of the gurushrink slipping through loopholes in the legal process and said lets sit down and talk for a minute first mr nagler theres a few questions i have nagler nodded assent lloyd walked through the foyer into a living room furnished with plastic hightech chairs and a long sofa constructed of beanbags and industrial tubing bergen sauntered in behind him going straight for a portable bar on casters sitting down in a lavender armchair that creaked under his weight lloyd saw western movie posters beam down at him from all four walls nagler perched himself on the edge of the sofa and said will you please make this fast lloyd smiled and said of course this is a charming living room by the way he pointed to the posters are you a movie buff im a freelance art director and an amateur filmmaker nagler said leveling worried eyes at marty bergen now please get to your questions bergen chuckled and poured himself a large shot of scotch i think this pad sucks and i think this bimbo is just holding down this art director gig as a front for his dope racket he downed the drink and poured another what are you dealing citizen weed speed dust thats it hoppy this is a dust bust nagler fretted his hands and pleaded to lloyd with his eyes bergen guzzled scotch then blurted out jesus im gonna be sick wheres the can lloyd waved an arm toward the back of the house as nagler drew his feet together and slammed the edge of the sofa with outwardly cocked wrists bergen took off running making gagging sounds and holding his hands over his mouth lloyd shook his head and said i apologize for my colleague mr nagler hes a terrible man nagler whispered he has a low karma consciousness unless he changes his life radically hell never go beyond his low efficacy image lloyd noted that the recitation of the minispiel had had a calming effect on nagler he honed his own spiel to razor sharpness and said yes i do pity him he has so many doors to go beyond before he finds out who he really is the razor drew blood naglers whole body relaxed lloyd threw out a smile calculated to flash kindred soul thinking hook him now he said he needs spiritual guidance a spiritual master is just the ticket for him dont you agree naglers face lit up then clouded over with what looked to lloyd like an aftertaste of doubt and fear finally he breathed out yes please get on with your business and leave me in peace please lloyd was silent charting interrogation courses while he got out a pen and notepad nagler fidgeted on the edge of the sofa then turned around when footsteps echoed behind him achtung citizen lloyd looked up from his notepad to see marty bergen hovering next to the sofa holding a glass freebase pipe out at arms length thought you were cool didnt you citizen no dope on the premises however you overlooked the new possession of drug paraphernalia law recently passed by the state legislature this pipe and the ether on your bathroom shelf constitute a misdemeanor bergen dropped the pipe into naglers lap nagler jerked to his feet and threw his hands up to his face the pipe fell to the floor and shattered bergen florid faced and grinning from ear to ear looked at lloyd and said this is fucking ironic i wrote an editorial condemning that law as fascist which of course it is now im here enforcing it aint life a bitch he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a wad of paper check this out he said lloyd stood up grabbed the papers and walked over to the shivering worshipper steeling himself against revulsion he said you have the right to remain silent you have the right to have legal counsel present during questioning if you cannot afford counsel an attorney will be provided do you have a statement to make regarding that paraphernalia mr nagler the answer was a series of body shudders nagler pressed himself into the wall trembling lloyd put a gentle hand on his shoulder and felt a jolt of almost electric tension looking down at the worshippers feet he saw that they were twisting across each other as if trying to gouge the ankles the brutality of the posture made lloyd turn away and seek out marty bergen for a semblance of sanity the image backfired bergen was standing by the bar guzzling scotch straight from the bottle when he saw lloyd staring at him he said learning things you dont like about yourself hot dog lloyd walked to bergen and grabbed the bottle from his hands guard him dont touch him and dont talk to him just let him be this time the answer lloyd got was bergens grin of selfloathing a smile that looked like a closeup of his own soul taking the bottle with him he walked to a small den off the living room hallway and found the phone he dialed lindas number and let it ring ten times no answer checking his watch he saw that it was linda had probably gotten tired of waiting for his call and had left lloyd put down the phone knowing that he had wanted the comfort of lindas voice more than her confirmation of havillands prints on the magnum remembering bergens wad of paper he reached into his pocket and extracted it smoothing it out on the desk beside the phone it was a real estate brochure listing properties in malibu and the malibu colony attached to the top of the front page were complimentary pacific coast highway parking stickers for the period to a soft bingo sounded in lloyds mind beach area realtors gave away the hundreddollarayear resident stickers to their preferred customers it was a solid indication that nagler had property in malibuproperty that he let john havilland use but held the deed to for tax purposes and secrecy havilland would undoubtedly not let his worshippers confer with him at his office or beverly hills condobut a beach house owned by an especially trusted worshipper would be the ideal place for individual or group meetings he read the name of the realtor on the front of the brochureginjer buchanan properties the phone number was listed below it lloyd dialed it on the offchance that an eager beaver salesperson might still be at the office when all he got was a recorded message he called information and got a residential listing for a ginjer buchanan in pacific palisades he dialed that number and got another machine this one featuring reggae music and the realtors importunings to leave a message at the tone and ill call you from the twilight zone thinking of the los angeles police department as both the keepers and inmates of the twilight zone lloyd rifled the desk drawers looking for official paper pertaining to malibu property finding nothing but stationery and invoices for movie equipment he walked down the hall looking for other likely rooms to toss the bathroom and kitchen would probably yield zilch but at the end of the hallway stood a halfopened door lloyd walked to it and fumbled at the inside wall for a light switch an overhead light went on framing a small room filled with haphazardly discarded movie cameras rolls of film and developing trays the floor was a mass of broken equipment with plaster chips torn loose from the walls noticing a movieola that remained intact atop a metal desk lloyd peered in the viewfinder and saw a celluloid strip showing a pair of inert legs clad in white stockings he was about to examine the equipment more closely when singing and chanting blasted from the living room walking back to investigate lloyd saw and heard a hellish twopart harmony marty bergen was standing over a kneeling william nagler strumming an imaginary guitar and singing they had an old piano and they played it hot behind the green door dont know what theyre doin but they laugh a lot behind the green door wont someone let me in so i can find out whats behind the green door when bergen fell silent fumbling for more verses naglers chanting took precedence patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum muttered in a droning monotone punctuated by the worshippers banging of his prayerclasped hands against his chest the words seemed to rise from a volition far older and darker than john havilland or his murdererfather patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum bergen snapped to lloyds presence and shouted above the chanting hi hoppy think ill make the top forty with this green door green door green door lloyd grabbed bergen and shoved him to the wall and held him there hissing shut the fuck up now and dont drink another drop go toss the rest of the pad for naglers irs forms and income tax returns dont say another fucking word just do it bergen tried to smile it came out a death grin okay sarge he said lloyd released bergen and watched him ooze off the wall when he shambled away the chanting became the dominating aspect of the room patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum lloyd knelt in front of the worshipper watching his trance grow deeper with each blow to the heart memorizing every detail of the flagellation in order to justify his next move when naglers glazed eyes and heaving lungs were permanently imprinted in his mind he swung a full power open hand at his head and saw the trance crumble as the worshipper was knocked off his knees screaming doctor lloyd knocked loose of his own equilibrium pinned naglers shoulders to the floor and shouted havillands dead william before he died he said that you were a chump and a fool and a dupe naglers glazed eyes zeroed in on lloyd no no no patria infinitum patria infin lloyd dug his fingers into the worshippers collarbone no william you cant you cant go back doctor shhh shhh you cant bill you cant go back doctor lloyd dug his fingers deeper until nagler started to sob withdrawing his hands altogether he said he talked about how he used you bill how he got you to pay his phone bills how he made you his slave how he laughed at you how your movies were shit how you had all that expensive equipment but you did lloyd stopped when naglers sobs trailed off into a terrified stutter horhorhormoohormoo shhh shhh lloyd whispered take it slow and think the words out nagler stared up at lloyd the look on his face wavered between grief and bliss finally the bliss prevailed long enough for him to say horror movie doctor john made a horror movie thats how i know youre lying about what he said about me he appreciates my talent i edited the movie and doctor saidhe said lloyd stood up then helped nagler to his feet and pointed him toward the sofa when nagler was seated he studied his face he looked like a man about to enter the gas chamber who didnt know whether or not he wanted to die knowing that the blissdeath part of the worshipper had the edge and possessed the potential to produce lucid answers lloyd quashed his impulse to bludgeon nagler into grieflife sighing he sat down beside the ravished young man and stabbed in the dark havilland isnt really dead bill i know that nagler said he was here this morning with he stopped and flashed a robot smile he was here this morning lloyd said finish the thought bill i did doctor john was here this morning end of thought no beginning of thought but lets change the subject you dont really think im a policeman do you nagler shook his head no doctor john told me that there was a three percent leak factor in our program i know exactly what the leak wasit came to me while i was chanting youre an internal revenue agent i paid doctor johns phone bills while he went skiing in idaho last december you checked the records out because youre with big brother you also crosschecked my bank records and the doctors and saw that i sent him a big check last year he probably forgot to report it on his tax return you want a bribe to keep silent very well name your amount and ill write a check nagler laughed how silly of me that would leave a record no name your amount and ill pay you off in cash lloyd gasped at naglers recuperative powers five minutes earlier he had been a groveling mass now he held the condescending authority of a plantation owner a horror movie and the wrecked equipment in the back room were the dividing points thinking break him he said didnt it surprise you that my partner knew enough to sing you that song no a song is a song and a movie is a movie lloyd said reaching into his pocket bill its time i came clean doctor john sent me to test your loyalty he held out the mugshot strip of thomas goff im the replacement for the old recruiter you remember this fellow dont you theres a guy on doctor johns program who looks just like him i know all about the meetings at the house in malibu and how you bought the house for the doctor and how you pay the phone bill i know about the pay phone contacts and how you dont fraternize outside the meetings i know because im one of you bill first grief then bliss now bewilderment lloyd had kept his eyes averted from nagler letting him feast on thomas goffs image instead of his own when he finally reestablished eye contact he saw that the man had fingered the mugshot strip to pieces and that his spiel had turned him into clay feeling like a bullfighter going in for the kill lloyd said i also lied when i said that doctor john said that your movies were shit he really loves your movie work in fact just today he told me that he wants you to both star in and direct the script hes working on he tol lloyd stopped when naglers grief took him over patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum patria infinitum lloyd thought of linda and got up and walked toward the den and the telephone he had his hand on the receiver when a tap on his shoulder forced him to jump back turn around and ball his fists it was bergen looking eerily sober i couldnt find any irs papers he said but i did find our pals diary under his bed renaissance weird hopkins fucking gothic lloyd took the morocco bound book from bergens hands and sat down on the desk opening it he saw that the first entry was dated and that it and all the subsequent entries were written in an exquisitely flourished longhand while bergen stood over him he read through accounts of havillands programming picking up a cryptically designated cast along the way there was the lieutenant who had to be thomas goff the fox the bull dagger the bookworm the professor the muscleman and billy boy who had to be nagler himself the entries themselves detailed how havilland ordered his charges to fast for thirtysix hours then stand nude in front of fulllength mirrors and chant their fear mantras into tape recorders until subliminal dream consciousness took over and led them to babble transcendental fantasies that he would later sift through for key details to translate into reality fodder how he paired them off sexually at the beach womb interrupting the couplings to take vital signs and stress readings how he forced them to kill dogs and cats as insurance against moral flaccidity how the lieutenant interrupted their rem sleep with late night phone calls and brutal interrogations into their dreams alternately using the first person i and the third person billy boy nagler described how he and doctor johns other counselees were pimped out to wealthy people who advertised for fantasy therapists in privately published and circulated sex tabloids the weekend lovemaking seminars often netting havilland several thousand dollars and how the beach womb groupings were taped and transcribed by the lieutenant who sometimes served as the chef concocting mixtures of pharmaceutical cocaine and other prescription drugs that the doctor would administer to his counselees under testflight conditions lloyd leafed fullspeed through the diary looking for incriminating facts names addresses and dates with marty bergen hovering beside him and naglers muffled chanting coming in from the living room he felt like the sole outpost of sanity in a lunatic landscape the feeling underlined by the fact that the diary contained no factsonly narrated disclosures peopled with coded characters until an entry dated the day before jumped out at him helped set up movie equipment at the musclemans house in the hollywood hills doctor john supervised i showed him how to operate the camera i hope muscleman wont break anything he scares meand he looks more and more like the lieutenant these days the entry was followed by a blank page followed by the diarys concluding entry dated that morning lloyd felt an icepick at his spine as he read its not real they faked it you can fake anything with new camera technology its a fake its not real lloyd shoved bergen aside and walked back to the movie room and searched among the upended equipment for film scraps finding three strips of celluloid wedged underneath the editing machine running them through the machines feederviewfinder he saw four closeups of a womans white nyloned legs a long shot of a mattress on a carpeted floor and a blurred extreme closeup of a broadchested man with what looked like an lapd badge pinned to his shirt the icepick jabbed his heart lloyd thought of the whitestockinged nurse that richard oldfield had brought to his house twentyfour hours before the knife twisted dug and tore accompanied by a deafening burst of patria infinitums from the living room lloyd walked toward the sound finding nagler still in his mantra pose and bergen standing beside the fireplace pouring bottles of liquor over the acrylic firewood on the grate longterm interrogation sarge he said it wont do to get tempted whats next his ghoul grin had become a feisty smirk and for one splitsecond lloyd found a beacon of sanity im leaving youre staying here he said i have to check on someone then if she got my evidence i have to take our friends guru out you stay here and watchdog him hang by the phone if i need you ill ring once then call back immediately i want in on the bust bergen said lloyd shook his head no just having you here could cause me lots of grief and im not risking my job or you any further he watched bergens smirk go hangdog what are you going to do when all this is over bergen laughed as he poured out a bottle of courvoisier vsop i dont know jack left me close to twenty grand maybe ill just see where that takes me when lloyd didnt react to his mention of the money he said you knew about the bank draft right lloyd said yeah i didnt report it because i knew iad would try to seize your account as evidence youre a good shit hopkins you know that sometimes what are you going to do when this is over lloyd thought of linda and janice and his daughters then looked over at the devastated william nagler still chanting at demons i dont know he said the night tripper sat at the recording console in the beach womb listening to richard oldfield and linda wilhite make frightened small talk upstairs in bedroom number three the splitsecond accuracy of his fate had taken on ironic overtones lindas screaming of hopkins combined with the gun in her purse was a tacit admission that the genius cop had figured it out on the same day that he had broken through his childhood void richard had blown his chance to kill hopkins and his contingency plan to drive linda over the edge with the snuff film and have her commit the murder had backfired after twentyseven years devoted to venting his terror through others it had all come down to himself he had claimed his fathers heritage gaining autonomy along with the knowledge that the game was over god was a malevolent jokester armed with a blunt instrument called irony havilland leaned back in the chair that thomas goff used to occupy feeling a conscious version of his dream disengagement split him in two his left side imagined whirling corkboards while his right side heard words issuing from the bedroom where richard guarded the object of his corkboard fantasies soon exhaustion crept up the spinning of the corkboard dominated while the words played on like dim music at the edge of sound why are you staring at me doctor said to watch you do you do everything he tells you to do yes why are you making nasty faces at me ive been gentle with you because doctor said to be gentle no dont answer itll only make me hate you more for your information drugging and kidnapping is not a gentle activity are you aware of that yes no youre very beautiful jesus was that movie for real i mean there was the awful part and then this closeup of you listen are you thomas goff i told you my name was richard all right but what about the movie was it real my mother was killed like that with a pillow and a gun is the movie part of your crazy gurus plans for me what movie jesus are you high i mean on something besides insanity you know on drugs doctor gives me tranquilizers and antidepressants prescription stuff hes a doctor so its legal and not bad not bad havillands a doctor feelgood to boot no dont answer i know hes capable of anything im not going to let you hurt me you know never not ever i dont want to hurt you jesus you sound like peter lorre does it turn you on that im not scared yes no no first responses are always the most honest richard if you or that psychopath downstairs tried to hurt me id kick and bite and scratch and rub lye in your eyes i i dont want to hurt you ive done my hurting it wasnt good yyouyou mean you hurt other women yes no i mean they hurt me me me me me me who hurt you what are you talking about no doctor said i should talk to you but not about bad things bad things hmm okay well change the subject let me ask you a question do you honestly think that those overdeveloped muscles of yours are a turnon to women no yes yes first responses richard and youre right a woman sees a man like you and thinks this guy is so insecure that he spends three hours a day at the gym with all the fags and narcissists building himself up outside so i wont know how scared he is inside ive got a lover whos bigger than you and probably almost as strong but hes got a trace of flab on his stomach and hips and i dig it you know why because he lives in reality and does a good job of it and he hasnt got time to pump iron so dont think that your muscles impress me the theyre for protection from the people who hurt you from the woman who hurt you yes aha the truth outs let me set you straight on something muscles dont rule the world brains do which is how a wimp like havilland can make a slave out of someone big and strong like you people protect each other with their love not their muscles someone probably some woman hurt you really badly she didnt do it with her muscles because she didnt have any you cant get revenge by hitting back at people the way they hit at you because then the people who hurt you winby making you like them arent you hip to that no its different with doctor john he took me beyond my beyond whats your beyond no hurting women you cant hurt me because im smarter than you and stronger than you and because that wimp downstairs told you not to some fucking beyond brownnoser to a freakedout headshrinker whos going to end up in the locked ward at camarillo for life whos going to protect you when hes wearing a straitjacket and sucking baby food out of a straw no no no no no no no no yes richard yes besides how many beyonds have you got one two three you dont seem too fulfilled to me its old wimpys beyonds were talking about richard i almost wish youd try to get violent with me so id know you had the guts to disobey your slavemaster what makes you think youre so smart and so tough i dont know do you know that im not scared of you yes then thats your answer what would you do if i tried to hurt you fight back watch you get turned on and watch you lose doctor said youre a whore whores are wrong whores are bad you almost got me there but you missed by a few days i quit i walked i walked you can too you can walk out the door and wave goodbye to the doctor and hell be terrified because without you hes just another la fruitcake with no place to hang his hat think on that im going to try to sleep but you think on that the night tripper awakened instantly aware that his corkboard dreams had destroyed the music voices in bedroom number three he checked the console and saw that he had forgotten to hit the record switch then heard a soft male sobbing come over the speakers and pictured richard distraught over his dictate not to hurt the whore richard was a day too late linda was his in the morning he would sacrifice her to his fathers memory he would end the game on his own terms dawn lloyd sped north on pacific coast highway running on adrenaline rage and terror his jeopardy gambit had become a sacrificial offering and if the fires had already been fed he would have to take out the beach womb and everyone in it and throw himself into the flames he looked at the pump shotgun resting on the seat beside him five rounds enough for havilland oldfield two miscellaneous worshippers and himself the thought of selfimmolation jerked his mind off of the immediate future and back to the immediate past after leaving bergen and nagler he had driven to lindas apartment she was not there and her mercedes was not in the garage now frightened he had run dome light and siren to havillands century city office the night watchman in the lobby told him that he had admitted a very beautiful young woman at about seven oclock and that an hour later the nice dr havilland and another man had brought her downstairs looking high as a kite emergency tooth extraction the doctor had said im not a dentist but i gave it a go anyway the two men had then hustled the nearcomatose woman off in the direction of the parking lot after frantically driving by havillands beverly hills condo and finding no one there lloyd had run code three to the pacific palisades residential address of ginjer buchanan of ginjer buchanan properties the woman was not at home but her livein housekeeper succeeded in rousing her by phone at her boyfriends apartment in topanga canyon after lloyd explained the urgency of the matter the realtor agreed to meet him at her office with the information he needed an hour later at five am he was staring at a floor plan of the beach womb then the terror that he had held at bay by movement took over if he called the malibu sheriffs for assistance they would storm the beachfront house swat style with all the accoutrements of militarypolice overkill gas machine guns bullhorns and the substations lackluster hostage negotiation team loudspeaker amplified pleas counterpleas and simplistic psychological manipulation that havilland would laugh at itchyfingered deputies weaned on tv cop shows automatic weaponry fired in panic linda in the crossfire no the jeopardy gambit came down to himself again lloyd looked at his ithaca pump when the taste of cordite and charred flesh rose in his throat he pulled over to the side of the highway and a long row of pay phones jungle jack herzog reduxwith a blackmail demand he had the receiver to his ear and a handkerchief over the mouthpiece when a strangely familiar vehicle ground to a halt behind his cruiser squinting through the plexiglas he saw marty bergen get out on the drivers side door and walk over to the booths holding a quart bottle of beer out at arms length as though he were afraid of being contaminated lloyd slammed down the receiver wondering how someone so sad could look so scary bergen smiled maintenance jug i havent touched it yet emergencies only you looked scared hopkins really scared lloyd grabbed the bottle and smashed it to pieces on the pavement only when the smell of beer hit his nostrils did he realize what he had done i told you to stay with nagler i couldnt i had to move so i tied him up and split is that a misdemeanor or a felony when i was on the job i never did learn the penal code how did you find me that one i do know impersonating a police officer i called the number on the real estate brochure the woman told me youd just walked out the door she gave me the guru guys address i was headed up there when i saw your car lloyd started to see red and bergen squared his shoulders and this is vigilante shit all the way wheres the backup units wheres the sheriffs blackandwhites its all about to come down and youre here by your lonesome looking scared why personally i think we should go in full bore fire team copters tear gas snipers i lloyd swung an overhand right at bergens jaw bergen caught the blow flush and went down on his back then got up on one knee and began flailing with both arms his eyes squeezed shut lloyd started to bring up an uppercut then hesitated and moved backward into the phone booth he fed dimes to the coin slot until he realized he had deposited four times the required amount cracking the door for air he deep breathed and dialed hello the voice was havillands lloyd cleared his throat and brought his voice up to tenor register doctor this is jack herzog ive been away for a while i need to see you the doctors response was a startling burst of laughter hello sergeant congratulations on a job well done lloyd said i know all about you and your father herzog left a pile of notes let linda go havilland its over yes it is over but herzogs green door would prevent him from keeping notes and if you had any evidence storm troopers would already have assaulted me and linda is here of her own free will let me talk to her no later perhaps hav lloyd doubled over as a blunt force crashed into his kidneys he dropped the receiver and slid down the wall as bergen uncoiled his fists and elbowed his way into the booth lloyd tried to get up but stomach cramps forced him to remain bent over retching for breath bergen picked up the dangling receiver and spoke into it hey guru man this is martin bergen im a reporter for the big orange insider maybe jack herzog told you about me listen hopkins and i just broke billy boy nagler he told us all about your scam the orange is going to do an expose on you talk about how you cheated your way through medical school how you studied pimp techniques with western avenue spades how chronic impotence led you to become a spiritual master you like it guru you feel like consenting to an interview lloyd got to his feet and shoved his ear in the direction of the receiver shouldering bergen partially aside so that both men were able to hear the tail end of havillands scream the long silence that came in its wake and the calm words that finally emerged yes an interview you obviously know where i am come over well barter for the truth the line went dead lloyd shoved bergen out of the booth and limped over to his car his abdominal pain abating with each step he took grabbing ginjer buchanans floor plan from the glove compartment he said have you still got your thirtyeight yes bergen whispered lloyd spread the floor plan out on the hood of the cruiser good you knock on the front door ill go in upstairs on the beach side theres a woman in the house shes innocent dont go near her keep the doctor talking for at least two minutes if he tries to pull anything weird kill him the night tripper switched on the living room amplifier and the bedroom number three speaker then walked into the kitchen and found the equivalent of his arkansas toad stabber a shortbladed serratededged steak knife he stuck the weapon in his back pants pocket and called upstairs richard come here a second oldfield appeared at the head of the stairs yes doctor were having a visitor havilland said maybe more than one stay upstairs in number three and stick close to linda listen for strange noises when you hear now come over the speaker bring linda down to me nodding mutely oldfield aboutfaced and walked back down the hall havilland stared at the front door and counted seconds savoring each little increment of time he was up to six hundred and fortythree when the doorbell rang the doctor opened the door extending his second count to six hundred and fifty standing perfectly still as he eyed the burnedout figure who had maneuvered at the center of the alchemists life and the unseen periphery of his own please come in he said bergen entered hunching forward with his hands jammed in his windbreaker pockets nice decor he said too bad i didnt bring my notebook i can never remember details unless i write them down havilland pointed to a pair of armchairs facing the latticework patio and the beach bergen walked over and sat down stretching his legs and cramming his hands deeper into his pockets sitting down beside him the doctor said wheres hopkins bergen licked his lips parked over on pch scared shitless hes crazy about this girl youre holding and hes afraid to move because he thinks youll kill her he suspects you of all kinds of felony shit but his superiors wont let him moveno hard proof we glommed billy boys diary but all we could get out of it were possible pandering beefs youre clean doc havilland breathed out slowly wondering if the burnouts right hand was holding a gun then you really have no intentions of writing an article on me you came here to offer me a deal right hopkins and i both want something personal i want all your records pertaining to jack herzog destroyed i dont want anyone to know that you counseled him hopkins wants the girl released safely if you comply hopkins drops his investigation and lets the lapd high brass deal with you and i never write a word about you and your scam what do you think havilland let the deal settle in on him the selfishness of the mens motives rang true but they obviously didnt know that he knew the game was over and if i dont comply bergen pulled out his left hand and looked at his watch then i attack you in print with a yellow journalistic fervor you wouldnt believe and crazy lloyd goes after you with everything hes got a word to the wise doc they dont call him crazy lloyd for nothing lloyd skirted the ocean side of the house looking for the foundation stanchions mentioned on the floor plan holding the ithaca pump in the crook of his arm he hugged the edge of the sand shielded from view from within the house by a wooden screen of crisscrossed trelliswork the rear stanchion was an ornately carved wooden pole leading up to a secondstory balcony that was open at the front and enclosed by a trelliswork arbor immediately before the upstairs windows lloyd grabbed the pole with his right arm and inched himself up the narrow footholds provided by the carving indentations holding the shotgun out at arms length when he was just underneath the edge of the balcony he slid the ithaca pump up and over wincing at the clatter and scrape of metal leaning his weight into the pole he released his right arm and grabbed the edge with both hands then hoisted himself onto the tar papered surface hearing nothing but silence lloyd picked up the shotgun and tiptoed over to the enclosure looking for an entry point there were no builtin doors but dead in the middle a section of wood had cracked and separated providing a crawl space seeing no other way lloyd wedged himself through splintering a large network of boards in the process the sound exploded in his ears and he closed his eyes to blot out the overwhelming sense that the whole world could hear it when he opened them he again heard nothing but silence and realized that his finger had the ithacas trigger at halfsqueeze early morning light played through the gaps in the trelliswork and reflected off the secondfloor windows lloyd threaded his way past piles of lounge chairs and over to the windows hoping to find at least one unlatched he was about to begin trying the hasps when he saw that the middle window was wide open holding the shotgun out in front of him he walked over and pulled back the curtains that blocked his view seeing nothing but an empty bedroom he stepped inside and padded to the door opening it inward with trembling hands he saw a long carpeted hallway and heard marty bergens voice surrounding him were reasonable men arent we compromise in the basis of reason isnt it we lloyd pulled the door shut wondering how bergens voice would be carrying from two places at once then it hit him william naglers diary had stated that thomas goff taped the beach womb groupings the house was obviously equipped with speakers amplifiers and bugging apparatus bergen and havilland were downstairs talking while an upstairs speaker was blasting their conversation lloyd pushed the door open and peered out cocking his ears in order to get a fix on the speaker the sound of amplified coughing delivered it the room across the hallway two doors down linda was flashing across his mind until havillands voice destroyed the image but you want innocence for jack and you cant have it hopkins wants the woman and he cant have her now and then linda was there in reality propelled out of the speaker bedroom by an unseen force lloyd jumped out into the hallway when he saw her catching a blurred glimpse of a moving object that she seemed to be shielding when linda saw him she screamed no and tried to duck back into the room revealing richard oldfield behind her hopkins no linda stumbled and fell to the floor as oldfield froze in the doorway lloyd fired twice at eye level blowing away oldfields retreating shadow and half the doorframe muzzle smoke and exploding wood filled the hallway lloyd ran through it to find linda on her feet blocking his entrance into the bedroom she pummelled him with tightly balled fists until he shoved her aside and saw an empty room and a halfopen picture window reflecting a descending object on its opposite side screaming oldfield lloyd pumped a shell into the chamber and blew the reflection and the window to bits staring into the rain of glass for geysers of red that would mark first blood all he saw was glass fallout all he heard and felt was linda pushing herself into him shrieking no until a shot reverberated stereophonically from downstairs and the bedroom speaker tearing him away from linda and down the hall to the head of the stairs from which he saw bergen and havilland wrestling on the floor for bergens kicking flailing and gouging at each other twisted into one entity that made a clean shot at the doctor impossible lloyd fired blindly at the far downstairs well startled by the explosion bergen and havilland jerked apart from each other letting the fall between them lloyd hurtled down the stairs pumping in another round and taking a running bead on the doctors head he was within a safe firing perimeter when havilland got his left hand on the revolver and aimed it at bergens midsection bergen twisted away and brought his knees up to deflect havillands arm again voiding lloyds target the doctors finger jerked the trigger twice the first shot ricocheted off the hardwood floor the second shot tore through bergens jugular lloyd saw innocent first blood cut the air and screamed hearing his own terrified wail dissolve into the sound of his ithaca kicking off a wild reflex round and the blasting three times in its echo when his tearwasted vision cleared he saw havilland stabbing bergen in the stomach with a shortbladed knife lloyd felt everything move into a thunderous slow motion slowly he worked the slide of his weapon slowly he walked to the death scene and aimed pointblank at havillands head slowly the doctor looked up from his second generation fate dropped the knife and smiled lloyd rested the muzzle on his forehead and pulled the trigger the empty chamber click resounded like hollow thunder snapping the slow motion sequence sending everything topsyturvy and breakneck fast suddenly lloyd had the shotgun reversed and was slamming the butt into havillands face over and over again until a jagged section of his cheek was sheared off and blood started to seep from his ears then the speed diminished into a vertiginous absence of light and from deep nowhere a beautiful voice called out walk richard walk the legal machinery took over and for nine straight days temporarily suspended from duty and held incommunicado at parker center lloyd watched the state of california and the city and county of los angeles bury dr john havilland in an avalanche of felony indictments a barrage of due process based on his ninetyfour page arresting officers report and havillands own written and taped memoirs the first indictment was for the murder of martin bergen the malibu district attorney expected it to be an open and shut case because a highly respected veteran police officer had witnessed the killing and because the defendant appeared to have no known relatives or friends likely to press embarrassing lawsuits against either sergeant lloyd hopkins or the los angeles police department for their jurisdictional foulup on the arrest backup charges were quick in coming as federal agents investigating the howard christie murder moved in and seized everything at havillands century city office beverly hills condominium and malibu house his handwritten notes alone led to three indictments for first degree murder handwriting experts having examined verified specimens of the doctors script along with his diary notations stating that he had ordered thomas goff to kill the proprietor of the liquor store on sunset and the hollywood freeway as proof of your desire to move beyond your beyond identical match ups three murder one indictments and an indictment for criminal conspiracy resulting the agents also found the deed to a storage garage in east los angeles and upon checking it out discovered a yellow toyota sedan and the decomposed body of thomas goff a right index print belonging to john havilland was found on the cars dashboard the district attorney of the city of los angeles ordered yet another murder indictment the federal officers could find no concrete evidence linking havilland to the murder of howard christie and gave up four days into his forced sequestering captain fred gaffaney visited lloyd at his typewriter storage roomdomicile and told him that any report that he submitted explaining martin bergens presence at the malibu house would be accepted if he agreed to edit out all mention of former officer jacob herzog and all mention of the stolen lapd files and the security firms and their files the various prosecutors thus far involved in the case had read his ninetyfour page epic and considered it overly candid and potentially embarrassing to the prosecution lloyd agreed gaffaney smiled and told him it was a wise movehe would have been summarily shitcanned from the department had he refused before he left gaffaney added that he would be appearing before the grand jury in two days was there any information he had held back lloyd lied and said no the worshippers of john havilland were taken into custody questioned and released after signing depositions elaborating their relationships with doctor john a freelance deprogrammer of religious cult captives was there to aid the district attorneys and das investigators in their interrogations the combined coercion worked four out of five times resulting in detailed accounts of brainwashing dope experimentation and sexual debasement only william nagler could not be convinced to talk he screamed his mantra and ranted about horror movies and was ultimately released to the care of his parents who admitted him to an expensive private sanitarium the das were pleased overall with their questionings the depositions would be juicy fodder for the grand jury and they would spare the sad brainwashees the grief of a courtroom appearance lloyd was not spared that grief he spoke for four straight hours almost verbatim from his new arrest report omitting all mention of herzog the security files and martin bergens outsized role in his investigation he explained bergens presence at the death house as a simple case of a bulldog reporter hot on a story when lloyd concluded his own story he did not mention richard oldfield or linda wilhite and their presences at the house or how he happened to be unconscious when the first wave of sheriffs deputies arrived on the scene when he walked back to the witness table fred gaffaney was there with a wink and glad tidings his violations of lapd canon were only going to cost him a thirtyday suspension without pay a slap on the wrist for his vigilante hooliganism the final witness to appear before the grand jury was a los angeles county deputy medical examiner who stated that in his opinion the flurry of indictments leveled at havilland was overkill because the doctors fall down a steep flight of stairs immediately before his arrest had resulted in severe and irrevocable brain damage havilland was destined to live out his years insensate not knowing who what or where he was the impact sustained by his fall had opened up lesions from a previous head injury quadrupling the neurological destruction the me ended with the statement i tried to get the man to understand that i was a doctor that i was there to examine him it was like trying to explain relativity to a turnip he kept looking at me so pathetically he had no idea that it was over but lloyd knew that it wasnt there was the unfinished business of the horror movie and the big why of lindas behavior at the beach womb and when that was settled there was the matter of homage to marty bergen nine days after the incident the press had dubbed the malibu massacre lloyd was released from his voluntary incarceration at parker center his thirtyday suspension had twentyone days left to go and he was told to remain in los angeles for the next two weeks in order to be available to the myriad das working on the havilland case he was also ordered not to speak to representatives of the media and to refrain from police work on any level returning to los angeles at large lloyd found that john havilland had become a cause for ghoulish celebration the psychiatrist was still frontpage news and a number of nightclub comedians had made him the focal point of their shticks the big orange insider had dubbed him the witch doctor and the novelty song witch doctor by david seville and the chipmunks was rereleased and climbing the top forty charles manson was interviewed in his cell at vacaville prison and proclaimed dr john havilland a cool dude medical authorities at the jail ward of the la county hospital proclaimed the doctor a vegetable and lloyd resisted his own ghoulish impulse to visit his adversary in his padded cell and throw the phrase snuff film at what remained of his brain instead before going home or partaking of any postsequestering amenities he drove to windemere drive no lapd or federal crime scene stickers on the doors or windows layers of undisturbed dust on the junctures of doors and doorjambs an ordinary looking tudor cottage in the hollywood hills lloyd sighed as he circuited the house on foot stonewall he hadnt mentioned oldfield in any of his official reports or earlier communiques and the feds who had seized havillands property either hadnt come across oldfields name or had decided to ignore it in their fearful haste to deny jack herzog the lapd and the fbi were letting the sleeping dogs that were john havillands minions lie lloyd broke into the house through a back window and went straight for the bedroom a mattress lay on the carpeted floor an identical visual match to the film scrap he had seen at billy naglers workshop reddishbrown matter stained a swatch of carpet near the window recalling the adhesive bandage he had found on the front lawn the day before the malibu apocalypse lloyd bent down and examined it blood checking the rest of the house lloyd found it cleaned of personal belongings no male clothing no toilet articles no legal or personal documents food appliances and furniture remained oldfield had fled and judging from the dust on the doorjambs he had a good head start driving back to parker center he put all thoughts regarding linda wilhite out of his mind coming to one solid conclusion havilland or oldfield had destroyed the movie had the department or the feds discovered it he would have heard again he was dealing with theory and circumstantial evidence it took officer artie cranfield a scant ten minutes to identify the reddish brown matter on the carpet swatch as type o blood thus armed with facts lloyd called the lapd missing persons bureau and requested the stats on all female caucasians age twentyfive to forty with type o blood reported missing over the past ten days only one woman fit the descriptionsherry lynn shroeder age thirtyone reported missing by her parents six days before lloyd wept when the clerk ticked off her last known place of employmentjunior miss cosmetics he had watched her walk in the door tears streaming down his face lloyd ran through the halls and out the door of parker center knowing that he was exonerated and that it wasnt enough knowing that the woman he wanted to love was innocent of the overall tapestry of evil she had been psychically violated by a madman in the parking lot he slammed the hood of his car and kicked the grill and broke off the radio aerial and molded it into a missile of hate hurling it at the twelvestory monolith that defined everything he was he sent up a vow to sherry lynn shroeder and set out to plumb the depths of his whorelovers violation a call to telecredit revealed that linda wilhite had bank balances totaling and had made no recent major purchases with any of her credit cards richard oldfield had liquidated his three savings and checking accounts and had sold a large quantity of ibm stock for a trip to la international airport armed with dmv snapshots of the two supplied the information that oldfield had boarded a flight for new york city four days after the malibu killing paying cash for his ticket and using an assumed name linda had accompanied him to the gate an alert baggage handler told lloyd that the two didnt seem like lovers they seemed more like withit sister and outofit brother lloyd drove back to la proper feeling jealous and tired and somehow afraid to go home afraid that there was something he had forgotten to do he would have to confront linda soon but before he did that he needed to pay tribute to a fallen comrade marty bergens landlady opened the door of her former tenants apartment and told lloyd that the people from the big orange had come by and taken his beatup furniture and typewriter claiming that he promised them to the tabloid in his common law will she had let them take the stuff because it was worthless but she kept the box that had the book he was working on because he owed two months rent and maybe she could sell it to the real newspapers and make up her loss was that a crime lloyd shook his head then took out his billfold and handed her all the cash it contained she grabbed it gratefully and ran down the hall to her own apartment returning with a large cardboard box overflowing with typed pages lloyd took it from her hands and pointed to the door the woman genuflected out of the apartment leaving him alone to read the manuscript ran over five hundred pages the typing bracketed with redinked editorial comments that made it seem like a complete coauthorship it was the story of two medieval warriors one prodigal one chaste who loved the same woman a princess who could only be claimed by traversing concentrically arrayed walls of fire each ring filled with progressively more hideous and bloodthirsty monsters the two warriors started out as rivals but became friends as they drew closer and closer to the princess battling demons who entered them as they entered each gauntlet of flame growing telepathic as the guardians of each others spirit when the final wall of fire stood immediately before them they revolted against the symbiosis and prepared to do battle to the death at that point the manuscript ended replaced by contrapuntal arguments in two different handwritings the quality of the prose had deteriorated in the last chapters lloyd pictured jack herzog pushed to the edge of his tether by the witch doctor trying to forge poetry out of the horror of his flickeringout life when he finally put the book down lloyd didnt know if it was good bad or indifferentonly that it had to see print as a hymn for the la dead the hymn became a dirge as he drove to linda wilhites apartment hoping that she wouldnt be there so he could go home and rest and prolong the sense of what might have been but she was lloyd walked in the halfopened door linda was sitting on the living room sofa perusing the classified section of the times when she looked up and smiled he shuddered no mighthavebeens she was going to tell him the truth hello hopkins youre late lloyd nodded at the classifieds looking for a job linda laughed and pointed to a chair no business opportunities fifty grand down and a note from the bank gets me a burger king franchise what do you think lloyd sat down its not your style seen any good movies lately linda shook her head slowly i saw a preview of one and got a vivid synopsis from one of the stars the one print was destroyed by me id forgotten how good you were hopkins i didnt think you knew that part of it im the best i even know the victims name you want to hear it no lloyd mashed his hands together and brought them toward his chest then stopped when he realized he was unconsciously aping billy naglers worship pose why linda what the fuck happened with you and oldfield linda formed her hands into a steeple then saw what she was doing and jammed them into her pockets the movie was a crazy reenactment of my parents deaths havilland pushed richard into it he ran part of the film for me at his office i freaked out and screamed richard grabbed me and they doped me and took me out to malibu richard and i talked i hit the one germ of sanity and decency that he had i convinced him that he could walk out the door like the movie and havilland never existed we were getting ready to walk when havilland called out now marty bergen could have walked out with us but then you showed up with your shotgun when lloyd remained silent linda said babe it was the right thing to do and i love you for it richard and i took off running and you could have put the cops on to us but you didnt because of what you felt for me theres no rights and wrongs in this one dont you know that lloyd brought his eyes back from deep nowhere no i dont know that oldfield killed an innocent woman he has to pay and then theres us what about that richard has paid linda said in a whisper god has he paid for the record hes long gone i dont know where he is and i dont want to know and if i did know i wouldnt tell you do you have any idea what you did do you goddamn it lindas whisper was barely audible yes i figured out that i could walk and i convinced someone else that he could too he deserves the chance dont lay your guilt on me hopkins if richard hadnt gotten hooked up with havilland he never would have killed a fly what are the odds of his meeting someone else like the witch doctor its over hopkins just let it be lloyd balled his fists and stared up at the ceiling to hold back a flood of tears its not over and what about us linda put a tentative hand on his shoulder i never saw richard hurt anybody but i saw what you did to havilland if i hadnt seen it maybe we could have given it a shot but now thats over too lloyd stood up when lindas hand dropped from his shoulder he said im going after oldfield ill try to keep your name out of it but if i cant i wont one way or the other im going to get him linda got to her feet and took lloyds hands i dont doubt it for a minute this is getting funny and sad and weird hopkins will you hold me for a minute and then split lloyd shut his eyes and held the most beautiful woman he had ever seen closing out the la end of the havilland case when he felt linda start to retreat from the embrace he turned around and walked thinking that it was over and it would never be over and wondering how he could get the herzogbergen book published outside the night shone in jetstreams of traffic light and in flames from a distant brush fire lloyd drove home and fell asleep on the couch with his clothes on
