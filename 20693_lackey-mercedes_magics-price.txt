mercedes lackey last heraldmage magics price to russell galen judith louvis and sally paduch and everyone who dreams of wearing whites one sweat ran down herald vanyels back and his ankle hurt a little he hadnt twisted it quite bad when hed slipped on the wooden floor of the salle back at the beginning of this bout but it was still bothering him five exchanges later a point of weakness and one hed better be aware of because his opponent was watching for such signs of weakness sure as the sun rose he watched his adversarys eyes within the shadows of his helm watch the eyes he remembered jervis saying over and over the eyes will tell you what the hands wont so he studied those halfhidden eyes and tried to hide his entire body behind the quillons of his blade the eyes warned him narrowing and glancing to the left just before tantras moved vanyel was ready for him experience told him just before their blades touched that this would be the last exchange he lunged toward tantras instead of retreating as tran was obviously expecting engaged and bound the others blade and disarmed him all in the space of a breath the practice blade clattered onto the floor as tantras shook his nowempty hand swearing stung did it vanyel said he straightened and pulled at the tie holding his hair out of his eyes letting it fall loose in damp strands sorry didnt mean to get quite so vigorous but you are out of shape tran i dont suppose youd accept getting old as an excuse tantras asked hopefully as he took off his gloves and examined the abused ringers vanyel snorted not a chance bard breda is old enough to be my mother and she regularly runs me around the salle you are woefully out of condition the other herald pulled off his helm and laughed ruefully youre right being seneschals herald may be high in status but its low in exercise spar with my nephew medren vanyel replied if you think im fast you should see him thatll keep you in shape he unbuckled his practice gambeson while he spoke leaving it in a pile of other equipment that needed cleaning up against the wall of the salle ill do that tantras was slower in freeing himself from the heavier armor he wore the gods know i may need to face somebody using that cutandrun style of yours some day so i might as well get used to fights that are half race and half combat and entirely unorthodox thats me unorthodox to the core vanyel racked his practice sword and headed for the door of the salle thanks for the workout tran after this morning i needed it the cool air hit his sweaty skin as he opened the door it felt wonderful so good in fact that between his reluctance to return to the palace and the fresh crispness of the early morning he decided to take a roundabout way back to his room one that would take him away from people one that would for a moment perhaps take his mind off things as well as his bout with tantras had he headed for the paths to the palace gardens fullthroated birdsong spiraled up into the empty sky vanyel let his thoughts drift away following the warbling notes leaving every weighty problem behind him until his mind was as empty as the air above van wake up your feet are soaked yfandes mindvoice sounded rather aggrieved and youre chilling yourself youre going to catch a cold heraldmage vanyel blinked and stared down at the dewladen grass of the neglected garden he couldnt actually see his feet hidden as they were by the long dank dead grass but he could feel them now that fandes had called his attention back to reality hed come out here wearing his soft suede indoor boots theyd been perfect for sparring with tran but now they are undoubtedly ruined she said acidly she sounded so like his aunt heraldmage savil that he had to smile wont be the first pair of boots ive ruined sweetheart he replied mildly his feet were very wet and very cold a week ago it wouldnt have been dew out here it would have been frost but spring was well on the way now the grass was greening under the dead growth of last year there were young leaves unfolding on every branch and a few of the earliest songbirds had begun to invade the garden vanyel had been watching and listening to a pair of them rival male yellowthroats square off in a duel of melody probably not the last article of clothing youll ruin either she said with resignation youve come a long way from the vain little peacock i chose that vain little peacock you chose would still have been in bed he yawned i think he was the more sensible one this hour of the day is positively unholy the sun was barely above the horizon and most of the palace inhabitants were still sleeping the sleep of the exhausted if not the just this halfwild garden was the only one within the palace grounds with its eastern side unblocked by buildings or walls and the thin clear sunlight poured across it making every tender leaf and grass blade glow tradition claimed this patch of earth and its maze of hedges and bowers to be the queens garden which was the reason for its current state of neglect there was no queen in valdemar now and the kings lifebonded had more urgent cares than tending pleasure gardens an old man a gardener by his earthstained apron emerged from one of the nearby doors of the palace and limped up the path toward vanyel the herald stepped to one side to let him pass and gave him a friendly enough nod of greeting but the old man completely ignored him muttering something under his breath as he brushed by his goal evidently was a rosevinecovered shed a few feet away he vanished inside it for a moment emerged with a hoe and began methodically cultivating the nearest flowerbed with it van might as well have been a spirit for all the attention the old man gave him vanyel watched him for a moment more then turned and walked slowly back toward the palace did it ever occur to you love he said to the empty air that you and i and the entire palace could vanish overnight and people like that old man would never miss us except that we wouldnt be trampling his flowers anymore yfandes replied it was a bad morning wasnt it a statement not a question yfandes had been present in the back of vanyels mind during the whole privy council session one of randis worst yet thats why i was taking my frustration out with tran vanyel kicked at an inoffensive weed growing up through the cobbles of the path and randis got some important things to take care of this afternoon formal audiences for one ambassadorial receptions i wont do not this time it has to be the king theyre insisting on it sometimes i wish i didnt have to be so politic and could knock a few diplomatic heads together tashir bless his generous young heart handled things a bit better with his lot another gardener appeared and looked at vanyel oddly as he passed van suppressed the urge to call him back and explain he must be new hell learn soon enough about heralds talking to thin air what did tashir do with his envoys i was talking to ariels darvena while you were dealing with them you know i still cant believe your brother mekeal produced a child sensitive enough to be chosen neither can i but then illogic runs in the family i guess as for tashir his envoys have been ordered to accept me as the voice of the king vanyel explained the troubles with the territories he annexed on lake evendim this lot from the lake district is touchy as hell and being received by anyone less than randi is going to be a mortal affront where did you pick that tidbit up last night after you decided that stallion from up north had a gorgeous nose yfandes interrupted primly he had a perfectly lovely nose and you and joshe were boring me to tears with your treasury accounts poor joshe he meant that less than a year in the office and trying to do the work of twenty and wishing with all his soul he was back as somebodys assistant and unfortunately tran knows less about the position then he does hes not comfortable as seneschal in the black love hes young and hes nervous and he wanted somebody else to go over his figures before he presents them to the council vanyel sighed the gods know randi cant hell be lucky to make it through this afternoon esten will help hell do anything for randi i know that but fandes the painsharing a companion can do and the strength a companion can lend just arent enough anymore and its time we all admitted what we know randis too sick for anything we know to cure vanyel took a deep breath to steady his churning insides and the very best we can hope for is to find some way to ease his pain so he can function when he has to and hope we can get treven trained soon in case we cant get treven trained in time you mean yfandes replied glumly because were running out of it i hate this van we cant do anything the healers cant do anythingrandale is just dying by inches and none of us can do anything about it except watch van replied with bitterness he gets a little worse every day and not only cant we stop it we dont even know why i mean there are some things not even the healers can cure but we dont even know what this illness thats killing randi is is it inheritable could treven have it too randi didnt show signs until his midtwenties and trev is only seventeen we could be facing the same situation we have now in another ten or fifteen years unbidden thoughts lurked at the back of his mind a good thing jisa isnt in the line of succession or people would be asking that about her too and how could i explain why shes in no danger without opening a much bigger troublebox than any of us care to deal with especially her she takes on too much its bad enough just being fifteen and the kings daughter to have to deal with the rest of this thank the gods there are some difficulties i can spare her he stared down at the overgrown path as he walked so deep in thought that yfandes tactfully withdrew from contact there were some things or so she had told him that even a companion felt uncomfortable about eavesdropping on he walked slowly through the neglected garden he took the winding path back to the door from the palace setting his feet down with exaggerated care putting off his return to the confines of the building as long as he could but his troubles had a tendency to pursue him beyond the walls uncle van a breathless young female voice called from behind him he heard the ache in the familiar voice the unshed tears he turned and opened his arms and jisa ran into them she didnt say anything she didnt have to he knew what brought her out here the same problems that had driven him out into the unkempt maze of the deserted garden shed been with her mother and father all morning right beside van doing what she could to ease randales pain and boost shavris strength van stroked her long unbound hair and let her sob into his shoulder he hadnt known she was behind him ordinarily that would have worried him but not since it was jisa she was very good at shielding so good in fact that she could render herself invisible to his othersense that was no small protection to her since if she could hide her presence from him she could certainly hide it from enemies vanyel was tied to every other herald alive and was able to sense them whenever he chose but since jisa wasnt a herald he wouldnt know where she was unless he was deliberately looking for her jisa had not yet been chosen which vanyel thought all to the good to his way of thinking she didnt need to be as an empath she was getting full healers training and van and his aunt savil were instructing her exactly as they would have a newlychosen herald if people wondered why the child of two full heralds wasnt yet chosen when every companion at haven loved her and treated her as one of their own let them continue to wonder vanyel was one of the few who knew the reason jisa hadnt been chosen because her companion would be taver and taver was the companion to the kings own jisas mother shavri so jisa and taver would not bond until shavri was dead not an event anyone cared to rush none of them not randale shavri nor vanyel were ready for even the heraldic circle to know why she hadnt been chosen jisa knew vanyel had told her but she seldom said anything about it and van didnt push her the child had more than enough to cope with as it was being an empath and living in the household of your dying parent it was one thing to know that someone you loved was going to die to share randales pain as jisa did must be as bad as any torture van could think of small wonder she came to vanyel and cried on his shoulder the greater wonder was that she didnt do so more often he insinuated a tiny thread of thought into her mind as he stroked her tangled sablebrown hair not to comfort there was no comfort in this situation just something to let her know she wasnt alone i know sweetling i know id give my sight to take this from you she turned her redeyed tearsmudged face toward his sometimes i think i cant bear it anymore ill kill something or go mad except that theres nothing to kill and going mad wouldnt change anything he smoothed the hair away from her face with both hands cupped her chin in one hand and met her hazel eyes with his own you are much too practical for me sweetling i doubt that either of those considerations would hold me for a second in your place he pretended to think for a moment i believe on the whole id choose to go mad killing something is so very messy if you want it to be satisfying and how would i get the blood out of my whites she giggled a little diverted he smiled back at her and blotted the tears from her eyes and cheeks with a handkerchief he pulled from the cuff of one sleeve youll manage as you always do dearest by taking things one day at a time and coming to me or trev when you cant bear it all on your own shoulders she sniffled and rubbed her nose with her knuckle he pulled her hand away with a mockdisapproving frown and handed her his handkerchief stop that little girl ive told you a hundred times not go out without a handkerchief what will people think to see the kings daughter wiping her nose on her sleeve that shes a barbarian i suppose jisa replied taking it with a sigh i swear ill have your women sew scratchy silver braid on all your sleeves to keep you from misusing them he frowned again and she smiled now wouldnt that be a pretty picture sewing silver braid on my clothing would be like putting lace on a horseblanket jisa dressed plainly as soberly as a priestly novice except when coerced into something more elaborate by her mother take now she was in an ordinary brown tunic and full homespun breeches that would not have been outofplace on one of the holderkin beyond the karsite border jisa jisa he sighed and shook his head her eyes lit and her pretty triangular face became prettier with the mischief behind them there were times he suspected her of dressing so plainly just to annoy him a little any other girl your age in your position would have a closet full of fine clothing my mothers maids dress better than you do mindspeech with jisa was easier than talking aloud shed been a mindspeaker since she was six and use of mindspeech was literally secondnature to her on the other hand that made it very difficult to keep things from her then no one will ever guess you are my father will they she replied impudently perhaps you should be grateful to me fatherpeacock he tugged a lock of hair mind your manners girl i get more than sufficient backchat from yfandes i dont need it from you feeling any better she rubbed her right eye with the back of her hand ignoring the handkerchief she held in it a bit she admitted then why dont you go find trev hes probably looking for you van chuckled everyone who knew them knew that the two had been inseparable from the moment treven stepped onto the palace grounds that pleased most of the circle and court except those young ladies of the court who cherished an infatuation with the handsome young herald treven was a finelyhoned blond copy of his distant cousin herald tantras one with all of trans defects not that there were many corrected he had half the girls of the court trailing languidly after him and he was jisas utterly and completely his loyalty was without question and no one among the gifted had any doubts as to his love for her sometimes that worried van not that they were so strongly attracted to each other but because treven was likely to have to make an alliancemarriage just the way his grandmother queen elspeth had it would never be a marriage in more than name vanyel was certain of that there were conditions in trevens case that his grandmother and cousin had not ever needed to consider elspeth had not been a mindspeaker randi wasnt much of one no one but another herald with that particular gift could guess how distasteful it would be for a powerful mindspeaker like trev to make love to someone who was not only mindblocked but a total stranger probably a frightened unhappy stranger one wonders how any mindspeaking monarch could be anything but chaste yet the monarchs of valdemar had done their duty before and likely would do so again probably trev would have to as well yes it was heartrending but it was a fact of life heralds did a lot of things they didnt always like as far as that went for the good of valdemar vanyel could and would have bedded anyone or anything in fact he had done something of the sort though it hadnt been exactly disagreeable van had fathered jisa with poor dear shavri when randale proved to be sterile even though his preference was then and now for his own sex shaych they called it nowfrom the tayledras word shayachern though only a handful of people in all of valdemar knew that though openly shaych hed given shavri a child because randale couldnt and because shed wanted one so desperately randi needed his lifebonded stable and whole and the need for a child had been tearing her apart and her pregnancy had stilled any rumors that randale might not be capable of fathering a child which kept the channels open for proposals of alliancemarriages to him at least until his illness became too severe to hide but because randale had needed to keep those lines open and because shavri was terrified of even the idea of ruling hed never married his lifebonded so when it became evident that randale was desperately ill and that the companions inexplicably were not going to choose jisa randales collateral lines had been searched for a suitable candidate treven was the only possible choice at that point hed been chosen two years ago he was a mindspeaker as powerful as vanyel he understood the principles of governing at least so far as they applied to his own parents borderbarony since hed been acting as his fathers righthand man since he was nine jisa had loved him from the moment hed crossed the threshold of the palace it wasnt obligatory for the kings own to be in love with her monarch but vanyel was of the opinion that it helped except that it makes things awfully complicated shes not a child anymore yfandes reminded him at that point he really looked at her and saw the body of a young woman defining the shape of what had been shapeless before this year lets not borrow trouble before we have to he thought back at his companion avoiding the topic jisa looked back at him with those tooold toowise eyes trevs waiting for me he sent me to you sometimes he knows what i need before i do he released her and stepped back a pace think you still need me she shook her head and pulled her hair back over her shoulders no i think ill be all right now i dont know how you do it father how you manage to be so strong for all of us ill go back in now but if you need me for anything he shook his head and she smiled weakly then turned and threaded her way across the overgrown flowerbeds taking the most direct route back the route he had avoided soaking her shoes and not caring in the least like father like daughter yfandes snorted shut up horse van retorted absently his own thoughts followed his daughter its a lifebonding the thing between her and trev im positive the way shes always aware of him and trev of her in a way thats not a bad thing shes going to need all the emotional help she can get when randi dies and she surely wont get it from shavri shavri is going to be in too much pain herself to help jisa assuming shavri lives a candlemark beyond randi but the problems gods above and below is she old enough to understand what trev is going to have to do that the good of valdemar may will take precedence over her happiness how can any fifteenyearold understand that especially with her heart and soul so bound up with his butshe was old enough to understand about me how well vanyel remembered the provisions of the exclusion to be as follows uncle van vanyel had looked up from the proposed new treaty with hardorn he had the odd feeling that there was something hidden in the numerous clauses and subclauses something that could cause a lot of trouble for valdemar he wasnt the only one the seneschal was uneasy and so were any heralds with the gift of foresight that so much as entered the same room with it so hed been burning candles long into the night searching for the catch trying to ferret out the problem and amend it before premonition became reality hed taken the infernal thing back to his own room where he could study it in peace it was past the hour when even the most pleasureloving courtier had sought his or her bed it was long past the hour when jisa should have been in hers yet there she stood wrapped in a robe three sizes too big for her halfin halfout of his doorway jisa hed said blinking at her as he tried to pull his thoughts out of the maze of whereases and party of the first parts jisa what are you doing still awake its papa shed said simply she moved out of the doorway and into the light her eyes were darkcircled and redrimmed i cant do anything but i cant sleep either hed held out his arms to her and shed come to him drooping into his embrace like an exhausted bird into its nest uncle van shed mindtouched him immediately and he could sense thoughts seething behind the ones she sent uncle van its not just papa i have a question and i dont know if youre going to like it or not but i have to ask you because because i need to know the answer hed smoothed her hair back off her forehead ive never lied to you and ive never put you off sweetling hed replied even when you asked uncomfortable questions go ahead she took a deep breath and shook off his hands papa isnt my real father is he you are hed had less of a shock from magelightning and hed answered without thinking iyesbut shed thrown her arms around his neck and clung to him not saying anything simply radiating relief relief and an odd subdued joy he blinked again and touched her mind tentatively sweetling do im glad she said and let him fully into her mind he saw her fears that she would become sick as randale had her puzzlement at some odd things shed overheard her mother say and the strange evasions shavri had given instead of replies the frustration when she sensed she wasnt being told the truth the bewilderment as she tried to fathom questions that became mystery and the love she had for him a love she now felt free to offer him like a gift perhaps it was that last that surprised him the most you dont mind he asked incredulously he could hardly believe it like many youngsters in adolescence shed been a little touchy around him of late hed assumed that it was because she felt uncomfortable around him and in truth hed expected it jisa knew what he was that he was shaych and what that meant at least insofar as understanding that he preferred men as close companions neither he nor her parents had seen any point in trying to hide that from her shed always been a precocious child as evidenced by this little surprise you really dont mind he repeated dazed why should i mind she asked aloud and hugged him harder just tell me why why isnt papa my father and why is it you so he had as simply and clearly as he could she might have been barely over twelve but shed taken in his words with the understanding of someone much older she left him amazed shed finally gone off to her bed but had sent him back to his treaty both bewildered and flattered that she admired him so very much and loved him so very much she still loved him admired him and trusted him sometimes she trusted him more than her parents certainly she confided more in him than in shavri he shook his head a little and continued down the cobbled path that would lead him eventually to the door out of the garden poor jisa shavri leans on her as if she were an adult depends on her for so much it hardly seems fair then again maybe i should envy the little minx i still cant get my parents to think of me as an adult all too soon he came to the end of the path buried in a tangle of hedges and vines was the chipped greenpainted door he opened it and stepped into the darkened hallway of the queens suite the rooms were just as neglected as the garden had been dark full of dusty furniture and with a faint ghost of elspeths violet perfume still hanging in the air shavri had never felt comfortable here and randale had deemed it politic after much discussion to leave this suite empty as a sign that he might take a queen that might had been hardwon from randi because although shavri was both his kings own and his lifebonded love his advisors vanyel among them had managed to convince him that he should at least appear to be free to make an alliance and seal it with a wedding shavri had seen the need but randale had been rebellious even angry with them but after hours of argument even he could not deny the fact that valdemars safety would be illserved if he acted to please only himself it was a lesson trev was going to have to learn all too soon fortunately shavri lovely quiet shavri had backed them with all the will in her slender body and that was considerable for she was a full and powerful healer as well as being a herald heraldmages were rare before taver chose shavri valdemar had never seen a heraldhealer van hoped the need would never arise for there to be another vanyel eased through the rooms with a sense as always that he was disturbing something dust motes hung in the sunbeams that shone through places where the curtains had parted despite that hint of perfume there was no sense of presence it was rather as though what he was disturbing were the rooms themselves rather than something inhabiting them there were several places in the palace like that places where it seemed as if the walls themselves were alive taver had chosen shavri when lancir had died just before elspeth herself had passed the heralds had been puzzled they hadnt known why a healer should be chosen though most assumed it was for lack of a more suitable candidate or simply because shavri and randale were lifebonded only later when shavri couldnt seem to conceive for all her trying did she suspect that the reason for tavers taking her was that something was wrong with randi and only much later did they all learn that her suspicion was correct at that point wild horses couldnt have dragged her to the altar to marry randale if there was one thing shavri didnt want it was the responsibility of rule vanyel eased open one side of the heavy double door to the main corridor and shut it behind him his own responsibilities settled over him like a tooweighty cloak he straightened his back squared his shoulders and set off down the stonefloored hall toward his own quarters in the heralds wing shavri was if truth were to be told entirely unsuited to ruling i guess we should be just as pleased that she doesnt want consort status vanyel thought nodding to an earlyrising courtier one already clad in peacockbright elaborately embellished court garb for her own sake and jisas sake i think she made the right decision i know she didnt want jisa forced into the position of heir and really this was the only way to keep that from happening she cant be sure that jisa wouldnt be chosen if the companions thought it necessary and if she were chosen and rightborn but jisas legally a bastard and cant inherit and not being chosen makes her doubly safe the stone floor gave way to wood the old palace to the new vanyel ran over the plans for the day in his mind first his audience with tashirs people then a session with the privy council then with the heraldic circle then the audiences with randale and the lake district envoys shavri would be there of course randale needed her gift and her strength she spent it all on him which left her no time or energy for any of the normal duties of the kings own no matter vanyel took those and even if shed had the strength to spare shavri had not been very skilled at those tasks shavri was abysmal at those tasks yfandes said tartly the only reason she wasnt a total failure was that she relied on taver and on you to tell her what to do and say vanyel stopped long enough to have a few words with one of joshes aides an older girlpage with a solemn face his mind only vaguely on what he was saying to the girl fandes that isnt kind maybe but its true the only thing she showed any real talent in was managing randi and in knowing where her skills werent up to the job if shavrid let randale go through with wedding her shed be next in line even before jisa and that would be a disaster vanyel wanted to be able to refute her but he couldnt shavri wasnt a ruler she wasnt even a herald except in having taver vanyel did most of her work from playing ambassador with full plenipotentiary powers to creating and signing minor legal changes into effect from being first in the circle to being first in the council to being northern guardian of the web he did it all he even took randales place in the council in the kings absence thats most of the time now yfandes observed sadly van got the answer he wanted out of the child despite his distraction she smoothed her tunic nervously plainly anxious to be gone and vanyel obliged her he was still analyzing the overtones of his conversation with jisa weve got a new problem did you pick up what i did from jisa he asked hurrying his steps toward his room his feet were beginning to ache with the cold and the wet leather had begun to chafe his ankles about the real reason why she came to cry on your shoulder the one she doesnt want to think about it was too cloudy for me to read vanyel sensed someone in his room as he neared it but it was a familiar presence though one without the feel of a herald so he didnt bother to identify his visitor shavri he said grimly its what shes picking up from her mother jisa knows randis doomed shes coming to grips with that what she cant handle is that shavris getting more desperate by the moment more afraid of being left alone jisas afraid that when randi leaves us her mother will follow he felt yfandes jerk her head up in surprise shes a healer the companion exclaimed she cant she wouldnt dont count on it dearheart vanyel answered one hand on the door latch even i cant tell you what shell do i dont think shed actively suicide on us but she is a healer she knows enough about the way that the body works to kill herself through lacking the will to live and thats what jisas afraid shell do just pine away on us and the worst of it is i think shes right he pushed the door to his spare quarters open it was full of light and air but not much else just a bed a low square table a few floorpillows a wardrobe and a couch on the couch was his visitorand despite his worries vanyel felt his mouth stretching in a real smile medren he exclaimed as the lanky brownhaired young bardtrainee rose and reached across the table to embrace him lord and lady nephew i think you get taller every week im sorry about not being able to get to your recital but medren shook long hair out of his warm brown eyes and smiled tripes it isnt my first and it isnt going to be my last thats not what i came after you for anyway no vanyel settled himself down in his favorite chair and raised an inquiring eyebrow what brings you then medren resumed his seat leaning forward over the table his eyes locking with vans something a hell of a lot more important than a stupid recital van i think have something that can help the king two vanyel closed the door behind him balanced with one hand still on the door handle and reached down to pull one of his boots off what exactly do you mean he asked examining it and deciding that it was going to survive the soaking after all forgive me if i sound skeptical medren but ive heard that particular phrase dozens of times in the past few years and in the end nothing anyone tried made any difference im sure you mean well medren perched in a chair beside the window with not only his expression but his entire body betraying how tense he was the curtains fluttered in a sudden gust of breeze wrapping themselves over his arm he pushed them away with an impatient grimace thats why i waited so long i really thought about this for a while before i decided to talk to you medren told him earnestly youve had every healer herbalist and socalled physician in the kingdom in and out of here i wasnt going to come to you unless it wasnt just me who was sure we had something vanyel pulled off his other boot and regarded his nephew dubiously hed never known medren to go overboard but there had been so many times when a new treatment had sounded promising and had achieved nothing medrens judgment was unlikely to be better than anyone elses still there was always the chance there was little doubt that in medren van was dealing with a rational adult now not an overly impressionable boy medren had grown taller in the years since vanyel had sent him off to bardic collegium and even though he hadnt put on any bulk at all he was obviously at full growth he actually looked like a pareddown thin version of his father vanyels brother mekeal except for one small detail he had his mother melennas sweet doelike eyes he must be just about ready to finish journeymans status at least vanyel realized with a start he might even be due for full bard rank ye holy stars he must be nearly twenty the curtains flapped and medren pushed them away again you know i wouldnt bring you anything trivial or untried i know better and anyway ive got my ranking to think of im one masterwork away from full bard he finished confirming vanyels startled assessment he combed his fingers restlessly through his long hair i cant start my career by getting a reputation for chasing wild geese ive had breda check this for me and shes confirmed it it seems my roommate stefen has a wild talent he can sing pain away van had made his way to the side of the bed by the end of this speech he sat down on it rather abruptly and stared at his young cousin he can what he sings pain away medren shrugged and the cloth of his redbrown tunic strained over his shoulders we dont know how we only know he can found it out when i had that foul case of marshfever and a head like an overripe pumpkin vanyel grimaced in sympathy hed had a dose of that fever himself and knew the miserable head and bone aches it brought with it stef didnt know i was in the room came in and started practicing i started to open my mouth to chase him out i figured that was the last thing i needed but after the first two notes i couldnt feel any headache point of fact i fell asleep medren leaned forward and his words tumbled out as he tried to tell vanyel everything at once i woke up when he finished he was putting his gittern away and the headache was coming back managed to gabble something out before he got away from me and we tried it again damned if i didnt fall asleep again that could have been those awful herbal teas the healers seem to set such store by vanyel reminded him they put me to sleep put you to sleep sure but they dont do much about the head besides we thought of that got at breda when i cured up told her got her to agree to play victim next time she had one of her dazzleheadaches and it worked for her too he took a deep breath and looked at vanyel expectantly it did vanyel was impressed despite his skepticism breda as someone with the bardic gift wasnt easily influenced by the illusions a strong gift could weave besides so far as he knew nothing short of a dangerous concoction of wheatsmut could ease the pain of one of her dazzleheadaches medren spread his hands damned if i know how he does it van but stefs had a way of surprising us over at bardic about once a week only eighteen and hes about to make full bard just may beat me to it anyway you were telling me how randale hates to take those paindrugs because they make him muddled but cant endure more than an hour without them yes i remember vanyel threw the abused boots in the corner and leaned forward on his bed crossing his arms i take it you think we can use this stefen instead of the drugs im not sure that would work medren the reason randi hates the drugs is that his concentration goes to pieces under them how can he do anything and listen to your friend at the same time medren swatted the curtains away again jumped to his feet and began pacing restlessly keeping his eyes on vanyel thats the whole beauty of it this wild talent of his seems to work whether youre consciously listening or not honest van i thought this out i mean if it would work when breda and i were asleep it should work under any circumstances vanyel stood up slowly this wild talent of stefens might not help but then again it might it was worth trying these days anything was worth trying and they had tried anything and everything once the healers had confessed themselves baffled hot springs mud baths diets that varied from little more than leaves and raw grains to nothing but raw meat there had been no signs of a cure no signs of improvement just increasing pain and a steadily growing weakness nothing had helped randale in the last year not even for a candlemark nothing but the debilitating mindnumbing drugs that randi hated lets go talk to breda van said abruptly kneeling and fishing his outdoor boots out from under the bed he looked up to catch medrens elated grin dont get excited he warned i know youre convinced but this may be nothing more than painsharing and randis past the point where thats at all effective he stood up boots in hand and pulled them on over his damp stockings but as you pointed out its worth trying astera knows weve tried stranger things medren kept pace with his uncle easily despite vanyels longer legs and grounddevouring strides after all he had just spent his journeyman period completely afoot in the wild northlands where villages were weeks apart fortunately it was also the shortest journeyman trial in the history of the collegium he reflected wryly recalling his aching feet sore back and the nights he spent halffrozen in his little tentshelter and it wasnt even winter yet three months up there gave me enough material for a hundred songs although so far half of them seem to be about poor souls freezing to death medren watched his uncle out of the corner of his eye trying to gauge his feelings but he couldnt tell what van was thinking in that as in any number of things vanyel hadnt changed much in the past few years though he had altered subtly from the uncle medren had first encountered gotten quieter more focused inside himself doesnt even talk to anybody about himself anymore not even savil medren frowned a little uncle van isnt doing himself any favors isolating himself like that vanyel had the kind of fineboned ascetic face that aged well with no sign of wrinkling except around the eyes and a permanent worryline between his brows his onceblack hair was thickly streaked with white but that wasnt from age that was from working magic with what he and his aunt heraldmage savil called nodes medren had gathered from vanyels complicated explanations that these nodethings were collecting points for magical energy and that they were infernally hard to deal with for whatever reason the silverstreaked hair when combined with the ageless face and a body that would have been the envy of most of medrens peers made vanyels appearance confusing even to those who knew him young old and hard to categorize add eyes the color of burnished silver eyes that seemed to look right through a person and you had the single most striking herald in whites medren frowned again and the least approachable his nephew guessed that vanyel had been purposefully learning how to control his expressions completely in the same way a bard could probably for some of the same reasons not even a flicker of eyelid gave his thoughts away over the past couple of years control had become complete even medren who knew him about as well as anyone never knew what was running through his mind unless van wanted him to know vanyel was as beautiful as a statue carved from the finest alabaster by the hand of a master but thanks to that absolute control he was also about as remote and chill as that same statue which is the way he wants it medren sighed or at least thats what he says i cant afford hostages he says i cant let anyone close enough to be used against me he doesnt even like having people know that he and i are as friendly as we areand were related he thinks it makes me a target there actually had been at least one close scrape toward the end of the tashir affair medren hadnt realized how close that scrape had been until long after in his third year at bardic and in some ways van was absolutely right in that he couldnt afford close emotional relationships if hed been the marble statue he resembled his isolation would likely have been a good thing but he wasnt he was a living human being and one who would not admit that he was desperately lonely to the lowest hells with that if he doesnt find somebody he can at least talk to besides savil hes going to go mad in white linen one of these days hes keeping everyone else sane but who can he go to nobody thats who medren gritted his teeth well well see about that uncle if you can resist stef youre a candidate for the order of saint thiera the immaculate they left the palace itself and followed a graveled path toward the separate building housing the bardic collegium a threestoried gray stone edifice the first floor held classrooms the second the rooms of such bards as taught here and the third the rooms of the apprentices and journeymen about to be made masters there were only two of the latter himself and stefen some might have objected to being roomed with stef for the younger boy was shaych and made no bones about it but not medren not with vanyel for an uncle medren reflected with tolerant amusement not that stefs anything like van if uncles a candidate for the order of saint thiera stefs a candidate for the order of the brothers of perpetual indulgence no wonder he writes good lovesongs hes certainly had enough experience one of the browntunicked bardic apprentices passed them laboring under a burden of four or five instruments they stepped off the path long enough to let her pass her eyes widened at the sight of vanyel and she swallowed and sketched a kind of salute as they passed by her van didnt notice but medren did he winked at her and returned it medren had gotten stef as a roommate before this back when he was an apprentice that was surely an experience im not sure which was stranger for me stef as he arrived or stef once he figured out what he was medren mentally shook his head what a countrybred innocent i was stef had arrived at the collegium in the care of bard lynnell barely ten and frightened half to death he had no idea what was going on or why this strange woman had plucked him off his street corner and carried him off lynnell wasnt terribly good with children and she hadnt bothered to explain much to young stefen that had been left to medren the only apprentice at the time who had no roommate and first i had to explain that this wasnt a bordello hed thought lynn was a procurer lynnell had heard the boy singing on the street corner attracting good crowds despite being accompanied only by an unskilled hag with a bodhran while the bard had no talent for taking care of children she was both skilled and graced with the bardic gift herself she had recognized stefens gift with the first notes she heard and she knew what would happen if that child was left unprotected much longer some accident would befall him he could be sold to a whoremaster some illness left untreated could ruin his voice for life there were a thousand endings to this childs story and few of them happy until lynnell had entered it anyway one thing about lynn she goes straight for what she wants so fast that most people are left gaping after her as she rides out of sight shed made enough inquiries to ascertain that the crude old woman playing the drum and collecting the coins was not stefs mother nor any kind of relative that was all it took for her to be on the sunny side of legality once that was established she had invoked bardic immunity and kidnapped him then dumped him on me medren smiled glad she did he may have gotten me into trouble but it was generally fun trouble there were some who opined that stefens preference for his own sex stemmed from some experience with that nasty old harridan that was so appalling hed totally repressed the memory privately medren thought that was unlikely so far as he was able to determine shed never laid a finger on stefen except for an occasional hard shaking or a slap now and then from everything stef said when she was sober she knew where her money was coming from she wasnt cruel just crude and not too bright so long as her little songbird kept singing she wasnt going to do anything to upset him he held the door to the bardic collegium open for his uncle and followed closely on his heels all that stef had suffered from was neglect physical and emotional the emotional neglect was quickly remedied by every adult female in the collegium who found the halfstarved bigeyed child irresistible stefs spirits certainly revived quickly enough once he discovered the attention was genuine and also learned he was to share the relative luxuries of the bardic collegium like a roof over his head every night a real bed all he could eat whenever he wanted it medren thought following vanyel up the narrow staircase to the second floor poor little lad whatever his keeper had been spending the money on it certainly wasnt high living drugs maybe the gods know stefs death on anybody he catches playing with them bard bredas rooms were right by the staircase collegium lore had it that shed picked that suite just so she could humiliate apprentices she caught sneaking in late at night the fact was that she had chosen those rooms because she was something of an empath and something of a chirugeon shed gotten early herbalist training before her gift was discovered bardic apprentices tended to get themselves in trouble with alarming regularity sometimes that trouble ended in black eyes and occasionally in worse bredas minor talents had come to the rescue of more than one wayward apprentice since the day shed settled in to teach like every other female in the place shed taken a liking to stef which was just as well once stef had reached the age of thirteen his preferences were well established and his frail build combined with those preferences got him into more fights than the rest of the apprentices combined breda had patched stefen up so many times she declared that she was considering having the healers assign him to one of their apprentices as a permanent case study vanyel paused outside the worn wooden door and knocked lightly come breda replied her deep voice still as smooth as cream despite her age and steadier than the palace foundations vanyel pushed the door ajar and let them both into the dim cool of bredas quarters medren often suspected that breda was at least half owl she was never awake before noon she stayed alert until the unholiest hours of the dawn and she kept the curtains drawn in her rooms no matter what time of day or night it was of course that could have been at least in part because she was subject to those terrible headaches during which the least amount of light was painful still walking into her quarters was like walking into a cave medren peered around trying to see her in the gloom blinking as his eyes became accustomed to it he heard a chuckle rich and throaty by the window i do read occasionally medren realized then that what hed taken for an empty chair did in fact have the bard in it hed been fooled by the shadows cast by the high back hullo van the elderly bard continued serenely come to verify your scapegrace nephews tale hmm something like that vanyel admitted finding another chair and easing himself down into it you must admit that most of the rumors of cures weve chased lately have been mistmaidens medren groped for a chair for himself winced as the legs scraped discordantly against the floor and dropped down onto its hard wooden seat sad but true breda admitted i must tell you though i was completely skeptical myself im difficult to deceive at the best of times when i have one of my spells i really dont have much thought for anything but the pain and that youngling dealt with the pain ive no idea how but he did it so i take it youre in favor of this little experiement medren thought van sounded relieved but he couldnt be sure a faint movement from the shadows in the chair signaled what might have been a shrug what have we got to lose the boy cant hurt anyone with that wild talent so the very worst that could happen is that the king will have one of our better young journeymen providing appropriately soothing background music for the audiences hell have to have someone there entertaining in any case someone with the gift to keep those ambassadors in a good mood no reason why it cant be stefen the boys amazingly good very deft so deft that even most gifted bards dont notice hes soothing them no reason at all vanyel agreed especially if hes that good can he do both at once can you mindspeak with fandes and spellcast at the same time breda countered if the spell is familiar enough vanyel pondered but i dont know hes not very experienced is he medren told me hes still a journeyman he may not be experienced but hes a damned remarkable boy breda replied with an edge to her voice you ought to pay a bit more attention to whats going on under your nose van the lads been the talk of the collegium for the past couple of years thats why we kept him here for his journeyman period instead of sending him out the boys got all three bardic requirements van not just two the gift the ability to perform and the creative talent to compose three of his ballads are in the common repertory already and hes not out of journeyman status vanyel coughed i stand rebuked he replied a hint of humor in his voice well lets give this stefen a chance do you want to tell him or shall i breda laughed you id just gotten comfortable when you two sailed in and at my age one finds stairs more than a little daunting vanyel rose and medren scrambled to join him youre just lazy thats all he mocked gently you can outdance outfight outdrink and outlast people half your age when you choose thats as may be breda replied as vanyel turned toward the door her own voice just as mocking but right now i dont choose let me know how things work out youngling medren felt a hand between his shoulderblades propelling him out the door and into the corridor just for that vanyel said over his shoulder as he closed the door i think ill see that someone tells you some time next week a pungent expletive emerged muffled through the door medren hadnt known breda knew that particular phrase though anatomically impossible it certainly would have been interesting to watch if shed decided to put his uncle in that particular position stefen or rather stefens appearance came as something of a surprise to van vanyel had been expecting something entirely different a youngster like medren but perhaps a little plainer a little taller at some point hed formed a vague notion that people gifted with extraordinary abilities tended to look perfectly ordinary stefen was far from ordinary van hung back when theyd gotten to the room medren shared with the boy prompted by the feeling that stefen might be uneasy in his presence stef had just been leaving in fact medren intercepted him right at the door and vanyel had lingered in an alcove while medren explained to the boy what they wanted of him that gave van ample opportunity to study the musician while the youngster remained unaware of the heralds scrutiny vanyels first impression was of fragility stefen was slight had he been a girl hed have been called delicate he was a little shorter than vanyel and as slim that didnt matter though vanyel could tell that stefs appearance was as deceptive as his own stefen was fineboned yes but there was muscle over that bone tough wiry muscle i wouldnt care to take him on in a street fight van observed eyes halfclosed as he studied the boy something tells me hed win dark auburn hair crowned a triangular face one composed at first impression of a pair of bottomless hazel eyes high cheekbones and the most stubborn chin van had ever seen he looks like a demented angel like that painting in the high temple of the spirit of truth the one that convinced me that knowing too much truth will drive you mad vanyel watched carefully as stef listened to medrens plans once or twice the boy nodded and some of that wavy hair fell into his eyes he brushed it out of the way absently all his attention given to his roommate he was tense that was understandable vanyel was very glad that he had chosen to keep himself out of the way now the boy was under quite enough pressure without the added stress of herald vanyels presence van was quite well aware how much he overawed most of the people he came into contact with that gardener this morning was the exception most folk reacted the way that young bardic apprentice had on the way over here the kind of mix of fear and worship that made her try to bow to him despite having both arms full and despite custom that decreed otherwise heralds were not supposed to be special rank was not supposed to matter except inside circle and council rules apparently did not apply to heraldmage vanyel ashkevron well thats neither here nor there he thought watching the young journeymanbard carefully fandes what do you think of this youngster he felt her looking out of his eyes and felt her approval before she voiced it i like him van hell give you everything he has without holding back he has a very powerful bardic gift and he does indeed have a secondary gift as well that is nearly as powerful its something like mindhealing but very specific i cant tell you any more than that until i see it in action for the first time that day vanyel allowed his hope to rise a little then you think this might work i dont know any more than you do she replied but the boy has something unusual and i think youd be a fool not to give him all he needs to wield it van blinked huh well right now the only other thing i can give him is to stay out of the way i dont want to frighten him into freezing by having the great heraldmage vanyel demonsbane descend on him the great heraldmage indeed she snorted sounds like someone i know may not fit his hats before too long medren opened the door to their room and waved stefen inside he looked back over his shoulder at van who just nodded at him the boy was doing just fine so long as stefen got to the throne room in time for the audiences vanyel didnt see any reason to interfere in the way things were going he turned and headed back down the hallway to the stairs i wont fit my hats hmm he replied as he descended the stairs isnt that interesting i was just thinking that its been too long since the last time you and i went over the advanced endurance course together who was it i overheard boasting about the times she used to make over the course if shed been human shed have spluttered van that was a long time ago the trainees are going to be out on the course at this time of the day im going to look like an outofshape old bag of bones in front of them vanyel chuckled and pushed open the door to the outside with one hand and who was it who told me she could run those trainees into the ground he hadnt known yfandes knew that particular curse he wondered if shed learned it from breda stefen sagged bonelessly into the rooms single comfortable chair and stared at a discolored spot on the plastered wall this was what i wanted right thats why i let medren talk me into trying that trick on breda i used to cure old bertes hangovers by singing them away i was sure i could do the same for what ailed medren and breda and that would get me what i needed since i knew damn well he has connections up into the court i knew hed get me in to see if i could help the king this is the only way i could think of to get court favor and get it honestly now i know i can help king randale what i can do is better for him than his taking a lot of drugs itll be a fair exchange so why am i so nervous about this he couldnt stand sitting there idle he reached automatically for the gittern he kept strung and tuned beside the chair it was one of his first student instruments worn and shabby a comforting old friend he ran his fingers over the strings in the finger exercises every bard practiced every day of his life rain or shine well or ill hed known about this trick of his this knack of singing pain away for a long time hed had it forced on him for all practical purposes by the old woman who had cared for him for as long as he could remember it was either sing her pain away or put up with her uncertain temper and trust he could get out of her reach when she was suffering a morning after old berte wasnt his mother but he couldnt remember anyone who might have been his mother there had only been berte those memories were vivid and edged with a constant hunger that was physical and emotional berte teaching him to beg before he could even walk berte making false sores of flourpaste and cows blood so that he looked ill berte binding up one of his legs so that he had to hobble with the help of a crutch the hours of sitting beside her on a street corner learning to cry on cue then the day when one of the other beggars brought out a tin whistle and stef had begun to sing along in a thin clear soprano and when hed finished there was a crowd about the three of them a crowd that tossed more coppers into bertes cracked wooden bowl than hed ever seen in his short life i looked up and i saw the expression on her face and i knew id never have to limp around on a crutch again he closed his eyes and let his fingers walk into the next set of exercises berte bought us both a real supper of cooked food from a food stall at the market fresh food not stale not crumbs and leavings and we shared a pallet and a blanket that she bought from a ragman that night that was the best day of my life it remained the best day of his life for a long while for once she had a steady source of income berte returned to the pleasures that had made her a beggar in the first place liquor and the drug called dreamerie she drank and drugged away every copper we made at least i didnt have to spend half of every night trying to run the cramps out of my legs he thought forcing the muscles in his shoulders to relax while he continued to play things were a little better i could take care of her hangovers enough so that we could get out every morning i was hungry but i wasnt quite as hungry as when wed just been begging for a living the worse she got the easier it was to hide a coin or two and once she was gone into her dreams i could sneak out and buy something to eat but i kept wondering when she was going to run afoul of whoever it was that sold her the drugs how long it would be before the craving got too much and she sold me the way shed sold her own children an involuntary shudder made both his hands tremble on the strings i was sure that was what had happened when lynnell grabbed me that night it had been late berte had just sunk into snoring oblivion and stef had eased out between the loose boards at the back of their tenement room a couple of coppers clutched in his fist he had intended to head straight for inn row where he knew he could buy a bowl of soup and all the bread he could eat for those two coppers but someone had been waiting for him a woman tall and sweetsmelling dressed all in scarlet shed grabbed his arm as he rounded the corner and there had been two uniformed guardsmen with her terror had branded her words into his memory come with me boy you belong to valdemar now he hadnt the faintest idea what shed meant he hadnt known that valdemar was the name of the kingdom where he lived he hadnt even known he lived in a kingdom all hed ever known was the town hed never even been outside its walls hed thought this valdemar was a person and that berte had either sold him or traded him away i was in terror too frightened to object too petrified to even talk i kept wondering who this valdemar was and whether it was a he or a she he smiled at the next set of memories poor lynn when she finally figured out what i thought shed bought me for she blushed as red as her tunic shed done her best to try and convince him otherwise but he really didnt believe her he really didnt believe any of it until a week or two after hed been brought to the collegium tested and confirmed in his gifts it was really medren that convinced me bless him bless breda for putting us together he was a complete country bumpkin and i was an ignorant piece of street scum and together we managed to muddle through if he was just shaych hed have been perfect he wasnt even jealous when he found out i had all three gifts too and in a greater measure than he did it took two of what were commonly called the bardic gifts to ensure entry into bardic collegium as a bardic apprentice rather than a simple minstrel the first of those two were the most common the ability to compose music often referred to as the creative gift and the unique combination of skills and aptitudes that comprised the gift of musicianship the third was more along the lines of the gift of healing or one of the heraldic gifts and that was simply called the bardic gift it seemed to be related to projective empathy a person born with it had the ability to manipulate the moods of his audience through music some of the bards of legend had been reputed to be able to control their listeners with their songs stef had all three gifts just as lynnell had suspected medren who until stefen had arrived had been the star apprentice also had all three but not to the extent stef did take the creative gift for instance medren cheerfully admitted that he could no more compose anything more complicated than a simple ballad than he could walk on water or musicianship there were few even among the master bards that were stefs peers in skill on his chosen instruments in sober truth there were few who even played as many instruments as he did although his favorite by far was the twelvestringed gittern he played virtually every string and percussion instrument known to exist and even a few wind instruments like the shepherds pipes but it was stefens bardic gift that was the most impressive even before he had revealed his ability to come between the listener and his pain the master bards had marveled at the strength of his gift untrained he could easily hold an audience of more than twenty and when he exerted himself they would be deaf and blind to anything other than himself and his music anybody but medren would have been jealous he just felt sorry for me because i was alone stefen smiled and modulated the last exercise into a lullaby there i was the cygnet among the chicks and instead of trying to peck me to bits like anyone else would have he decided i needed a protector life would have been a lot harder without him he kept me from making a lot of enemies he hadnt known until much later that a number of the sharptongued boys who initially closed their ranks against the stranger were children of highranking nobles or were nobles in their own right when he would have gone after them in the straightforward fightorbebeaten manner of the streets medren had kept him from losing his head he helped me to at least get them to accept me and i may need them i certainly couldnt afford to have any of them holding grudges he sighed and racked his instrument thats my only hope court favor and its a damned good thing medren kept me from losing it before i even had a chance at it being a bard is better than being a beggar but its still a risky profession to be in with no real security a healer can always rely on the temple to care for him if something happens to him and if a herald ends up hurt or illhavens most of them end up deadthere are always places for them here at the palace but a bard has only himself to rely on if he loses his voice or the use of his hands the harsh reality was that stefen had come from the streets and if something happened to him the streets were likely where hed end unless he built himself some kind of secure future otherwise no he got up and stared for a moment out his window at the palace the heart of all his hopes no ill do it ill make my own luck i swear i wont go back to that i wont end up like berte he gazed at the palace for a moment more then picked up the case holding his good gittern squared his shoulders and headed for the door so now valdemar needs me after all that should work i serve valdemar and we both get what we need he nodded to himself and closed the door behind him fair enough three are you going to be all right vanyel asked in an undertone then he thought savagely in the next instant of course he isnt going to be all right you fool the king was as pale as paper thin to transparency with painlines permanently etched about his mouth and eyes under any other circumstances vanyel would have ordered him back to his bed beads of sweat stood out all over his forehead with the effort of walking as far as the audience chamber and vanyel didnt have to exert his empathy to know how much pain his joints were causing him vanyel would have traded away years of his life to give the king a few moments respite from that agony but he allowed none of this to show as he settled the colorless wraith that was king randale into the heavilypadded shelter of his throne ill be fine randale replied managing a strained smile really van you worry too much but he couldnt restrain a gasp of pain as he slipped a little and hit his arm against the side of the throne vanyel cursed his own clumsiness and did his best not to clutch at randales fragile arms as he caught randale before he could fall and lowered the king carefully the rest of the way down into his seat another bruise the size of my hand and he doesnt need ten more where my fingers were really van randale repeated with patently false cheer once hed been settled as comfortably as possible you worry too much vanyel stepped back a pace ready to aid in any way he could but sensing the kings irritability at his own weakness and helplessness he also doesnt need to be reminded of how little he can do anymore the slight noise of the chambers side door opening and shutting caught randales attention he craned his head around a little to see who it was as young stefen entered the audience chamber put down a stool and began setting up near the throne is that a new bard he asked with more real interest than hed shown in anything all day i dont remember seeing that youngster in court and id surely remember that head of hair he looks like a forest fire at sunset should i tell him fandes no came the immediate reply it would be cruel to raise his hopes stefen is either going to be able to help him or not and if not better that the king simply enjoy the music as best he can vanyel sighed yfandes could be coldly pragmatic at the oddest times breda sent him over van temporized she says hes very good and you can probably use him with this particular lot of hardheads gifted hmm randale looked genuinely interested quite remarkably according to breda vanyel coughed i gather she caught something in the wind about the lake district lot and sent him over specially i understand hes to concentrate on something soothing randale actually chuckled breda is a very wise woman remind me to thank her at that moment the delegation from the lake district arrived a knot of brightlyclad figures beside the door who waited impatiently for the seneschal to announce them vanyel stepped back to his place behind the throne and to randales left while shavri stepped forward to her position as kings own at his right please he sent up a silent plea just let him get through this audience shavri nodded to the young journeyman bard and stefen began to play as the delegation formed themselves into a line and approached the throne stefen fought down the urge to stare at the king and concentrated on his tuning instead each brief glance at randale that he stole appalled him more than the one before it only the thin gold band holding his lank hair back and the deference everyone gave this man convinced him that the man on or rather in the throne was valdemars king there were two other heralds on the dais one on either side of the throne a dusky woman and a man stefen couldnt see because the woman was in his lineofsight either one of them was a more kingly figure than randale hed known that randale was sick of course that was no secret and hadnt been for as long as stefen had been in haven but he hadnt known just how sick randale was after all apprentice and journeymen bards hardly were of sufficient rank to join the court especially not bastards like medren and gutter rats like himself the bards didnt gossip about the king at least not where their students could hear them and stef had never believed more than a quarter of what the townsfolk and noblyborn students would tell the presumptive bards hed imagined that randale would look ill thin and pale perhaps since his illness was obviously serious hed never thought that the king could actually be dying randale looked like a ghost from colorless hair to skeletal features to corpsepale complexion if stef had come upon this man in a darkened hallway hed have believed all the tales of spirits haunting the palace that the king wore heraldic whites didnt help matters they only emphasized his pallor stefen was stunned he couldnt have imagined that the king was in that bad a state it didnt seem possible kings werent supposed to die in the ways ordinary mortals did when kings were ill the healers were supposed to take heroic measures and cure them kings werent supposed to have pain so much a part of their lives that every movement was hesitant tremulous kings were supposed to be able to command miracles except this one cant this one cant even command his own body to leave him in peace there was something so heroic about this man this king sitting there despite the fact that he obviously belonged in bed doing his job in spite of the fact that he was suffering stefen wanted to do something for him to protect him for the first time in his life stefen found himself wanting to help someone for no reason other than that the person needed the help and for a moment he was confused but i am getting something out of this he reminded himself notice at court maybe even the kings favor if i really do well come on stef you know whats at stake here settle down and do your work if he needs your help thats all the more reason that hell be grateful when he gets it there was a stir among the group of people beside the door and they began to sort themselves out and move toward the throne stefen looked back to the three on the dais for instructions and the darkhaired woman with the sorrowful eyes nodded at him purposefully taking that as a signal he began to play dividing his power as hed been instructed the greater part went to king randale once that was established the remainder went toward the approaching delegates soothing their fears their suspicions and they were suspicious he could read that in their attitudes just as hed been taught bards werent thoughtsensers but the kind of instruction they had in reading movement and expression sometimes made it seem that they were it was plain to stef that this lot thought randale had been playing some kind of political game with them calculatedly insulting them by making them wait for their audience look you fools he thought at them surprising himself with his anger at their attitude see what hes going through he wasnt putting you off the mans in agony every moment he spends with you hes paying for in pain he tried to put some of that behind his music and it worked he saw the mistrust in their hard closed faces fade watched the expressions turn to shock and bewilderment then faint shame he allowed himself a moment of triumph before turning his attention back to the king he hadnt quite known what to expect from randale in the way of an indication that he was doing some good he had known he would manage something in the way of relief for the king he had been completely confident of that but how much and whether there would be any outward sign it was the womans reaction that surprised him the most she clutched at the other heralds arm her expression astonished and incredulous randale simply looked well better he sat up straighter there was a bit more alertness in the set of his head and shoulders and he moved with more freedom than he had before but then stefen caught a glimpse of his face breda had been transfigured when his gift had taken away the pain of her dazzleheadache medren had revived when it had eased the misery of the fever but those reactions compared to the relief randale showed now well there simply was no comparison only at that moment did stefen realize how the king must have been living with this pain as a constant companion day and night with no hope of surcease he couldnt bear to bring that relief to an end not after seeing that so even when the audience concluded he played on allowing himself to drift into a trancestate in which there was nothing but the music and the flowing of the power through himall of it directed to randale now a cynical little voice in the back of his mind wondered at that wondered why he was so affected by this man and why he was giving so much of himself with no promise of reward he ignored that thought though he might have heeded it an hour ago now it seemed petty and ugly not sensible and realistic besides it really wasnt important anymore all that was important was the music and the places it was reaching there was only the flow of melody no real thought at all this was the world he really lived for once hed discovered it the little universe woven entirely of music this was where he belonged and nothing could touch him here not hunger not pain not loneliness he closed his eyes and let the music take him deeper into that world than he had ever gone before something brushed against stefens wandering thoughts a presence where no one had ever intruded until now what he thought and his fingers faltered for a moment that slight hesitation broke the spell he had woven about himself and suddenly he was in pain real pain and not some echo from randale his fingers ached with weariness threatening crampsthe tips burned in a way that told him hed played for much longer than he should have in fact when he opened his eyes slowly then pulled fingers that felt flayed off the strings and looked at his chording hand the reddened and slightly swollen skin told him of blisters beneath the callus blisters that are really going to hurt in a moment but that wasnt what had broken his trance there was someone standing near enough to him to have intruded on his trance but not so near as to loom over him he felt himself flushing why he wasnt quite sure it wasnt quite embarrassment it was more confusion than anything else he glanced up from his mangled hand at whoever it was that was standing beside him the audience chamber had been nearly empty when hed lost himself in his music now it was filled to overflowing but it wasnt the crowd that had broken his entrancement it was that single person the other herald the one he hadnt been able to see clearly because the woman had been in the way and now stefen knew him knew exactly who he was long silvered black hair the face every women in the court sighed over silver eyes that seemed to look straight into the heart there was no mistaking this herald for any other this was heraldmage vanyel ashkevron demonsbane they called him sometimes or firelord or shadowstalker there were a hundred names for him and twice as many tales about him ballads about him he was probably the most sungabout herald alive stefen knew every song and he knew things about vanyel that were not in the ballads for one thing he knew that vanyels reputation of being a lone wolf was wellfounded hed held himself aloof from nonheralds for years and even those he called friend were scarcely more than casual acquaintances he had no lovers not even the rumor of a lover for as long as stef had been at the collegium so the ladies set their wits to catch him each one hoping shell be the one to capture his fancy to break through that shell of ice stef would have felt sorry for them if the situation hadnt been so ridiculous the ladies were doomed to sigh in vain over vanyel their hopes could never bear fruit he knew what they didnt thanks to the fact that vanyel might just as well have taken a vow of celibacy and that the few older heralds who knew him from his younger days were not inclined to gossip because of medren stef was well aware that vanyel like stef himself was shaych and that his current state of solitude was not due to a lack of capability or desire it was due to fear according to medren fear that being close to vanyel would put prospective partners in danger fear that others he cared for could be used against him the past seemed to have proved vanyel right in some ways certainly the herald had not had a great deal of good luck in his emotional life especially with tylendel stef knew all about tylendel the heraldtrainee no one talked about at least not willingly theyd talk about his companion but theyd avoid mentioning his name if they could gala repudiated her chosen theyd say as if by mentioning tylendels name his mistake would rub off on them there were no songs and few people were willing to discuss the deceased young trainee even though that repudiation had led to vanyels coming into his powers in the first place people knew that herald vanyel had been tylendels closest friend and some even remembered that theyd been lovers but it sometimes seemed to stefen that despite that they wanted to forget that tylendel had ever existed that struck him as unfair somehow the whole tragic mess had been directly responsible for vanyel becoming the most respected and powerful heraldmage in the circle and from what stefen had learned tylendel hadnt been sane when hed pursued revenge at the cost of all else the companions knew that theyd rung the death bell for him that was why hed been buried with full honors despite the repudiation which told stef that someone thought hed have been worth his whites if he hadnt gone over the edge someone besides vanyel stefen was one of the few outside of the heraldic circle who knew that doomed tylendel had been vanyels very first lover and according to medren his lifebonded and only love and medren should know seeing that vanyel is his uncle stefen thought staring stupidly into those incredible silver eyes this was the closest by far hed ever been to the famous heraldmage though hed secretly worshiped vanyel and daydreamed about him for well years medren had offered an introduction but stef just couldnt scrape up the courage certainly medren was stefs friend and certainly medren was vanyels favorite nephew but the herald himself was as far from stefs reach as a beggar child from a star still he could dream in all those daydreams stefen imagined himself doing something wonderfulwriting a ballad that would bring tears to the eyes of everyone who heard it perhaps or performing some vague but important service for the crown he had pictured himself being presented to the court then being formally introduced to herald vanyel hed invented a hundred witty things to say something to make the herald laugh or simply to entertain him and from there the daydreams had always led to vanyels seeking out his companyand finally courting him because thanks to medrens gossip stefen was very well aware that before the heraldmage had gotten so bound up in assuming most of the duties rightfully belonging to the kings ownand before hed decided that his attentions could prove dangerous to those around him vanyel hadnt been at all celibate now the moment was here heraldmage vanyel was within arms reach and looking at him with both gratitude and concern now was the time to say or do something clever the music limped to a faltering conclusion as stefen stared back at his idol unable to think of a single word clever or otherwise vanyel pivoted and strode back over to the dais while stefens ears burned with chagrin i had my chance i had it i should have said something anything dammit why couldnt i say anything oh ye mothering gods how can i be such a gapfaced idiot the king was talking with someone in healers greens this looked like more of an interview than an audience though judging by the way they were leaning toward each other and the intensity of their concentration there was no doubt that it was an important exchange while stefen sat dumbly berating himself for being such a dolt the heraldmage interrupted the earnest colloquy with a whispered comment both randale and the healer turned their heads in his direction and stefen suddenly found himself the focus of every eye in the audience chamber he felt his face growing hot a sure sign that he was blushing he wanted to look away to hide his embarrassment but he didnt dare he knew that if he did hed look like a child and a bigger fool than he already was instead he raised his chin a little and politely ignored the scrutiny of everyone in the room and kept his eyes fixed on the king randale smiled it was an unexpected smile and stefen smiled hesitantly back it was easy enough to be cocky among his own peers but between vanyels attentions and then the kings stef was getting very flustered he struggled to keep himself from dropping his eyes the kings smile spread a little wider then he turned away he said something to vanyel something too quiet to overhear then people were suddenly clearing out of the chamber stefen blinked i guess the audience must be over in the bustle over the getting the king out of his throne and on his feet everyone seemed to have forgotten that stef existed he took a deep breath and began to pack up his things in one way he was relieved that he was no longer the center of attention but in another he was a little annoyed after all hed just played his hands bloody for randales benefit hed be a week recovering at least if it hadnt been for him there wouldnt have been a session of court this afternoon thank you stefen youre very welcome your majesty think nothing of it all in a days movement at the edge of his vision made him look up herald vanyel was walking back toward him he looked back down at his gittern and at the leather traveling case his hands were shaking which didnt make it any easier to get it into the tight leather case and didnt make him look any more confident either he hastily fumbled the buckles into place his heart pounding somewhere in the vicinity of his throat im jumping to conclusions he thought stacking his music and putting it back into the carrier hes not coming toward me he doesnt know me he has more important people to worry about hes really going to talk to somebody behind me before they leave hes here said a soft deep voice as his music carrier vanished from his hand let me help you with that stefen looked up into the clouded silver of vanyels eyes and forgot to breathe he couldnt break the eye contact it was vanyel who looked away glancing down at stefens chording hand the heralds mouth tightened and he made an odd little sound of something that sounded suspiciously like a reaction to pain stefen reminded himself that blue was not his best color and got his lungs to work again then his lungs stopped working for a second time as the herald took his elbow as if he were a friend and urged him onto his feet vanyel looked back over his shoulder at the milling crowd now clustered about the departing monarch and his lips curled in a half smile no one is going to miss either of us the herald said would you mind if i did something about those fingers uh no stefen managed at least he thought that was what he choked out it must have sounded right since vanyel steered him deftly out of the room and toward the heralds wing stefen immediately stopped being able to think he couldnt even manage a ghost of a coherent thought vanyel took the young bards music carrier and gittern away from him and gave the youngster a nudge toward the side door he refused to let stefen carry anything the boys fingers were a mess he chided himself for not having noticed sooner for that matter if id thought about how hed been playing without a break id have realized that no one not even a master bard can play all damned afternoon and not suffer damage he tightened his jaw the boy must have been in some kind of a trance otherwise hed have been in agony he guided the youngster through the door to his quarters thanking whatever deities happened to be watching that no one seemed to have noticed their exit from the audience chamber together and that there was no one in the halls that would have noticed the two of them on the way there the last thing i need is for this poor boy to end up with his reputation ruined he thought wryly pushing stefen down into the couch near the door and putting his instrument and music case on the floor next to him the youngster blinked at him dazedly confirming vanyels guess that hed put himself in a trancestate its just as well once he starts to feel those fingers well that was why vanyel had brought the boy here there was a cure for the injury two actually one of them residing in his traveling kit vanyel had become perforce something of an herbalist over the years all too often he or someone he was with had been hurt with no healer in reach he had a touch of healing gift but not reliable and not enough to heal anything serious so hed learned other ways of keeping himself and those around him alive he kept a full medical kit with him at all times even now though here at the palace he was unlikely to have to use it he found it after a moment of rummaging under the bed he knew the shape of the jar he wanted and fished it out without having to empty the entire kit out on his bed a roll of soft bandage followed and vanyel returned to the boys side with both in his hands a distinctive sharpspicy scent rose from the jar as soon as he opened it cinnamon and marigold he told the boy and took the most maltreated hand in his to spread the salve on the ridged and swollen fingertips feeling the heat of inflammation as he began his doctoring numbs and heals and its good for the muscle cramps youd be having if you hadnt played your fingers past that point im surprised you have any skin left the boy smiled shyly but didnt say anything vanyel massaged the salve into the undamaged areas of the boys hands and spread it gently on the blistered fingertips with the care the raw skin merited he wrapped each finger in a cushion of bandage then closed his eyes and invoked the tiny spark of healing talent he had along with his empathy he couldnt do much but at least he could reduce the inflammation and numb some of the pain that the salve wouldnt touch but when he opened his eyes again he was dismayed by the expression on the boys face pure adoration unadulterated heroworship as plain as the condition of the boys fingers and just as disturbing it was bad enough when he saw it in the eyes of pages and heraldtrainees or even younger heralds it made him uncomfortable to see it in the pages and sick to see it from the heralds he couldnt avoid it so hed learned to cope with it he could distance himself from it when it was someone he didnt know and wouldnt have to spend any amount of time with i cant leave it like this he decided feeling his guts knot a little iii be working with him constantly seeing him in court i cant allow him to go on thinking im some kind of godling so he said lightly as he put the boys hand down according to my nephew youre the best thing to come out of bardic in an age he raised an eyebrow and halfsmiled though if you dont show a little more sense youll play the ends of your fingers off next time and then where will you be i suppose i coulduhlearn to play with my feet the boy ventured then i could always get a job at fairtime in the freak tent van laughed as much from surprise that the boy had managed a retort as at the joke theres more to this lad than i thought well thats true enough but id rather you just learned to pace yourself a bit better ill wager you havent eaten yet either stefen looked guilty enough to convince him even before the boy shook his head vanyel snorted gods why is it that anyone under twenty seems convinced he can live on air and sunshine maybe because anyone under fifteen is convinced he has to eat his weight twice a day stefen retorted his eyes starting to sparkle so once you hit sixteen you realize youve stored up enough to live on your fat until youre thirty fat vanyel widened his eyes in mock dismay youd fade away to nothing overnight well rank does have its privileges and im going to invoke one of mine he reached for the bellrope to summon a servant then stopped with his hand around it unless youd rather go back to bardic and get a meal there me stefen shook his head the awestruck look back on his face havens no but why would you want to i mean im just youre the first person ive had to talk music with in an age vanyel replied stretching the truth just a trifle and for one thing id like to know where you got that odd fingering for the dminor diminished chord he rang the bell as he spoke a page answered so quickly vanyel was startled he sent the child off after provisions as stefen attempted to demonstrate with his bandaged hand when the page returned a few moments later laden with food and wine they were deep in a discussion of whether or not the tradition was true that the tandere cycle had been created by the same bard as blood bound once into the heated argument vanyel arguing for based on some eccentricities in the lyrics stefen just as vehemently against because of the patterns of the melodies the boy settled and began treating him as he would anyone else vanyel relaxed and began to enjoy himself stefen was certainly good company in some ways very much older than his chronological age and certainly able to hold his own in an argument this was the first chance hed had in weeks to simply sit back and talk with someone about something that had nothing whatsoever to do with politics randale or a crisis the page had brought two bottles of wine with the meal it was only when vanyel was pouring the last of the second bottle into both their glasses that he realized how late it was and how strong that wine had been he blinked and the candle flames blurred and wavered and not from a draft i think maybe ive had a little too much vanyel forced his eyes to focus and licked his lips stefen had curled up in the corner of the overstuffed couch with his legs tucked under him his eyes had the soft slightly dazed stare of someone who is drunk knows it and is trying very hard to keep everyone else from noticing vanyel glanced up at the timecandle well past midnight and both of them probably too drunk to stand much less walk certainly stefen couldnt even as vanyel looked back at him he set his goblet down with exaggerated care on the thin air beside the table in no way is he going to be able to walk back to his room vanyel thought nobly choking down the laugh that threatened to burst from his throat and fumbling for a handful of napkins as stefen swore in language that was quite enough to take the varnish off the table and snatched at the fallen goblet even if he got as far as the collegium building hed probably fall down the stairs and break his neck he mopped at the wine before it could soak into the wood of the floor stefen on his knees beside him alternately swearing and begging vans pardon seriously if i send him back to his room hell get hurt on the way i just know it maybe all hed get would be a bruising but he really could break his neck stefen sat back on his heels hands full of wet stained napkins and looked about helplessly for someplace to put themsome place where they wouldnt ruin anything else vanyel solved his dilemma by taking the cloths away from him and pitching them into a hamper beside the wardrobe he took no little pride in the fact that although he was just as drunk as stefen he managed to get the wadded cloths into the basket aside from the fact that i like this youngster theres the fact that hes proven himself valuable after his performance this afternoon id say that hes far too valuable to risk van sat back on his own heels and thought for a moment he allowed his shields to soften a little and did a quick look through the palace none of the servants are awake theres nobody id trust to see the lad safely over to his quarters except myself and right now i wouldnt trust me i can still think but i know damn well i cant walk without weaving he became aware painfully aware that stefen was looking at him with an intense and unmistakable hunger he flushed and tried not to look in the boys eyes damn damn damn damn if i let him stay it is not fair dammit hes too young he cant possibly know what he wants he thinks he wants me and maybe he does right now but in the morning thats another thing altogether he felt stefens gaze like hot sunshine against his skin felt the youngster willing him to look up and stubbornly resisted the boy was too young less than half his age and the boy was infernally attractive damn it all its not fair stefen could hardly believe it he was in herald vanyels private quarters the door was shut and they were quite alone together hed finally managed to redeem himself at least in his own eyes for looking like such an idiot in fact it looked like hed impressed vanyel once or twice in the discussion at least up until hed spilled the wine and even then he could tell that vanyel was attracted he sensed it in the way the herald was carefully looking to one side or the other but never directly at him and in the way vanyel was avoiding even an accidental touch yet vanyel wouldnt do anything whats the matter with him stefen asked himself afroth with frustration or is it me no it cant be me or is it maybe hes not sure of me maybe hes not sure of himself the wine was going to stefens head with a vengeance making him bolder than he might otherwise have been so when vanyel reached blindly for his own goblet on the table beside them stefen reached for it too and their hands closed on the stem at the same time stefens hand was atop vanyels and as vanyels startled gaze met his own he tightened his hand on the heralds vanyels ears grew hot and his hands cold he couldnt look away from stefens eyes startled and tempted by the bold invitation he read there no dammit no boy child you dont know what youre asking for in all his life vanyel had never been so tempted to throw over everything hed pledged to himself and just do what he wanted so very badly to do not that there hadnt been seduction attempts before this his enemies frequently knew what his tastes were and where his preferences lay and all too often the vehicle of temptation had been someone like thisa young seemingly innocent boy sometimes in fact it was an innocent but in all cases vanyel had been able to detect the hidden trap and avoid the bait and there had been encounters that looked like seduction attempts young impressionable children overwhelmed by his reputation and perfectly willing to give him everything he wanted from them and thats whats going on here he told himself fiercely the back of his neck hot his hand beneath stefens icy thats all thats going on i swore by everything i consider holy that i was never going to take advantage of my rank and fame to seduce anyone anyone at all much less impressionable children who have no notion of what theyre getting into no it hasnt happened before and im not going to permit it to happen now he rose to his feet perforce bringing stefen up with him once on his feet he took advantage of stefens momentary confusion to put the goblet down the boys hand slid from his reluctantly and vanyel endured a flash of dizziness that had nothing at all to do with the wine theyd been drinking come on lad he said cheerfully casually youre in no shape to walk back to your bed and im in no shape to see that you get there in one piece so youll have to make do with mine tonight he reached for the boys shoulder before the young bard could figure out what he was up to and turned him about to face the bed he gave the boy a gentle shove and stefen was so thoroughly intoxicated that he stumbled right to the enormous bedstead and only saved himself from falling by grabbing the footboard sorry vanyel replied sincerely i guess im a bit farther gone than i thought i can usually judge my shoves better than that stefen started to strip off his tunic and turned to stare as vanyel walked slowly and carefully to the storage chest and removed his bedroll what are you doing the youngster asked bewildered youre my guest vanyel said quietly busying himself with untying the cords holding the bedroll together i can do without my bed for one night the young bard sat heavily down on the side of the bed looking completely deflated but where are you going to sleep he asked as if he didnt quite believe what he was hearing the floor of course vanyel replied unrolling the parcel and looking up to grin at the boys perplexed expression it wont be the first time in fact ive slept in places a lot less comfortable than this floor but good night stefen vanyel interrupted using his gift to douse all the lights except the nightcandle in the headboard of the bed because he didnt trust his hands to snuff them without an accident he stripped off his own tunic and his boots and socks but decided against removing anything else his virtuous resistance might not survive another onslaught of temptation particularly if he wasnt clothed dont bother to get up when i do the hours i keep are positively unholy and no one sane would put up with them but good night stefen vanyel said firmly crawling in and turning his back on the room he kept his eyes tightly shut and all his shields up after a while he heard a longsuffering sigh then the sound of boots hitting the floor and cloth following then the faint sounds of someone settling into a strange bed and the nightcandle went out good night vanyel came from the darkness i appreciate this youll appreciate me more in the morning vanyel thought ironically and i hope you leave before therere too many people in the corridor or youll end up with people thinking you are shaych but good night stefen he replied youre welcome to stay as long as you like he smiled into the darkness in fact youre welcome any time consider yourself my adoptive nephew if you like and chew on that for a while lad vanyel thought as he turned over and stated at the embers of the dying fire i have the feeling that in the morning youll thank me for it four hard surface beneath him too even to be dirt too warm to be stone where van woke as he always did all at once with no transition from sleep to full awareness and since he was not where he expected to be he held himself very still waiting for memory to catch up with the rest of him a slight headache between his eyebrows gave him the clue he needed to sort himself out of course im sleeping virtuously alone on the floor with a hangover because theres a bard whos altogether too beautiful and too young in my bed and ill bet he doesnt wake up with a hangover he heard yfandes laughing in the back of his mind poor suffering child i shall certainly nominate you for sainthood van opened his eyes and the first morning light stabbed through them and straight into his brain shut up horse he groaned and closed his eyes tightly no you dont yfandes said sweetly you have an appointment with lissandra kilchas tran and your aunt remember he stifled another groan and opened his eyes again the sunlight was no dimmer now that youve reminded me yes i have done stupider things in my life than get drunk the night before a major spellcasting im sure but right now i cant recall any i can yfandes replied too promptly he knew better than to reply in the state he was in now shed be a constant step ahead of him some day he vowed to himself im going to find out how to make a companion drunk and when she wakes up ill be waiting so there was nothing for it but to crawl out of his bedroll aching in every limb from a night on the hard floor to stare resentfully at the youngster whod usurped his bed stefen lay sprawled across the entire width of the bed a beatific halfsmile on his face and deaf dumb and blind to the world dark red hair fanned across the pillow vans pillow not the least tangled with restless tossing as vans was no dark circles under stefens eyes oh no the young bard slept like an innocent child vanyel snarled silently snatched up his towels and a clean uniform and headed for the bathing room the room was very quiet this early in the morning and every sound he made echoed from the whitetiled walls he might well have been the only person alive in the palace he couldnt hear anything at all but the noise he made after plunging his head under cold water then following that torture with a hot bath he was much more inclined to face the world without biting something in fact he actually felt up to breakfast of sorts perhaps a little bread and a great deal of herb tea stefen was still blissfully asleep no doubt which made vans room off limits well it was probably too early for any of the servants to be awake he dressed quickly shivering a little as the chill morning air hit his wet skin and headed down the deserted hallways to the kitchen where he found two cooks hard at work they were pulling hot loaves from the ovens anonymous in their floured brown tunics and trousers their hair caught up under caps they gave him startled looks it probably wasnt too often that a herald wandered into their purview but they gave him a pot of tea and a bit of warm bread when he asked them for it and he took both up to the library the palace library was a good place to settle the fire was still banked from last night and a little bit of work had it crackling cheerfully under new logs filling the empty silence vanyel chose a comfortable chair near it his mug of tea on the hearthstone beside him and nibbled at his bread while watching the flames and basking in the heat the last of the headache faded under the gentle soothing warmth of the tea yfandes having sensed no doubt that he had reached the limits of his patience had remained wisely silent are you up to this she asked when his illhumor had turned to rueful contemplation of his own stupidity it wont hurt to put it off another day or even two he leaned back in his chair and tested all the channels of his mind and powers oh i think so no harm done other than to my temper sorry i snapped she sent no real thoughts in reply to that just affection he closed everything down and thought about the planned session they would be working magic of the highest order something so complicated that no one had ever tried it before if hed had any choice vanyel wouldnt be doing it now but the ranks of the heraldmages had thinned so much that there was no one to replace any of the four guardians should something happen to one of them there were no spare heraldmages anymore the web the watch spell that kept the heralds informed of danger required four experienced and powerful mages to make it work a guardian of the web was effectively tied to haven not physically but psychically as long as he or she was a guardian one fourth of the guardians energy and time were devoted to powering and monitoring the web van intended to change all that he had been gradually augmenting a magenode underneath haven for the past several years he was no tayledras but he was hawkbrothertrained creating a new node probably would have been beyond him but feeding new energyflows into an existing node wasnt he intended to power the new webspell with that node and he intended to replace the guardians with all the heralds of valdemar magegifted or no and lastly he intended to set the new webspell to do more than watch valdemar he intended to make it part of valdemars defenses albeit a subtle part he was going to summon vrondi the little airelementals used in the truth spell and summon them in greater numbers than anyone ever had before then he was going to purpose them set them to watching for disturbances in the fabric of mageenergy that lay over valdemar disturbances that would signal the presence of a mage at work no one but a mage would feel their scrutiny it would be as if there was something constantly tapping the mages shoulder at irregular intervals asking who he was and if the mage in question was not a herald it would report his presence to the nearest heraldmage this was just the initial plan if this worked vanyel intended to elaborate his protections using other elementals besides vrondi to keep valdemar as free as he could from hostile magics he wasnt quite certain where to draw the line just yet though for now it would probably be enough for every mage in valdemar to sense he was being watched it would likely drive a would be enemy right out of his mind well sitting there thinking about it wasnt going to get anything accomplished vanyel rose reluctantly from his chair left his napkin stuffed into his mug on the hearth and left the comforting warmth of the library for the chilly silence of the stonefloored corridors he headed straight for the work room the old shielded chamber in the heart of the palace that had been used for apprentice heraldmages to practice their skills under the eyes of their teachers but there were no apprentices here now and every heraldmage stationed in haven had his or her own private workrooms that would serve for training if any new youngsters with the magegift were chosen now the heavily shielded room could serve another purpose to become the heart of the new web tantras was already waiting for him when he arrived arranging the furniture vanyel had ordered a new oil lamp hung from a chain in the center of the room directly beneath it was a circular table with a depression in the middle around it stood four highbacked curved benches over in one corner tran was wrestling a heavy chair into place putting it as far from the table as possible the older herald looked up as van closed the door behind him raked graying hair out of his eyes with one hand and smiled ready vanyel asked taking his seat and putting his magefocus a large irregular piece of polished tigereye in the depression in the center he hadnt been able to find a piece of unflawed amber big enough to use as a webfocus and fireopals were too fragile to use in the web fortunately when hed replaced jaysen as guardian hed learned that he worked as well with jaysens tigereye as with opal and amber flawless tigereye was much easier to find vanyel looked back over his shoulder at his friend about as ready as im ever likely to be tantras replied shrugging his shoulders this is the first time ive ever been involved with one of these highlevel setspells of yours first time ive ever worked with one adept much less two nervous vanyel raised an eyebrow at him i wouldnt blame you weve never tried anything like this before me nervous when youre playing with something that could fry my mind like a breakfast egg tran laughed of course im nervous but i trust you i think thanks for the vote of confidence van began when the door behind him opened and the other three heraldmages entered in a chattering knot the chattering subsided as they took their places around the table savil directly across from van in the west kilchas in the south lissandra in the north savil hadnt changed much in the last ten years lean and spare as an aged greyhound she moved stiffly and seldom left haven anymore her hair was pure silver but it had been that color since she was in her early forties working with nodemagic was the cause the powerful energies bleached hair and eyes to silver and blue and the more one worked with it the sooner one went entirely silver she placed her magefocus a perfect unflawed natural crystal of rosequartz opposite the tigereye she pursed her lips and contemplated the arrangement then adjusted her stone until one side of the crystal was just touching the tigereye before she sat down she smiled briefly at vanyel then her blue eyes darkened as she began opening up her own channels her face lost expression as she concentrated what wrinkles she had were clustered around her eyes and mouth there was nothing about her that told her true age which was just shy of eighty on the other hand kilchas looked far older than savil although in reality he was twenty years younger a wizened shriveled old tree of a man he had more wrinkles than a dried apple hair like a tangle of gray wire and a smile that could call an answering grin from just about anyone at the moment that smile was nowhere in evidence he set his focusstone touching vanyels and savils a piece of translucent applegreen jade hed had it carved into the shape of a pyramid he fussed with it a moment until its position satisfied him then he took his seat and lowered his eyelids to concentrate frowning a little and his eyes were lost in his creased and weathered face lissandra was the most senior of the guardians despite being younger than vanyel she had been a guardian for much longer even than savil she had assumed the northern quadrant along with her whites and although she was not quite adept status she wasnt far from it outside of her duties as a heraldmage she specialized in alchemy in poisons and their antidotes taller than many men and brown of hair eyes and skin her movements were deliberate and yet oddly birdlike she had always reminded vanyel of a stalking marshheron like a heron she wasted no motion she dropped her halfglobe of obsidian in precisely the right place and sat down in her chair planting her elbows on the table and steepling her fingers in front of her face tantras settled gingerly in his chair in the corner as vanyel reached for the lamp dimming it until everything outside the table was hardly more than a dim shadow he reached into his belt pouch and felt for the final stone hed selected for this spell a single flawless quartzcrystal perfectly formed unkeyed and as colorless as pure water and i must have gone through five hundredweight of quartz to find it he closed his hand around it a sharpedged lump wrapped carefully in silk to insulate it and brought it out into the light the silk fell away from it as he placed it atop the other four and it glowed with light refracted through all its facets lissandra nodded her approval kilchas eyes widened and savil smiled i take it that we are ready vanyel asked he didnt need their nods as he lowered all of his barriers and brought them into rapport with him he felt their assent now he closed his eyes the better to concentrate on bringing them all completely into rapport with himself and each other hed worked with savil so many times that he and his aunt joined together with the firm clasp of longtime dancing partners or lovers she teased catching the essence of the fleeting thought he smiled youre not my type dearest aunt besides youd wear me out he reached for kilchas next half expecting a certain reticence given that van was shaych but there was nothing of the sort im too old to be bothered by inconsequentials boy came the acid reply strong and clear you dont spend most of your life in other peoples heads without losing every prejudice you ever had kilchas mind meshed easily enough with theirs not surprising really given that he was the best mindspeaker in the circle but vanyel found it very hard to match the vibrations of his magic the old man was powerful but his control was crude which was why he had never gotten to adept status he was much like a sculptor used to working with an axe instead of a chisel every time van thought he had their shields matched the old man would reach toward him impatiently or his shields would react to the presence of alien power and the protections would flare which had the effect of knocking the meld of van and his aunt away vanyel opened his eyes clenching his teeth in frustration and saw kilchas shaking his head sorry about that lad he said gruffly im better at blasting things apart than putting them together and im fraid some things have gotten instinctive would you object to having me or savil match everything for you vanyel asked unclenching his fists and twisting his head to loosen his tensed shoulder muscles you mean you take over kilchas frowned i thought heralds didnt do that isnt that the protocol well yes and no savil replied massaging her temples with her fingertips yes thats the protocol but the protocol was never meant for mindspeaking adepts especially not with the strong gifts my nephew and i have van and i can get in there show you what to do then get out again without leaving anything of ourselves behind occasionally rules were made to be broken youre sure kilchas said doubtfully i dont want to find myself not knowing if an odd thought is a bit of one of you left over from this spellcasting or someone trying to squeak past my shielding im positive van told him its how the tayledras trained me one of them would take over walk me through something then get out and expect me to imitate them kilchas sighed and placed both his palms flat on the tabletop all right then savil by preference van youre the one directing this little fireworks show id rather you had your mind on that and not distracted with one old mans wavering controls good enough vanyel nodded relieved that it was nothing more personal than that kilchas reasoning made excellent sense lets try this again this time he waited watching for his aunt to take over kilchas magepowers and bring them into harmony with her own putting into place a much finer level of control than he had learned on his own not to fault kilchas for all that his hobby was the peaceable one of astronomy hed been primarily an offensive combat mage he hadnt had much time to learn the kind of control van and savil had nor had he any reason so we take a shortcut yfandes said softly theres nothing wrong with a shortcut i wish this were going faster though so do i love van replied watching the edges of kilchas shields for the moment when the fluctuations ended since that would signal savils success i take it that the others are impatient kilchas rohan is petrified she said frankly hes afraid kilchas isnt up to this lissandras shonsea just wants it over shes not happy about this but shes confident that lissandra can handle her part i dont blame her for being unhappy i want it over too im not going to be worth much when we finish this job suddenly kilchas shields stopped pulsing and the color smoothed to an even yellowgold tell her it wont be long now he reached out again to his aunt and let her bring him into the meld to avoid disturbing kilchas fragile control then before the delicate balance could fall apart he and savil flung lines of power to lissandra the fourth guardian was used to working with savil she had been waiting for them and with the smooth timing of a professional acrobat caught them and drew herself into the meld vanyel had in the nottoodistant past had more than one dislocated joint the snap as lissandra locked herself into place was a physical sensation very like having a bone put back in the socket and once she was there the meld stabilized a ring instead of an arc vanyel breathed a sigh of relief and yfandes took that as the signal to bring the companions into the meld they were to be the foundation the anchoring point so that none of them would be caught up in the currents of magepower vanyel would be using and find themselves lost kilchas and lissandra would be contributing their powers and their presence and savil her expertise in handling vrondi but most of this would be up to vanyel vanyel had worked this entire procedure out with the tayledras adepts of ktreva taking several years to research and test his ideas the hawkbrothers moondance and starwind and their fosterson brightstar were the ones that had helped him the most no one knew nodemagic like the tayledras did they were bred in and of it and those that were magegifted handled it from the time their gifts first began to manifest which could be as young as eight or nine and amongthe ktreva clan those three were the unrivaled masters of their calling in point of fact it had been the spell that another master of an unidentified tayledras clan had left behind in lineas long ago the one that bound tashirs family to the protection of the heartstone there that had given van the idea for this in the first place in that case the compulsions set by the spell had been relatively simple guard the heartstone discourage the use of magic keep the stone and the power it tapped out of the hands of unscrupulous mages while tayledras normally drained any area they abandoned of magic they had left the heartstone in what would become the capital of lineas because the stone had been bound into another spell meant to heal a magecaused faultline that spell would take centuries to complete and meanwhile only magic was keeping the fault stable if that magic were to be drained the devastation caused by the resulting earthquake would be extensive carrying even into valdemar tashirs family had been selected precisely because they had no magegift and little talent with mindmagic although this would ensure that none of them would succumb to the temptation to use the magic that meant that the creators of the spell had very little to work with vanyel had all of the heralds and all their varied gifts to integrate into his spell so what he planned to do was infinitely more complicated though the results would be equally beneficial first things first he told himself get a good shield up around the four of us if anything goes wrong i dont want tran caught in the backlash the shield was the tightest hed ever built and when he was finished the other three guardians tested it for possible leaks and weak points ironically of the five of them it was tantras who sat outside that shield who would be in the most danger if anything got loose the work room itself was shielded and so securely that even sounds from without came through the walls muffled when they penetrated at all each of them had their own personal shields that in part was what had been the cause of the difficulty van had in melding with kilchas those shields never came down and it was difficult to match shields one to another so that the power would flow between mages without interruption or interference if the energy van planned to call up got away from him he and the others would be protected by their personal shields the work room shields would protect those beyond the doors but tran would be caught in between the two and since he wasnt a mage he had none of his own van had spent many hours manufacturing protections for him but theyd never been tested to destruction and he had no idea how much they would really take he knows that yfandes reminded him and he agreed life is a risk our lives ten times the risk somehow that only made vanyel feel guiltier but he had no choice his decision to go ahead was based entirely on valdemars need the problem was that the magegift had always been rare and the troubles following elspeths passing had resulted in the deaths of more heraldmages than could be replaced it had been appallingly clear to vanyel after the death of heraldmage jaysen that there werent going to be enough guardiancandidates to take over the vacant seat in the web in the event of another death yet the web was valdemars only means of anticipating danger before it crossed the border heralds with no magegift but with very powerful gifts of mindspeech or farsight had been tested in the seats the webspell wouldnt work for them because it was powered by a mages own personal energies and there was no way for a herald without the magegift to supply that energy what vanyel proposed was to modify that spell for the first time since his gifts had been awakened he dropped all but the last of his shields every mage ever born could establish a line to the mind of another with whom he had shared magic but vanyel had a line to every living herald in valdemar by virtue of their being heralds when his shields were down he found himself part of a vast network linking all the heralds together as delicate as a snowflake as intricate as the finest lacework the strands of power that bound them all were deeplaid but strong they pulsed with life as if someone had joined every star in the night sky to every other star linking them with faint strands of spuncrystal light it was beautiful hed suspected this network existed from the glimpses hed caught when following his lines to other heralds but this was the first time vanyel had ever seen the whole of it through his mind the others saw the same amazing kilchas said at last why has no one ever spoken of this before probably because unless your gift is very strong you cant detect it since the actual linkage is through the companions vanyel replied we share magic with the heralds without the magegift through the companions thats the other reason i wanted them in the meld i can see this without them but with them i can also manipulate it this must be what king valdemar first saw when he created the web savils mindvoice was subdued except that things were a lot less complicated in his day vanyel said dryly lets get to this before we lose the meld or we get bored with your chatter and find something more interesting yfandes mindspoke him alone one more comment like that and ill replace you with one of the tayledras birds vanyel retorted before fandes had a chance to respond savil had begun invoking the web and vans attention was fully take up with the task at hand as each guardian responded his or her focusstone came alive with power when lissandra completed her response the four stones were glowing softly as brightly as the lamp flame above them and the quartz crystal that topped them was refracting their light in little spots of rainbow all over the room now vanyel closed his eyes and saw the web overlaying the network lacing the entire kingdom there were secondary lines of power wisping out from the web as if the spellstructure was trying to make full contact with the entire body of heralds and yet lacked the power and direction to do so that was exactly what moondance had surmised the spellstructure was capable of linking all heralds but was incomplete and underpowered there was no way of knowing if king valdemar had intended that or not somehow the idea of legendary valdemar being incapable of completing such a spell did not make vanyel feel any easier if he couldnt how in havens can we never mind he was already committed and it was too late to back out now he reached for the assemblage of focusstones in the center of the table felt a sudden flare of heatilightipressure as he melded with all five of them then stabbed his power deep into the earth below haven to the ancient node there a node he and savil had reawakened it was very deep and hard to sense but now that it was active it was one of the most powerful hed ever used finding it was like plunging into the heart of the sun too overwhelming to be painfulit was beyond painand it threatened to burn him away from himself it was easy to be lost in a node and that was why the companions were in this meld after the first breathless mindnumbing contact he felt them anchoring him reminding him of where and what he was it took him a moment to lean on their strength and steady himself to catch his breath then he took hold of the heart of the node braced himself and pulled this was something no one outside of the tayledras clans had ever attempted vanyel was going to create a heartstone a small one but nevertheless a true heartstone he was fire he was riven earth he was molten rock he was raging water and lightning he was ancient and newborn he was with no memory and no anchor no identity then something prodded him a name yfandes he remembered with memory came sensation he was agony he pulled though his nerves screamed and his heart raced overburdened he pulled though it felt as though he was pulling himself apart slowly reluctantly the power swelled then settled again at his command he reached again this time for the web and brought it into contact with the raw power of the nodecontact wasnt enough he entered the web itself reached from inside it with mental hands that were burned and raw and with the melded will of the four guardians and their companions forced it to match magics with the raw nodepower and take it in and with the very last of his strength keyed it the web flared from the heart of it he saw and felt the power surging through it opening up new connections casting new lines until the web was no longer distinguishable from the fainter but more extensive network hed seen before he cast himself free from the new heartstone and sent delicate tendrils of thought along the new forcelines of the web and wanted to shout with joy at what he found for the spell had taken full effect from this moment on all heralds were now one with valdemar and all were bound into the web in whatever way their gifts could best serve when danger threatened the farseers would know where the foreseers would know when and every herald needed to handle the danger would find himself aware of the peril and its location at that moment vanyel felt the companions withdraw themselves from the meld for a moment he panicked until he saw that the new web was still in place still intact damn id hoped but theyre still laws unto themselves he thought ruefully they were apart from the web before and it looks like theyve decided its going to stay that way too bad we could have used them to make up for heralds with weak gifts and since every human magic ive seen has always left them unaffected i was hoping they might have conferred that immunity on us companions have never done more than aid their chosen but it would have been nice if this time had been an exception at least his original intentions were holding the new web was powered by the magic of the node and only augmented by the heralds instead of depending entirely on them when the call came those without more pressing emergencies would leave everything to meet greater threats to valdemar now for the addition to the web protections he dropped out of the meld for this was something he had to handle alone he stilled himself isolated himself from every outside sensation then brought savil in closer together they reached out to the vrondi and called one came immediately then a dozen then a hundred and still they called until the air elementals pressed around them on all sides thousands of the creatures it was a good thing they didnt really exist on the same plane of reality where his body slumped in the work room or he and everyone in it would have been smothered he reached again much more carefully this time and created a new line to the web and the power it fed upon and showed it to the assembled vrondi as savil told them wordlessly that this power would be theirs for the taking they surged forward hungrily if said savil holding the line a bit out of their reach if the word echoed from vrondi to vrondi ripples of hungeridoubtihunger if if they withdrew a little and contemplated both of them finally they responded what vanyel showed them as savil held the line to earn the power all they need do would be to watch for mages always watch for mages and let them know they were being watched they swirled about him about savil thousands of blue eyes in little mistclouds all they asked in a chorus of mindvoices thats all he replied feeling the strength of his own power starting to fade watch let them know you watch the vrondi swirled around him thinking it over then just when he was beginning to worry yes they cried and seized on the line of power and vanished and he let go of savil of the meld and let himself fall gods kilchas moaned vanyel raised his head from the table where hed slumped forward my sentiments exactly kilchas was halflying on the table with his hands over his head fingers tangled in his gray mane i think lissandra said pronouncing the words with care that i am going to sleep for a week did your thing with the vrondi work they took it vanyel replied staring at the single globe of iridescent crystal in the center of the table where the grouping of five stones had been every mage inside the borders of valdemar is going to know hes being watched thats going to make him uncomfortable if he doesnt belong here or hes up to no good the deeper inside valdemar the more vrondi hell attract and the worse hell feel and hell have to shield pretty heavily to avoid detection savil added leaning into the back of her chair and letting it support all her weight the vrondi are quite sensitive to mageenergy and theyre curious as all hell i suspect wild ones will start joining our bound ones in watching out for mages just for the amusement factor thats good as far as it goes lissandra reached out and touched the globe in the center with an expression of bemusement but it doesnt let us know we have mages working on our territory not unless you can get the vrondi to tell us i do have some other plans vanyel admitted id like to get the vrondi to react to strange mages with alarm and since theyre now bound into the web that in itself would feed back to the heralds but i havent got that part worked out yet i dont want them to react that way to heraldmages for one thing and for another im not sure the vrondi are capable of telling mages apart neither am i savil said dubiously seems to me its enough to let mages know theyre being watched if youre guilty that alone is enough to make you jumpy kilchas had managed to stand up while they were talking he reached for the globe and tried to pick it up his expression of surprise when he couldnt made vanyel chuckle weakly thats a heartstone now he said apologetically its fused to the table and the table is fused to the stone of the palace and the bedrock beneath it oh kilchas replied sitting down with a thump vanyel banished the shields then turned to the only person in the room who hadnt yet spoken a single word van leaned against the back of his chair and faced tantras well he asked tran nodded its there all right theres something there that wasnt a part of of me before what about the troublespots vanyel asked the other herald closed his eyes and frowned with concentration im trying to think of a map he said finally im working my way around the border its like reading an object i get a kind of sick feeling when i come up on some place where therere problems ill bet it would be even more accurate if i had a real map vanyel sighed and slumped his shoulders allowing his exhaustion to catch up with him then we did it i never doubted it savil retorted nor i said the familiar voice in his head then its time for me to go fall on my nose i think ive earned it vanyel got to his feet feeling every joint ache i think all of us have earned it aye to that lissandra copied him kilchas levered himself up with the aid of the table and savil needed tantras help to get her onto her feet vanyel headed for the door and pulled it open leaving the others to take care of themselves right now all he could think about was his bedand how badly he needed it he walked wearily down the corridor leading out of the old palace and toward his quarters doing his best not to stagger he was so tired that it would probably look as if he was drunk and that wouldnt do the heraldic reputation any good oh i dont know yfandes chuckled you might get more invitations to parties that way i might but would they be parties id want to attend probably not she acknowledged it didnt occur to him until he was most of the way to the heralds wing that his bed might not be unoccupied but it was he pulled his door open to find his room empty the bed made and no sign of his visitor anywhere evidently the servants had already cleaned and tidied his quarters there was nothing out of the ordinary about the room he clung to the doorframe surprised by his own disappointment that the young bard hadnt at least stayed long enough to make some arrangements to get together again this time with a little less wine that disappointment made no sense hed only met the boy last night and he couldnt afford close friends hed told himself that over and over anybody you let close is liable to become a target or a hostage he repeated to himself for the thousandth time you cant afford friends fool you should be grateful that the boy came to his senses you can talk to him safely in court you know very well that after yesterday youre going to be seeing him there every day that should certainly be enough he had no idea what he was offering you last night it was the wine and his heroworship talking youre too old and hes too young but his bed when he threw himself into it seemed very cold and very empty five a door closed somewhere nearby stefen stretched only halfawake and when his right hand didnt hit the wall he woke up entirely with a start of surprise he found himself staring at a portion of wood paneling rather than plastercovered stone it was an entirely unfamiliar wall therefore he wasnt in his own bed well that wasnt too terribly unusual over the course of the past couple of years hed woken up in any number of beds with a wide variety of partners what was unusual was that this morning he was quite alone and every sign indicated hed gone to sleep that way he rubbed his eyes and turned over and blinked at the room beyond the bedcurtains there on the floor like a mute reproach was a rumpled bedroll looks like i did go to bed alone damn a pile of discarded clothing unmistakably heraldic whites lay beside the bedroll so it wasnt a dream stefen sat up and ran his right hand through his tangled hair i really did end up in herald vanyels room last night and if he slept there and i slept here stefen frowned hes shaych i certainly made an advance toward him he was attracted what went wrong stef unwound the blankets from around himself and slid out of vanyels bed on the table beside the chairs on the opposite side of the room were the remains of last nights supper and two empty bottles of wine i wasnt that drunk i know what i did it should have worked why didnt it he was certainly drunk enough not to be shy should i have been more aggressive he reached down to the floor picked up his tunic and pulled it over his head his boots seemed to have vanished but he thought he remembered taking them off early in the evening he found the footgear after a bit of searching where theyd been pushed under one of the chairs and sat down on the floor to pull them on his bandaged left hand making him a little awkward no i think being aggressive would have repelled him i read him right dammit another thought occurred to him then and he stopped with his left foot halfway in the boot but what if he wasnt reading me right what if he thinks im just some kind of bedazzled child ye gods little does he know stef started to smile at that thought when another thought sobered him but if he knew or if he finds out what would he think then that was a disturbing notion indeed i havent exactly been discreet or terribly discriminating he felt himself blushing withshame it certainly felt like it i was just enjoying myself i never hurt anybody i didnt think it mattered but maybe to somebody like vanyel who had never had more than a handful of lovers in his life it might matter and before last night stef would have shrugged that kind of reaction off and gone on to someone else before last night it wouldnt have mattered but something had happened last night something that made what vanyel thought very important to stefen maybe thats it maybe its that hes heard about me heard about the way ive been living and but that didnt make any sense either vanyel hadnt been repelled or at least he hadnt shown any sign of it hed just put stefen to bed alone like a child or like his nephew and left him to sleep his drunk off and had himself gone to some duty or other this morning without a single word of reproach stef stood up collected his gittern and music case from where they were propped beside the door and slipped out into the hallway still completely at a loss for what to think all i know is its a good thing nobody knows i slept alone last night or my reputation would be ruined there were no less than four messages waiting for him when he reached the room he shared with medren fortunately his friend wasnt in he didnt want to face the older journeyman until he could think of a reasonable excuse for what hadnt happened there were times when medren could be worse than the village matchmaker and he didnt even want to look at all those messages until after he was clean and fed the first was easily taken care of in the students bathing room the youngsters were all in class at this hour and the bathing room deserted the second was even easier hed learned when he was a student himself that his slight frame and a wistful expression could coax food out of the cooks no matter how busy they were thus fortified he went back to his room to discover that the messages had spawned two more in his absence he sat down on his bed to read them four of the six messages were from healers one from the dean of healers collegium two from randales personal physicians and one astonishingly from lady shavri herself they all began much alike with variations on the same theme effusive but obviously genuine gratitude assurance that he had done more for the kings comfort than he could guess the dean asked obliquely if he would be willing to allow the healers to study him the kings attending healers hinted at requests to attach him directly to the court shavris note said bluntly i intend to do everything i can to see that you are well rewarded for the services you performed for randale as kings own i will be consulting with the dean of your collegium and the head of the bardic circle if you are willing to continue to serve randale journeyman stefen i will do my best for you stef held the last message in his bandaged hand and contemplated it with amazement and elation last night i thought theyd forgotten i existed vanyel was the only one who seemed to care that id played my hand raw for them but this then his keen sense of reality intruded shavri hadnt promised anything specific the others had only been interested in finding out if hed work with them and while their gratitude was nice it didnt put any silver in his pocket or grant him a permanent position there were two more messages and one was from the dean of the bardic collegium there was no telling what they held you spent too much time with vanyel stef he told himself all that altruism is catching the fifth was from medren letting him know that his roommate was taking a week to travel up north of the city with a couple of full bards for a spring fair i want to try out some new songs pick up some others the note concluded sorry about running off like this but i didnt get much notice hope things work out for you an oblique and discreet hint if ever i heard one stef thought cynically obviously he noticed i didnt come back to the room last night and ill bet hes wondering if it was his uncle i was with unless somebody already told him stefen sighed horseturds i hope not if nobody knows ill have a chance to make something up to satisfy his curiosity between then and now that left the message from the dean of the collegium stefen weighed it in his hand and wished he could tell if it was good or bad news before he opened it but he couldnt and there was no point in putting it off further he broke the seal hesitated a moment further and unfolded the thick vellum sealed and written on brand new vellum not a scrap of palimpsest very officialwhich means either very good or very bad he skimmed through the formal greeting then stopped cold as his eyes took in the next words but his mind refused to grasp them at the second noon bell the bardic circle will meet to consider your status and disposition please hold yourself ready to receive our judgment what did i do he thought wildly i only just made journeyman they cant be meaning to jump me to master but why would they demote me what could i have possibly done that was that bad unless they just found something out about my past that could be it not something hed done but something he was the lost heir to some title or other no not likely that sort of thing only happened in apprenticeballads but there were other things that might cause the circle to have to demote him at least temporarily if his family ran to inheritable insanity for instance theyd want to make sure he wasnt going to run mad with a cleaver before they restored his rank or if hed been pledged to wed in infancy now there was a horrid thought in that case the only thing that would save him would be apprenticerank apprentices were not permitted marriage and galling as it would be to be demoted it would be a lot worse to find himself shackled to some pudgy bakers daughter with a face like her fathers unbaked loaves but being demoted would give the bardic collegium all the time they needed to get him free of the pledge or simply outwait the wouldbe spouse delaying and delaying until the parents gave up and fobbed her off on someone else or until they found out about his sexual preferences even in valdemar most fathers would sooner see their daughters married to a gaffer a drunkard or a goat than to someone who was shaych for one thing theyd never get any grandchildren out of me stef thought grimly and as long as im an anonymous apprentice theres no status or money to be gained by forcing a marriage through anyway that seemed the likeliest far likelier than that the circle would convene to elevate an eighteenyearold barely three months a journeyman to master rank well there was only one way to find out get himself down to the council hall and wait there for the answer but first hed better make himself presentable he flung himself into the chest holding his clothing in a search for one set of bardic scarlets that wasnt much the worse for hard wearing waiting was the hardest thing in the world for stefen and he found himself waiting for candlemarks outside the council chamber he did not wait graciously the single hard wooden chair was a torture to sit in so he opted for one of the benches meant for hopeful tradesmen instead he managed to stay put rather than pacing the length and breadth of the anteroom but he didnt sit quietly he fidgeted rubbing at the bandages on his fingers tapping one foot fortunately there was no one else in the room or they might have been driven to desperate measures by his fretting finally with scarcely half a candlemark left until the bell signaling supper the door opened and bard breda beckoned him inside he jumped to his feet and obeyed his stomach in knots his right hand clenched tightly on his bandaged left the council chamber the heart of bardic collegium was not particularly large in fact there was just barely room for him to stand facing the members of the bardic council once the door was closed the council consisted of seven members including his escort breda she took her place at the end of the square marbletopped table around which they were gathered there was an untidy scattering of papers in front of the chief councillor bard dellar the councillor looked nothing like a bard which sometimes led to some awkward moments set slightly askew in a face much like a lumpy potato were a nose that resembled a knot on that potato separating a mouth so wide dellar could eat an entire loaf of bread in one bite and a pair of bright black eyes that would have well suited a raven well dellar said his mouth stretching even wider in a caricature of a grin youve certainly been the cause of much excitement this morning and no end of trouble i might add stefen licked his lips and decided not to say anything dellar looked friendly and quite affable so the trouble couldnt have been that bad cheer up stefen breda chuckled cocking her head to one side youre not at fault what caused all the problems was that we were trying to satisfy everyone without hurting anyones feelings making you a master and assigning you directly to randale was bound to put someone out unless we did it carefully making me what stefen gulped dellar laughed at the look on his face were making you a full bard lad shavri was most insistent on that the chief councillor smiled again and stef managed to smile back dellar picked up the papers in front of him and shuffled them into a ragged pile she doesnt want a valuable young man like you gallivanting about the countryside getting yourself in scrapes nonsense dell breda cut him off with an imperious wave of her hand and pointed an emphatic finger at stefen what shavri did or didnt want wouldnt have mattered a pin if you werent also one of the brightest and best apprentices weve had in bardic in i dont know ages at any rate we dont make exceptions because someone with rank pressures us stefen we do make them when someone is worthy of them you are you have no need to prove yourself out in the world and your unique gift makes you double valuable to us and to the crown she gave dellar a challenging look he just shrugged and chuckled shes put it in a nutshell lad we need to keep you here for the kings sake and the only way to do that is to assign you to king randale permanently the only way to give you the rank to rate that kind of assignment is for you to be a master bard but theres a problem i can see that sir stef replied regaining his composure its not the way things are supposed to be done theres likely to be some bad feelings that is an understatement one of the others said dryly examining her chording hand with care bards are only human theres more than a few that will want your privates for pulling this plum about half of that lot will be sure you slept your way to it and unless we can do something to head that jealousy off gossip will dog your footsteps and make both your job and your life infinitely harder need i remind you that were dealing with bards here and experts with words before theyre through that risque reputation of yours will be the stuff of tavernsongs and stories from here to hardorn stefen felt his face getting hot thats been the problem lad dellar shrugged and this is where we had to make some compromises so now ill have to give you the bad news youll be assigned as the kings personal bard but it will be on the basic stipend bare expenses just like now no privileges and your quarters will be your old room right here rather than something plusher at the palace well have medren move out so its private but thats the best we can do for you stef nodded and hid his disappointment he was still going to be the youngest master bard in the history of the collegium he still had royal favor and he would be in the court in everyones eye where he had the chance to earn rewards on the side i can understand that sir he said trying to sound as if he was taking all this in stride if it looks like im not getting special treatment if in fact its pretty obvious that the only reason ive been made master is so i can serve the king directly well nobody whos that ambitious is going to envy me a position with no special considerations attached exactly dellar nodded with satisfaction and folded his hands on top of his papers id hoped you would see it that way youll also be working with the healers of course theyre mad to know how it is you do what you do and to see if its possible for them to duplicate it stefen sighed that would mean more time taken out of his day and less that he could spend getting some attention where it could do him some longterm good hed seen randale now and just how ill the king really was he wouldnt last more than a few years at best and then where would stefen be out probably if nobody needs that painkilling gift of mine and having nowhere else to go unless i make myself into a desirable possession yes sir he replied with resignation he did his best to conceal still the healers cant take up all my time what i really need to find out is where the ladies of the court congregate since there isnt any queen the married ones that is the young ones wont have any influence no what i need is a gaggle of bored middleaged women young enough to be flattered old enough not to take it seriously ones i can be a diversion for he realized suddenly that bard dellar was still talking and hed lost the last couple of sentences and what had caught his attention was a name herald vanyel dellar concluded and stef cursed himself for his inattention now he had no idea at all what it was vanyel had said or done or was supposed to do nor what it could possibly have to do with himself well i think that about covers everything lad think youre up to this i hope so sir stefen said fervently very well then report to court about midmorning just as you did yesterday herald vanyel will instruct you when you get there so vanyels to be my keeper hmm stefen bowed to the members of the bardic council and smiled to himself as he left the room well things are beginning to look promising despite the precautions there was still jealousy stef found himself being ignored and even snubbed by several of the full bards mostly those who were passing through haven on the way to somewhere else but it still happened it wasnt the first time hed been snubbed though and it probably wouldnt be the last the bards that stayed any length of time soon noticed that he wasnt getting better treatment than an ordinary journeyman and the ice thawed a little but only a little they were still remote and didnt encourage him to socialize stef was not at all happy about the way they were acting and it didnt help that he had something of a guilty conscience over his rapid advancement making the jump from journeyman to master was much more than a matter of talent no rnatter what the council said it was also a matter of experience experience stef didnt have he wasnt that much different from medren on that score nevertheless here he was jumped over the heads of his yearmates and even those older than he was getting shoved into the midst of the high court the side of him that calculated everything rubbed its hands in glee but the rest of him was having second and third thoughts and serious misgivings the way some of the other full bards were treating him just seemed to be a confirmation of those misgivings and the healers were beginning to get on his nerves they wanted to monopolize every free moment of his time studying him and he had no chance during that first week to make any of the court contacts he had intended to in fact for the first time he was using that gift of his every time he sang and by the end of the day he was exhausted if he wasnt singing for randales benefit he was demonstrating for the healers if hed had any time to think he might well have told them one and all to chuck their master bardship and quit the place but he was so tired at days end that he just fell into bed and slept like a dead thing and telling the council to go take a long hike never occurred to him maddeningly he seldom saw much of vanyel either and every attempt to get the heralds amatory attention fell absolutely flat every time he pressed his attentions the herald seemed to become nervous he could not figure out what the problem was vanyel would start to respond but then would pull back inside himself and a mask would drop down over his face if hed had the energy left hed have strangled something in frustration that was the way matters stood when medren returned from his little expedition stefen stared at himself in the mirror then made a face at himself you he said accusingly pointing a finger at his thin disheveled other self are an idiot ill second that said medren popping up behind him startling stef so much that he yelped and threw himself sideways into the wall while he gasped for breath and tried to get his heart to stop pounding medren thumped his back good gods stef his friend said apologetically what in the seventh hells made you so jumpy no nothing stef managed huh medren replied skeptically probably the same nothing that made you call yourself an idiot so hows it feel to be a master bard when stef didnt immediately answer medren held him at arms length and scrutinized him carefully if it feels like you look i think ill stay a journeyman dont you ever sleep a sly smile crept over medrens face or is somebody keeping you up all night stefen groaned and covered his eyes kernos codpiece dont remind me my bed is as you see it virtuously empty since when have you and virtue been nodding acquaintances medren gibed since just before you left stef replied deciding on impulse to tell his friend the exact truth thats odd medren let go of his shoulders and moved back a step i would have thought that you and uncle van would have hit it off stef bit off a curse since when youve been what do you i set you up medren said casually the opportunity was there and i grabbed it i knew van would try anything to help the king and i know you think he hung the moon i figured neither one of you would be able to resist the other gods know id been trying to get you two in the same place at the same time for over a year so now he paused and frowned so what went wrong i dont know stef groaned and turned away flinging himself down in a chair i cant think anymore ive tried every ploy thats ever worked before and i just cant imagine why they arent succeeding now the healers are working me to death and herald vanyel keeps sidestepping me like a skittish horse id scream if i could find the energy tell the healers to go chase their shadows medren ordered gruffly horseturds stef youre exercising a gift that takes power physical energy and youre using yours up faster than you can replace it no wonder youre tired i am this was news to stefen hed always just assumed using his gift was a lot like breathing you just did it and he said as much medren snorted good gods doesnt anybody in this place think i guess not or the healers wouldnt be stretching you to your limits or else nobodys ever figured the bardic gift was like any other i promise you it is using your gift does take energy and youve been burning yours up too fast if the blasted healers want to study you any more tell them that then tell them that from now on they can just wedge themselves into a corner behind the throne and study you from there idiots honestly stef healers can be so damned focused give them half a chance and theyll kill you trying to figure out how youre put together stefen laughed his sense of humor rapidly being restored thats why i was telling myself i was an idiot i was letting them run me into the ground but i couldnt think of a way to get them to stop they can be damned persuasive you know oh i know medren took the other chair and sprawled in it gracelessly i know heralds are the same way they dont seem to think ordinary folks need something besides work work and more work ive watched uncle van drive himself into the ground a score of times once or twice its been me that had to go pound on him and make him rest and speaking of uncle van that brings me right back to the question i started with what went wrong you still havent really told me anything take it from the beginning stefen gave in and related the whole tale his frustration increasing with every word medren listened carefully his eyes darkening with thought hmm i guess his voice trailed off and stef snapped his fingers to get his attention you guess what i guess hes gotten really shy medren replied with a shrug its the only thing i can think of to explain the way hes acting that and this obsession he has about not letting anyone get close to him because theyll become a target stefen felt a cold finger of fear run suddenly down his back hes not wrong he told his friend solemnly trying not to think of some of the things hed seen as a street beggar how during wars between street gangs or thief cadres it was the lovers and the offspring who became the targets and the victims more often than not and it was pretty evident from the border news that a war between the nations and a war between gangs had that much in common its a lot more effective to strike at an emotional target than a physical one medren shook his head oh come on stef youre in the heart of valdemar whos going to be able to touch you here thats even assuming van is right which im not willing to grant i dont know stefen replied still shivering from that odd touch of fear i just dont know then snap out of this mood of yours medren demanded give over and lets see if we cant think of a way to bring uncle van to bay stefen had to laugh you talk about him as if he was some kind of wild animal medren grinned well this is a hunt isnt it youre either going to have to coax him or ambush him take your pick at that moment one of the legion of healers that had been plaguing stefen appeared like a green bird of illomen in the doorway excuse me bard stefen the bearded swarthy man began but no stef interrupted the healer blinked what i said no i wont excuse you stefen stood and faced the healer with his hands spread look at me i look like a shadow you people have been wearing me to death im tired of it and im not going to do anything more today the healer looked incensed what do you mean by that he snapped bristling what do you mean weve been wearing you to death we havent been i meant just what i said stef said coolly ive been using a gift healer that takes energy and i dont have any left now the healer did look closely at him focusing first on the dark rings under his eyes then looking oddly through him and the mans weathered face reflected alarm great good gods he said softly we never intended probably not but youve been wearing me to a thread stefen sat down again feigning more weariness than he actually felt the guilt on the healers face gave him no end of pleasure in fact he continued drooping a little if you dont let me alone i fear i will have nothing for the king he sighed and rested his head on the back of the chair as if it had grown too heavy to hold up through halfclosed eyes he watched the healer pale and grow agitated we cant i mean king randales needs come first of course the man stammered ill speak to ill see that you arent disturbed any more today bard stefen i dont know stefen said weakly i hope that will be enough but im so tired out of the corner of his eye he saw medren with his fist shoved into his mouth strangling on his own laughter never mind bard the healer said strangling on his own words well do something about all this i and with that he turned and fled medren doubled up in silent laughter and stefen preened feeling enormously pleased with himself i really am tired you know he said with a grin when medren began to wheeze i honestly am lord and lady the journeyman gasped i know but good gods you should go on the stage he clasped the back of his hand to his forehead and swooned theatrically across the back of his chair oh la good sir i do believe i shall fai the pillow caught medren squarely in the face all right stefen thought carefully putting his gittern back in its case ive left you alone except for simple politeness for three days herald vanyel lets see if you respond to being ignored he began tightening the buckles holding the case closed ive never known anyone yet who could deal with that he suppressed a smile as he caught vanyel making his way through the crowd obviously coming in stefs direction looks like you wont be the first to be the exception to the rule bard stefen vanyels voice was very low with a note of hesitancy in it stefen looked up and smiled he didnt have to feign the hint of shyness that crept into the smile vanyel still affected him that way i cant get used to that he confessed surprising himself with the words people calling me bard stefen i mean i keep looking around to see who youre talking to vanyel smiled and stefens throat tightened i know what you mean he said if it hadnt been that i spent the winter with the hawkbrothers and had gotten used to wearing white i would have spent half every morning for the first couple of months trying to figure out whose whites had gotten into my wardrobe do i no i dont think so every time ive tried to touch him hes started to respond then pulled back lets keep things casual and see if that works i sometimes wish id never gotten scarlets stef said instead of trying to touch vanyels hand i never have any time for myself anymore and i dont recognize myself anymore when i look in the mirror i used to know how to have fun vanyel relaxed just the tiniest bit and stefen felt a surge of satisfaction finally finally im reading him right the crowd was almost gone now and stefen wondered fleetingly what business had been transacted this time he wouldnt know unless someone told him you did a good days work bard stefen vanyel said as if reading his mind randi was able to judge three interfamily disputes that have been getting worse for the past year or more ill make you an offer stefen if you promise not to get so intoxicated you cant navigate across the grounds vanyel smiled teasingly well have dinner in my quarters and you can show me those barchords you promised to demonstrate the night you played your fingers to bits i did i dont remember promising that for a moment stefen was startled because he thought he remembered everything about that evening then he suppressed a smile clever herald vanyel a nice innocent excuse and you might even believe it well ill take it i dont make a habit of getting fallingdown drunk herald he replied with a grin to take the sting out of the words and since the food is much better at the palace ill accept that offer you mean youre only interested in the food vanyel laughed i suppose my conversation hasnt much impressed you hes a lot more relaxed i think medrens right im either going to have to coax him or ambush him and in either case im going to have to keep things very casual or ill scare him off again damn stefen stood up and slung his gittern case over one shoulder before replying actually i am much more interested in someone wholl talk to me he said im not exactly the most popular bard in the collegium right now vanyel grimaced because of being advanced so quickly stefen nodded and picked up his music carrier i had only just made journeyman and a lot of bards resent my being jumped up like i was a lot of the apprentices and journeymen do too i cant say as i blame them too much but im getting tired of being treated like a leper he fell into step beside vanyel and the two of them left through the side door at least the councils put it about that the whole promotion was at herald shavris request he continued that makes it a little more palatable at least to some of the older ones and the younger bards cant claim i earned it in bed thats one blessing however small vanyel raised one eyebrow at that last statement but didnt comment i got something of the same treatment though not for too long the herald told him since it was savil that gave me my whites there was an awful lot of suspicion of nepotism or sympathy because of lendel the heralds expression grew remote and saddened for a moment then he shook his head well fortunately heralds being what they are that didnt last too long especially not after savil got herself hurt and i cleaned out that nest of hedgewizards up north i pretty much proved then and there that id earned my whites im afraid i wont be able to do anything that spectacular stef replied lightly its not in the nature of the job for a bard to do anything particularly constructive instead of laughing the herald gave stefen a peculiar sideways look i think you underestimate both yourself and the potential power of your office stefen he said stefen laughed oh come now you dont really expect me to agree with that old cliche that music can change the world do you things usually become cliched precisely because theres a grain of truth in them was the surprising answer and well never mind i expect youre right they had reached the heralds wing that bright woodpaneled extension of the old palace vanyels room was one of the first beyond the double doors that separated the wing from the rest of the palace vanyel held one of the doors open for stef then stepped gracefully around him and got the door to his own room open stefen put his burdens down just inside the door and arched his back in a stretch brightest havens he groaned i feel as stiff as an old bellows i bet i even creak youre too young to creak vanyel chuckled and pulled the bellrope to summon a servant i dont suppose you play hinds and hounds do you stefen widened his eyes and assumed a patently false expression of naivete why no herald vanyel but id love to learn vanyel laughed out loud oh no you dont fool me with that old trick youve probably been playing for years since i could talk stef admitted cant blame me for trying since i might have done the same to you i suppose i cant vanyel gestured at the board set up on the table red or white red stef replied happily and since youre the strategist you can spot me a courser stefen moved his gazehound into what he thought was a secure position and watched with dismay as vanyel captured it with a lowly courser then to add insult to injury the herald maneuvered that same courser into the promotion square and exchanged it for a yearstag damn he exclaimed seeing his pack in imminent danger of being driven off and taking steps to retrench his forces the hind side of hounds and hinds was supposed to be the weaker which was why the better player took it it was usually considered a good game if the play ended in stalemate vanyel beat him about half the time it looked as though this game was going to end in defeat too three moves later and stef surveyed the board in amazement unable to see any way out vanyels herd had trapped his pack and there was no way out i yield he conceded i dont know how you do it you always take the hinds and i can count the number of times ive won on one hand vanyel replaced the carved pieces in their box with thoughtful care i have a distinct advantage he said after a long pause until randi got so sick that shavri was spending all her time keeping him going i helped guard the karsite border i have a lot of experience in taking on situations with unfavorable odds ah stef replied unable to think of anything else to say he watched vanyels hands admiring their strength and grace and tried not to think about how much he wanted those hands to be touching something other than game pieces ever since hed stopped pursuing van and started keeping things strictly on the level of friendship hed found himself spending most evenings with the herald he was learning an enormous amount and not just about hinds and hounds economics politics the things vanyel had experienced over the years it was fascinating if frustrating being so near vanyel and yet not daring to court him overtly or otherwise stef had never dreamed he possessed such patience this was an entirely new experience wanting someone and being unable to gratify that desire it was a nervewracking experience yet it was not completely unpleasant he was coming to know vanyel the real vanyel far better than anyone else except herald savil that was not a suspicion hed had the fact confirmed more than once by letting some tidbit of information slip in conversations with medren and medren would give him a startled look that told stefen that once again hed been told something vanyel had never confided to anyone else he knew van better than hed ever known any lover and for all this knowledge the herald was still a mystery he was no closer to grasping what music vanyel moved to than he had been when this all began which made him think of something else to say after all van he ventured you hated it out there but you sound as if you wish you were back on the border vanyel turned those silver eyes on him and stared at him for a moment i suppose i did he said finally i suppose in a way i do partially because it would mean that randi was in good enough health that shavri could take her own duties up again stef shook his head there was more to it than that it sounded like you wanted to be out there vanyel looked away and put the last of the pieces in their padded niches well its rather hard to explain its miserable out there on the lines youre constantly hungry wet cold afraid in danger but i was doing some good youre doing good here stefen pointed out vanyel shook his head its not the same any reasonably adept diplomat could do what im doing now any combination of heralds could supply the same talents and gifts the only reason its me is randis need and randis whims i keep having the feeling that i could be doing a lot more good if i was elsewhere stefen sprawled back in his chair studying the herald carefully i dont understand it he said at last i dont understand you heralds at all youre constantly putting yourselves in danger and for what for the sake of people who dont even know youre doing it much less that youre doing it for them and who couldnt point you out in a crowd if their lives depended on it why van that earned him another strange stare from the herald one that went on so long that stef began to think hed really said something wrong this time van whats the matter did i vanyel seemed to come out of a kind of trance and blinked at him no its quite all right stef its just this is like an echo from the past i remember having exactly this same conversation with lendel except it was me asking why and him trying to tell me the reasons vanyel looked off at some vague point over stefens head i didnt understand his reasons then and you probably wont understand mine now but ill try to explain it has to do with a duty to myself as much as anything else i have these abilities most other people dont i have a duty to use them because i have a duty to myself to be the kind of person i would want to have as a a friend if i dont use my abilities im not only failing people who depend on me im failing myself am i making sense not really stefen confessed vanyel sighed just say that its a need to help could you not sing and play well i cant not help not anymore anyway and it doesnt matter if anyone knows what im doing or not i know and i know im doing my best and because of what im doing things are better for other people sometimes a great many other people this is loyalty right stefen hazarded only in being loyal to people in general and not any one land i could no more have let those farmers in hardorn be enslaved than i could have our own people vanyel leaned forward earnestly dont you see stef its not that im serving valdemar its that im helping to preserve the kind of people who leave the world better than they found it and trying to stop the ones who take instead of giving you sound like one of those tayledras i am moondance himself has said so more than once their priority is for the land and mine is for the people but thats at least in part because the land is so damaged where they live vanyel smiled a little i wish you could see them stef youd want to write a thousand songs about them if theyre so wonderful why are people afraid of them stefen asked and why arent you and savil vanyel laughed at that let me tell you about the first time i ever worked with moondance the story was almost enough to make stefen forget his frustration six damn medren swore pounding the arm of his chair this is stupid i swear to you my uncle is about to drive me mad the windows to stefens room were open to the summer evening and medren was trying to keep his voice down to prevent everybody in the neighborhood from being privy to their plight stef evidently didnt care who overheard them about to drive you mad stefens voice cracked and medren winced in sympathy stef was pulling at his hair totally unaware that he was doing so and looked about ready to climb the walls he shifted position so often that his chair was doing a little dance around the room a thumblength at a time i know i know its a lot worse for you im just frustrated youre medren paused unable to think of a delicate way to put it im celibate thats what i am stefen growled lurching to his feet and beginning to pace restlessly im worse than celibate im fixated its not just that vanyel isnt cooperating its that i dont want anyone else anymore and the better i know him the worse it gets he stopped dead in his tracks suddenly and stared out the window for a moment im never happier than when im around him i sometimes wonder how long im going to be able to stand this there are times when i cant think of anything but him medren stared at his friend wondering if stefen had really listened to himself just now because what hed just described was the classic reaction of a lifebonded stef and uncle van no not possible not when van has already been lifebonded once or is it is there a rule somewhere that lifebondings can only happen once in a lifetime even if you lose your bondmate a lifebonding would certainly explain a great deal of stefs behavior medren had long ago given up on trying to secondguess his uncle vanyel was far too adept at hiding what he felt even from himself so what have we tried so far medren said aloud stef at least stopped pacing long enough to push his hair out of his eyes and count up all the schemes theyd concocted on his fingers we tried getting him drunk again he didnt cooperate we tried that trip to the hot springs that almost worked except that we got company right when it looked like he was going to break down and do something we tried every variation on my hurting myself and him having to help me and all i got were bruises in some fascinating places stefen gritted his teeth we tried my asking him for a massage for my shoulder muscles he referred me to a healer the only thing we havent tried is catching him asleep and tying him up dont even think about that medren said hastily listen first of all you wont catch him asleep and secondly even if you did you wouldnt want to be standing there if he mistook you for an enemy like the last time he was home when that idiot with the petition tried to tackle him in the bath medren shuddered i know grandfather said he needed to replace the bathhouse but that wasnt the best way to get it torn down he wouldnt hurt me stefen said with absolute certainty dont bet on that medren replied grimly especially if he doesnt know its you ive seen what he can do and you wouldnt want to stand in the way of it if he wants to level something or someone he will and anything in between him and what he wants to flatten is going to wind up just as flat as his target no stef denied vehemently no i swear to you i know it no matter what he wouldnt hurt me medren just shook his head and hoped stef would never have to test that particular faith all right he said after a moments thought what about this vanyel closed his weary eyes for a moment and thought longingly selfishly of rest of peace of a chance to enjoy the bright summer day but there was no peace for valdemar and hence no rest for herald vanyel take a break tonight van yfandes advised him you havent had young stefen over for the past three evenings and i think you can afford to let the seneschal and the lord marshal hash this one out without you at least the news out of karse was something other than a disaster for a change so theres no doubt of it he asked the messenger the karsites have declared the use of magic anathema the dustcovered messenger nodded it was hard to tell much about her other than the fact that she was not a herald road grime had left her pretty much a uniform graybrown from head to toe theres more to it than that mlord she said theyre outlawing everyone even suspected of having magecraft just before i left the first of the lucky ones came straggling across the border i didnt have time to collect much of their tales but theres another messenger coming along behind me wholl have the whole of it lucky ones said the seneschal puzzled lucky for us perhaps but since when has it been lucky for enemy mages to fall into our hands aye it wouldnt seem that way but tis she replied wiping the back of her hand across her forehead and leaving a paler smear through the dirt and sweat the ones we got are the lucky ones theyre the ones that scaped the hunters theyre burning and hanging over there whoever they can catch tis a bit of a holy crusade it seems like some kind of plague all of a sudden half of karse wants to murder the gifted good gods the seneschal ran his hand over his closed eyes it sounds insane how did it start the lord marshall asked bluntly or do you know the messenger nodded lord vanyels turning those demons back on karse ten years ago was the start of it but the real motivator seems to be from the priesthood the priesthood healer liam exclaimed sitting up straight which priesthood sunlord vkanda the messenger replied and theres not enough news yet to tell if its only the one priest or the whole lot of them at that moment a servant appeared with wine the messenger took it and gulped it down gratefully lord marshall reven leaned forward over the table when shed finished his lean face intent his spare body betraying how tense he was what else can you tell us he asked any fragment of information will help the messenger leaned back in her chair quite a bit actually she said im trained by one of your heralds the one that started this crusades a nameless lad of maybe twenty or so calls himself the prophet no one knows much else about him cept that he started on that there was a curse on the land on account of them using mages that was a bit less than a month ago next thing you know the countrysides afire and karses got moren enough troubles to make em pull back every trooper they had on the border that was how matters stood a week ago when i left gods only know whats going on in there now have we heard from any of our operatives in karse itself the seneschal asked vanyel the herald shook his head not yet he was worried for those operatives there were at least three of them one mindspeaking herald among them but his chief reaction was relief i cannot believe that we pulled the last of the mages out less than a year ago there is no one in there now who should be suspected of magery you say this situation is causing some civil disorder archpriest everet had a knack for understatement but he was serious enough his closecropped winterwhite hair was far too short to fidget with so he fingered his earlobe worriedly instead beneath his bland exterior vanyel sensed he was deeply concerned not surprising while it might look as if this was unalloyed good news for valdemar that fact that it was a religious crusade meant the possibility of it spilling over the border there were several houses of the sunlord within the borders of valdemar if they joined their fellows in this holy war against mages not only would the archpriest be responsible for their actions he would be obligated to see to it that they were stopped which is about all hes thinking of he doesnt see how much chaos this could cause the entire country if the followers of the sunlord move against heralds some of us are mages they might also count all gifts as magic and we have the backing of other religious orders if the heralds were attacked those orders might move before the crown and archpriest could what would happen if the acolytes of kernos decided to take matters into their own hands and fight back on the mages behalf after all the order is primarily martial fighting monks and the like and they favor the heralds the situation if it crossed the border could be as damaging to valdemar as to karse the sunlords the karsite official state religion the messenger reminded them if this prophet has the backing of the priesthood then hes got the backing of the crown when i left that was what things looked like but theres a fair number of people with a bit of magery in their blood and aplenty of hedgewizards and herbwitches that do the common folk a fair amount of good not everybody can find a healer when they need one when the big magics are flyin about the lords tend to forget about the little ones that bring the rain and protect the crops so not everybody is taking well to this holy crusade i would suggest a series of personal visits to our own enclaves of the sunlord my lord everet vanyel said mildly i suspect your presence will make cooler heads prevail especially if you point out that this socalled prophet seems to be operating on nothing more than his charisma and his own word that he speaks for the sunlord vkanda everet nodded his mouth tight they owe their establishments to his majestys tolerance he replied i shall be at pains to point that out ill assure him that youre already working on the potential problem vanyel told him glancing at the empty throne barring a miracle randi will never use that seat again i wonder if we should have it taken out its certainly depressing to have it there the seneschal dismissed the messenger who got stiffly to her feet bowed and limped out well seneschal arved said once the door had closed behind her i think we have a situation the lord marshal nodded if it stays within the karse border this situation can only benefit us if vanyel shook his head theres no guarantee of that and what about later yfandes prompted after this crusade is over good point we use magic openly in valdemar sanctioned and supported by the crown van continued if this crusade doesnt burn itself out if in fact it is sanctioned by the karsite crown where does that leave us the deadliest of enemies everet answered grimly it will be worse than before it will become a holy war arved groaned and closed his eyes for a moment youre right he said finally youre absolutely right and if that situation occurs theres nothing we can do to stop it what we need now is information vanyel told them and thats my department ill get on it whatever happens well have a respite from karsite incursions for a couple of weeks while they get their own house in order we should use that respite to our own advantage good arved said shaking back his tawny hair lets take this in manageable chunks herald vanyel you get us that information and find out what the king wants us to do with refugees well see what we can do to use this involuntary truce tomorrow well put together plans to cover all the contingencies we can think of everet ill be making myself conspicuous in the vkanda enclaves the archpriest said rising from his seat youll have to go on without me i think id better leave as soon as i can pack hes going to be out of here within two candlemarks yfandes said he travels light lord everet ill have a document from randale for you before you leave authorizing you to take whatever actions you think necessary with the followers of vkanda vanyel said please dont leave without it everet paused in midturn and halfsmiled thank you herald i would have gone charging off trusting in my office and socalled sanctity forgetting that neither apply to the guard nor some highborn the lord marshal reminded him and unless i miss my guess therell be one or two of those among the sunlords followers gentlemen the archpriest and i will get to our duties and well leave you to work on this in our absence vanyel told them he and everet pushed their chairs aside and left the council chamber going in opposite directions once they reached the door randi first then get in touch with kera he thought then mindsent fandes can you boost me that far knowing shed been watching his surface thoughts if not we can at least reach someone stationed near the border to relay she sounded quite confident and van relaxed a little well have inside information shortly and dont worry about kera thanks to that new web we wove if she was in trouble wed know one of us would anyway thanks love hed reached the door to randales quarters and was such a familiar sight to the guards that one of them had already pushed the door open for him he thanked the man with a nod and slipped inside most of the time randale was cold so the room was as hot as a desert with a fire in the fireplace despite the fact that it was full summer the king lay on a daybed beside the fire bundled up in a blanket shavri on a stool beside him he looked exhausted but the pain lines about his mouth and eyes were mercifully few those eyes were closed but he wasnt sleeping vanyel saw his lids flutter a little the moment before he spoke so he said quietly whats sent you flying out of the council chamber this time good news or bad wish i could tell you vanyel replied dropping down beside the bed and putting one hand on shavris shoulder she brushed her cheek briefly against it but didnt let go of randales hand van touched her dark gypsytumble of curls for a moment then turned his full attention back to the king we just got a messenger from the border and the karsites have just confirmed my belief that theyre all completely mad he outlined the situation as quickly as he could while randale listened with his eyes still closed the king had long ago shaved off his beard saying it no longer hid anything and made him look like the business end of a mop hed grown so thin that was the day hed finally acknowledged his illness and the fact that he was never going to recover from it the day van had been reassigned permanently and indefinitely to the palace all of randale that could be seen under the swathings of blankets were his head and hands both were emaciated and colorless even randales hair was an indeterminate shade of brown herald joshe who was something of an artist had remarked sadly that the king was like an underpainting all bones and shadows but there was nothing wrong with his mind and he demonstrated that hed inherited his grandmothers good sense rethwellan he said after listening to vanyel they have mages in their bloodline if karse starts an antimage campaign theyll be in as much danger as we get arved to draft up some letters to queen lythiaren feeling her out and offering alliance he paused a moment tell him to word those carefully she doesnt entirely trust me right now after that mess with the amarites it wasnt your fault vanyel protested as shavri stroked her lifebondeds forehead randale opened his eyes and smiled slightly i know that but she cant admit it he replied have we got a limited powers declaration around here somewhere youll need one for everet i think so vanyel answered and got to his feet after a moment of checking through the various drawers he found what he was looking for a preinscribed document assigning limited powers of the crown with blanks for the person and the circumstances there was always pen ink and blotter waiting on the desk in another moment vanyel had filled in the appropriate blank spaces good let me see it randale read it carefully as he always did your usual thorough and lawyerlike job van he looked up at vanyel and smiled i hope you brought the pen with you i did vanyel laid the bottom of the document over a book and held both so that randale could initial the appropriate line blowing on the ink to dry it more quickly he took the paper over to the desk and affixed the seal of the monarch what about the mages coming across the border he asked over his shoulder unhindered passage via guarded traderoad into rethwellan randale told him but i dont want to offer them sanctuary this would be a good opportunity for karse to get an agent into valdemar we cant know which are blameless which are hirelings and which are spies send them on unless one of them happens to get chosen not likely vanyel left the paper where it was and returned to randales side how has today been shavris beginning to understand what it is that young bard of yours actually does randale replied shes able to do a bit more for me but yesterday was bad id rather not give audiences today because i dont think i can get past the door right now no strength left vanyel touched his shoulder randale sighed and covered vanyels hand with his own then dont try van said quietly anything more i should do about karse get us inside information then get our herald operatives out of there randale replied then send a few nongifted agents to deliver aid to the rest then insinuate themselves into the trouble and lets get moving on the rethwellan situation by this time the corners of his mouth were tight and pinched and he was very pale vanyel felt a lump rising in his throat randale was proving a better king than anyone had ever expected the weaker he became the more he seemed to rise to the challenge as his body set tighter physical limits on what he could do his mind roved keeping track of all of the tangles inside valdemar and out vanyel swallowed the lump that caught in his throat every time he looked at randale anything else he asked theres a lot of matters pending randale closed his eyes and leaned back into the pillows compromise in the lendori situation by offering them the contract for the guard mules if theyll cede the water rights to balderston their animals are good enough if priced a little high the evendim lot has their own militia feel them out and see if they might be willing to spare us some men tell lord preatur that if he doesnt either take that little mink he calls his daughter and marry her off or send her back home ill find a husband for her shes got half my guard officers at daggers point with each other thats all thats enough vanyel touched one finger to randales hot forehead and exerted his own small healing ability shavri had told him that every tiny bit helped some rest randi ill do my best the king whispered and vanyel took himself out before he started weeping pages and acolytes were flying about everets rooms like leaves in a storm while everet stood in the middle of the chaos and directed it calmly vanyel dodged a running child and handed everet the document everet read it through as carefully as randale had excellent enough authority to cow just about anyone i might need to he intercepted one of the acolytes and directed the young man to pack the document with the rest of his papers thank you herald lets hope i dont need to use it fervently vanyel replied and returned briefly to the council chamber to give the seneschal the rest of king randales orders sunlight on the water blinded him a moment i feel like the fair maid of bredesmere waiting for her lover fandes mindsent vanyel squinted against the light then waved to her she was standing on the field side of the bridge spanning the river separating the palace grounds from companions field well youre all in white he teased as he approached the bridge and theres the river for you to get thrown into just try it my lad she reared a little and danced in place the long grass muffling the sound of her hooves well see who throws who in thank you id rather not he ran the last few steps over the echoing bridge and took her silken head in both his hands youre beautiful today love he said aloud huh she snorted and shook his hands off you say that every day but he could tell by the way she arched her neck that she was pleased thats because you are beautiful every day he replied flatterer she said tossing her silver waterfall of a mane since they werent in combat situations anymore shed told him to let it and her tail grow and both were as long and full as a companions in an illuminated manuscript it isnt flattery when its true he told her honestly i wish i had more time to spend with you her blue eyes darkened with love i do too a plague on reality i just want to be with you not have to work he laughed now youre as lazy as i used to be come along love and lets get ourselves settled so we can make a stab at reaching kera at one time there had been a grove of ancient pine trees near the bridgethe grove that had been destroyed when heraldtrainee tylendel had lost control of his gift in the shock following his twin brothers death there was nothing there now except grass a few seedlings and a couple of trees that had escaped the destruction the dead trees had long since been cut up and used for firewood since that night had been the start of the train of events that led to tylendels suicide it would have been logical for vanyel to shun the spot but logic didnt seem to play a very large part in vanyels life he still found the place peaceful protective and he and yfandes often went there when they needed to work together there was a little hollow in the center of what had been the grove yfandes folded her legs under her and settled down there in the long grass there wasnt so much as a breath of wind to stir the tips of the grass blades vanyel lowered himself down beside her and braced his back against her side the warm afternoon sun flowed over both of them ready he asked when you are she replied he closed his eyes and slid into full rapport with her it was even easier with her than with savil he waited for a moment while they settled around each other then reached for kera she couldnt know when someone was going to try to contact her but kera had to realize that they were going to do so eventually vanyel was counting on that on the receptivity hed worked with kera before this so he knew her well enough to find her immediately if he could reach that far he strained to hear her to sort her out of the distant whispers on the border of karse most of those mindvoices were strident with anger a few were full of panic it was by the lack of both those traits that he identified kera that and the carefully crafted shields about her savils work and beautiful like a faceted crystal he stretchedit was like trying to touch something just barely within his grasp the tips of his fingers brushed the edge of it kera he offered his identification to her shields which parted briefly and silently who came the thought then incredulity vanyel she knew where he was and the kind of strain it was to reach her hard on that incredulity came the information he needed exactly what was going on over in karse everything kara knew about the prophet and that he was indeed backed by the full force of the karsite crown and the priesthood of the sunlord get out of there vanyel urged go over white foal pass if you have to or get out through rethwellan but leave warn the others youre leaving if you can with a companion around you however disguised youre the most likely to be uncovered fear and complete agreement evidently shed had some close calls already go she told him courage layered over the fear ive got my plans i was just waiting for contact he released her and dropped into clamoring darkness when he opened his eyes again the last of a glorious scarlet sunset was fading from the clouds crickets sang in the grass near his knee and he shivered with cold not a physical cold but the cold of depletion yfandes nudged him with her nose i got it all and i passed it on to joshes kimbry and joshe passed it to the seneschal good fandes he coughed leaning on her warm strength thank you i never suspected you had that kind of reach you outdistanced me i did he rubbed his eyes with a knuckle well i dont know what to say i do she replied humor in her mindvoice youre going to have a reactionheadache in a few more breaths i suggest you stop by randales healers on the way to your room ill do that he got to his knees then lurched to his feet she scrambled up next to him glowing in the blue dusk have you forgotten youd invited young stefen to your room tonight oh gods i had he was torn truly torn he was weary but dammit he wanted the bards company he wants yours just as badly yfandes said with no emotional coloring in her mindvoice at all oh fandes hes just infatuated vanyel protested itll wear off if i told him to leave me alone assuming i wanted to which i dont it would just make him that much more determined to throw himself in my way i think its more than infatuation she responded and he thought he caught overtones of approval when she thought about the bard i think he really cares a great deal about you well i care about him which is precisely why im going to keep this relationship within the bounds of friendship vanyel tested his legs and found them capable of taking him back to the palace though the threatened reactionheadache was just beginning to throb in his temples he doesnt need to ruin his life by flinging himself at mehe stroked her neck goodnight sweetling and thank you my privilege and pleasure she said fondly he began the trek back to the palace dusk thickening around him his head throbbing in time with his steps friendship oh certainly havens van he chided himself you know very well that youre just looking for excuses to see more of stef now finally a breeze blew up a stiff one that made the branches bend a little he had warmed up quite a bit just from the long walk but although the cool air felt good against his forehead it made him shiver well theres no harm in it except to me im certainly exercising all my selfcontrol the depth of his attraction to the bard bothered him and not only because he felt the lad was still pursuing him out of heroworship as night fell around him and the lights of the palace began to appear in the windows he realized that over the past few weeks he had become more and more confused about his relationship with stefen stars appeared long before he reached the doors to the palace gardens and he looked up at them wishing he could find an answer in their patterns i dont understand this at all i want to care for him so muchtoo much it feels like im betraying lendels memory he turned away from the night sky and pulled open the door blinking at the light from the lantern set just inside it he entered the hall and closed the door behind him great good gods the boy should be glad im not lendel he thought with a hint of returning humor lendel would have cheerfully tumbled the lad into bed long before this gods i need that headache tea evidently the gods thought otherwise for at that moment a page waiting in the hallway spotted him and ran to meet him herald vanyel the child panted the king wants you jisas done something horrible the child couldnt tell him much just that jisa had come to randales suite with treven and a stranger there had been some shouting and the page had been called in from the hall randale had collapsed onto his couch shavri and jisa were pale as death and shavri had sent the page off in search of vanyel an odd gathering waited for him in randales suite the king and shavri jisa and young treven the seneschal joshe and a stranger in the robes of a priest of astera and a veritable swarm of servants and guards by this time vanyel was ready to hear almost anything a tale of theft murder drunkenness but not what jisa flatly told him with a rebellious lift of her chin married he choked looking from jisa to treven and back again youve gotten married how who in the havens name would dare i did herald vanyel the stranger said not cowed as vanyel would have expected but defiantly as he raised his head the cowl of his robe fell back taking his face out of the shadows it was no one vanyel knew and not a young man middleaged or older that was vans guess old enough not to have been tricked into this i wasnt tricked the priest continued as if he had read vanyels thought i knew who they were they told me no one specifically forbade them to marry and it seemed to me that there was no reason to deny them that status no reason vanyel couldnt get anything else out the vows are completely legal and binding joshe said apologetically the only way they could be broken would be if either of them wanted a divorcement treven put his arm around jisa and the girl took his hand in hers both of them stared at vanyel with rebellion in their eyes rebellion and a little fear randale chose that moment to turn a shade lighter and gasp shavri was at his side in an instant and in the next had him taken out of the room into their private quarters no reason vanyel repeated in disbelief what about trevens duty to valdemar what are we going to do now if the only way out of a problem is an alliancemarriage he addressed the priest but it was treven who replied i thought about that herald vanyel he said i thought about it quite a long time then i did some careful checking and unless you plan to have me turn shaych there isnt anyone who could possibly suit as a marriage candidate not even in karse unless theres some barbarian chieftains daughter up north that nobody knows about of the unwedded most are past childbearing and the rest are infants of the wedded who might possibly lose their husbands in the next five years most are bound with contracts that keep them tied to their spouses land and the rest are the designated regents for their minor children despite his relatively mild tone trevens expression boded no good for anyone who got in his way i didnt see any reason to deny ourselves happiness when we know that were lifebonded happiness shavris voice sounded unusually shrill you talk about happiness here she stood in the doorway clutching a fold of her robe just below her throat youve put my daughter right back in the line of succession you young fool do you have any idea how long and hard i fought to keep her out of that position youve seen what the crown has done to randi both of you treven how can you possibly want that kind of pain for jisa shavri doesnt want the crown so she thinks her daughter shouldnt either yfandes observed your objection is rational but hers is entirely emotional jisa ignored her mothers impassioned speech turning to vanyel and the seneschal if theres pain im prepared to deal with it she said calmly addressing them and not her mother i dont blame mother for not wanting the crown she doesnt want that kind of responsibility she doesnt like being a leader and she isnt any good at it she says that the crown means pain and it does for her but my lords im not mother why should she make my decisions for me the priest nodded a little and shavris face went white mother now jisa turned toward her pleading mother im sorry but were two different people you and i i am a leader i have been all my life youve said so yourself im not afraid of power but i respect it and the responsibility it brings theres another factor here treven will be the king ill be his partner we will be sharing the power the responsibility and yes the pain it will be different for us cant you see that shavri shook her head unable to speak then turned and fled back into the shelter of her room arved was redfaced with anger who gave you the authority to take it upon yourself to decide who and what was a suitable contract he snarled at treven the young man paled but stood his ground two things sir he replied steadily the fact that jisa and i are lifebonded and the fact that a marriage with anyone except my lifebonded would be a marriage in name only and a travesty of holy vows in my opinion put in the priest that would be blasphemy a perversion of a rite meant to sanctify lifebonding is a rare and sacred thing and should be treated with reverence it is one thing to remain unwedded so as to give the appearance of being available provided it is done for the safety of the realm it seems to me however that to force a young person into an entirely unsuitable marriage when he is already lifebonded is well a grave sin arved stared at the priest then looked helplessly at vanyel and threw up his hands its done he said it cant be undone and im not the one to beat a dead dog in hopes of him getting up and running to the hunt joshe just shrugged shavri had fled the room randale had collapsed the seneschal and his herald had abrogated their responsibility it was going to be left to van to make the decision he ground his teeth in frustration but there really was very little choice as the seneschal had pointed out the thing was accomplished and there would be no profit in trying to fight it further done is done he said with resignation ignoring jisas squeal of joy but i hope you realize you two have saddled me with the hard part hard part treven asked yes he replied trying to convince the rest of the world that you havent made a mistake when im not sure of it myself seven i thought youd be pleased jisa said sullenly you know how we feel about each other i thought you would understand vanyel counted to ten and sighted on a point just above jisas head they werent alone the priest was trying to talk shavri around treven hovered right at jisas elbow and there were at least half a dozen servants in the room it wouldnt do to strangle her the only blessing was that arved and joshe were gone which meant two less edgy tempers in a room full of tension whatever gave you the idea that id be pleased he asked and why should i understand because you were willing to defy everything and everyone to have tylendel she replied maddeningly you know what its like to be lifebonded father she continued in mindspeech weve done everything else anyone ever asked of us why should we have to give up each other and why cant you see our side of it he wanted to argue that her case was entirely different that tylendel was only an ordinary heraldmage trainee that neither he nor lendel was the heir to the throne but he couldnt they were young and in love and so it was useless to bring logic into the argument i cant understand why trevens companion didnt stop him he replied irritated by her relative calm father eren not only didnt stop him she helped us shes the one that found father owain for us she couldnt have kept the triumph out of her mindvoice and she didnt even try she what vanyel exclaimed aloud one of the servants picking up the clutter nearly jumped a foot then glared out of the corner of his eye at them bloody eralds he muttered just loud enough for van to hear standin around thinkin at each other still cant get used to it eren helped us jisa persisted ask yfandes i will he told her grimly fandes what do you know about all this everything she replied and you didnt stop them you didnt even tell me he couldnt believe what he was hearing of course we didnt stop them she said sharply we approve you would too if youd take a minute to think with your head and your heart what else would you have jisa will make a fine consort better than anyone else your stuffy council would have picked for treven the boy is entirely right there are no female offspring of a suitable age among any of the neutrals and why should he make an alliancemarriage with someone whos already an ally if youd have him hang about for years without wedding jisa i think youre a fool but randi he began randales case is entirely different for a start there is or was a karsite princess only a year older and the queen of rethwellan is exactly his age before his illness became a problem there was always the potential for an alliancewedding he was too taken aback to reply for a moment and when he finally managed to recover one of the pages appeared at his elbow looking anxious mlord herald the child said nervously mlord the king is doing poorly the healers said to tell you he was in pain and refusing to take anything and that youd know what to do go fetch bard stefen vanyel told the boy instantly if hes not in his own rooms check mine he ignored the raised eyebrows as shavri turned away from the priest and rounded on jisa and treven now see what youve done the distraught heraldhealer began her hair a wild tangle around her face her eyes redrimmed youve made him worse your own father i vanyel put a hand on her arm and restrained her projecting calm at her shavri dearheart in all honesty you cant say that randi goes in cycles you know that and you know he was about due for an attack you cant say thats jisas fault but she brought it on shavri exclaimed she made it worse you dont know that vanyel began when the page reappeared with stefen in tow the bard strolled right up to the tense knot of people ignoring the pages frantic tugs on his sleeve he bowed slightly to treven and took jisas limp hand and kissed it congratulations he said as shavri went rigid and vanyel silently recited every curse he knew i think you did the right thing i know youll be happy he finally responded to the pages efforts and turned toward the door to the private rooms but before he could take more than a step shavri seized him by the elbow to stop him wait she snapped where did you hear this he looked down at her hand still clutching his elbow then up at her face its all over the palace milady herald he replied mildly and looked down at her hand again she let go of him and pulled away and clenched her hands in the folds of her robe then theres no way we can hide this i would say not milady stefen replied by this time tomorrow itll be all over the kingdom he winked at treven as shavri turned back to the priest to vans amazement and anger treven winked back you didnt he mindsent to jisa the anger in his eyes was met by matching anger in hers of course we did the first thing we did was tell the servants and two of the biggest gossips in the court one of whom is stef why he asked anger amplifying his mindvoice so that she flinched why to make your mother a laughingstock no she flared back to keep you and her from finding some way to annul what we did we thought that the more people that knew about it the less youd be able to cover it up the companions spread it about too yfandes said complacently i was told by liams orser just as you found out dear gods he groaned its a conspiracy of fools jisa looked hurt yfandes gave a disgusted mental snort and blocked him out stefen stepped back a pace and straightened his back taking on a dignity far beyond his years you can call it what you like herald vanyel he said stiffly and you can think what you like but a good many people think that these two did exactly the right thing and im one of them and with that he turned on his heel and followed the frantic page to the doorway at the back of the room as the priest nodded in satisfaction and took shavris arm vanyel threw up his hands in a gesture of defeat and left before his tattered temper and dignity could entirely go to shreds as the seneschal had pointed out it was done and couldnt be undone in the week following shavri forgave her daughter jisa reconciled with vanyel but the council was unlikely to accept the situation any time soon as stefen remarked sagely in one of the few moments he had to spare away from randales side theyd gotten used to having a pair of pretty little puppets that danced whenever they pulled the strings but the puppets just came alive and cut the strings and they dont have any control anymore younglings grow up van and when they do it generally annoys somebody do you want a potential king and queen or a couple of rag dolls if you want the king and queen youd better get used to those two thinking for themselves because thats what theyre going to have to do vanyel hadnt expected that much sense out of stefen though why he should have been surprised by it after all their long talks made him wonder how well he was thinking the young bard was showing his mettle in the crisis not only easing randales pain for candlemarks at a time but soothing shavris distress and bringing about her reconciliation with jisa and treven that left van free to deal with council court and outkingdom making decisions in randales name or waiting for one of the kings coherent spells and getting the decrees from him the two of them worked like two halves of a complicated beautifully engineered machine and vanyel wondered daily how he had gotten along without stefens presence and talents before this the bard seemed always to be at the right place at the right time using his gift in exactly the right way but that wasnt all he did he made himself indispensable in a hundred little ways seeing that no one forgot important papers that pages were on hand to fetch and carry and that shavri and randale were never left alone except with each other he had food and drink sent in to council meetings saw to it that ambassadors felt themselves treated as the most important envoys valdemar had ever harbored if it hadnt been for stefen vanyel would never have survived that week as it was by the time the crisis was over both of them looked like identical frayed threads and that was when the second shoe dropped vanyel opened the door to his room and stared in surprise at stefen the bard was draped over his chair head thrown back obviously asleep as vanyel closed the door the slight noise woke stefen who raised his head and rubbed his eyes with one hand van he said his voice thick with fatigue ssorry about this shavri sent me out they got two healers that can painblock now they finally caught the trick of it this morning he shifted around and grimaced as he tried to move his head i couldnt make it back to mroom too damned tired ordered some food for both of us and came here didnt think youd mind do you vanyel threw himself down in the other chair and reached for a piece of cheese suddenly ravenous of course i dont mind he said but why in havens didnt you take the bed if you were so tired stefen frowned at him i put you out of your bed once im not going to do it again theres your mail he pointed to a slim pile of letters weighed down with a useless dressdagger just came as i dozed off pass me some of that cheese would you vanyel passed the plate to him absently and used the paperweight to slit the letters he worked his way down through the pile and then froze as he saw the seal on the last one oh no he moaned oh no i do not need this what stef asked alarmed whats the vanyel held up the letter wordlessly thats the forst reach seal stefen said puzzled then comprehension dawned and his expression changed to a mixture of amusement and sympathy oh that one of your fathers famous missives what is it now sheep your brother or your choice of comrades probably all three vanyel said sourly and opened it might as well get this over with he skimmed through the first paragraph and found nothing out of the ordinary well mekeals doing all right with his warhorse project which means that fathers grousing about it but cant find anything to complain about looks like the famous stud has a few good traitswell hidden i may add the second paragraph was more of the same good gods mekes first just got handfasted whats he trying to do start his own tribe did i send something what about that really awful silver and garnet lovingcup ive seen around stefen had curled up in the chair with his head resting on the arm and his eyes closed savil told me you kept things like that for presents and the worse they are the better your family likes them except for savil my sister and medren the concept of good taste seems to have eluded my family vanyel replied wearily thank you hmm the last of the sheep has succumbed to black fly and father is gloating melenna and good gods what both of stefens eyes flew open and he raised his head staring blindly melenna and jervis are married van sat there with his mouth hanging open the very idea of jervis marrying anyone oh stef said indifferently theres a lot of that going around maybe its catching he put his head back down on the armrest as vanyel shook his head and proceeded to the third and final paragraph heres the usual invitation to visit home which is invariably the prelude to something that kicks me in the van stopped and reread the final sentences and read them a third time they didnt make any more sense than they had before i suppose you know weve heard a lot about you from medren hes told us you have a very special friend a bard stefen was the name he gave us wed really like to meet him son why dont you bring him with you when you visit van stefen waved a hand at him and broke him out of his daze van what is it you look like somebody hit you in the back of the head with a board i feel like that van told him putting the letter down and rubbing the back of his neck i feel just like that there has to be a trick to it trick to what well they want me to bring you with me they want to meet you and knowing my father hes already assumed the worst about our friendship vanyel picked up the letter again but the last paragraph hadnt changed stefen yawned and closed his eyes let him assume he asked for it lets give it to him you mean youd be willing to go with me vanyel was astounded stefen you must be crazed nobody wants to visit my family theyre all insane so you need somebody they can be horrified by so theyll leave you alone stefen was drifting off to sleep and his words started to slur souns like me tme i couldnt vanyel thought but hes worn away to nothing they do have two healers to replace him and those two can train more randi is as much recovered as hes going to get and the karse situation is stable so why not why not savil said and chuckled hes certainly asked for it vanyel had finally prevailed on her to have her favorite chair recovered in a warm gray she looked like the winter queen with her silver hair and her immaculate whites taking her out of the web had done her a world of good there was a great deal more energy in her voice though she still moved as stiffly as ever but savil vanyel protested weakly he thinks stef is my lover he has to savil leveled the kind of look at him that used to wither her apprentices so what if he does he is the one who issued the invitation entirely unprompted call his bluff then confound him tell you what ill come with you kernos horns savil what are you trying to do get me killed vanyel laughed every time you come home with me i wind up earsdeep in trouble i might as well go parade up and down the karsite border in full panoply itd be safer nonsense savil scoffed it was only the once seriously i darent travel by myself anymore and i could certainly use the break they cant afford to let heraldmages retire anymore there arent enough of us true van acknowledged you know this really isnt a bad idea stef is a sack of bones and hair fandes chimed in the healers are threatening mayhem if someone doesnt take him away for a rest savil needs one too and so do you and neither of you will get one unless youre out of reach fandes thinks its a good idea he mused and to tell you the truth mother and father have been fairly civilized to me the last couple of visits maybe this will work give me two days savil said looking eager dont take more than that vanyel told her as he got up and headed for the door why she asked you dont take that long to pack because if you take longer than that he called back over his shoulder my courage will quite melt away and youll have to tie me to yfandes back to make me go through with this two days later they were on the road out of haven with stefen riding between them on a sleek little chestnut palfrey a filly out of stars line vanyels beloved star had lived out her life at haven a pampered favorite whose good sense and sweet nature bred true in all the foals shed thrown star had in fact been jisas first mount and although once hed been chosen van had no more need of a riding horse there had been trusted friends and the occasional lover who did so star and stars offspring had definitely earned their keep one of stars daughters this palfreys dam was now jisas mount vanyel had made a present of this particular filly stars granddaughter melody to stefen stef had reacted with dubious pleasurepleasure because it meant hed be able to accompany van on his daily exercise rides with fandes dubious because he didnt know how to ride van had been surprised until he thought about it then felt like a fool for not thinking stef had seldom had anything to do with a horse as a child he was born into poverty and in the city so there was no reason for him ever to have learned how to ride while van who had been tossed onto a ponys back as soon as he could walk was a member of a privileged minority the landed which meant mounted nobility he didnt often think of himself that way but stefens lack of such a basic to van skill made the herald rethink a number of things in that light and then hed seen to it that stef learned to ride among other things he was actually glad that stefen was still such a tyro it gave him a good excuse to stop fairly early each day savil wasnt up to long rides either but she would never admit it but with poor saddlesore stefen along she could be persuaded to make an early halt long before she ran into trouble herself by the third day of their easy trip stef was looking much more comfortable astride in fact he looked as though he was beginning to enjoy himself taking pleasure in his mount and her paces the chestnut filly was a good match for his dark red hair and the two of them made a very showy pair i imagine theyd attract quite a bit of notice if we werent around yfandes commented echoing his thoughts dont look now beloved but they attract quite a bit when we are around with the late summer sun making a scarlet glory of the chestnuts coat and stefs hair and the two whiteclad heralds on their snowy companions on either side of him stefen looked like a young hero flanked by savants its a good thing he isnt the clotheshorse i was at his age van continued otherwise hed outshine all of us he is rather striking isnt he there was a note of fondness in yfandes thoughts that pleased vanyel she didnt always like his friends it was a relief when she did one thing that helped was that stef shared a habit with jervis the former armsmaster of forst reach he talked directly to yfandes never talked about her in her presence and included her in on conversations as if she could understand themwhich of course she could stefs filly snorted at a butterfly and pranced sideways tossing her mane and tail playfully stefen laughed at her and reined her in gently a few weeks ago he would have clutched at the reins probably frightening her and himself in the bargain there was a patience and a confidence in the way he handled her that spoke to vanyel of more than riding experience hes matured vanyel thought with some surprise hes really grown up a lot in the last few weeks he looks it too which is probably just as well its bad enough that my father is assuming hes my lover if they knew how young he really is my tail would truly be in the fire he squinted ahead trying to make out a distance post or a landmark through the bright sun another week at most even at this easy pace and well be there i wish i knew how much of a strain this was really going to be it could be worse i suppose at least theyre making an effort to be polite the filly fidgeted but stef held her down to a fast walk talking to her with amusement in his voice savil caught vanyels eye and grinned nodding her head toward the young bard a month ago shed have put him on his rump in the dust boys doing all right van i like him her grin got a little wider beats the blazes out of some friends youve had he made a face at her now dont you start ive told you were just friends and thats the way i intend to keep it she just gave him a look out of the corner of her eye that implied she knew better he ignored the look by his reckoning even if his parents were willing to admit that he was shaych that didnt imply they were minded to aid and abet him theyre willing to meet my friends but they wont want to know theyre more than friends ill bet they keep half the hold between my room and stefs he thought wryly little do they know how much im going to appreciate that its been hard enough keeping things cool between us and if theyre going to help thats just fine with me stefen slowed his filly and brought her alongside yfandes if this is the way traveling always is im sorry they jumped me out of journeyman so quickly he said as vanyel smiled i could get to like this awfully fast you should have talked more with medren van told him youre lucky this is a good trip the roads are fine it hasnt rained once and its late summer id say that on the whole the bad days outnumber the good two to one thats what it feels like when youre stuck out on the road anyway yfandes snorted and bobbed her head in agreement stef looked down at her that bad is it milady she whickered and snorted again ill take your word for it both of you that is but this trip has been entirely wonderful i feel like a human being for the first time in weeks he tilted his head sideways and gave vanyel a long appraising look you look a lot better yourself van i feel better he admitted i just hope joshel can hold things together for a few weeks huh savil said entering the conversation if he cant hes not worth his whites thats not fair savil vanyel objected just because joshe isnt a heraldmage thats not it she replied at least thats not all of it you left him a clean slate if he cant deal with it then im sure well hear from someone stefen interrupted firmly i dont think it matters they know where we are if they really need you they can contact you van why not relax stef was right he thought reluctantly he really should relax this was another in a string of absolutely perfect summer days the air was warm and still without being sultry they encountered a number of travelers and all were completely friendly and ordinary farmers traders children on errands not a one had aroused his suspicions or savils birds chirped sleepily as they passed and when the sun grew too oppressive there always seemed to be a pleasant grove of trees or a tiny village inn to rest in for a little maybe thats whats bothering me its too perfect i mistrust perfection i keep waiting for something to go wrong this afternoon was identical to the rest at the moment they were passing through an area completely under cultivation open fields left fallow alternated with land under the plow there were usually sheep or cattle grazing in the former and farmfolk hard at work in the latter the sheep would either ignore their presence or spook skittishly away from the roadthe cattle gathered curiously at the hedgerows to watch them pass insects buzzed on all sides in the fields and the hedges this is the way it should be van thought a little sadly thinking of the burnedover fields and ravaged villages of the south this is how valdemar should be from border to border will i ever see it that way in my lifetime somehow i doubt it dear gods i would give anything if i could ensure that day would come stefen gave the filly her head and she danced away ahead of them her hooves kicking up little puffs of dust vanyel shook his head no use in brooding ill just do what i can when i can and keep stef at arms length until he comes to his senses the bard let his filly stretch into a canter outdistancing both the heralds van chuckled the filly was headstrong but hadnt learned her own limits yet he and savil would catch up to the two of them eventually probably resting in the shade of a tree with any luck this whole trip may end up with stef doing just that learning his limits especially after he meets mother and father chasing me is one thing but trying to do so around them and having to play little politeness games with them he chuckled to himself and yfandes cocked an ear back at him oh stef i think you may have met your match manys the marriage thats been canceled on account of relatives this might be exactly whats needed to make him realize that hes been throwing himself at a legend not a fteshandblood human and when he sees that this human comes with a package of crazed relations i wont seem anywhere near as attractive they rode into forst reach in the late afternoon of the one day that hadnt been completely perfect clouds had begun gathering in late morning and by midafternoon the sky was completely gray and thunder rolled faintly in the far south fanners were working with one eye on the sky and stefens filly fidgeted skittishly her ears flicking back and forth every time a peal of thunder made the air shudder nevertheless there was the usual child out watching the road for them and by the time they came within sight of the buildings of forst reach the multitude had assembled withen ashkevron had given in to fate and begun adding to the building some ten years ago now two new wings spread out from the gray granite hulk sprawling untidily to the east and north and scaffolding on the southern side told van that yet another building spree was about to begin the additions had totally altered the appearance of the place when vanyel was first a herald it had looked foreboding and martial not much altered from the defensive keep it had originally been now it looked rather like an old warhorse retired to pasture surrounded by cattle clambered upon by children and entirely puzzled by the change in its status and it appeared as they drew nearer that the entire population of the manor had assembled to meet them in the open space in front of the main building much to vans amusement stefen looked seriously alarmed at the size of the gathering van that cant be your family can it he asked just before they got in earshot i mean theres hundreds of them vanyel laughed not quite hundreds counting all the cousins and fosterlings probably eighty or ninety by now more servants of course farewells can take all day if you arent careful oh stefen replied weakly and then the waiting throng broke ranks and poured toward them the filly shied away from the unfamiliar scents and sounds but the people pressed closely around her were all well acquainted with the habits of horses the children all scampered neatly out of the way of her dancing hooves and before she could bolt vanyels brother mekeal took her reins just under the bit in a surprisingly gentle fist this one of stars get he asked running a knowing hand over her flank shes lovely van would you consider lending me her to put to one of the palfrey studs one of these days were still keeping up the palfrey and hunter lines yknow ask bard stefen shes his vanyel replied and dismounted taking care to avoid stepping on any children not an easy task they were as careless around adults as they were careful around horses he moved quickly to help savil down before she could admit to needing a hand a service that earned him a quick smile of conspiratorial gratitude stefen dismounted awkwardly in a crowd of chattering children and gawky and admiring adolescents who immediately surrounded him demanding to know if he was a real bard if he knew their cousin medren if he knew any songs about their cousin vanyel and a thousand other questions he looked a little overwhelmed there werent a great many children at court and those that were there were usually kept out of sight except when being employed as pages and the like vanyel debated rescuing him but a moment later found himself otherwise occupied withen bore down on him with treesa in tow plowing his way through the crowd as effortlessly as a draft horse through a herd of ponies he stopped just within arms reach van he said awkwardly son and there he froze unable to force himself to go any further and unwilling to pull away vanyel took pity on him and broke the uncomfortable moment hello father he said clasping withens arms for just long enough to make withen relax without making him flinch gods it is good to see you youre looking indecently well i swear some day im going to open a closet door somewhere and finally find the little wizard youve been keeping to make your elixir of youth withen laughed reddening a little under the flattery in fact he was looking well less like mekeals father than his older brother they both were square and sturdily built much taller than vanyel browneyed brownhaired browncompleted withens hair and beard were about half silvered and hed developed a bit of a paunch those were his only concessions to increasing age withen relaxed further and finally returned the embrace and as usual you look like hell son randales been overusing you again no doubt of it your sister warned us kernes horns cant we ever see you when you havent been overworking its not as bad this time father van protested with a smile my reserves are in fairly good shape its mostly sleep and peace i lack but dont they ever feed you boy withen grumbled ah never mind well get some meat back on those bones wont we treesa vanyel held out his hands to his mother who took both of them treesa had finally accepted the onset of age though not without a struggle she had permitted her hair to resume its natural coloring of silvergilt and had given up trying to hide her agelines under a layer of cosmetics yet it seemed to van that there might have been a little less discontent in her face than there had been the last time he was here he hoped so it surely helped that roshya mekeals wife was accepting her years gracefully and with evident enjoyment whatever stupid things mekeal had done in his time and hed done quite a few including the purchase of a purported shinain warsteed that was no more shinain than vanyel hed more than made up for them by wedding roshya at least that was vans opinion roshya stood right behind treesa a young child clinging to her skirt with grubby hands giving treesa an encouraging wink run along dear roshya said to the child with an affectionate push the child giggled and released her treesa smiled tentatively then with more feeling your fathers right dear she said holding him at arms length and scrutinizing him you do look very tired but you look a great deal better than the last time you were here thats mostly because i am he replied mother you look wonderful well you can see that i brought aunt savil and he hesitated a moment and the friend you wanted to meet my friend and medrens stef he turned and gestured to stefen who extracted himself from the crowd of admiring children and adolescents van steeled himself kept his face set in a carefully controlled and pleasant mask of neutrality then cleared his throat selfconsciously father mother he said gesturing toward stefen this is bard stefen stef my father and mother lord withen lady treesa stef bowed slightly to withen then took treesas hand and kissed it mother surely i heard incorrectly you are herald vanyels younger sister i am certain he said with a sweet smile at which treesa colored and and took her hand away with great reluctance shaking her head his mother no impossible withen looked a little strained and embarrassed but treesa responded to stefs gentle courtly flattery as a flower to the sun are you really a full bard she asked breathless with excitement truly a master unworthy though i am my lady stef replied that is the rank the bardic circle has given me i pray you will permit me to test your hospitality and task your ears by performing for you oh would you treesa said enthralled evidently she had completely forgotten what else stef was supposed to be besides vans friend and a bard withen still looked a little strained but van began to believe that the visit would be less of a disaster than he had feared thunder rumbled near at hand startling all of them gods its about to pour meke radevel you see to the horses withen ordered the rest of you give it a rest youll all get your chances at van and his ffriend later lets all get inside before the storm breaks for true treesa had already taken possession of stefen and was carrying him off chattering brightly van turned protectively toward yfandes remembering that his father never could bring himself to believe she was anything other than a horse but to his immense relief meke was leading stefs filly to the stables but his cousin radevel had looped the two companions reins up over their necks and was standing beside them dont worry van radevel said with a wink jervis taught me remember and then to the two companions if youll follow me ladies one of the new additions to the stables are proper accommodations for companions saw to em mself vanyel relaxed and allowed his father to steer him toward the door to the main part of the manor as lightning flashed directly overhead and the first fat drops of rain began to fall good old rad finally after all these years i get one of my family convinced that fandes isnt a horse eight so thats the situation withen continued staring out the bubbly thick glass of the crudelyglazed window at the storm outside i dont think its going to change any time soon tashir is turning out to be a fine young man and a good ruler his second eldest is fostered here did i mention that thunder vibrated in the rock walls and vanyel shook his head no father you didnt what about farther north though up beyond baires withen sighed dont know son thats still pelagir country full of uncanny creatures and odd folks and without much leadership that ive been able to see its a problem and likely to stay one vanyel held his peace the tayledras werent leaders as his father understood the term anyway although they ruled and protected their lands as effectively as any warlord or landed baron rain lashed the outside of the keep and hissed down the chimney he and his father were ensconced in withens study a room devoted to masculine comforts and entirely offlimits to the females of the household withen turned away from the window and eased himself down into a chair that was old and battered and banished to here where it wouldnt offend treesas sensibilities but like withen it was still serviceable despite being past its prime van was already sitting or rather sprawling across a scratched and battered padded bench one with legs that had been used as teething aids for countless generations of ashkevron hounds so tell me the truth son withen said after a long pause im an old man and i can afford to be blunt how much longer does randale have vanyel sighed and rubbed the back of his neck uneasily i dont know father not even the healers seem to have any idea he hesitated a moment then continued the truth is though i dont think its going to be more than five years or so not unless we find out what it is hes got and find a way to cure it or at least keep it from getting worse right now right now the councils best hope is to be able to keep him going until trevens trained and in whites we think he can hang on that long is it true the boys wedded that young jisa withen looked as if he approved so vanyel nodded good the sooner the boy breeds potential heirs the better off well be shows the lad has more sense than his elders withen snorted his disgust at those elders it was shillyshallying about randales marriages that got us in this pickle in the first place should have told the boy to marry healer shavri in the first damn place and wed have had half a dozen legitimate heirs instead of one girl out of the succession withen went on in the same vein for some time and vanyel did not think it prudent to enlighten him to the realities of the situation about the pelagir lands father he said instead the last few times ive visited home ive heard stories and seen the evidence of things coming over and into valdemar are they still doing that when withen hesitated he began to suspect that something was seriously wrong father are these visitations getting worse what is it that you arent telling me son withen began no father dont think of me as your son im herald vanyel and i need to know the whole truth he sat up from his sprawled position looked his father straight in the eyes withen was the first to look away well yes for a while they were getting worse withen looked at the fire out the window anywhere but at van and and we asked haven for some help for a heraldmage withen coughed and and they said there werent any to spare and they sent us just a plain herald withens mouth worked as if he were tasting something bitter i wont say she was of no use but but we decided if haven wasnt going to help us wed best learn how to help ourselves and we sent her back let her think shed taken care of the problem after a hunt or two had a talk with tashirs people after all theyve been doing without mages for one damned long time found out the ways to take out some of these things without magic worked out some more finally the things stopped coming across altogether i guess they got some way of talking to each other and let it be known that we dont like havin things try and set up housekeeping over here theres been no more sign of anything van was amazed not that there were no signs of further incursions but that the people here had taken on the problem and dealt with it on their own no though weve been keepin the patrols up tashirs people too but but what father vanyel asked gently you can say what you like i wont be offended by the truth its just all our lives weve been told how we can depend on the heraldmages how theyll help us when we need them then when we need them we get told there arent any to spare theyre all down on the karsite border or off somewhere else and here one of our own is a heraldmage it just goes hard withen was obviously distressed and vanyel didnt blame him but father you were sent help you said so yourself they sent you a herald he pointed out a herald within scoffed what goods a plain herald we needed a heraldmage did you give her a chance vanyel asked quietly or did you just assume she couldnt be of any help and lead her around like a child until she was convinced there wasnt any real need for her but she was just a herald father nobody is just a herald vanyel said were taught to make the best of every ability we have heralds and heraldmages the only difference in us is the kinds of abilities we have she would have done exactly as you did she probably would have been able to help you if youd given her the chance she wouldnt have been able to invoke a spell and destroy the creatures for you but its quite probable a heraldmage wouldnt have been able to either i have no doubt she could have found the ones in hiding perhaps or uncovered their weaknesses but you didnt give her a chance to find out what she could do i suppose not withen said after a moment i dont suppose that was very fair to her either vanyel nodded its true father there arent enough heraldmages im afraid to tell you how few of us there are i wish there were more of us but there arent and i hope when you are sent help next time you wont think of that help as just a herald because thats the best help haven can give us withen concluded for him but he didnt look happy and in a way van understood but there was that stigma again just a herald when there were heralds who had twice the abilities of some of the heraldmages hed known it was a disturbing trend and unfortunately one he had no idea how to reverse father which would you rather have in a pinch a herald with a very strong gift a gift thats exactly the kind of thing you need or a heraldmage who may be able to do no more than you could on your own he paused for effect there have been no few heraldmages killed down on the karsite border precisely because they were mages and because of that they tried to handle more than they were capable of if i were spying on the enemy id rather have a strongly mindspeaking herald doing it for me than a heraldmage who has to send up a flare of magefire when he needs to talk if i were hunting up magical creatures id rather have a herald with powerful farsight than a weak heraldmage whod light up like a tasty beacon to those creatures every time he uses his magic i never thought about it that way withen mumbled but still please do think about it father van urged and please talk to others about it valdemar is short of friends and resources these days we have to use everything we can however we can you have a powerful influence on the way people think in this area i wish your brother thought that withen mumbled but he looked pleased if you decide that im right you can make an enormous difference in the way things are handled the next time and that just may save you a great deal including lives withen sighed and finally met his eyes well ill think about it son thats all ill promise which is about as much of a concession as im ever likely to get out of him thank you father he said hoping it would be enough thats all i can ask dinner proved to be entertaining and amazingly relaxing only the immediate family and important household members assembled in the great hall anymore there wasnt room for anyone else vanyel was partnered with the priest who had replaced the late unlamented father leren a young and aggressive cleric with a thousand ideas whose fervor was fortunately tempered with wit and a wry good sense of humor the young man was regrettably charismatic before the meal was over van found hed been lulled into agreeing to broach a half dozen of those ideas to his father treesa had kidnapped stef and enscounced him at her side with herself and withen between the bard and vanyel since that was pretty much as van had expected things would go he ignored stefs mute pleas for help throughout the meal given how much effort hed been going to in order to avoid the less platonic of stefs continued attentions he found it rather amusing to see the bard in the position of pursued immediately following dinner withen claimed his son for another conference this time it included withen radevel mekeal and two cousins vanyel just barely knew that conference left him with a profound admiration for how well the folk in this socalled border backwater were keeping up with important news they knew pretty well how much impact trevens marriage was going to have on situations outkingdom had good guesses about what concessions randale was likely to have to make with rethwellan in order to gain their queens aid and had a fair notion of the amount of help tashir was likely to be able to offer valdemar what they wanted to know was the real state of the situation with karse we heard theyd outlawed magery radevel said putting his feet up on the low table they all shared and there was rumors about fightin inside karse all well an good if its true an whats bad for karse is likely to be good for us twould look like but whats that really gonna do to us that gonna end up spillin across the border you reckon vanyel put his drink down on the table and dipped his finger into a puddle of spilled ale heres the karsite border he said drawing it for them heres rethwellan and heres us now this is what we know so far in a few sentences he was able to sum up his own and randales analysis of the situation and the reasons why the alliance with rethwellan was all the more necessary so we end up takin hind teat if theres trouble out here hmm one of the cousins said cynically around a mouthful of bread and cheese to be brutally frank vanyel felt forced to say unless its a major incursion yes i wish i could tell you differently radevel shrugged philosophically somebodys gotta take second place he pointed out no way around that seems to me weve been doin pretty well for ourselves we got some guard we got our own patrols we got tashir an his people so long as nobody brings up an army we should be all right withen nodded and refilled all their mugs letting the foam run over the tops with casual disregard for the state of the furniture l can do this much for you vanyel told them after a moments thought five sets of eyes fastened on him you know i have limited crown authority i can authorize a general reduction in taxes for landholders who keep their own armed forces and i can get you weapons and i think some trainers weve got some guards that are minus legs or arms that would still make good trainers even if they cant fight all of them brightened at that mekeal looked as if he was counting something up in his head probably wouldbe young heroes yfandes said cynically and hes reckoning how much he can get taken off the taxroles by encouraging young hotheads to take their energy off to the guard probably van replied thinking a little sadly of all the aspiring heroes who had found only early graves on the karsite border and how many more hed send there if indirectly but the fighters had to come from somewhere better that they came as volunteers and welltrained i can probably even authorize tax credit if you send trained fighters for the guard instead of cash or kind at tax time he continued randales pretty loath to hire mercenaries but he wants to avoid conscription and right now the ranks down south are getting thinner than wed like i got another thought mekeal put in give that credit across valdemar an send the greenuns to us for training an seasoning well get em blooded without the kind of loss you get in combat that made him feel less guilty good gods vanyel replied im surrounded by geniuses why didnt we think of that meke shrugged pleased just tryin to help all of us its an excellent solution to getting youngsters used to real combat at relatively low risk fandes observed with approval i like the way your brother thinks so do i dearling he nodded at meke that will help immensely i truly think they discussed other matters for a while but it was fairly evident that theyd touched on all the topics the others considered of the most import vanyel got to his feet and excused himself when the conversation devolved to small talk about hunting ill make an effort to get in touch with herald joshel and get confirmation on everything we covered he told them and grinned seeing a chance to bring a point home thats the advantage of having a strong mindspeaking herald around when you need answers in a hurry joshe is actually a stronger mindspeaker than i am and hes taking my place with randale while im gone i know when hell be free tomorrow and ill contact him then he was surprised at how late it was when he left them the halls were quiet the servants had long since gone to bed leaving every other lamp out and the ones still burning turned down low his room would be the guest room hed used every visit hed made home and he knew exactly where it was despite the additions to the manor and the darkness of the halls he found himself yawning as he neared his door i didnt realize how tired i was he thought sleepily its a good thing i didnt drink that second mug of ale father poured i wonder what room they put stef in i hope it wasnt the one overlooking the gardens ye gods hell be up all night with mockerbirds screaming at his window ill take the old room any time even if it isnt as cool in the summer havens that bed is going to feel good he reached for the door handle and pulled it open just enough to slip inside some kind soul had left two candles burning one above the hearth one beside the bed the gentle candlelight was actually quite bright compared to the darkened hallway shadows danced as the candleflames flickered in the draft he had created by opening the door as he stepped away from the door he glanced automatically toward the right side of the hearth beside the bed the servants always left his luggage there and he wanted to make sure his gittern was all right before he went to bed and he froze for there were two sets of packs and two gitterns his and stefens and he looked beyond the luggage to see if the furnishings had been changed but they hadnt only one bed behind him someone shot the bolt on the door he whirled stefen turned away from the door and faced him the warm gold of candlelight softening his features so that he looked very young indeed his loose shirt was unlaced to the navel and his feet were bare beneath his leather riding breeches before you ask he said in a soft low voice this wasnt my idea this seems to have happened on your fathers orders but van im glad he did it vanyel backed up a step his mind swimming in little circles oh ah stefen ill just get my things and stef shook his head and brushed his long hair back behind his ears with one hand no not until i get a chance to say what i have to youve been avoiding this for weeks and im not letting the one chance ive had to really talk to you get away from me vanyel forced himself to relax forced his mind to stop whirling as best he could and walked over to one of the chairs next to the hearth he stood beside it with his hands resting on the back so that stefen could not see them trembling he glanced down at them they seemed very cold and white and he wondered if stefen had noticed ah what is it you need to talk about that you couldnt have said on the road he asked as casually as he could dammit van stefen exploded you know very well what i want to talk about you and me stefen vanyel said controlling his voice with an effort that hurt you are one of the best friends ive ever had i mean that and i appreciate that friendship stefs eyes were full of pleading and vanyel forced himself to turn away from him and stare at a carved wooden horse on the mantelpiece stef youre very young im nearly twice your age ive seen all this before you admire me a great deal and you think there were no footsteps to warn him suddenly he found stefs hands on his shoulders wrenching him around forcing him to look into the young bards face stef s hands felt like hot irons on his shoulders and there was strength in them that was not apparent from the bards slight build vanyel ashkevron stef said hoarsely i am shaych just like you ive known what i am for years now im not an infatuated child whats more now the bard flushed and looked away off to vanyels right ive had more lovers in one year than youve had in the last ten and and ive never felt about any of them the way i feel about you i i think i love you van i dont think i could ever love anyone but you he looked back up at vanyel the herald could only gaze back into the darkened emerald of stefens eyes eyes that seemed in the dim light to be mostly pupil vanyel was utterly stunned this this was considerably beyond infatuation bards are supposed to be so cursed good with words stefen said unhappily looking into vanyels eyes as if he was looking for answers well all my eloquence seems to have deserted me all all i can tell you is that i think id love you if you were a hundred years older than me or a deformed monster or or even a woman the bards voice had lost any hint of training it was tight and rough with tension and unhappiness for his part vanyel couldnt seem to speak at all his throat was paralyzed and his chest hurt when he tried to breathe he felt alternately hot and cold and his heart pounded in his ears stefen didnt notice his unresponsiveness evidently for he continued on without looking away from van since you arent any of those things he said his voice unsteady with emotion since youre wwonderful and wwise and beautiful enough to make my heart ache and dammit not old i i cant take this much longer a single then proved that the sweet giving and receiving the bard had just taught him was only the beginning overhead sky a dead and lightless black to either side walls of ice he turned to the one standing at his side lendel but it was stefen wrapped in wool and fur and so frightened his face was as icypale as the cliffs to either side of them you have to go get help he told the herald no the bard i wont leave you stef said stubbornly you have to come with me i wont leave without you he shook his head and threw back the sides of his cloak to free his arms yfandes cant carry two he said and i can hold them off for however long it takes you to bring help you cant possibly i can he interrupted look theres only enough room at this point for one person to pass as long as i stand here theyll never get by blink suddenly he was alone and exhausted chilled to the bone an army filled the pass before him and at the forefront of that army a single man who could have been vanyels twin save only that his eyes and hair were deepest black a dark mirror to vanyels silver eyes and silvered hair and as if to carry the parody to its extreme he wore clothing cut identically to heraldic whites only of ebony black i know you he heard himself say the man smiled indeed you you are leareth the word was tayledras for darkness the man smiled a quaint conceit dont you think and vanyel knew he woke shaking like a leaf in a gale his chest heaved as he gasped for breath clutching the blanket he was cold bonecold yet drenched with sweat it was the old dream the icedream the dream where i die i havent had that dream for years stefen lay beside him sprawled over the edge of the bed oblivious to vans panting for air though the candles were out van could see him by moonlight streaming in the window the storm had blown itself out leaving the sky clear and clean the moonlight was bright enough to read by and vanyel saw the bright points of stars glittering against the sky through the windowpane vanyel controlled his breathing and lay back forcing his heart to slow he blinked up into the dark canopy of the bed still caught in the cold claws of the nightmare i havent had that dream for years except this time it was different this time it wasnt lendel that was with me except except it felt like lendel i thought it was lendel until i turned around and it was stef the young bard sighed and turned over bringing his face into the moonlight lying beside stef for a moment for a moment it had been it had felt like being beside tylendel his love and lifebonded lifebonded only then did he realize why stefen felt like tylendel the tie was the same vanyel was not only in love with the bard he had lifebonded to him there was no mistaking that tie especially not for an empath no but there was no denying it either vanyel suppressed a groan if being attracted to stefen had been a betrayal of lendels memory then what was this he couldnt think he felt his stomach knot and a lump in his throat he had loved lendel he still did he thought that he would lie awake until dawn but somehow exhaustion got the better of confused thoughts and tangled emotions and sleep stole over him its about time you got here yfandes said with a knowing look honestly van you make things so complicated for yourself sometimes well come on she turned adroitly and flicked her tail at him looking back at him over her shoulder well arent you coming where am i he asked looking about himself there wasnt anything to be seen in any direction wherever he looked there was nothing but featureless gray fog he and yfandes were all alone in it so far as he could see where are you she repeated her mindvoice warm and amused youre dreaming of course or rather in dreamtime there is a difference now are you coming or not he followed her having nothing better to do the peculiar fog thickened until he could hardly see her he tried to catch up with her but she always managed to stay the same distance ahead of him finally all he could make out of her was a vague glowingwhite shape in the swirling fog a tendril of fog wrapped around his head blinding him completely he faltered tried to bat it away and stumbled into an exact duplicate of the grove in companions field where he and lendel had spent so many hours the same grove that lendel had destroyed well ashke said a heartbreakingly familiar voice behind him you certainly took your time getting here he turned slowly afraid of what he might see especially after what he and stef had done dont be an idiot tylendel said shaking back hair as gold as the summer sun filtering through the pine boughs above him why should i mind tylendel lounged against the rough trunk of a tree with his arms crossed over his chest looking little older than when hed died but dressed in the whites he hadnt yet earned in life he raised one golden eyebrow quizzically at van then grinned why van thats twice in one day youve been moonstruck is this getting to be a habit then softer whats wrong vanyelashke as vanyel stood rooted to the spot tylendel pushed himself away from the tree crossed the few feet between them and took him in his strong warm arms sharp scents rose from the crushed pine needles beneath their feet vanyel returned the embrace hesitantly at first then with a sob that was half relief and half grief held his beloved so tightly his arms hurt here now lendel said holding him gently whats the matter why should i be angry with you because you found someone to love who loves you because because i love you it seemed a foolish fear now vanashke whats the point in suffering all your life for one mistake lendel let go of him and stepped back a little so that he could look down into vanyels eyes you dont give up a chance at happiness just because youve already been happy once in your life havens thats like saying youll never eat again because youve been a guest at one grand feast lendel chuckled warmly as his smile reached and warmed his brown eyes van found himself smiling back i guess that is kind of stupid he replied with a touch of chagrin but i never did think too clearly when my emotions were involved lendels smile faded a little neither of us did he said soberly me especially van you know i didnt love you enough and im sorry vanyel started to protest lendel put one finger on his lips to quiet him this is honesty i didnt love you enough if i had i would have cared more about what was good for you than what i wanted im sorry ashke and i think perhaps ive learned better i hope so because oh van i want to make it up to you more than anything if you can believe in anything please believe that and believe that i love you he bent down and touched his lips to vanyels vanyel woke with a start wrapped in stefens arms for a moment he thought he could still smell the scent of crushed pine needles and feel the breeze on his cheek love you stefen whispered in his ear then subsided into deep breathing that told van he was still really asleep lendel that was lendel what in hell did all that mean van wondered still slightly disoriented what in hell did all that mean he stared wideeyed into the darkness he would have liked to talk to yfandes but a gentle mindtouch showed her to be deep in slumber the next time stef turned over releasing him he eased out of bed far too awake now to fall back asleep the room was chilly the storm had cooled things off in its passing he slipped into a robe and began slowly pacing the floor trying to unravel his dreams and nightmares and making heavy work of it that second thing didnt feel like a dream he thought staring at the floor while he paced that felt real as real as the shadowlover and i know he was real it was lendel it couldnt have been anything i conjured up for myself out of guilt could it ive never done anything like that before this and the old icedream has changed i thought id gotten rid of it thought id purged it away after i faced down krebain why has it come back the square of moonlight crept across the floor and up the all then vanished as the moon set and still vanyel was wide awake and too intent on his own thoughts to feel chilled he kept pacing the floor pausing now and again to look down on stefen the bard slept on his lips curved in a slight smile sprawled over the entire bed after a while as the impact of the two dreams if they were dreams began to wear off that posture of stefs began to amuse him i never would have believed that someone that slight could take up that much room all by himself he thought with a silent chuckle hes like a cat takes up far more space than is even remotely possible under the laws of nature it was nearly dawn the pearly light of earliest morning filled the room making everything softedged and shadowy vanyel continued to stare down at stef not thinking really just waiting for some of his thoughts to sort themselves out and present themselves to him in an orderly fashion stefen stirred a little and opened his eyes he blinked confusedly at van for a moment then seemed to recollect where he was van he asked sleep bluring his voice is something wrong vanyelashke vanyel froze the words the very tone brought back the second dream with the impact of a blow above the heart tylendel leaning up against the shaggy tree trunk a slight smile on his lips his arms crossed over his chest whats wrong vanyelasbke ashke it was the tayledras word for beloved and tylendels special name for him a play on vanyels family name of ashkevron but lendel had been fluent in tayledras savil had insisted that lendel and vanyel both learn the tongue as she had always intended to take them to the pelagir hills territory claimed by her hawkbrother friends as soon as tylendel was ready for fieldwork she didnt even offer the lessoning to donni and mardic her other two pupils stefen on the other hand knew only one word of pidgintayledras shaych the shortened form of shayachern which had become common usage for those whose preferences lay with their own sex he couldnt ever have heard the word hed just used must less know what it meant wild thoughts of hauntings and possessions ran through vanyels mind hed seen so many stranger things as a herald stef vanyel said slowly and carefully what did you just call me vanyelashke stefen repeated bewildered and plainly disturbed by vans careful mask of control why did i say something wrong is there a reason why you called me that just now vanyel didnt move though the hair was rising on the back of his neck first the dreams and now this he extended a careful probe ready at any moment to react if he found anything out of the ordinary sure stef replied blinking at him and rising up onto one elbow ive he blushed a little ive been calling you that to myself for a while comes from your name ashkevron it it seems to suit you you know how a bard likes to play with words it has a nice sound you know the probe met with nothing no resistance no aura of another presence vanyel relaxed and smiled it was nothing after all just an incredible coincidence he wasnt being haunted by the spirit of a longdead lover nor was this love in any danger of being possessed or controlled by the last not that lendel would ever have done that he reminded himself no im just short on sleep and no longer thinking clearly thats all and so used to jumping at shadows that im overreacting to even a perfectly innocent petname did i say something wrong stefen asked again more urgently this time starting to sit up as he pulled tangled hair out of his eyes with both hands if you dont like it if it bothers you no its all right vanyel answered him i was just a little startled thats all ashke is the tayledras word for beloved and i wasnt expecting to hear that from you if youd rather i didnt stef hastened to say when vanyel interrupted him i do like it just i had some odd dreams and coming on top of them it startled me thats all vanyel touched stefens shoulder and the bard flinched havens youre freezing stef exclaimed how long have you been up never mind its probably too long get in here before you catch something horrible and let me warm you up after all he added slyly as van shrugged off his robe and slid into bed beside him whatever you catch ill probably get and you wouldnt want to have the guilt of ruining a bards voice on your conscience would you anything but that van replied vaguely then gasped as stef curled his warm body around vans chilled one oh the bard said archly anything nine after stefen had warmed him and relaxed him among other things they both fell asleep for a second time as the first light of the sun sent strokes of pink and gold across the sky this time vanyel slept deeply and dreamlessly and stefen actually woke before him van awakened to find stef lounging indolently next to him watching him with a proprietary little smile on his face well what are you looking at van asked amused by the bards expression and a copper for your thoughts stefen laughed acres and acres and its all mine he said quoting a tagline of a current joke if you had any idea of the number of times ive daydreamed of being right where i am now youd laugh you think so van smiled and shook his head oh no i promise i wouldnt laugh well maybe you wouldnt stefen searched his face for a moment looking as if he wanted to say something but couldnt make up his mind how to say it vanyel waited patiently for him to find the words van he said finally i have to know are you sorry i mean im just a bard i havent got mindspeech i cant you know mesh with you when we he flushed i mean does that bother you do you miss it i stef vanyel interrupted him gently youre laboring under a misapprehension ive never had a lover who shared his mind with me so i wouldnt know what it was like you havent stefen was flabbergasted but but what about tylendel my gifts were all dormant while he was alive van replied finding it amazingly easy for the first time in yearsto talk about his old love the only bond we had that i could share was the lifebond do you miss that then stef asked shyly as if he was afraid to hear the answer but had to ask the question no vanyel said and smiled broadly and if you look inside yourself for a moment youll know why if i stef youre a trained bard bardic gift is enough like empathy for you to see what i mean van sent a brief pulse of wordless love along the bond and watched stefs face change first surprise then something akin to shock then a delight that resonated back down through the bond they shared i never dreamed stefs voice was hushed i never how why i dont know kechara and i dont care vanyel shook his head all i know is that its happened its real and i know that if we dont get out of bed and put in an appearance were never going to do so before noon im afraid they might break the door down and find us in a very embarrassing position stefen laughed you know youre right we should spare them that at least its only fair vanyel grinned wickedly besides if i know my mother shes dying to carry you off to perform for her and her ladies so come on bard your audience awaits stefen struck a pose and held it until vanyel slid out of bed and flung his clothing at him i warn you youd better hurry the herald advised him or ill send her in to fetch you im hurrying stefen replied pulling on his breeches trust me im hurrying then he stopped with his shirt half on van about your mother is sheah serious vanyel knew exactly what stef was trying to ask and laughed no shes not really chasing you she would probably be horrified if you took her seriously in her way she really loves father i think shes just playing the game stefen heaved an enormous sigh of relief i couldnt tell shes a little heavierhanded at it than the ladies at the court not surprising van replied checking his appearance in the mirror shes playing by rules that are thirty years out of date he straightened his hair a little then turned back to stef who was struggling into his tunic under all the posing she really has a good heart you know she was the one that saw that medren had talent even if she couldnt recognize the gift and saw to it that he got whatever training was available out here not much but it was enough to give him a start he crossed the room to tug stefs tunic down over his head she could have ignored him he was nothing more than the bastard son of one of her maids even if his father is my brother meke she could have dismissed melenna she didnt granted she was holding melenna as a last effort to cure me but still she did her best for both of them and thats a great deal more than many would have done stef solved the problem of his tousled hair by shaking his head vigorously then running his fingers through his mane a couple of times then ill get along fine with her anyone whos done anything for medren gets my nod vanyel chuckled dont misunderstand me treesas far from perfect she can be selfish inconsiderate and completely featherheaded she didnt dismiss melenna but that was at least partly because shed have had to train a new maid and take care of all the things melenna had until the new one was trained and the gods know shes a shrewd one when it comes to her own comforts she knew melenna would be so grateful that shed have devoted service out of the girl for years but for all of that shes good at heart and i love her dearly stef unlocked the door with a sly smile over his shoulder for van you know this business of having a family takes an awful lot of getting used to i have to confess it kind of baffles me vanyel laughed and followed stefen out into the hall stef i hate to tell you this but for all the privileges i grew up with there have been any number of times id have traded places with any orphaned beggarchild on the street my life would have been a great deal simpler stefen grimaced ill keep that in mind true to vanyels prediction treesa descended upon them once they reached the great hall and appropriated stefen to perform for her and her ladies as soon as theyd finished a sketchy breakfast that left vanyel alone which was exactly what he wanted right now he strolled out the side door heading ultimately toward the stables taking care not to take a route that would put him along halls used by anyone except children and servants or once outside under anyones window he wanted some time to think things through and hed had enough of family conferences for a while but there was someone who deserved his attention first fandes he mindsent good morning love good morning sleepy she sent back her mindvoice so full of pleased satisfaction that he chuckled i trust you enjoyed yourself last night you trust correctly he replied just a tiny bit embarrassed good she said its about time i want you to know that i heartily approve of this and i commend the lads patience the only question is now what are you going to do he paused for a moment beside the mews noting absently the chirrs and soft calls of the hooded raptors inside thats something i need to work out love would you be terribly hurt if i borrowed one of the hunters and rode off without you for a little bit i want to be alone to think this through properly he caught a moment of surprise from her and halfsmiled it wasnt often that he was able to catch her offguard anymore i suppose that makes sense she said after a long pause this really affects you a great deal more than me no i wont be hurt just dont make any stupid decisions like trying to get rid of the lad will you you need him and he needs you and you are very very good for each other he laughed aloud one of his worries taken care of he was afraid that while she approved of stef as a friend she might not be as approving of the new relationship i doubt i could remove him now with a prybar love and thank you for understanding she sent him a reply not in words but in emotion love trust and shared happiness then she released the link he managed to reach the stables without being intercepted by anyone though there were a couple of close calls avoided only because he saw meke and his father before they saw him fortunately the stables werent far the double doors were standing wide open to catch every breeze and he walked inside mekeals famous stud still had the best loosebox in the place and the years had not improved the beasts looks or temper it laid its ears back and snapped at him as he passed then cowkicked the side of its stall in frustration when it couldnt reach him the only ones who had ever succeeded in riding the beast were radevel and jervis and it was a fight every step of the way even for them watch it horse he muttered under his breath or ill turn fandes and kellan loose on you again the horse snorted as if it could understand him and backed off into a corner of its box mekes warhorse mares were in this stable along with the foals too young to sell they watched him calmly as he passed them some whickering as they caught his scent and recognized him for a stranger that brought him the attention of one of the stablehands a scruffy young man who came out of a loosebox at the sound of the first mares call grinning when he saw that it was vanyel milord herald he said can i serve ye i just want to borrow a hunter he said fandes is tired and all i want to do is take a ride through wyrfen woods has father got anything that needs exercise oh aye aplenty the stablehand scratched his sandy head for a moment thinking habout blackfoot yonder he pointed about three stalls down at a sturdy bay huntermare with a fine intelligent eye not too many can handle her so she dont ever get all th workin she could use she got a touchy mouth an goes best neckreined an shes a spooker needs someun with light hands an no nonsense reckon ye can still ride abaht anything eh pretty well vanyel replied i gentle all of the foals out of stars line if i have the time i like your watchdogs by the way he waved at the warhorsemares who were still keeping an eye on him theyre very effective they are that the stablehand agreed grinning and showing that he like vanyels old friend tam had lost a few teeth to the hooves of his charges better at night anybody they dunno in here an they be raisin a fuss leave one or two loose and they be out o their boxes heyla he illustrated with his hands and the handle of his rake for a wall got us one thief an three o them uncanny things that way that old stud breeds bettern he shows i should hope vanyel laughed and went to fetch saddle and harness for his assigned mount blackfoot was exactly as predicted very touchy in the mouth and working well under pressure of neckrein and knee vanyel took her back to the stable long enough to switch her bridle for a bitless halter as far as he was concerned with a beast that touchy it was better not to have a bit at all if he had to rein her in he was strong enough to wrestle her head down and no horse out of withens hunterline would ever run when she couldnt see he took one of the back ways into the wood rather than the road through the village right now he didnt feel sociable and the villagers would want him to be herald vanyel demonsbane which was particularly trying so he followed the bridle path out through the orchards which were currently in fruit but nowhere near ripe so there was no one working in them the apple trees were first then nut trees then the hedge that divided the orchards from the wild woods riding a horse was entirely different from riding yfandes the mare required his skill and his attention she tested him to see what she could get away with most of the way to the wood and subsided only when they had passed through a break in the hedge and the bridle path turned into a game trail the silence of the wood seemed to subdue her and she settled down to a walk leaving vanyel free to turn most of his concentration inward wyrfen wood was still avoided by everyone except hunters and woodcutters and those who had to pass it traveled the road running right through the middle of it the place had frightened van half to death the first time hed ridden through it even dormant hed had enough magegift to sense the old magics that had once permeated the place those energies were mostly drained now but there was still enough lingering to make anyone marginally sensitive uneasy animals felt it certainly birds were few and seldom sang and blackfoots ears flickered back and forth constantly betraying her nervousness vanyel had made a fair number of exploratory trips into the wood over the years and he was used to it or at least as used to residual magics as anyone ever got he was aware of the dormant magic but only as a kind of background to everything else and a possible source of energy in an emergency for all that wyrfen wood was an eerie place it was relatively harmless except that it attracted things from outside that were not harmless and gave them an excellent place to hide which brought him right around to one of the very things he needed to think out the mare had slowed to a careful walk picking her way along a game trail that was a bare thread running through the dense undergrowth vanyel let her have her head settled back in the saddle and spoke his thoughts aloud to the silent trees there arent enough heraldmages there wont be enough heraldmages for years even if karse stops being a major threat tomorrow that means the heralds are going to have to start taking the place of heraldmages right blackfoots ears flicked back and she snorted exactly most people including the heralds themselves dont think they can but thats because theyre looking at heralds as if they werewerewhat replacements no substitutes and when you substitute something youre usually replacing something superior with something inferior but you substitute something like the original and heralds arent necessarily like heraldmages at all he thought about that while blackfoot picked her way across a dry creekbed the point is that they arent heraldmages the point is to get heralds to use their gifts the best they possibly can rather than trying to do something they cant im a tactician wheres the tactical advantage in that the game trail widened a little and they broke into a clearing a place where lightning had set fire to a stand of pines last year to create a sizable area of burnoff now the secondary growth had taken over grass stood bellyhigh to the mare lush and tangled with morningtrumpet vines and bright golden sunfaces a pair of deer that had been grazing at the farther end looked up at the noise they made and bounded off into the deeper woods the tactical advantage vanyel told their fleeing backs is that most mages dont have strong gifts in anything other than sensing and manipulating magical energy which means that they wont think of things like that they wont be protected against a farseer spying on their work or a thoughtsenser reading their minds or a fetcher moving something they need for a spell at a critical moment thats it thats it ive got to do something to get the heralds to stop thinking of themselves as secondrate mages and start thinking of themselves as firstrate in the areas of their gifts and we have to start matching the need exactly to the gift and not just throw the first herald who happens to be free at the need it wasnt the entire answer but it was a start it was more than they had now blackfoot had reacted to the lush meadow before her precisely as any horse would have she put her head down and began grazing greedily vanyel was so used to yfandes that the move took him completely by surprise he started to pull her up then thought better of the idea the grass would keep her occupied while he contacted joshe and the residual magics made a good pool of energy to draw on so he wouldnt have to use his own strength right now joshe should be with randale going over what the herald would need to cover at the council meeting this would be an ideal time to contact him he let her graze while he closed his eyes getting used to the sounds around him so that he would be alerted by anything out of the ordinary there werent many a light breeze in the branches high overhead an air current that did not reach the ground a few crickets and a locust singing and the noise of blackfoot tearing at the juicy grass and chewing it once everything was identified he extended his magegift and made careful contact with the trickle of magic directly underneath him a curious touch and one he did not expect but not hostile he identified that much immediately the touch came again he caught it and began laughing at himself caught by my own trap he said aloud and opened his eyes nothing to be seenuntil he invoked magesight there right in front of him hovered a little cloud glowing a happy blue a cloud with eyes a vrondi hello he said to it it blinked and touched him a second time this time he sent back the proper reassurance it replied andwell giggled was the closest he could come to it then it vanished leaving him free to tap the magic current again so far as van knew the heraldmages of valdemar were the only ones to have ever discovered the vrondi their touch was not something that outkingdom mages would recognize and even their appearance only showed that they were air elementals and nothing more air elementals were the ones most commonly used as spies or scouts which would only reinforce the impression he was trying to give and even he who had set the spell in the first place had found that unexpected contact alarming so a strange mage would feel something watching him as soon as he invoked any aspect of magegift or set any spell in motion he wouldnt be able to identify it he wouldnt know why it was watching him and vanyel heartily doubted hed ever be able to catch itvrondi were just too quick and they were incredibly sensitive to hostility van decided he could almost feel sorry for that hypothetical future mage the vrondi would drive him crazy yes he could almost feel pity for someone faced with that situation almost he settled back again blackfoot chewed on happily oblivious to the magics going on around her intent only on stuffing herself with the sweet grass oblivious or ignoring them with an ordinary horse it was often hard to tell which first she gets spooky because she feels magic then she totally ignores it going on above her ears stupid beast but fandes would have been laughing at him by now for forgetting his own protectionspell so van wasnt entirely unhappy that she wasnt with him at the moment he reached carefully for joshe drawing on the little stream of magic hed tapped to boost him all the way to haven vanyel came the reply he caught at the proffered contact and pulled joshe in strengthening joshes faltering touch with his own augmented energies the line between them firmed and stabilized concern overlaid with the beginnings of foreboding vanyel is there anything wrong no he said quickly no just some things came up out here and i need limited crown authority to guarantee the things i promised is randi up to that relief and assent hes been better but hes been worse weve got treven in full training poor lad i dont think he sees jisa until bedtime and hes up at dawn with the rest of us a little more seasoning and hell be sitting in for randale on the council what is it you need vanyel explained as succinctly as he could he sensed joshes excitement over the notion of taking more recruits in lieu of taxes and then sending them to the western border for toughening instead of throwing them straight into combat after training its good van all of it hold up a moment van sensed joshes attention going elsewhere for a moment then the contact strengthened as it came back king randale gives you full permission the official documents will get drafted today or tomorrow and go out by regular courier he also said to tell you he thinks your family is slipping theyre not only degenerating into becoming normal theyre getting sensible he says hes not sure how to take that it sounds to him like the end of the world cant be far away so randi was feeling good enough to make a joke that was an improvement over the state hed been in following jisas revolt tell him it isnt the end of the world its merely the result of my own patient application of a board to their heads for the last several years even they get the hint eventually joshes sending was a simple laugh lve also got some thoughts for you and the rest of the heraldic circle id like you to call a meeting and put this before them if you would i really think its important especially now he explained his own thoughts on the dichotomy perceived and actual between the heralds and heraldmages the problems he could see it causing and his own tentative ideas for a solution to the problems joshe was silent all through his explanation and for a short time afterward finally he answered im surprised you noticed he replied slowly with thoughts just under the surface that vanyel couldnt quite read most of the other heraldmages either dont see it or agree with the common perception that heralds are some kind of lesser version of a heraldmage the bitter taste to his reply told vanyel that this was something joshe himself had encountered and it hadnt gone down well joshe was immensely competent and a match for van in any number of spheres and vanyel didnt blame him for feeling resentment its a problem joshe he said as carefully as he could its part of my peculiar mindset to see problems i think it needs to be dealt with now before it causes serious damage we cant do much about the perceptions of the general populace until we start to fix things in our own house something followed that comment that was like a mental sigh of relief that follows after a fartooheavy burden has been removed van nodded to himself and pursued his advantage youll never have a better time than now the king is a herald the heir is a herald the heraldmage in charge of the karsite border is much more gifted in fetching than magery and knows it and youre sitting in for me savil will be sensible about this you can keep this on the table as long as you need to in order to get the others to see that it is a problem and you can call on the heralds in the circle to submit examples now joshes resolution wavered do you think its that important it seems so trivial with everything else in front of us the karse situation randis health its important he replied grimly and its only going to get more so i think you can make the rest of the circle see that point out the attrition among the heraldmages and then quote what happened out here people are supposed to trust us and how can they if they think of some of us as being better than others good point consider it on the boards vanyel knew that once joshe made up his mind about doing something he pursued it to its end he felt a breath of relief of his own the problem wasnt solved but it would be at least a start was being made then i leave it in your capable and efficient hands wind to thy wings brother and to yours vanyel felt joshe break the contact and dropped his end of it with a sigh blackfoot was still stuffing herself and showed no signs of stopping any time within the decade he hauled her head up she fought him every thumblength of the way and returned to the game trail sullenly and with ill grace i wish i had as clean an answer to what i should do about stef he thought uncomfortably gods theres no denying what i feel about him or the lifebond but if i accept all that and do so publicly it flaunts the fact that im shayachern in the faces of people i have to handle very carefully can i afford that can valdemar or will knowing i have my weaknesses actually put me at an advantage it might i know that an awful lot of people come to me with the idea that im some kind of supernally wise and powerful savant and that i cant possibly be interested in their problems knowing i have problems and weaknesses of my own might make me more accessible but it also puts stef right where i dont want him in a position as an easy target for anyone who cant come directly at me and he doesnt have any way to protect himself from that maybe i ought to give him up i dont know that i can afford a liability like that just make this a wonderful little idyll out here where its safe to do so then send him on his way when we get back to haven ill make him understand somehow maybe we could pretend to quarrel no i cant give him up i cant there has to be another way he was so intent on his own thoughts that he barely noticed when blackfoot left the game trail for the road and turned herself back toward forst reach why is it i can solve the problems of the kingdom but cant keep my own life straight gods i cant even control a stupid horse he let her go for a moment then reined her in to turn her back onto one of the game trails he was still in no mood to face his fellows and intended to return home the way hed left he got her turned though not without a fight she had gotten her fill of picking her way through the brush and let him know about it in no uncertain terms she balked when they reached the break in the blackberry hedges that lined both sides of the road and he finally had to dismount and lead her through that was when the spell of paralysis struck him pinning him and blackfoot where they stood one moment everything was fine the next with no warning at all he was completely unable to move every muscle had locked rigid as wood and beside him blackfoot shivered as the same thing happened to her magic tingled on the surface of his skin and magesight showed him the cocoon of energylines that held him captive it took him completely by surprise but only for half a breath he hadnt spent all those years on the karsite border without learning to react quickly even after being surprised his body was trapped but his mind was still free and he used it he tested the barrier even as he searched for the flare of mageenergy that would betray the location of his enemy as the other mage held the spell against him there and it was someone who was reacting exactly as hed postulated ordinary mages would when faced with a herald armored to the teeth with shieldings to magic but completely open to any of the heraldic gifts van could use his own magic and not the mindmagic of course the stranger was nowhere near vanyels ability and van knew he could break the spell with a simple flexing of his own power if he chose but if he did that the man might get away and van had no intention of letting him do that too many enemies had come back better equipped for second tries at him mages were particularly prone to doing just that even one who was as outranked as this one perhaps especially this one because this was one whose power was stolen siphoned from others with neither knowledge nor consent van saw that the instant before he struck that may have been the others motivation to catch vanyel offguard and steal his power there was no way of knowing until van had him helpless and could question him at length which vanyel thought angrily as he readied his mental energies for a mindtomind blastwould be very shortly now no mage of illintent should have been able to concentrate long enough to set a trap he thought looking down at the trussedup body of his wouldbe captor lying on his side in a bed of dead leaves especially not in my home territory the vrondi should have had him so confused and paranoid that he should have been firing off blasts at nothing at the least he should have been leaking mageenergy sufficiently enough for me to detect him i cant understand why he wasnt or why the vrondi didnt reveal him the man stirred and moaned he was going to have a dreadful headache for the next several days the bolt van leveled him with had been at fullpower just under killing strength van could kill with his mind in fact he had once it was something he never ever wanted to do again it had left him too sick to stand for a month and feeling tainted for a year afterward even though the mage hed destroyed had been a selfcentered powerhungry bastard without a drop of compassion in his body and with no interests outside his own aggrandizement experiencing his death directly mindtomind had been one of the worst things vanyel had ever endured no unless there was no other way he didnt ever want to do that again maybe hes unusually good at concentrating or maybe hes already so paranoid that having the vrondi watching him didnt make things any worse for him the mage at vans feet was ordinary enough he looked no different in fact from any number of petty nobles van had encountered over the years sandy hair and beard medium build a little soft and certainly not much accustomed to exercise or physical labor his nondescript bluegray woolen clothing was that of minor noble quality though cut a little differently from what was currently popular in valdemar and of heavier materials he must have come in over the western border he certainly isnt from around here van waited impatiently for the mage to regain consciousness he wanted to scan his mind and wouldnt be able to do that effectively unless the mage was at least partially awake the best information came when people reacted to questions especially when they had something to hide the mage opened brown eyes that reflected his confusion when he felt he was tied up and realized that he was lying in a pile of last years leaves van moved closer stirring the branches and the mage focused on him immediately with no outward sign whatsoever of recognition but insidethe mans mind was screaming with fear thoughts battered themselves to death against the inside of the mages skull none coherent none lasting more than a breath the only thing they had in common was fear after a few moments of attempting to make sense of what was going on in there vanyel gave up and withdrew the mage was completely insane there was no reason for his action because he wasnt rational he had trapped vanyel because he had detected vans use of magic the way the vrondi had and thought that van was after him but then he thought everyone was after him his life for at least the past month had been spent in constant flight he didnt leak energy because he couldnt he had himself so wrapped up in mageshields that nothing would leak past them and the vrondis constant surveillance was only confirmation of what he already knew that everybody was after him and they were probably so confused by his insanity that they hadnt been able to make up their tiny minds about revealing him vanyel sighed then felt a twinge of guilt and a sudden suspicion that sent him back to the mages mind probing the chaotic memories for confirmation he hoped he wouldnt find but he did and this time he retreated from the chaos still troubled the man had never been more than a hedgewizard but had convinced himself that someone was thwarting him from advancing beyond that status to that end he began stealing power from others specifically those whose gift was even weaker than his but since he really wasnt terribly adept or adroit he failed to clean that power of little bits of personality that came with it for at least the past four years hed been going progressively closer to the edge of insanity hed have gone over eventually of that vanyel had no doubt but he had still been clinging to the last shreds of rational thought when he crossed the border into valdemar and used his powers to search for another victim that had triggered vanyels guardian spell and the vrondi swarmed on him it was at that point that he lost his grip on reality in other words he told the man who stared at him blankly i might well be the one who sent you mad in a roundabout fashion damn he crossed his arms leaned back against the trunk of a tree and thought over what he was going to have to do blackfoot snorted her disgust at being tied to a bush for so long with nothing she wanted to eat within reach when van didnt respond she stamped her hooves impatiently he continued to ignore her and she heaved an enormous sigh and turned as much as her reins would allow to watch a moth fly past i guess im going to have to take you back to forst reach vanyel said reluctantly if i leave you with father tyler he can find a mindhealer to set you straight and powertheft is really more in the provenance of the clergy than it is mine since you didnt actually do any of that inside valdemar i really hate to have to take you there but theres no place else with that he hauled the mage to his feet ignoring the mans struggles hed learned a thing or two on the border and one of those things was the best way to immobilize a prisoner blackfoot snorted with alarm when they approached her but van ignored her alarm as well as he ignored the mans attempts to struggle free at that point vanyel gave the man a taste of his own medicine a touch of the paralysis spell hed set on van with the man completely helpless vanyel was able to haul him bodily to lie facedown over blackfoots saddle like an enormous bag of grain he felt the curious touch of the vrondi attracted by his use of the spell but ignored the creature when he didnt invoke magic again it got bored and vanished he was sweating and annoyed when he finally got the man in place he considered using the spell to keep him quiescent during the walk back but decided against it it would be a waste of energy since the ropes tying feet to hands under blackfoots belly would hold him perfectly well with a glance of annoyance at him and a swat for blackfoot who decided to rebel against this unexpected burden vanyel took the reins and began leading the hunter along the game path heading back to the manor and he couldnt help wondering if every halfmage in the kingdom was going to take it into their heads to go mad the prospect was not an appetizing one ten lamentable said father tyler regarding the trussedup mage who was propped against a corner of the low wall surrounding the fathers stone cottage from the look of things the mage was neither happy nor comfortable not that van was inclined to wish him either of those states father tyler shook his head again his tightlycurled blond hair scarcely moved most regrettable i wouldnt feel too sorry for him father vanyel said sourly rubbing a pulled shoulder the man had somehow gotten heavier when the time came to get him off blackfoots back and van had wrenched his back getting the mage to the ground he brought at least two thirds of this on himself maybe more mages arent supposed to cross into valdemar without registering themselves but i doubt youll find a record of this one be that as it may his problem stems from powertheft hes certainly guilty of that and hes managed to do as much harm to himself as he ever did to his victims just how serious is powertheft the priest asked rubbing his chin a look of intense concentration on his long face i admit the seminary never covered that somewhere between rape and larceny vanyel replied absently wondering if he could get blackfoot back to the stables without running into his relatives power becomes part of a mage it has to if hes going to be able to use it effectively because of that having your power stolen is a little like rape theres a loss of self thats very disturbing on a purely mental level but thats why this fool ran into trouble he wasnt good enough to cleanse the power he stole of all the personality overtones and they became part of him pretty soon he never knew if what he was thinking stemmed from his own personality or what was from outside and he couldnt control what was going on in his dreams and random thought processes anymore he put on tighter and tighter shields to stop the problem which only made it worse the pressure in there must have been intolerable then the vrondi started spying on him and he snapped completely but if he hadnt stolen the power in the first place this never would have happened well it is your job to judge vanyel the priest said with a smile that made it clear he intended no insult but it is part of mine to forgive and mend ill see what can be done for this poor fellow that only succeeded in making van feel guiltier but he smiled back and thanked the priest he thought about warning him that the mage was strong and far from harmless but father tyler was younger than vanyel himself quite as strong as any of the stablehands besides he was the successor to father leren he had been part of the united temples effort at cleansing their own ranks and was probably quite well acquainted with all the faces of treachery hell be all right vanyel told himself as he made his farewell and took blackfoots reins she was quite willing to go in fact she tried her best to drag him to the stable he would have been amused if he hadnt been so preoccupied he held blackfoot to a walk by brute force and turned again to his personal dilemma the problem of stef was no closer to a solution van still couldnt see how he would be able to reconcile all the warring factors in his life what would you do he asked the mare who only strained at the reins on her halter and tried to get him to quicken his pace oh i know what youd do he told her youd eat she ignored him and tugged impatiently as they crossed the threshold of the stable several of the stalls that had been occupied were empty when blackfoot hauled him back to her loosebox so luck was with him it looked like the masculine contingent of forst reach had taken themselves off somewhere en masse and since treesa had stef as a semicaptive provider of entertainment she wouldnt be looking for her son vanyel unsaddled the mare and groomed her evidently she was one of those animals that liked being groomed as she leaned into his brushstrokes and sighed happily behaving as charmingly as if she hadnt spent most of the ride fighting him while he curried her van tried to think of somewhere about the keep he could go to think what he needed was someplace where he could be found if someone really went looking for him but a place no one would go unless they really were looking all over for him then it occurred to him the one side of the manor that hadnt yet been built on was the side with that relatively inaccessible porch it was treeshaded and quite pleasant but since the only entry was through a pantry hardly anyone ever used it it was too open for trysting and too awkward for anything else which meant it should be perfect for his purposes blackfoot whickered entreatingly at him and rattled her grain bucket with her nose you greedy pig im surprised you arent as fat as a pony he exclaimed laughing well you dont fool me i know the rules around here girl and you dont get fed until after evening milking she looked at him sourly and turned her back on him and you dont get to lounge around in your stall either he told her as he swung the door to the paddock open its a beautiful day now get out there and move that plump little rear of yours he swatted her rump she squealed in surprise and bolted out the open door she dug all four feet in and stopped a few lengths into the paddock snorting with indignation but it was too late hed already shut the door he laughed at the glare she gave him before she lifted head and tail and flounced out into the paddock then he turned tail himself and headed back to the keep and a great deal of thinking once hed fetched his instrument from their room stefen expected treesa to lead him straight to the solar that room was normally the ladies sanctum or at least it was for all the ladies he knew but she didnt head in that direction in fact she led him outside and down a path through the gardens the path was very wellused and led through the last of the garden hedges and out into a stand of trees that continued for as far as he could see lady treesa he said politely where in havens are we going didnt van tell you she asked stopping for a moment to look back over her shoulder at him he shook his head and shrugged i am quite entirely in the dark my lady i expected you to take me to your solar oh im sorry she laughed or rather giggled during the summer we dont work in the solar unless there happens to be a lot of weaving to do we come out here to the pear orchard no one is working in it at this time of year and its quite lovely and cool even on the hottest summer days the keep i fear is a bit musty and more than a bit damp who would want to be indoors in fine weather like this no one i suppose stef replied at about that moment the rest of the ladies came into view between the tree trunks they had arranged themselves in a broken circle in the shade and were already at work sure enough they had their embroidery frames their cushions and their plainsewing just as if they were working in the heart of the keep spread out as they were on the grass beneath the trees they made a very pretty picture they came up to the group to a chorus of greetings and lady treesa took her seat she was the only one with a chair an ingenious folding apparatuswhich when stef thought about it really wasnt unreasonable given her age now stefen was the center of attention treesa let her ladies stew for a bit though they surely must have known who he was likely to be after an appropriate span of suspense treesa introduced him as bard stefen vanyels friend and there were knowing looks and one or two pouts of disappointment evidently vans predilections were now an open secret open enough that there were assumptions being made about what being vanyels friend entailed stefen ignored both the looks and the pouts smiled with all the charm he could produce and took the cushion offered him at treesas feet and began tuning his gittern thankful that hed put it in full tune last night and it only required adjusting now the twelvestringed gittern was a lovely instrument but tuning it after travel was a true test of patience now what is your pleasure my lady he asked when he was satisfied with the sound of his instrument for giving you pleasure is all my joy at this moment treesa smiled and waved her hands gracefully at him something fitting the day she said something of love perhaps for one moment stef was startled she cant possibly have meant that the way it sounded she cant possibly be alluding to van and me can she then a second glance at her face told him that she was just playing the game of courtly love shed meant nothing more than to give him the expected opening to flatter her well then flatter her he would would my ladys eyes suit you he asked knowing from vanyel that it was treesas favorite she glowed and tossed her head coyly and he congratulated himself on reading her correctly it would do very nicely she replied settling back into the embrace of her chair not even pretending an interest in her needlework stefen smiled at her only at her as the game demanded and launched into the song by the third song he had grown to like treesa quite a bit and not just because she was so breathlessly flattering to his ego nor because she was vanyels mother as van himself had said she had a very good heart when he paused to rest his fingers she asked him for news of medren and not just out of politeness sake ignoring the sidelong glances of her ladies she asked him several questions about her woodscolt grandson after stefs initial answer of hes fine has he gotten advanced from his journeyman status she asked after several close inquiries to the state of medrens health and progress a question voiced wistfully or so it seemed to stef he paused for a moment to think as the breeze ruffled his hair and sent a breath of cool down the back of his neck not when wed left my lady he replied but i honestly dont think its going to be much longer hes very good my lady and im not saying that just because hes my friend the council of the bardic circle is really waiting for the fuss to die down about my getting jumped to master so quickly before they promote anyone else and if you want to know the truth i think they might have been waiting for me to leave so that no one could accuse me of using my influence to get him his full scarlets bard stefen she said and hesitated looking at him oddly this time he was certain that expression was of hope do you think when he gets it he would be willing to come here for a permanent post she smiled and blushed a little im perfectly willing to trade shamelessly on his family ties if you think hed be willing forst reach would never rate a master bard else stefen pondered his answer for a moment before replying treesa was entirely right forst reach was too small a place to demand the attentions of a master bard certainly there would be no chance for advancement here under normal circumstances but forst reach was also on the border and within reach of the newlycombined kingdoms of baires and lineas which were now ruled by herald tashir remarkable things had happened here in fact the solving of the mystery of who slaughtered tashirs family was the subject of medrens own planned masterwork and it was entirely possible that more remarkable things might occur these were the sort of events that the bardic circle really preferred to have a full bard on hand to record furthermore medren had never shown the kind of ambition stef harbored hed never talked about advancing in court circles or gaining an important patron it might well be that hed be happy here i think it might be worth asking him my lady stefen replied with perfect truth and i know that if he wants it the circle would grant him leave to be here especially if youd agree to share him with tashir id share him with anyone if it meant wed have a bard here treesa exclaimed and tashir is such a dear boy im certain hed work out schedules with me so that we wouldnt both need medren at the same time it shouldnt be that hard even for seasonal celebrations if i scheduled ours a bit early and he scheduled his a bit late her voice trailed off and she tapped her lips with one finger obviously deep in thought stefen held his peace until she spoke again then ill request it formally she said aloud and turned to stef with both hands out in entreaty would you ill speak to him my lady stefen assured her the dazzling smile she bestowed on him showed him something of the beauty she must have had in her prime he bowed slightly to her reinvoking the game before she could get him to promise more than he could deliver he had the distinct feeling that if she exerted herself she could do just that he heard the sound of hooves on dry ground behind him at that moment the steps slow and unhurried he was about to turn to see who was riding out here when lady treesa looked over his shoulder and smiled a second dazzling smile and here is the other reason we meet outofdoors in fine weather when vanyel is at home she said happily especially if we can get van to perform for us or we have some other musician available welcome lady yfandes it would certainly present some difficulties attempting to get you up to the solar would it not stefen turned sure enough it was yfandes who bowed there was no doubt of it to lady treesa and whickered with what sounded like amusement the companion made her stately way to a spot that had evidently been left empty just for her and folded herself down to it that was the only way stefen could think of the movement it was a great deal more graceful than the way a horse would lie down and was strongly reminiscent of a lady slowly taking a seat on the ground while minding all her voluminous skirts lady yfandes is as fond of music as i am treesa told stefen seriously when vanyel finally told me that the thoughtless boy i couldnt see any reason why she shouldnt be able to join us when she wished stefen realized then with a bit of shock that treesa was speaking of yfandes as if she were a ladyguest and doing so completely naturally it seemed she had no problem with accepting yfandes as a person and not a horse which is a little better than i can manage at the moment he thought ruefully i have to keep reminding myself that shes not what she seems and im a bard so i should know better well in that case my ladies all he said with a slight bow to yfandes and another special smile for treesa allow me to take up my gittern and resume amusing you in fact he was greatly enjoying himself the entire little group seemed to be enthralled with having the talents of a full bard at their disposal some of treesas ladies were quite pretty and although stef had no intention of following up on his flirtations when they fluttered coyly at him he preened right back that was an accepted part of the game too best of all none of this was work he used only the barest touch of his gift to enhance his performance hardly enough for him to notice unlike the deeptrance draining effort hed been putting out for the king it was a pity that van had decided to vanish somewhere but stef was getting used to that van broods he thought wryly and i must admit hes had a lot to brood about lately if i know him no matter what we managed to build between us last night hes going to have to agonize over it before he can accept it thank the gods he cant repudiate a lifebond or id probably spend every night were here reconvincing him hes not going to be rid of me of course that could be quite enjoyable but it could also be exhausting he wondered what the companion was making of all this it would certainly help if yfandes was on his side he cast a brief glance at her glowing white against the green of the orchard grass and obviously watching him her head nodding in time to his music there was no doubt that there was a formidable intelligence behind those soft blue eyes maybe the fact that she came out here is a sign that she likes me he thought when he couldnt detect any sign of hostility in her posture or her conduct i hope so it would make my life so much easier shortly after his second rest yfandes got up doing so with a quiet that was positively unnerving nothing that big had a right to move that silently and meandered off by herself stefen took that as a basically good sign if van was having trouble thinking things through fandes was probably going to him and no matter what was wrong stefen was certain that fandes would help her chosen get his head and emotions straightened out just as he was about to begin again stefen spotted someone coming toward the little group on a wagonroad that bisected the grove of trees he was moving slowly and as he neared stef could see why he was carrying two heavy baskets on a pole over his shoulders a farmworker then not someone coming to look for himself or treesa and nothing to concern them he continued to exchange news of the court with treesa while the other ladies leaned closer to listen but there was something about the man that vaguely bothered him though he couldnt put his finger on what it was he watched the stranger draw closer out of the corner of his eye and could not figure out what it was about the man that gave him uneasy feelings certainly none of the others seemed to think there was anything out of the ordinary about him they ignored him as completely as if he didnt exist then i thought treesa said that no one works out here at this time of year so whats he doing out here he took a second longer look at the stranger and realized something else something far more alarming the mans clothing was of high qualityactually better than stefs own bard uniform what is that peasant doing dressed like that the feeling of wrongness suddenly peaked and stefen reacted instinctively flinging himself at treesa and her chair and knocking both to the ground just in time for something small and with a deadly feel to it whizzed over both their heads cutting the air precisely where treesa had been sitting vanyel leaned out over the edge of the balustrade the granite was warm and rough under his hands solid and oddly comforting i want solid things around me he thought slowly so much of my life is in flux so much depends on luck and the things others do id really like to have one point of stability something i could always depend on or someone the balustrade overlooked nothing bushes were planted right up against it with trees beyond them and had been allowed to grow until they blocked whatever view there might have been with trees on all three open sides and the wall of the keep behind him the porch wasnt good for much except the occasional lounger sun beat down on vanyels head warming him even though his whites were reflecting most of the heat away he stood so quietly that the little yellowandblack birds that nested yearround in the branches of the bushes resumed the chatter hed disturbed when he came out onto the porch and actually began flitting to sit on the balustrade beside him brooding again are we he blinked and came out of his nebulous thoughts yfandes was below him barely visible through the thick branches of the bushes a kind of white shape amid the green i suppose you could call it brooding he admitted its about stefen of course she interrupted i thought youd probably had enough time to stew over it and make your insides knot up huh he raised an eyebrow dead in the black am i that predictable on some topics yes and i expect by now youve laid to rest the fact that youre lifebonded and that he really does love you on top of that and that you love him so what is it thats turning you inside out he sighed and looked up at the clouds crossing the cerulean sky danger love to him and to me to me because he can be used as a hostage against me to him because hes going to be in harms way as soon as its obvious were a pairing i dont know that i can afford that kind of liability and i dont know that its right to put him at that kind of risk yfandes withdrew for a moment well as to the first hes assigned to haven and a very valuable commodity even with the healers learning how to duplicate what he does they still have to be in physical touch and their subject responds best if both parties are in a trance try conducting negotiations that way and see how far it gets you he chuckled at the mental image that called to mind so far stefs the only answer to keeping randi on his feet and functioning when hes in pain she continued and as such hell have the best guards in haven and as for your second question stefens a grown man why dont you ask him if hes willing to take the risks that come with being your lover my bet is that hes already thought about them and accepted them as the price he pays for having you he pushed away from the balustrade and folded his arms across his chest do you really think so he asked doubtfully he heard her snort in exasperation below him of course i think so i wouldnt have said it otherwise you know i cant lie mindtomind he felt comforted by her matteroffact attitude and by her solid presence no matter what happened no matter what went wrong in his life fandes was always there for him it made all of this a little easier in a single moment the feeling of comfort vanished to be replaced by one of immediate danger all his internal alarms shrilled and without a second thought he leaped the balustrade and crashed through the intertwined bushes to land in a crouch at yfandes side she felt it too they were so closely linked she couldnt have ignored it in the next second he had vaulted onto her back she evidently had signals of her own for she plunged forward through the undergrowth aimed toward the orchards as soon as he was securely on her back that gave him a direction he clamped his legs around her barrel and twined his fingers in her mane and invoked farsight and magesight together magic strong controlled and near at hand dear gods his mind screamed the pear orchard fandes leaped the hedge surrounding the gardensthey hurtled through her hooves tearing great gouts of turf from the lawns she leaped the second hedge on the other side and flew into the orchard women were screaming at the tops of their lungs and scattering in all directions not with any great success at least not the highborn their heavy skirts encumbered them and they fell as much as they ran the serving maids had already hiked their dresses above their knees and taken to the dubious shelter of tree trunks cushions were tumbled every which way and the air was full of feathers where one or two of them had burst it was obvious whom they were fleeing as a brownclad stranger with his back to vanyel and yfandes raised his hands above his head a mage and his target was equally obvious treesa and stef lay sprawled helplessly just before him and van felt the gathering forces of energy as the mage prepared to strike them where they lay but thats the man i caught yfandes screamed a battlechallenge just before the man let loose a bolt of magefire he halfturned in startlement at the noise and the bolt seared the turf just beyond bard stefen and vanyels mother he was quicker than any mage van had ever encountered in his life at least in combat before vanyel could ready a blast of his own hed let fly with a second just as van realized that he and fandes were completely unshielded vanyel expanded the core of his own energies with a rush outward in a shield to cover the two of them but just a fraction too late yfandes writhed sideways as she tried to evade the bolt but was only partially successful the edge of it hit them both he was protected the shielding had covered that much but yfandes squealed as the bolt clipped her she collapsed going down in midleap falling over onto her side a sudden blank spot in vans mind told him that shed been knocked unconscious fandes he wanted needed to help her but there was no time no time he managed to shove himself clear of her as she fell hit the ground and rolled and came up with magebolts of his own exploding from both hands his hands felt as if hed stuck both of them in a fire but he ignored the pain the stranger dodged the one and his shields absorbed the other he struck back a firebolt vanyel sidestepped his return volley and let fly with a crackle of lightning at the strangers feet as hed hoped the mages combatshields did not extend that far down and vanyels lightning found a target the stranger shrieked and danced madly but would not budge from his position which was far too close to stef and vans mother for safety vanyel sent a sandaar a fireelemental raging straight for the enemys face he flinched but stood his ground and blew the elemental away with a shattering blast of power that gave van enough respite to take the offensive before the other mage had a chance to ready a counterblast van let fly three levinbolts in succession and succeeded in driving him back one step for each bolt when van saw that the ploy was working that the mage was being driven away from the bard and treesa he reached for energy in a frenzy and sent bolt after bolt crashing against the enemys shields though nothing penetrated the force of impact was enough to continue to drive him backward deeper into the orchard van continued to fire off levinbolts as his own body shook with the strain of producing them out of raw magic and his magesenses burned with the backlash of power his whole world narrowed to the flow of energy the target and a vague awareness of where treesa and stefen lay finally the enemy mage came exactly opposite the two lying on the ground he didnt seem aware of them certainly van was keeping him occupied in defending himself a few more steps and van would be able to include them in his own shielding treesa chose that moment to struggle erect though stefen was trying to keep her down and protected with his own body her movement caught the mages attention he looked directly into vanyels eyes and smiled and reaching down into a pocket at the side of his boot cast not a weapon of magic or force but one of material steel following that with a levinbolt of his own but not at vanyel at his mother no vanyel screamed and threw himself between treesa and the oncoming blade and felt the impact in his shoulder as he crashed into his mother sending them both to the ground and then a shock that twisted the world out of all recognition in a heartbeat picked him up by the scruff of the neck shook him like a dog shakes a rag and flung him into the darkness stef was trying to get treesa down on the ground again when another of those blinding flashes of light went off practically in the bards face he cried out in pain as it burned his eyes cried out again as two bodies crashed into his cant see cant breathe got to get out he struggled to get out from underneath them his eyes streaming tears with everything around him blurred he tried to make his eyes work the only person still standing was the brown blot that was the mage that had attacked them it raised two indistinct arms and stef struggled harder still to get free knowing that there was nothing to stop him this time that somehow hed gotten rid of van hey a hoarse yell the mage started and turned just as stefs eyes refocused the mages mouth opened in shock and he tried to redirect the power he had been about to cast at his three victims too late radevel was already on him he swung his weighted practice blade down on the mages head as he tried to fend off the blow or possibly hit radevel with the magebolt meant for the others it didnt matter the bluntedged metal sword snapped both his arms like dry sticks and continued with momentum unchecked when the blade connected it hit with a sound unlike anything stef had ever heard before the dull thud of impact with a peculiar undertone of something wet breaking like rad had just smashed a piece of unfired pottery the mage collapsed and stef swallowed hard as his gorge rose and he fought down the urge to vomit hed seen any number of people dead before this of cold hunger disease or selfindulgence but hed never seen anyone killed before it wasnt anything like that in songs he was having trouble thinking vaguely he knew he should be looking for vanyel but he couldnt seem to get started finally he noticed that van was one of the two people collapsed on top of him van hes not moving yfandes struggled to her feet and shook her head violently then looked around for vanyel she spotted him and the downed mage pounded over and shouldered radevel out of the way with a shriek of rage and began trampling the body with all four hooves ii he wasnt dead when he hit the ground he is now radevel stuck the blunt sword into his belt and turned half a dozen whitefaced young men and boys walked slowly toward him from behind the trees the sound of retching told stef that there were probably more of them out there who werent in any shape to walk yet i hope you were paying attention radevel said matteroffactly if you get the value of surprise on a mage about to spellcast thats the best way to take him get his attention and interrupt his magic then rush him before he has a chance to redirect it go for his arms first most of em seem to have to wave their arms around to get a spell off if you can you want to keep em alive for questioning he glanced back over his shoulder at yfandes who was still squealing with rage and doing her best to pound what was left of the mage into the dirt of course he continued when family or heralds are involved that usually isnt practical his expression didnt change nor did the tone of his voice but stef noticed with an odd corner of his mind that seemed to be taking notes on everything that radevels eyes widened when hed looked back at yfandes and he was retreating from her a slow casual step at a time servants had materialized as soon as the mage was down and pulled stef out from under the herald and his mother they ignored stef concentrating on trying to revive lady treesa and vanyel radevel gathered his group of students and plowed his way through them to get to his aunt and cousins side what happened one of the ladies grabbed radevels arm as he passed where did this man come from van brought him in radevel said shortly prying her hand off his arm bastard jumped him and van thought he was crazy left im with father tyler must notve been as crazy as van thought first chance he got once tyler left him alone he cut himself loose and stabbed the priest me i was on the way to practice with this lot and i found him good thing too hedve bled to death if i hadnt found him when i did anyway just about then i saw van pelting off this way and i followed radevel shook the lady off before she could ask him anything more and knelt down beside stef stefen didnt know what to do van was as white as snow and about as cold and treesa wasnt much better off he watched the servants trying to bring them around and felt as helpless and useless as a dayold chick radevel looked at the haft of the tiny knife in vans shoulder but didnt touch it laid his hand to the side of treesas face somethings wrong here he said to stef this isnt natural we need an expert you he reached out and grabbed one of the older servantwomen you keep anybody from muckin with em and dont nobody touch that knife ill get the healer ill get savil stef offered glad to find something he could do getting unsteadily to his feet he set off at a dead run before anyone could stop him ignoring the way his eyes kept blurring and clearing and the dizziness that made him stumble his breath burned in his throat and his sides ached by the time he was halfway across the garden there seemed to be something wrong he shouldnt have been that winded it felt like something was draining him savil was already on the way he was practically bowled over by kellan in the entrance to the gardens her companion stopped short of trampling him and he scrambled out of the way just barely avoiding her hooves what happened savil asked reaching down to grab his arm missing and seizing his collar instead a mage stef panted holding his side he attacked me and treesa no thats not right he attacked treesa and i was just in the way van took him out but he got van gods van is hurt and and we cant get him or treesa to wake up enough thats all i need to know for now she turned away dismissing him and kellan launched herself across the garden leaving him to make his own way back he arrived winded and unable to speak savil was kneeling beside the healer and examining vanyels shoulder ive been treating them for poison the healer said in a flat voice i thought lady treesa might have gotten nicked by one of those knives but they arent responding and i dont know why its because youre not fighting poison lad youre fighting magic savil muttered as stef limped up and collapsed on the ground beside her with a sob its a good thing you didnt try to pull that knife youd have killed him she looked up in stefs direction but more through him than at him we cant do anything for them here she said after a moment lets get them back to their beds i hate to admit this to you but im out of my depth van could probably handle this but well thats rather out of the question at the moment stef clutched his side and stifled a moan of panic and she glanced sharply at him dont give up yet lad she said quietly im out of my depth but im not ready to call it finished stef clenched his jaw and nodded trying to look as if he believed her while van lay as pale as a corpse on the ground beside her savil completed a more thorough examination than she was able to give in the orchard and sat back in her chair watching van and thinking he wasnt prepared for a magic weapon so he wasnt shielded against it but somethings got the thing slowed down considerably damned if i know what huh a leechblade thats something ive only read about i didnt know there was anyone that was enough of a magesmith to make one anymore she glanced over at stefen who was recovering from magicinduced shock adequately on his own savil hadnt done anything to help him mostly because she reckoned that the lad could do with a little toughening but he hadnt recovered as quickly nor as completely as shed expected and savil didnt know why that was happening either he sat on the other side of the bed holding vanyels hand in a pose that reminded her poignantly of the way van had held lendels when her trainee was coming out of the trauma his twins death had induced there was something else there that was poignantly like van and her protege when it finally occurred to her it was such an astonishing thought that she doublechecked with her companion to make sure she wasnt imagining things kell would you check with yfandes and ask her if that boys gone and lifebonded to van if hes a moment of surprise she says he has damn would that be why the leechblade isnt draining van as fast as i thought it would its a good guess a pause she says probably something as deep as a lifebond is hard to monitor she says van is being fed from somewhere besides her anyway sunsingers glory she invoked magesight and stared at the evil thing its working its way deeper but slowly enough that i can take my time hes got a couple of days before itll do any lasting harm stef said it was thrown at treesa i wonder what it was supposed to do to her take her over maybe well never know now so i may be out of my depth and van may be out of reach but i havent exhausted the quiver yet the only problem is that all the others that can handle this kind of weaponry are tayledras and i certainly cant take van through a gate in his condition it would kill him well that just means theyre going to have to come to him if i have to truss them up and drag them she heaved herself out of her chair and saw stefs eyes flick briefly to her before returning to vanyel stefen she said i want you to stay with him dont let anyone move him and especially dont let anyone touch that blade ill be back shortly where are you going he asked his head jerking up his expression panicked to get help she replied just remember what i told you and do it and before he could get himself organized enough to stop her she limped out of the room and ducked down a side stair only an ashkevron would know about iii bring them all right she thought grimly as she made her way down the twisting little staircase entirely by feel whether they like it or not eleven savil emerged from a linen closet on the ground floor a legacy of her fathers legendary building spree at the far end of this hallway was the old family chapel whose door savil intended to use as a gateterminus it had been used that way a number of times in the past and the borderstones remembered those configurations it was easier and took far less energy to build a gate where one had been built before and it was safer to anchor one end of a gate on holy ground there was less likelihood that something would come along and take control of it away from you weve shielded this chapel to a fairtheewell savil thought surveying the door for a moment it was wellshielded before but its a magical fortress now thats good less chance that the gateenergy is going to get out and turn poor van inside out its been twenty years and his channels are still sensitive to gateenergy id rather not take a chance on making his condition any worse right now a few months ago she wouldnt have been able to do this because she wouldnt have had the strength to spare but when van had changed the webspell hed freed her and the other guardians from the constant drain on their resources required by the web now she had energy for just about any contingency for the first time in years that freedom couldnt have come at a better time she braced herself and invoked the four sides of the gate right side and left threshold and lintel when she had the frame built on the actual doorjambs and the sides bottom and top of the door were all glowing a luminous white she invoked the second half of the spell she fought a wave of weakness back for a moment then sent the energy of the gate out in little seeking threads looking for the place she showed them where they would build the second terminus it was easier this time than the last gate shed built to the pelagirs because she knew now where the ktreva had relocated their vale the last time theyd moved and knew also where they built their own gates inside the vale easier in terms of time it was never easy to build a gate and the energy all had to be drawn from the mage himself no outside sources could be used as always it felt as if bits of herself were spinning off and leaving her as if she was trying to fetch something that was just barely beyond her strength it was hard to think as if someone was actively preventing her mind from working but there were no more than a few heartbeats between the moment she began the search and the moment she made contact with the other terminus there was a flare of light and the chapel door no longer opened on a prosaic little family shrine but on a riot of green leaves and twisted rock with a hot spring bubbling off to the right ktreva vale she stumbled across the threshold and into a circle of unblinking and hostile guards a halfdozen goldenskinned blueeyed warriors stared at her over the crystalline points of spear or arrowheads though not mages themselves these guards knew the tiniest signs of the gate being activated and were prepared to handle anything or anyone coming through this was the first time savil had actually seen the gateguards at their posts though she had met several of them during her visits to moondance and starwind whenever one of the ktreva mages needed to use the gate the guards generally cleared discreetly out of the way they stared at savil for a very long moment and she was altogether glad that she hadnt come with the intention of trying to cause trouble because they looked more than capable of handling it their nononsense attitude extended to their appearance most wore their hair shorter than was usual for tayledras barely past shoulderlength and since it was summer the normal silverwhite had been dyed in mottled browns and dull yellowgreens their elaborate clothing was also dyed that way in a tree or hiding in underbrush they would be very hard to see some few of them had the magegift but none were primarily mages these were members of the tayledras clan who whether or not they had the magegift preferred not to use what gift they had they served the clan in other ways as healers and craftsmen as scouts and borderguards and as guards of the few places within the ktreva shield that needed both tangible and intangible guards after all they didnt have to be sensitive to know when the gate had been activated the effect was fairly obvious most of them were young the lifeexpectancy of a tayledras scout was about that of a fieldherald and for many of the same reasons savil exclaimed one of them as savil fought off her weakness and looked up the circle of suspicious and hostile expressions changed in an instant someone knew her and recognized her the weapons were lowered or set aside entirely and two came to her aid as she swayed with fatigue and dropped to her knees on the bare stone in front of the gate itself wingsister exclaimed the same one a lean sharpfaced young woman savil knew as firesong whose spear clattered onto the smooth bare stone as she tossed it aside she helped savil to her feet and before the heraldmage could even voice her need snapped out a series of commands windblade get tea and honey hawkflight find brightstar he should be with his weaponsteachers dreamseeker find starwind and moondance suncloud get me three more guards move on it the four so designated handed their weapons to comrades and sprinted off firesong helped savil over to a seat on a magically smoothed boulder supporting the heraldmage with one arm around her shoulders how long can you hold the gate firesong asked as soon as savil was settled as long as i have to savil replied dryly dont worry the other terminus is secure i wouldnt put ktreva into any danger i could avoid good firesong looked as if she might have said more but the youngster sent off for tea returned as did the boy sent to fetch replacements the guardswoman then had her attention fully claimed by the newcomers like every set gateterminus savil had ever seen constructed by tayledras this one was built around a cavemouth unlike the last one which she had helped shape it was a very shallow cave this time it went into the solid rock of the cliffface scarcely more than two horselengths the entrance had been cleared of dirt down to the bare rock and ringed with boulders it wasnt wise to allow anything to grow too near a place used often as a gateterminus strange things happened to the plants in spite of her claim to be able to hold the gate savil was coming to the end of her strength she huddled with her hands cupped around the hot cup of tea and shivered theyd better come soon she thought or im going to lose this thing we could call it up again but that would take time a good day before id be fit to try we have time but i dont think we have that much but as if they heard her thoughts starwind and moondance finally made their entrance dramatically as always bondbirds on their shoulders savil looked up from her tea sensing them more than hearing themand there they were they were mages adepts in fact so their hair was its normal silverwhite elaborately braided and beaded and flowing down past their waists and being adepts they tended to a sense of the flamboyant that showed in their fantastically designed green tunics savil smiled weakly at them they wasted no time in formal greetings on seeing the depleted state she was in they moved as one to augment her own failing energy she sighed as they each caught up one of her hands and she felt their energy flowing into her strong and pure with one sitting on either side of her feeding her power to replace what she had lost she felt able to talk to them it had been a while since she was last at ktreva but the years hadnt made much change in either of her friends it was impossible to tell that starwind was savils age and moondance only a little older than vanyel adepts were longlived normally nodemagic tended to preserve them tayledras adepts were even more longlived for they lived amid a constant flow of nodederived magic magic that touched even the nongifted whether born or raised among them bleaching their hair and eyes to silver and blue in a matter of two years that bleaching effect was even more pronounced and took less time for the mages a sign that working with nodemagic changed them in deeper ways the drawback was that when they did near the end of their allotted span and not even an adept could know when that would be they would fail and die within a matter of weeks as the magic burned them up from within savil knew all that but growled you two have little simulacrums locked away somewhere dont you that age for you now wingsister starwind chuckled you know that isnt true you could enjoy the benefits we do if you would accept our invitation to live here cant she said shortly i have duties and weve been through all that listen i need your help briefly she outlined everything that had happened and waited for their response the initial reaction was pretty much as shed expected we do not leave ktreva moondance began uneasily when she had finished you know that our place is here as it has been for centuries that ashkevriden is no excuse said a light tenor voice from just beyond the trees planted at the edge of the safe boundary a huge white owl winged silently into the clearing to perch on a boulder and following it was a younger version of the two tayledras adepts except that instead of blue eyes this striking young man had luminous silver and there was something about the timbre of his strong vibrant voice that would remind anyone who heard it of vanyel hardly surprising since vanyel was brightstars father and apparently brightstar was going to be savils unexpected ally you yourselves have taught me that tayledras have left their territories at need before brightstar said taking a stand beside his owl and the world being what it is likely will again he lifted his chin in a way that reminded savil irresistibly of van in one of his aggressive moods if the need is great enough what harm in answering it savil explained again and brightstar stiffened his back in outrage but you must go i owe wingbrother vanyel my very existence i would go if i knew how to deal with these leechblades he spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness but i cannot what humility from the falcon who refused to admit there was any height he could not soar to starwind raised a sardonic eyebrow they were taking this a little too lightly for her comfort and evidently their adoptive son felt the same brightstar glowered i do not think that we have time to waste while vanyel lies in danger from this thing he said and you are quite right that there are some things i am not suited for so at last you recognize that yours is the gift of changing the living and healing the earth and not things made by the hand of man moondance looked up theatrically has the sun turned green are fish learning to fly is my honored father going to return to the point brightstar retorted the question is vanyel is in need of us and cannot come to us how do we answer that need i say you must go to him before he comes to harm starwind nodded reluctantly vanyel needs us and indeed we owe him much but is our clan served by our leaving the vale or would this bring harm that outweighs any good we could do my son there are good reasons for keeping our presence as secret as we may a polite cough interrupted them savil turned slightly and saw that firesong was standing there obviously waiting to be heard starwind nodded at her and she coughed again selfconsciously if you will excuse my intrusion she said standing at rigid attention with her hands clasped behind her it seems to me that the better question would be if the vale and clan are harmed by your leaving and i cannot see that this would be the case the debt of ktreva to wingbrother vanyel is a high one and our honor would be in doubt if we did not proffer help when it was asked of us in my opinion and speaking as the head of the scouts i think that this overrides even our tradition of secrecy so i am twice rebuked moondance said with a slight smile and by the infants i do believe that i hear a turtle singing lest the ground itself rise up to rebuke us a third time shaykrethashke starwind said rising and holding out his hand to savil or our son strike us down and drag us across the threshold let us go im very glad to hear you say that kechara savil said as they walked toward the gate and steeled themselves for the shock of crossing whyfor starwind asked pausing on the threshold of the gate itself because she said im getting too old to hit attractive men over the head and carry them off and the sad part is im so old thats the only way i can get them and with that she took his elbow and stepped across the threshold taking him with her though she was so exhausted that it felt like days since shed left it was hardly more than a candlemark either weariness had made it seem longer or time did odd things when you passed through a gate or both she thought turning to face her creation no one really knows how the damn things work anyway someday maybe an artificer will discover how to make us fly and we can do without them altogether if i had the choice between a nice journey in a comfortable seat and one of these gutwrenching gates id take the journey every time she held up her hands and began unweaving her gate strand by careful strand taking the energies back into herself tedious work and dangerous going too fast could send the power back into her at a rate she couldnt handle and at her age a shock like that could all too easily kill her then again that journey would probably mean entrusting myself to the competence of strangers theres plenty of folk i wouldnt trust my baggage to let alone my safety ah well its a nice dream anyway building a gate took most if not all of a mages energies but taking it down put a sizable amount of that energy back savil was feeling very much her cantankerous self when she turned back to starwind well she said dusting her hands off on her tunic what kind of an entrance do you want to make your pardon starwind replied puzzled by her turn of phrase do you want things to stay as quiet as possible she asked would you prefer we kept your presence at forst reach a secret itd be hard and frankly wed waste a lot of magic doing it but we could if thats what you want starwind exchanged glances and probably thoughts with moondance he bit his lower lip and looked at her measuringly before replying i am of two minds he said and the first thought is that it would be worth any effort to keep our presence unknown yet if we were to do that we would be unable to accomplish many things that i would like moondance wishes to have speech of vanyels father for one if we are to do such a thing we must be here openly savil did her best to keep her surprise from showing i cant imagine why youd want to talk to withen but all right so whats your choice open moondance said promptly with as much drama as we may if we are to break tayledras silence then i say we should leave your folk with a memory that will follow them all their days youll do more than that my lad savil muttered but nodded anyway however you want she said a little louder id like you to look at treesa first if you would van can wait a little and id rather get her on her feet before withen comes home and has hysterics starwind nodded lead the way wingsister we will follow your lead i doubt that she thought but didnt say it it was worth every odd look shed ever collected from the members of her family to see their faces as she sailed into treesas sickroom followed by the two tayledras they certainly knew how to time things for a particularly dramatic entrance she gave them that she shoved open the doors first then made a halfturn to see if they were still coming then just before the doors swung completely shut they flowed through side by side and paused to look around there were roughly half a dozen people in the room all told the only two savil recognized were the healer and father tyler both of whom stared at the exotic adepts with their mouths slowly falling open the rest drew back as far as they could get years of being told as children to be good or the hawkbrothers will get you were bound to have an effect and no one could doubt for a moment that these two were a pair of the fabled outlandersfor their birds were still perched calmly on their shoulders as if they passed through gates and were carried around strange keeps every day of the month both birds were stark white now though when savil had last seen him starwinds bondbird the younger of the pair was still marked with gray where the darker colorations hadnt yet bleached out she found herself marveling anew at the birds calm no falcon in the ashkevron mews would sit unjessed and unhooded on a humans shoulder nor tolerate being taken all over the keep but then these birds were to ordinary raptors what shinain warsteeds were to horses bred for centuries to be the partners of those they bonded with their intelligence was a little unnerving just now starwinds bird was watching savil with a quiet knowing look in its eyes and moondances was watching the priest with what had to be an expression of wicked amusement moondance himself strode toward the bed where treesa had been placed those at her bedside melted out of his way without a single word he held his hand briefly above her forehead frowned for a moment and then announced without turning around you were correct wingsister it is simple mageshock from being too near a blast i can bring her out if youd like it makes no difference to her recovery if she is awakened now or later do it now savil advised before withen comes crashing in here like a bull with its tail on fire moondance took both of treesas hands in his and held them for a moment with his eyes closed treesa began to stir muttering unintelligibly under her breath moondance waited for a moment then opened his eyes and called her name once treesa he breathed only that but somehow the name took on the flavoring of everything she was and things savil hadnt guessed she could be treesas eyes fluttered open and the first thing she focused on was moondance oh she said weakly my she gulped and blinked at the tayledras as if she could not look away from him though he dazzled her am am i dead are are you an angel starwind was too polite to burst out laughing but savil could tell by his toocalm expression and the creases around his twinkling eyes that he was doing his very best not to laugh at the notion of moondance as an angel moondance is never going to hear the last of this savil thought holding back a smile that twitched the corners of her mouth despite the seriousness of the overall situation no my lady moondance said haltingly in the tongue of valdemar i am only a friend of your son we came here to help him and you as well to help all the color drained from treesas face van how badly is he hurt dear gods she struggled to sit up but the healer prevented her from moving by holding her down with one hand on her shoulder moondance put his hand atop the healers eliciting a gasp from both the healer and treesa we go to him now my lady moondance said and smiled sweetly be at ease all will be well and with that he turned and swept out of the room starwind joining him so that they left as they had entered together savil smiled at treesa as reassuringly as she could and followed them where is young vanyel asked starwind as soon as they were all in the stonewalled corridor up a flight and over a bit savil told him taking the lead again and moving as quickly as her aching hip would permit i should warn you about something seems hes lifebonded again this time to a young bard about half his age starwind exchanged a wry glance with moondance indeed and where have i heard that tale before i would have no idea savil replied her tone heavy with irony just because you were near thirty and moondance was all of sixteen at any rate the boys with him dont frighten him hes had a bad few hours and hes part of the reason why i havent been frantic to get you here moondance looked puzzled but starwind nodded knowingly ah the blade feeds on both of them i had wondered why you were so calm about all this so long as you didnt take a week to make up your minds i reckoned we had time she paused outside vanyels door here and remember what i told you this time starwind held the door open for her and followed her inside with no dramatics at all stefen whitefaced was absorbed in van so completely that he didnt even notice they were there until starwind laid a gentle hand on his shoulder stefen jumped he looked up at the tayledras adept and his eyes grew very large and very round his mouth opened but he couldnt seem to make a sound we are here to help young vanyel little one starwind said kindly but for us to do so you must move away from him stefen lurched to his feet knocking over the chair hed been sitting on and backed away tripping over it in the process moondance caught him before he fell and savil wondered for a moment if the poor boy was going to faint on the spot he recovered and edged over to savil standing slightly behind her his eyes never once leaving the tayledras starwind held one finger near to the leechblade but did not touch it a nasty piece of work that he said in his own tongue to savil more than ordinary malice went into its making but can you get rid of it savil asked anxiously oh aye not easily but it is by no means the hardest task i have ever undertaken ashke moondance nodded and moved to stand immediately behind him with one hand resting lightly on his shoulder starwind ripped part of the ornamental silk from his sleeve the cloth parted with a sound like the snarl of a hunting cat he wrapped the bit of silk around his hand and only then grasped the hilt of the leechblade now we give it something else to seek after he murmured and held his other hand a few thumblengths away from the wicked little knife invoking magesight savil saw that his hand glowed with lifeforce far more than vanyel possessed even at the core of him and she saw how the blade loosened its hold on the heraldmage how it turned in starwinds hand and lurched out of the wound like a hungermaddened weasel not this time i think starwind said aloud pulling his unprotected hand away before the writhing blade could strike it now ashke moondance made an arc of pure power between his two hands and starwind brought the blade down into it the thing shrieked stefen screamed and clasped his hands over his ears savil very nearly did the same the only reason she didnt try to block her ears was because she knew it wouldnt do any good that hideous screaming was purely mental the scream of the blade continued for four or five breaths then as suddenly as it had begun the thing fell silent moondance damped the powerarc and when savils eyes and magesight recovered from the dazzle she saw that starwind held only a hilt the blade itself was gone and the air reeked of charred silk and that the tayledras said with satisfaction turning the blackened hilt over in his hand and examining it carefully is that he looked up at savil and now dearest wingsister we four can all join to bring our brother back to us she was placing her hands over moondances when she realized what hed said four huh well why not come here lad she said over her shoulder to stefen who was hovering worriedly in the background they wont bite you much moondance said in her tongue with a sly grin for stefen oddly enough that seemed to relax him what can i do he asked taking his place at savils side i have no idea she admitted but he knows so lets both find out starwind smiled and placed his hands atop theirs savil took a long deep breath and looked quickly down at vanyel he was breathing normally deeply asleep and his color was back hell probably wake up in a candlemark or so fandes will be out about as long what happened stef asked dazedly what did we do sit singer moondance said pushing him down onto the bed we gave young vanyel a path back to himself and the strength to return upon it but that strength came from us you most particularly and you should now rest he nodded at the bed there is plenty of room there and vanyel would feel comforted by your presence he would the youngster looked on his last legs but was stubbornly refusing to admit his weariness well if you think so i think so moondance threw a light blanket over the bards shoulders rest you do not hasten his recovery by fretting if you he stifled a yawn say so moondance shook his head at starwind children was i that stubbornminded he asked in tayledras oh you were worse starwind grinned and took savil by the elbow kindly show us where we will be staying wingsister i think we will have to remain here some few days more else vanyel will foolishly exert himself and it will be all to do again and just what do you have up your sleeve she asked him youre right of course but theres more that you arent telling the boy perceptive as always he replied i wish you to hear this from moondance however she nodded at moondance who joined them at the door sleep stefen he ordered as he closed it an indistinct mumble came from the general direction of the bed it sounded like agreement in the absence of anyone else i guess ill make the decision of where to put you two savil said and because i dont know where else i guess you might as well take the room next to vans she opened the door to the next guest room which looked about the same as vanyels in the dim light with forst reach entertaining as many as a hundred visitors during the course of a year no room ever sat long enough to take on an air of disuse the only real sign that it was not occupied was the fact that the shutters were closed and what light there was leaked in through the cracks so now what was it you wanted to tell me about savil asked starwind closing the door behind him the older tayledras went directly to the window and threw the shutters open not i he said but moondance he sat on the window ledge and leaned out looking with interestthough real or feigned savil couldnt tell whichat the grounds below well she asked impatiently of moondance the healingadept looked very uncomfortable i do not know how much you give credence to our beliefs he said doubtfully depends on which one she replied sitting on the edge of the bed if its the one about how people should live in trees i still think youre out of your mind he ignored the sally we think and have proved insofar as such a thing is possible to prove that souls are reborn sometimes even crossing species boundaries rebirth into something of like intelligence a hertasi perhaps being reborn as a kyree or a kyree as a human must make things interesting at dinnertime savil jibed he glared at her she gave him a sardonic stare right back this is all very fascinating philosophy but i dont see what it has to do with van she pointed out tilting her head a little moondance shook his head not with vanyel with the singer stef she exclaimed incredulously why on earth stefen and why is it important because my shaykrethashke believes as do i that your stefen is or was the young one called tylendel starwind called from the window savils first reaction was surprise then skepticism what just because they lifebonded really isnt that a little too neat too pat it makes a very nice tale but she shrugged no moondance said walking to the window to stand beside starwind no it is not because of the lifebond or not primarily there are other thingsmemory traces of vanyel many years ago ties other than the lifebond he paused and looked up at the ceiling as if gathering his thoughts and there are reasons pressing reasons for this to have happened the bond between tylendel and vanyel was strong stronger even than most lifebonds i have seen there is a debt owed to vanyel because of what happened there is unfinished business because tylendel failed as a herald he looked at her expectantly for a moment then shrugged i could go on at length but that would only bore you i doubt it savil replied fascinated in spite of her skepticism but i cant see what relevance it has to the current situation either starwind left the window only that the past has bearing on the present and will color what happens in the present so should i tell them about this speculation of yours she asked curiously ah starwind clasped his hands behind his back and gave his lifebonded a wry smile that is where we differ i think perhaps yes but i do not feel at all as strongly as moondance and am willing to be overruled and i think that on no account should you tell them moondance said adamantly leaning his back against the windowframe but our reasons for our feelings are much the same we feel starwind took up the thread of conversation that this relationship should be permitted to develop without the baggage of the previous one it is not the same set of circumstances at all their meeting and bonding nor are their relative status or ages the same therefore i think they should be told so that they may avoid misunderstandings that echoes of the past may bring and i think that being told will only bring problems that vanyel will cease to react to stefen as he has become and that he will begin behaving in ways that will warp the relationship out of all recognition and health moondance crossed his arms over his chest and looked very stubbornly at savil i can think of one problem right off she said slowly if van thinks stefs his old love hes likely to do one of two things pay more attention to stefs opinions and advice or less neither is healthy stefs got a good head on those shoulders but he also has a lot of growing up to do yet right now vans giving him about the same amount of slack hed give any lad his age and listening to him when he makes sense which is the way it should remain moondance concluded she shook her head at starwind sorry old friend but my vote goes with moondance he shrugged i had already told you i did not feel that strongly i am content to be overruled to change the topic how long do you want to stay she asked ill have to tell withen something when he gets back three days perhaps five no more certainly starwind shook his hair back two days to keep vanyel from overexerting then however long it takes to unravel who did this thing and why if we can moondance said with resignation it is by no means certain but with four adepts at work the odds are that what can be uncovered will be which brings me to a request dearest wingsister starwind grinned do you think this place is capable of producing garments of a suitable size for us it seems that we forgot to pack oh probably nothing good enough for you you preening snowbirds savil grinned wryly but we may be able to rummage up something twelve yet another of treesas ladies had savil and the elder tayledras trapped in a conversation this time just outside the keep as starwind sent his falcon up for some exercise there was no reason for this onesided discourse shed done it purely for an excuse to gawk at the exotic savil closed her eyes for a moment and wished that the chattering childwoman would come to the point this said starwind under his breath in his own language is not a family it is a small army and half of them are mad he nodded to the young woman smiled and tried to interject a single word it she ran right over the top of him without pausing for breath and without taking her eyes from starwinds face but my mothers cousin twice removed you know the kyliera grove brendewhins not the anderlins freehold lot the ones who does she never cease speaking starwind asked even in sleep not to my knowledge savil replied the same way then i shall have to do something rude to free us from the chains of her words he told her youre forgiven in advance savil assured him suddenly with no forewarning whatsoever starwinds white gyrfalcon swooped down out of the sky above them and dove at the girl missing her by a goodly distance but frightening her into silence the bird hovered just over starwinds head screaming at her threatening to dive again your pardon starwind said with a completely disarming smile but i think my bird must have taken a dislike to your apparel i have never seen him act in this way before he must believe that you are a threat to me the bird dove again and this time the girl shrieked and fled starwind held up his arm and the falcon settled on it immediately then hopped to his shoulder and began preening itself with every sign of being completely calm kellan wandered up and put her nose up to the bird it reached out with its wicked beak and gently nibbled at her upper lip before resuming its preening a bird with sense kellan told her chosen a wicked twinkle in her eye i was considering charging you three just before starwind asked asheena to threatdive the only problem with that is lytherill would never have believed threat out of you savil said she believes in the unquestionable goodness and purity of companions kellan hung her head and moaned does this mean i can expect her to garland me with roses try to hug my neck and speak to me in babytalk savil laughed no love shes not quite that young though a couple of years ago before she discovered boys youd have been in danger how close are you to finding out what that mage was up to kellan asked with the kind of abrupt change of subject savil had come to expect from her over the years close well probably be able to run the spells tomorrow indeed wingsister a new mindvoice entered the conversation and both savil and her companion suppressed startlement adepts or very powerful mindspeakers were so few that savil seldom remembered that the tayledras shared with vanyel the ability to overhear any conversation that was not shielded against them pardon he said apologetically yes we should be prepared enough and vanyel recovered enough to make the attempt tomorrow would the one who struck him were still in condition to be questioned starwind sent his falcon up once more this time in response to a pigeon taking wing from the keep eaves wild raptors savil knew missed more often than they struck but tayledras bondbirds seldom stooped without a kill at the end starwind had his eyes closed and his entire body stiffened with tension as his bird dove a scream of triumph rang out as the bird pulled up for the kill and starwind shivered a little a tiny smile of satisfaction on his lips as the falcons talons struck home the gyrfalcon carried its prey to the roof to feed and starwind opened his eyes and smiled a little more broadly at savils knowing grin fantasizing someone other than a pigeon at the end of that stoop hmm savil asked i starwind was all innocence and savil didnt believe it for a moment you if i had that bastard in my reach right now never mind come on lets finish this walk savil headed out into the paddocks and starwind fell in beside her kellan following noiselessly behind as for being waylaid by halfgrown girls half the problems you and moondance are having you brought on yourselves she told him frankly you two insisted on being spectacular well now you see what happens to a spectacle im sorry but i cant feel terribly sorry for you i would not have insisted had i known the sheer number of inhabitants in this place he replied ruefully gods of my fathers five families with no less than seven children in each hundreds of menatarms and then there are the servants the fosterlings he shook his head in disbelief ktreva is little larger and it is an entire clan it staggers the imagination and every one of those people is dying for a closeup look at you savil sighed i tried to warn you the warning came too late he shrugged though i am glad to have met withens falconer for all that he salivates every time he looks upon our winged brothers and i am doubly glad to have met vanyels father and mother savil strolled over to a fence surrounding the field that held the yearling fillies and leaned on it putting one foot on the lowest rung withens gotten better the last five years or so i must say im rather proud of him most men go more hidebound with age but the old bastard seems to have relaxed some of his attitudes hellfires he hardly ever bellows at me anymore you think so starwind replied looking out over the field that is good that is very good but why it was good he refused to say every night after dinner withen and treesa had taken to inviting the tayledras savil and vanyel up to their private suite or more often since the weather was excellent out to the secluded side porch vanyel had favored before the orchard incident in part it was out of pity to get them away from the forst reach hordes and after the first evening they included stefen in on the invitation although the bard begged off saying he had promised to entertain the younger set tonight was no exception but this time vanyel too had gracefully asked pardon to decline he didnt give a reason but savil told withen as she joined the group out on the porch that he was missing an unusual experience what is it withen said curiously handing starwind a cup of wine hed had servants line the porch with festivallanterns so that the place was well but not brightly lit someone managed to goad your son and his friend into challenging each other musically speaking she replied thats what theyre up to right now in front of most of the younglings of the keep no treesa trust me it isnt anything you want to subject yourself to treesa had begun to rise but sank back down to her seat i do trust you but why i trust van not to do anything that would upset the childrens parents so it cant be a bawdysong contest can it no its not savil said grinning its a bad song contest theyve challenged each other to come up with the worst songs they know trite badlyrhymed badlyscannedyou name it right now vans going through some piece of drivel about being trapped in a magic circle for seventeen years and it sounds like it may take seventeen years to sing it treesa laughed it may at that she said and filled a cup for the younger tayledras moondance took it but his face was sober lady treesa lord withen i have a great wish to speak of something with you and as it concerns your son i think this moment of his absence gives me the opportunity if you will permit he paused and looked first into treesas eyes then into withens it is not comfortable treesa dropped her gaze but nodded withen cleared his throat nothing about my son is particularly comfortable im not sure he was ever created to inspire comfort i think i would like to hear what you have to say no i would not like it but i think i should hear it moondance sighed and sat down on the stone railing then let me tell you something about a very young man a boy named tallo savil was considerably more than a little surprised moondance found the story of his own past so painful that he had rarely divulged it to anyone she knew it of course she had found the boy she had brought him to starwind nearly dead moondance told his story in as few words as possible his voice flat and without emotion some thirty years ago in a village far from here there lived a boy named tallo he was a recluse a lone runner an odd boy given more to thought than deed his parents hoped he would become a votary and sent him to the priest to learn but in the priests books he found what he was truly gifted with magic his parents did not understand this nor did they sympathize for their lives had little to do with magic and mages this made him further alone more different and his parents began to try to force him back to their own simple ways it was too late for that there were arguments there were more when they attempted to bring him to wed and he refused he could not tell them what he felt for what he yearned for were those of his own sex and such a thing was forbidden moondances soft voice did not betray the pain the tayledras adept felt savil knew no one better but certainly withen could never have guessed one summer after a winter of arguments and anger there came a troupe of gleemen to the village one among them was very handsome and quite different from his fellows thus it was that tallo learned he was not the only boy to feel yearnings of that kind they became lovers then they were discovered both were beaten and cast out of the village in anger tallos lover repudiated him and in pain and anger tallo called lightnings down upon him moondance sighed and shook his head he did not mean even to hurt only to frighten but he did not know enough to control what he called and the young gleeman died in agony crying out tallos name and in remorse for what he had done tallo tried to take his own life it was herald savil who found him who brought him to her new friend starwind of the ktreva who was also shayachern and healed the young boy in body and spirit but still there was such grief such remorse that tallo felt something must be given in sacrifice to the harm he had done so did tallo die and in his place came moondance withen started moondance glanced sideways at him and only now did the tayledras show any emotion tallo is no more he said his voice subdued and no one in tallos village would know moondance the tayledras are stories to frighten children with and they would not dare to recognize him those that were his family would only be afraid of what he has become never can the one who became moondance reconcile with his family he did not when he was tallo and now it is impossible to do so and that lord withen lady treesa is a desperate sadness he sipped his wine as the insects sang in the darkness around them and the lights in the lanterns flickered it seems to me lord withen starwind said finally just before the long silence became too much to bear that a mans life must be judged by what he has done with it your son is a hero not only to your people but to ours to the peoples of baires and lineas even to some outside the borders of your realm look at the good he has done and yet always with him is a deep and abiding hurt because he feels that you have seen nothing of the good he has done that you feel he is something evil and unclean withen swallowed his cup of wine in a single gulp he stared up at the stars for a long time then lowered his eyes to meet starwinds for just a moment he dropped them then toyed with his cup until the silence grew too much even for him to bear he cleared his throat and furrowed his brow looking very unhappy thank you youve given me a lot to think about he said awkwardly and turned to lock gazes with moondance both of you have and i promise you that i will think about it he looked down at his cup as if he was surprised to find it empty i think at the moment that i have had quite enough wine for one night he smiled suddenly stood up and held out his hand to treesa who took it with a surprised expression by now that little contest should be over and i do believe id like to find out who and what won and with that he set his cup down aided treesa to her feet and exited with a certain ponderous grace savil blinked and took a sip of her own wine what was that supposed to accomplish she asked and why on earth did you broach that subject now moondance put down his cup of wine untasted it was something that needed healing he replied i have done my poor best and we may only see what time will bring starwind nodded without speaking savil looked up at the velvet of the night sky no moon tonight which made the stars seem all the brighter it felt right if my opinion means anything to you she said at last right words right time if anything is going to happen it is in withens hands starwind sighed then stretched gods of my fathers if there is anything more difficult than dealing with the heart i do not know what it may be i am to my rest and i to mine savil said putting her cup down tomorrow is another day yes and tomorrow we shall have finished the preliminaries over that evil hilt tomorrow we shall look into its past and that of its wielder moondance shook his head this will not be pleasant no savil agreed moving toward the door with the other two and i dont think the answers were going to get will be pleasant either so lets enjoy our peace while we have it hmm indeed starwind said pausing to let her precede him for it is all too fleeting and fragile a thing peace vanyel knew that savil would have been happier in a fortified work room but the current situation wouldnt allow it there really was no place suitable in all of the keep the tayledras felt more comfortable outofdoors and the orchard was the place where the strange mage had died so to the orchard they had all come savil had brought a cushion with her the ground was too much for her bones the tayledras sank down in their places with no sign of discomfort at all vanyel wished belatedly that he had thought to bring something to sit on but it was too late now they sat in a circle but with their backs to each other rather than facetoface all four of them would see this reenactment of the recent past all four of them would hear the thoughts that had been strong enough to have left an imprint there they were looking outward not inward and hence the seating arrangement they were all in place now as vanyel eased himself down between savil and starwind the little circle did not include stefen who was keeping treesa and her ladies occupied and out of the mages way but it was starwinds opinion that he was better employed in that capacity than in watching them work magic he could not participate in vanyel unwrapped the blackened hilt and laid it on the bare earth he looked up at savil whose expression made him think that her insides were probably in knots you dont have to do this you know he reminded her you dont have to help i know that she replied but id worry myself to bits until you three finished this little exercise id rather be in on it vanyel nodded all right then lets link he linked to savil while starwind gathered moondance in familiar bonds to familiar then the two halves joined forming a meld that was as close to seamless as anything van had ever seen it helped that the four of them had wielded magics as a group before it also helped that their friendship was as close as it was but what made this work was that all four of them had actually trained together they would take turns as leader and supporters in this and there was no room for temperament or pride savil took the lead for the first part invoking from the hilt and from the bloodsoaked ground the mages last moments the peaceful orchard and his companions vanished from vanyels sight now he approached a ring of treesas ladies listening to stefens music as if he rode upon the mages shoulder and vanyel knew that the others were seeing what he saw all of the strangers surface thoughts were open to them for that time period savil froze the scene at the moment the mage had attacked treesa and stefen and they read then what was uppermost in his mind vanyel was so startled he nearly fell out of the link the man he had captured in the wood and this mage might just as well have been two entirely different people not only was this mage not crazed but his attitudes were drastically different as well as what could be read of his past history and training the mage had not known that vanyel was home he had deduced who vanyel was quickly enough but had entrapped him by pure accident he had been assuming that he would trap withens housemage most nobles outside valdemar had one to weave protections for themselves and their interests since he hadnt detected any of the arcane protections that would have shown him withens housemage had a work room he had supposed that his enemy must be some kind of woods witch or hedgewizard to do all of his spellcasting outofdoors the wood with all of its residual magics would have been perfect for that so the stranger had waited snare at the ready for the first sign of spellcasting he had expected to catch another hedgewizard he had gotten vanyel this was rather akin to setting a trap for a sparrow and catching a firebird the mental blow that knocked him unconscious had caught him completely by surprise so when he came to he had done so behind a screen prepared for just such an occasion he had retreated behind a disguise that had been created for him by another mage just in case he had discovered that the one he intended to neutralize had been more powerful than he this was the false persona whose thoughts vanyel had skimmed the madman who interpreted everything as an attack or a threat to himself at this point the stranger had still not known that hed caught vanyel he had only thought that withens housemage was far more skilled than he had guessed it wasnt until vanyel actually came into his lineofsight that he had realized who and what had caught him that had been the spark of recognition vanyel had seen after that the man buried himself even deeper beneath the false persona deciding to fall back on his secondary plan that involved getting inside forst reach itselfand vanyel played right into his hands by taking him to father tyler hed waited for vanyel to probe him more carefully and had been relieved when van was too preoccupied to see if there was anything behind the personascreen that made his job all the easier he had disposed of father tyler and had gone looking for treesa or withen hed found out where they were by the simple expedient of asking a servant then hed gone hunting the final thought vanyel read as the mage prepared to launch the leechblade at treesa was that his master would be very pleased that was maddeningly all savil tried to read farther into the past than the moment of the attack but once he was off forst reach lands the mage had been screened and shielded and there was nothing there to be read there was no image in the mages mind connected with this master hed never seen the unknown mage in person the master had only given him his orders then given him the means to carry them out he had set up the disguisepersona had screened his servant against detection and backreading while off the forst reach lands and had constructed the twin leechblades for him the mage had only been a tool in the hands of someone bigger vanyel shook off his disappointment and began gently disengaging himself from the spell gradually the frozen scene faded from magesight and ordinary sight then with an abrupt gutwrenching shudder it vanished completely and vanyel was back in the present with a numb behind and far too many unanswered questions he got up breaking the circle and stretched he stood staring at the tree just in front of him for a while trying to get everything hed learned and everything he hadnt learned sorted out when he turned around starwind was staring at him a slight frown on his lips you do realize what this attack means do you not he said to vanyel that you were vulnerable to the leechblade was the purest accident if you had been warded against magic the thing would have had no purchase upon you nevertheless you were the target the mage recognized you and knew that he was to destroy you by indirect means by destroying those you love the one who sent him does not want to confront you but does want you eliminated this time the targets were to be lady treesa lord withen or both hence the two blades the protections i put on them wont hold against direct attacks savil admitted unhappily i cant stop an assassin i dont think this is going to end with one attack either not with what i picked up van i dont know what to say vanyel sighed and ran his fingers through his hair its nothing i havent anticipated savil thats always been my worst fear you know that but if there is somebody some powerful enemy of mine out therewhere has he been all this time what does he really want and is he just my enemy or is he valdemars enemy as well moondance stretched as starwind clasped his shoulders and rubbed them absently this comes as quite a surprise to us as well wingbrother we are reclusive yes but there are still signs of such a mage as this master seems to be which we should have detected long before this vanyel offered savil his hands to pull her to her feet except that you have a peculiar blind spot my friends savil said accepting the aid you never look outside your own territory even the shinain clans work together but you dont each of your clans operates on its own thats your strength but thats also your weakness strength or weakness it matters not starwind said shortly the question is how is vanyel to ensure the continued safety of his parents as you have pointed out wingsister this is not going stop at one attack theres only one thing i can do vanyel said since i cant be where they are get them to move to where you are savil shook her head i dont know van that may be harder than getting yourself transferred to forst reach that may be vanyel said grimly but it has to be done dinner was a cold lump in vanyels stomach and his weariness made the lamplight seem harsher than it really was i have no choice but to insist on this father vanyel concluded clasping his hands around his ale mug and staring at the surface of the table i know you never want to leave forst reach and the gods know you never asked to have a heraldmage for a son im asking this because i have to i cant protect you savil cant protect you randale cant afford to keep a herald here fulltime to keep you safe there arent enough of them and nothing less would do it you could hire all the guards you wanted to none of them would do any good against a mage hire a mage and whoever this is will send a better one this enemy of mine knows me very well father if you or mother died because of what i am i id never get over it he looked up at withens troubled face and at treesas frightened one theres no help for it father youll have to take up the council seat for this district and move to haven everyone would be glad to see you in it and lord enderby never wanted it in the first place youd do a good job and the council could use your experience treesa sighed happily and lost her fear instantly she had wanted to move to haven for years ever since the last of her children wedded oh withen she said her eyes sparkling you must ive hoped for this for so long withen winced i think you mean youve hoped for a reason to make me go to the capital and not that the reason would be that were in danger otherwise treesa pouted shed recovered very quickly showing a resilience that moondance called remarkable of course thats what i meant withen for all that you like to pretend that youre a plain and simple man youve been running not only forst reach but most of the county as well and you very well know it when something goes wrong wheres the first keep they go to here of course and it isnt to ask advice of mekeal i think van is right i think youd make a fine councillor withen shook his head and took a long drink of ale ah treesa i hate politics you know thatand now you want me to go fling myself into them right up to the neck vanyel put his mug down im going to have to shock him into taking the seat or hell go and pine away with boredom father its either that or move to haven without anything to do but sit around the court all day and trade stories with the other spavined old warhorses he said bluntly i was offering you an option that would give you something useful to do you are going to haven whether or not you like it i cannot afford to leave you here withen bristled so im a spavined old warhorse am i vanyel didnt rise to the bait withen expected him to try and back down and he couldnt not with so much riding on his persuading withen that he was right in a sense yes youre too old to rejoin the guard even as a trainer theres nothing else there for you but that council seat is crying for someone competent to fill it and you are competent youre qualified and you wont play politics with valdemars safety at stake and that puts you ahead of half the other councillors so far as i can see and you father are trying to change the subject abruptly withen put his mug down and held up both hands in surrender all right all right ill take the damned seat but theyll get me as i am no court garb no jewels and furbelows treesa can dress up all she likes but im a plain man i always have been and i always will be vanyels shoulders sagged with relief father you can be anything you like youll be a refreshing change from some of the butterflybrains we have on the grand council trust me you wont be alone there are two or threeother old warhorses no more spavined than you i might add former bordermen like you who have pretty much the same attitudes and i say thank the gods for all of you withen glowered im only going because youve got work for me he said grumbling meke may think he runs forst reach but treesas right when theres trouble its me they all come to all the better for meke vanyel thought let him make his own mistakes and learn from them but what he said was then its time to expand your stewardship father more than time i think you will serve valdemar as well or better than you served forst reach he started to get up when withens hand on his wrist stopped him son his father said earnestly did you really mean that about how youd be hurt if something happened to your mother or me father vanyel closed his eyes and sank back into his seat swallowing an enormous lump in his throat father i would be devastated i would be absolutely worthless and somehow this mage knows that which is why its so important for you to be somewhere safe valdemar needs me and needs me undamaged and i need you youre my parents and i love you he took a deep breath what he was going to say was very hard and it had cost him a lot of soulsearching i cant change the past father but i can manage things better in the future youve been very good about my relationship with stef if it would make you feel better though ill see to it that he and i dont see much of each other that way you wont have what i am rubbed in your nose at haven withen flushed and looked down at the table thats thats very good of you son but i dont want you to do that vanyel bit his lip with surprise you dont but youre my son i tried to see to it that you learned everything i thought was important honor honesty that there are things more important than yourself it seems to me youve been living up to those things withen traced the grain of the table with a thick forefinger theres only one way you ever disappointed me and i dont know van butit just doesnt seem that important when you stack it up against everything else youve ever done i dont see where id have been any happier if youd been like meke i might have been worse off two blockheads in one family is enough id say withen looked up for a moment then back down at his cup anyway what im trying to say is is that i love you son im proud of you that youngster stefen is a goodhearted lad and id like to think of him as one of the family if hell put up with us that is i can understand why you like him withen looked up again met vanyels eyes and managed a weak grin of course ill admit that id have been a deal happier if he was a girl but hes not and youre attached to him and any fool can see hes the same about you youve never been one to flaunt yourself withen blushed and looked away again i dont see you starting now so you and stef stay the way you are after all these years i guess im finally getting used to the idea vanyels eyes stung he wiped them with the back of his hand father i i dont know what to say if youll forgive me son for how ive hurt you ill forgive you withen replied he shoved his seat away from the table and held out his arms i havent hugged you since you were five id like to catch up now father vanyel knocked over the bench and stumbled blindly to withens side of the table father he whispered and met withens awkward embrace oh father he said into withens muscular shoulder if you only knew how much this means to me i love you so much i never wanted to hurt you withens arms tightened around him i love you too son he said hesitantly you cant change what you are any more than i can help what i am but we dont have to let that get in the way any more do we no father vanyel replied something deep and raw inside him healing at last no we dont thirteen ordinarily stef would have been fascinated by the activities in the fields he was cityborn and bred and the farmers at their harvestwork were as alien to him as the tayledras and as interesting but vanyel had been brooding again and finally stef decided to ferret out the cause the road was relatively clear of travelers with the harvest just begun no one was bringing anything in to market that savil had told stef would happen in about a week when the roads would be thick with carts this was really the ideal time to travel if you didnt mind the latesummer dust and heat stef didnt mind but he did mind the way van kept worrying at some secret trouble until he made both their heads ache and it seemed that the only way to end the deadlock would be if he said or did something to break it somethings bothering you stefen said when they were barely a candlemark from haven its been bothering you for the past two days he urged melody up beside yfandes who obligingly lagged a little vanyels lips tightened and he looked away you wont like it he said finally stef swatted at an obnoxious horsefly i dont like the way youve been getting all knotted up either he pointed out whatever it is i wish youd just spit it out and get it over with youre giving me a headache he eyed savil who was riding on vanyels right hoping shed get the hint she raised one eyebrow at him then held kellan back letting herself fall farther and farther behind until she was just out of earshot though how much that means when she can read minds stef thought then chided himself oh she wouldnt probe unless she had to heralds just dont do that to people not even van comes into my mind unless i ask him ive got to get used to this that they have powers but dont always use them its you van said quietly once savil had withdrawn her discreet twenty paces im afraid for you stef the way i was afraid for my parents and for the same reason he shaded his eyes from the brilliant sun overhead and looked out over fields full of people scything down hay but stef sensed he wasnt paying any attention to them i have an enemy who doesnt want a direct confrontation so hell strike at me through others once its known that you and i are lovers he wont hesitate to strike at you gods i was afraid id shocked or offended him hes so virginal and kernos knows im not ah stefen said relieved i was hoping it was just something like that and not that that id upset you or anything vanyel turned to face him with an expression of complete surprise stef youve just had a taste of what its like to be a target how can you brush it off so lightly im not treating this lightly but why are you bringing your parents to haven if it isnt safe there stefen pointed out with remorseless logic i thought that was the whole idea behind making them move there vanyel looked away from him up the road ahead of them it wont work lover youre never getting rid of me stefen had already made up his mind to counter any argument van gave him so he used vans silence as an excuse to admire his profile the way his long fineboned hands rested on his saddlepommel his perfect balance in the saddle its safer vanyel said after a strained silence that doesnt mean its safe i dont want you hurt i dont want to be hurt stefen said vehemently then laughed you keep thinking im like a herald that ill go throwing myself into danger the way you do look van i am not a hero i promise you i have a very high regard for my skin bards are supposed to sing about heroes not imitate them theres no glory for a bard in dying young i promise you ill tell you what at the first sign the very first sign of trouble i will most assuredly run for cover ill hide myself either behind the nearest guard or the nearest herald does that content you no vanyel said unhappily but i cant make you leave me and thats the only thing that would keep you safe damned right you cant stefen snorted theres nothing that would make me leave you no matter what happened i only hope vanyel said soberly peering up the road at the gate in the city walls that nothing makes you eat those words i only hope nothing makes you eat those words was it only a few months ago i said that i knew it could come to this but will he understand im sorry stef vanyel spoke with his back to the bard looking out the window of his room as he leaned against the windowframe he couldnt bear to look at stefens face he didnt know how stef felt though he expected the worst he was so tightly shielded against leaking emotions that he couldnt have told if stef was angry unhappy or indifferent but he didnt expect stef to understand the bard couldnt possibly understand how a heralds duty could come ahead of anything else maybe nothing would make you leave me ashke but nobody said anything about me leaving you and i dont have a choice i can understand why you have to go youre the only real authority who can speak for the king but why cant i go with you stefen spoke softly with none of the anger in his voice that van had expected but stef was a bard and used to controlling his inflections because im going to rethwellan they dont like shaych there actually thats an understatement if you came with me theyd probably drive us both across the border and declare war on valdemar for the insult if when they found out about the two of us vanyel gripped the side of the window tightly the beautiful lateautumn day and the garden beyond the open window were nothing more than a blur to him we need that treaty and we need it now and the rethwellan ambassador specifically requested me as randis proxy i want you with me but my duty to valdemar comes first im sorry stef arms around his shoulders made him stiffen with surprise so am i stefen murmured in his ear but you said it yourself valdemar comes first how long will you be gone vanyel shook his head not quite believing what hed just heard you mean you dont mind of course i mind stef replied some of the anger van had expected before this in his voice how can i not mind but if theres one thing a bard knows its how heralds think ive known all along that if you had to make a choice between me and your duty id lose its just the way you are his arms tightened around vanyels chest i dont like it he continued quietly but i also dont like it that you can speak directly to my mind and i cant do the same to yours and im learning to live with that too and you didnt answer me about how long you think youll be gone about three months itll be winter when i get back the silence lasted a bit too long for vans comfort he tried to force himself to relax stefen slid his hands up onto vans shoulders and began gently massaging the tense muscles of his neck ill miss you the bard said eventually you know i will stef promise me youll stay safe van hung his head and closed his eyes beginning to relax in spite of himself im the safest person in the kingdom next to randale stefen chuckled frankly im much more concerned with knowing that youll keep yourself safe and one other thing concerns me very deeply whats that how im going to make sure tonight is so memorable you come running back here when youve got the treaty stefen breathed into his ear if fandes wasnt so bonedeep tired van thought through a fog of weariness and cold id ask her to run ah well dull gray clouds were so low they made him claustrophobic the few travelers on the road seemed as dispirited and exhausted as he was sleet drooled down as it had all day the road was a slushy mire and even the most waterproof of cloaks were soaked and nearuseless after a day of it dirty gray snow piled up on either side of the road and made walking on the verge impossible van had stopped at an inn at nooning to dry off and warm up and half a candlemark after they started out again he might as well not have bothered both he and yfandes were so filthy they were a disgrace to the circle no one would be able to stay clean in this fandes grumbled how far are we ive lost all track of distance gods im freezing i think were about two candlemarks out of haven at this pace vanyel told her she raised her head a spark of rebellion in her eye to the lowest hells with this pace she said shortly im taking a new way home and with that she pivoted on her hindquarters and leaped over the mounds of halfthawed snow that fenced the sides of the road vanyel tightened his legs around her barrel and his grip on the pommel with a yelp of surprise he tried to mindspeak her but she wasnt listening after three tries he gave up there was no reasoning with her in this mood she ranged out about twenty paces from the road then threw her head up her nostrils flaring i thought so this is where the road makes that long loop to the south i can cut straight across and have us at the palace gates in half a candlemark but he began too late she stretched her weary legs into a canter then a lope she was too tired for an allout run but her lope was as good as most horses full gallop look out vanyel shouted youre going through she leaped a hedge and cut through a flock of sheep who were too startled by her sudden presence to scatter something dark and solidlooking loomed up ahead of them in the gusting sheets of thick sleet she leaped again clearing the hedge on the opposite side of the field then lurched and slipped on a steep slope vanyel clung to her back as she scrambled down a cut splashed through the icecold creek at the bottom and clambered up the other bank van gave up on trying to stop her or even reason with her and hung on for dear life the sleet thickened and became real snow by now vanyel was so cold he couldnt even feel his toes and his fingers were entirely numb snow was everywhere blown in all directions including up by the erratic gusts of wind he couldnt see where yfandes was going because of the snow being blown into his face only the tensing of her muscles told him when she was going to make another of those bonejarring jumps into or out of someones field across a stream or even through a barnyard finally she made another leap that ended with her hooves chiming on something hard presumably pavement she halted abruptly ending in a short skid and he was thrown against the pommel of his saddle before he could regain his balance when he looked up the walls of the city towered over them both and here in the lee of the walls the wind was tamed to a faint breath already snow had started to lodge in the tiny crevices between the blocks of stone creating thin white lines around each of them she moved up to the gate at a sedate walk bridle bells chiming cheerfully as a kind of ironic counterpoint to her tired pacing the guard at the gate started to wave them through then took a second look and halted them just inside the tunnel beneath the walls with a restraining hand on yfandes bridle this tunnel sheltered from the wind and snow felt warm after the punishing weather outside vanyel raised his head tiredly what he began youre not goin past me in that state herald growled the guard a toughlooking woman who reminded van of his own sister lissa old man like you should know better than to old man he shook his head so that his hood fell back and she stopped in midsentence her mouth falling open if there were any flies to catch he said with tired good humor youd be making a frog envious she shut her mouth with an audible snap beg your pardon milord vanyel she said stiffly just saw the white in your hair and you did quite right to stop me my lady he replied gently im obviously not thinking and its from cold and exhaustion were far from infallible someone had better watch out for us now what were you planning on doing with me aside from telling me what a fool i was to be out in this muck i was goin to give you a blanket to wrap up in she said hesitantly make you take off that soggy cloak gods milord it looks like youre carryin half the roadmuck twixt here and the border on you i think we are but the palace isnt far and thats where were heading he said i think we can make it that far he managed a real smile and she smiled back uncertainly if you say so milord she took her hand off yfandes rein and stepped aside he rode back out into the cold and snow but at least within the city walls they were sheltered from the wind and it wasnt that far to the palace he must have blanked out for a while a common enough habit of his when he knew he was in relatively safe but uncomfortable surroundingsriding on a patrolled road in the dead of winter or waiting out an ambush in the pouring rain for instance the next thing he knew he was in the dry and heated warming shed beside the stable one of the grooms was at his stirrup urging him to dismount fandes he queried she turned her head slowly to stare at him blinking oh were home i must have you did the same thing i did the minute we crossed inside the city we went numb get some rest love im going to do the same as soon as i make my report get her closer to the heat he told the groom dismounting with care for his bruises the warming shed was heated by a series of iron stoves and on very cold nights the door into the stable would be left open so that the heat would carry out into the attached building get her dry give her a thorough grooming then a hot mash for her supper bless you put two blankets on her and take that tack away it needs a complete overhaul he took the saddlebags from the cantle and threw them over his shoulder mud and all anything else milord the groom asked eyes wide with surprise at his state no vanyel said and dredged up another smile thank you im a little short on manners i think they froze somewhere back about a candlemark ago where are you going yfandes asked as she was being led away to my room long enough to change then to report he told her check with the others and tell me if randis holding audience today would you he is she replied immediately stefs with him good thank you go get some rest you deserve it he found a little more energy somewhere and quickened his steps toward the door so do you but you wont take it she replied with resignation van sent her a tired but warm mental hug he strode out into the snow which was coming down so thickly now that it completely hid the palace from where he stood iii take it love later randis good hours are too rare to waste and i have too much to report he was afraid afraid of what hed find when he saw randale afraid that treven was not going to be able to cope with so many duties thrust on him so young afraid that shavri was going to fall apart at any moment yes and admit it afraid stefs lost interest thats what is really eating at you he shivered and forced himself to walk a little faster as the snow coated him with a purer white than his uniform cloak was capable of showing just now the stableside door opened just before he reached it and someone pulled him inside into warmth and golden light from the oil lamp mounted in the doorframe it took vanyel a moment to recognize him not because tantras had changed but because his numb memory couldnt put name and face together tran he croaked ye gods i doubt id recognize my own mother in this state give me that cloak tantras said briskly unfastening the throatlatch himself delian has been watching for you two for days as soon as he saw how mindnumb you were he called me there the cloak fell from vans shoulders landing in a sodden heap on the floor good there isnt a lot of time to spare randis audiences rarely last more than a candlemark or two even with stef to help come in here he pulled vanyel into a storagechamber there was a small lantern here on a shelf and a set of whites beside it strip and put these on tantras ordered what do you need out of your saddlebags just the dispatch cases vanyel said pulling at the lacings of his tunic with hands that felt twice their normal size i take it that you did all right tantras pulled out the pair of sealed cases and laid them on the shelf where the uniform had been it wasnt easy but yes i got the treaty randi wanted he had to peel his breeches off they were so soaked tran handed him a towel and he dried himself off then wrapped it around his dripping hair before he began pulling on the new set of breeches queen lythiaren gods thats a mouthful has only heard rumors of what we are and what we can do heralds i mean she isnt familiar with mindmagic the very idea that someone could pick up their thoughts and feelings frightens most of the people of rethwellan i spent about as much time undoing rumor as i did at the bargaining table but its over and i must say its a good thing randi sent me because ill tell you the truth i dont think anyone else has the peculiar combination of gifts that would have let them pull it off your reputation doesnt hurt either tran observed wryly vanyel pulled the tunic over his head one of trans and much too loose but that wouldnt matter he began toweling his hair still talking thats true though it almost did more harm than good thats why i got out of there before the passes snowed up i make them all very uneasy and they were very happy to see my back herere your dispatches tran said handing the cases to him as he ran his fingers through his hair to achieve a little order ill take the rest of your stuff back to your room and randi looks like hell so be prepared vanyel took the twin blueleather cases from his friend and hesitated a moment he wanted to say something but wasnt certain what go tran said holding open the door with one hand while he grabbed the lantern with the other you havent got any time to waste just how much worse can randi have gotten in three months he wondered forcing tired legs into a brisk walk the corridors were deserted in fact the entire palace had an air of disuse about it it was disquieting in the extreme especially for someone who remembered these same corridors full of courtiers and servants the way they had been in elspeths time it was as if an evil spirit had made off with all the people leaving the palace empty populated by memories the throne room was mostly empty no sycophants no curious idlers only those who had business with randale hardly more than twenty people all told and all of them so quiet that van clearly heard stef playing up at the front of the room at first van couldnt see randale at all then someone moved to one side and van got his first look at the king in three months with a supreme effort of will he prevented himself from crying out and running to randales side randale had changed drastically since summer it wasnt so much a physical change as something less tangible randale looked frail as fragile as a spunglass ornament there was a quality of transparency about him he could easily have been a tayledras icesculpture the kind they made for their winterfestivals but one of a creature other than a man one of the ethereal plane varrir perhaps that was perhaps the most frightening thing of all randale no longer looked quite human everything that was nonessential had been burned away or discarded in the past three months he held to life by nothing less than sheer will there was something magnificent about him vanyel would never have believed that poor vacillating randi randale who had never wanted to be king could have metamorphosed into this creature of iron spirit and diamond determination hes holding on until treven is ready van thought watching as randale listened carefully to the messenger from the karsite border he wont let go until trev can handle the job but thats all thats keeping him i wonder if he realizes that shavri bent over him and touched his shoulder he raised a colorless hand to cover hers without taking his eyes or his attention away from the messenger vanyel felt the strength flowing from her to him and realized something else shavri was as doomed as randi she had out of love done the one thing no healer ever did shed opened an unrestricted channel between them she was giving him everything she had they would burn out together because she no longer had any way to stop that from happening she knew what shed done she had to which meant that was what she wanted neither of them knows what the other is hiding randi doesnt know the channel shavri opened is unrestricted shavri doesnt know how little randi has left i should tell them but i cant i cant let them keep their secrets they have so little else except love joshel beckoned to van as the messenger bowed in response to something randale said vanyel forced himself to walk briskly to the foot of the throne as if hed just come in from a pleasure ride randale was focused entirely on what came immediately before him too focused to read past any outward seeming of wellbeing if van chose to enforce that kind of illusion which was precisely what vanyel intended to do majesty he said quietly your business with rethwellan is successfully concluded he handed the dispatch tubes to joshel who opened them and handed them to the seneschal here is your treaty my king exactly what you requested i negotiate for mutual defense pact against karse extradition of criminals provision for aid in the event of an attack its all there plus a few more things the queen and i worked out he watched as the seneschal scanned each page and handed it on to randale noted with tired satisfaction the surprised smiles as they came to the clauses he had gotten inserted into the document it was a good treaty fair to both sides the rulers of karse would have a rude awakening when they found out about this particular agreement he was proudest of the fact that he had negotiated the agreement despite having no formal training as a diplomat everything he knew hed picked up from joshel or the seneschal randale knew that and his smile showed that he realized the value of vans accomplishment well done old friend he said in a breathless voice that told van how much each word cost him in effort i couldnt have asked for more i wouldnt have thought to ask for some of the things you got for us im tempted to ask you to give up magecraft in favor of politics oh i think not my liege vanyel said lightly i am far too honest this is one situation where honesty was an asset but thats usually not the case in politics randale laughed a pale little ghost of a chuckle and leaned back into the padded embrace of his throne thank you vanyel im sure the council will want to go over this with you in detail shortly and id appreciate it if youd brief trev on how to handle the queen this was clearly a dismissal and vanyel bowed himself out he left the throne room entirely he couldnt bear to see anything more of what randale had become joshel followed him out into the corridor i know youre exhausted van but we need to convene the privy council on this and the karse situation right away the haggard young herald paused concern for vanyel warring with the needs of the moment and the conflict evident in his expression its all right joshe van told him the council room is warm and thats what i need most right now im cold right down to my marrow can you go there now i can get pages to bring everyone there in next to no time joshes relief was so plain that van wondered what else had gone wrong in his absence certainly he replied provided that no one minds that i look like a drowned cat i doubt theyll mind joshel said weve got other things to worry about these days theyd take you looking like a stablehand covered with muck youre that important frustration and anguish inside vanyel exploded into words important dammit joshe whats the use of all this i can level a building with the power i control but i cant do anything for a friend whos dying in front of my eyes joshel sighed i know i have to keep telling myself that it isnt randi that were working to preserve its valdemar most of the time it doesnt help what good is having power if you cant use it the way it needs to be used vanyel asked his hand clenched into a fist in front of him im vanyel demonsbane and i cant even keep my parents safe in their own home much less keep randi alive joshe just shook his head vanyel could feel the same anguish inside him and unclenched his fist im sorry van i wish i knew some answers for you i should tell you one thing more before the council meeting the heraldic circle met today and were promoting trev to full whites vanyel felt the news like a blow to the stomach to promote treven so young could only mean one thing the king had to be a full herald and the foreseers did not see randale living through the next two years it would ordinarily take treven to make his whites joshe nodded at vanyels expression you know what that means as well as i do he said and turned back to the door to the throne room van walked the few steps down the corridor to the council chamber unlike the rest of the palace this room looked and felt as if it were in use heavy use from the look of all the papers and maps stacked neatly about and the remains of a meal on a tray beside the door here then was where the business of the crown was being transacted and not the throne room evidently audiences were just for those things randale had to handle personally or for edicts that needed to come from the lips of the sovereign in order to have the required impact this treaty obviously was one of those things which was why tran had hustled him into the throne room randale was probably signing it now with what there was of the court as witness which made it binding from this moment on van took his usual seat then slouched down in it and put his feet up on the one beside it if stef hasnt had a change of heart while i was gone i could certainly use a massage he thought wistfully the fire in the fireplace beside him burned steadily and the generous supply of wood beside it argued that it had become normal practice to keep the council chamber ready for use at a moments notice that was in keeping with the rest of vans observations so it meant that the business of the kingdom was being conducted at any and all hours after being told of trevens promotion he wasnt surprised when the door behind him creaked open and treven eased into the room wearing a brandnew set of whites the youngster sat down in the chair beside vanyel with an air of uncertainty as if he didnt know what his welcome would be van watched him through halfclosed eyes for a moment then smiled ease up trev were still friends ive come to the conclusion that you and jisa did the right thing the young man relaxed weve managed to convince randale and shavri too he said though jisa and her mother came awfully close to a real fight over it im still not sure how i kept them from each others throats early training for diplomatic maneuvering i guess he adjusted the fit of his white belt selfconsciously feeling uncomfortable about that van asked gesturing at the white tunic treven nodded i hadnt expected it quite so suddenly i dont feel exactly like ive earned it it feels like a cheat and and i dont like getting it because because the young herald hung his head i understand vanyel said id think less of you if you didnt have doubts trev ill give you my honest opinion if you want it treven grimaced lady bless that sounds like a bitter pill still yes i think so at least id know what to measure myself against vanyel took his feet off the chair and straightened his aching back before facing treven the young mans honest blue eyes met his fearlessly and vanyel felt a moment of satisfaction there werent many people who could meet his gaze i think you were rushed into this trev and we both know why no i dont think youre ready quite i think you will be when you have to be if you dont let that uniform fool you into thinking the whites make the herald treven looked disappointed and vanyel knew hed been hoping to be told despite vans warning that this would be an honest opinion that he really was ready to be called a full herald in some ways treven was a boy still and that had something to do with what van had told him he had a boys optimism and a boys belief in the essential fairness of the universe this wouldnt have been a problem in an ordinary herald but neither belief had any place in the thinking of a monarch a king never assumed anything was fair a ruler must always expect the worst and plan for it treven would learn as randale had learned as jisa had learned as if his thought had summoned her vanyel felt jisas presence before she entered the little mindtomind brush that was the mindspeakers equivalent of a knock hello love he replied holding on as well as i can she replied you saw so she hadnt missed what her mother had done binding herself to her lifebondeds fate and she wasnt blinded to randales condition by her love of him there was resignation in her mindvoice and a sadness as profound as if her parents were already gone theyve closed me out she said in answer to the questions he couldnt bring himself to ask theyve closed everyone out except each other most of the time i could be a thousand miles away for all they notice im there well i notice youre here come on in the door behind him creaked again and treven looked up and smiled vanyel started to get up but jisa pushed him back down into his chair with her hands on his shoulders no you dont uncle van theres enough healer in me to know how tired you are she kissed him on the top of his head and sent treven doesnt know father i dont see any reason why he has to thank you dearheart i wont deny youre right are you part of the council now too she sat down beside treven both of us im here as mothers proxy i have been ever since late fall and doing very well at it too jisa had left the door open and the rest of the council filed in taking their usual seats the seneschal had said that last and he stopped on the way to his seat at the head of the table pausing with his hands on the back of jisas chair his inflection told vanyel he meant the compliment there was nothing paternalistic or condescending in his voice i frankly dont know what we would have done without her earlier this fall we had a situation with someone who claimed to be a highranking karsite refugee we suspected his motives but he was shielded against casual thoughtsensing and we didnt want to tip our hands by probing him we badly needed someone whose gift was empathy but mother was exhausted and in any case wouldnt leave father jisa said matteroffactly so i went he was a spy for the prophet sent to see if we were giving aid to their mages its hard to mistake fanatic devotion for anything else that was when we put her on the council the seneschal said taking his seat and that brings us around to the karsite situation the situation so seneschal arved told them was stalemate the followers of the prophet had won and were consolidating their victory as yet they had shown no signs of resuming the war the previous regime had begun but they had also been probing to see if valdemar had been aiding mages or were offering aid to those who continued to evade the witchfinders theyre just looking for an excuse to start things up again when theyre ready said the representative for the south lord taving with a sour grimace im inclined to agree vanyels father replied you know what they say nothing comes out of karse but brigands and bad weather whether they say their cause is for their god or for their greed the karsites always have been robbers and always will be lord taving looked gratified to find someone who shared his basic feelings toward karse the only problem is were still in no shape to fight a war he said or at least thats my understanding you are correct my lord the lord marshal said thanks to vanyels suggestions we havent had to resort to conscription but our new guards are still green as new leaves and if faced with troops of seasoned fanatics they wouldnt stand a chance and why arent they ready asked guildmaster jumay zado knows we pay enough in taxes largely because weve already lost more men to this war with karse than in the whole of elspeths reign the lord marshal shot back heatedly which is why the treaty vanyel brought back from rethwellan is vital the seneschal said pouncing on the opportunity to introduce the subject the rest of the councillors who had not been at the audiences reacted according to their natures lord taving was not inclined to trust anything south of valdemars border withen wanted to know where the catch was the lord marshal heaved an audible sigh of relief until he realized the thing included a mutual assistance pact vanyel explained the details of the treaty at length until his head ached pointing out the ones randale had requested and the ones he had gotten inserted they finally agreed that it was an excellent treaty as it stood which was just as well since randale had already signed it when they finally let him go it was clear that they were already preparing for randales death and a period in which treven would be just one of the council when it came to decisionmaking which was a good idea but it brought home the fact that randis days were numbered and probably less than a year he returned to his room very depressed and paused outside the door for a moment to think where stefen might be then the door opened under his hand im glad youre back stef said simply and took his hand to pull him inside fourteen stefen had been waiting for van ever since the audience session ended hed come straight to vanyels room once randale had been put to bed hed had a page bring food and wine and had gotten everything set up exactly like the supper hed had with vanyel the first night the herald had brought him to this room except tonight he expected the end of the evening to be somewhat different hed known van was expected back at any time but no one had been able to tell him exactly when the herald would arrive so hed been as nervous and excited as a kid waiting for festival for the past week when van had made his presentation at the audiences even though hed been in trance stef had known he was there he had thought his heart was going to pound itself to pieces with joy to stay in trance until randale had no further need of him had been the hardest thing stefen had ever done im glad youre back stefen said simply letting his voice tell vanyel exactly how glad he really was ive missed you he reached behind vanyel and closed the door ive missed you vanyel said then unexpectedly pulled the bard into his arms for an embrace with more of desperation in it than passion stef just held him not entirely sure what had prompted the action but ready to give vanyel whatever he needed behind him the fire crackled and popped punctuating the silence finally van let him go i was afraid once i was gone youd find someone who suited you better he said hoarsely weve lifebonded stef reminded him pulling the herald into the room and getting him to sit in the chair nearest the fireplace how could i find anybody who suited me better than that thats not something that goes away just because theres some distance between us vanyel laughed weakly i know i was being stupid its just that in the middle of the night when youre leagues and leagues away from me its hard to see why youd choose to stay with me stefen reached for the food since van was ignoring it and poured some wine for him youre still being stupid stef said and put bread and cheese in one hand and a mug of hot mulled wine in the other eat relax i love you there see everythings all right he sat in the chair opposite vanyel and glared at him until he took a bite i wish it could be that simple vanyel sighed but he smiled a little when he said it he ate what stef gave him then sipped at his wine watching stefen his strange silver eyes gone dark and thoughtful i have a surprise for you stef said unable to bear the silence anymore he got up went to the desk and took out the box hed put there earlier i left it here in case you came back to your room before i got done here he thrust it into vanyels hands and waited hardly breathing for the herald to open it vanyel turned the catch on the simple wooden box saying as he did so you didnt have to do this you dont have to give me things stef the lid came open and he saw what nestled in the velvet and his mouth opened in a soundless oh he took it out his hands trembling a little hed told stef once or twice that he was hampered in his magecraft by not having a good focusstone the mineral he worked best with was amber which wasnt particularly rare but he had a problem similar to his aunt savils for magework the clearer and less flawed the stone the better it focused power and amber rarely appeared totally clear and without inclusions when it did it was expensive since the loss of his first focusstone a few years ago van had never again found a piece even in the raw state that was flawless and large enough to be of use flaws in a stone could make it disintegrate or even explode when stressed by magic energies so like savil vanyel had to do most of the work that required a focus through his secondary stone an eggshaped piece of tigereye stefens present was a faceted halfglobe of completely flawless waterclear dark goldred amber set in a thin silver band with a loop at the top so that it could be worn as a pendant hed begged a silver chain of jisa just so that van could wear it immediately jisa had given one to him without asking why but when hed told her shed been as pleased as if the gift had been for her stefen van said in a strange strained voice you have to tell me where and more importantly how did you get this i didnt steal it stef exclaimed stung i didnt think you did love but theres no ordinary way you could afford something like this and we both know it vanyel put the pendant back in the box and closed it i cant in good conscience wear this until i know he thinks i sold my bedtime for it stef thought suddenly oh gods i have to put him right i met this gemmerchant he said quickly he was giving some of the ladies i was playing for a private showing amber pearls and coral really unusual things but he says hes been all over the world at one time or another anyway he had this and i saw it and he saw me looking at it he told me it would be useless to me that it was made to be a magefocus well we got to talking and i told him i wanted it for you even though i knew i couldnt afford it he remembered what the merchant had told him too what a bard like you gods my friend in my country youd have been showered with baubles like this a thousand times over a gift such as yours is rarer than all my collection put together then the merchants face had grown thoughtful on the other hand perhaps we could do each other a service so anyway he offered to give me the stone if id do him a favor he had some more private showings planned at the house hed rented for fellow gemmerchants he said they were a lot harder to convince than pretty ladies and he wanted me to play for them he faltered for vanyel was looking at him in a way that made him feel as if he had sold himself he didnt ask me to do anything like make them buy things just to put them in a pleasant mood make them feel good and allow him to drop the fact that i was the kings bard to impress them that was all i didnt do anything wrong vanyel was still looking at him doubtfully did i he asked in a very small voice the herald weighed the box in his hand stefen felt worse with every passing moment hed intended this to be a loveoffering and instead the thing had turned into a viper and bitten them both finally van opened the box and took the amber out stef heaved a sigh of relief vanyel stared at the beautiful thing and shook his head you didnt do anything wrong but only by accident and the fact that i dont think your friend wanted you to get into trouble he said in a low voice you came so close to misuse of your powers that i shudder to think about it you must never use your gift to manipulate people except at the orders of the crown stef you can be stripped of it if you do and its wrong stef its just plain wrong what if this man had been unscrupulous and had been trying to sell trash and what if hed actually asked you to influence people to buy what if hed drastically overpriced his wares and asked you to make them think he was giving them a bargain what if hed brought in those who couldnt afford his merchandise and told you to make them want it enough to buy it no matter what stop stef cried horribly ashamed of himself now he almost wished he had sold himself it seemed more honest stef vanyel caught his hand and drew him down beside his chair stef i didnt want to make you feel bad you didnt do any of those things you didnt misuse your powers but it was a very near thing you can thank that merchant for being an honest fellow and not leading you into temptation stefen vowed silently to think about what he was being asked to do before he did it and he marveled a little at this change in himself a year ago he would have done any of those things and never considered them wrong van he said quietly being with you youve shown me that its as wrong to play with peoples minds and emotions as it is to steal he hesitated a moment then added in a way it is stealing from them its stealing their right to think and feel at their own will i wouldnt have understood that before i met you but i do now vanyel relaxed completely and closed his hand around the amber halfglobe then i can wear this stef and i will gladly and ill use it knowing it was a gift of love and honor he bowed his head and chuckled i suppose that sounds rather pretentious and pompous like something out of a ballad but its how i really feel stef if you thought any differently you wouldnt be vanyel stef replied flushing happily as van pulled the chain over his head and laid his right hand on stefs shoulder you give me too much credit lover vanyel said quietly im as prone to being a fool as anyone else and just now im a very sore fool could i possibly get you to use those talented hands of yours to unknot my shoulders and give me a chance to have my hands on you stef grinned of course you could and i will gladly vanyel finished off his wine in a single gulp peeled off his tunic kicked off his boots and sagged back into his chair stefen got up and moved around behind him and began kneading his shoulders with steady firm pressure whats wrong van he asked you just got back with everything the king asked you for and more sometimes i feel like everything ive done is useless vanyel said dispiritedly randi is going to be dead before the years out every enemy valdemar has will take that as a signal to strike while treven is so young and a good half the treaties we made will fall apart because they were made with randale and not trev karse is likely to declare holy war on us any day the west is full of halfmad mageborn any one of whom might be another krebain but with wider plans i have a personal enemy out there somewhere i dont know who or why only that he she or it is a mage stefen dug his thumbs into vanyels shoulders a little harder and tried to think of things to say that would make a difference randale is the mind behind the crown but about half of the work is being done by trev and the council he offered trevs bright especially on shortterm planning and randales doing longrange planning that ought to hold good for the next five years trevs a little too idealistic maybe but hell get that knocked out of him soon enough and jisa is practical enough for two theyll be all right how do you know so much about this vanyel asked suddenly after a long silence im right there whenever randale is working and im beginning to be able to listen to whats going on while im in trance stefen was rather proud of that it wasnt much compared with the kinds of things vanyel could do but it was more than hed been able to manage before vans trip thats pretty impressive vanyel told him without even a trace of patronization bards usually dont have a gift that requires being in trance and im surprised you learned how to manage that on your own what about jisa and trev i spent a lot of time with them after youd gone stef replied working on vans neck flexing and stroking as though he were playing an instrument the muscles were very stiff so tight they were like rope under tension and stef had no doubt they were giving van a headache of monumental proportions with jisa especially the seneschal is the only one who doesnt underestimate her and he likes it that way a very wise lady vanyel said his voice a little muffled did you know shes my daughter and not randis it should have been a shock somehow it wasnt no but it makes sense shes very like you you know he thought about the situation for a moment obviously randale must know i mean a healer like shavri can prevent any pregnancy she cares to so it wasnt an accident which means she wanted jisa shavri was desperate for a child and the two of them asked me to help ive never told anyone but you not even my parents van replied i have three other children but the only one i ever see is brightstar the boy starwind and moondance are raising the others are a magegifted girl one of the other tayledras has named featherfire and a girl two of lissas retired shaych guards are raising who has no gifts at all so far as i can tell stefen wasnt sure how he should be feeling about these revelations why he asked finally i mean why did you do it i can see why shavri would have asked you rather than somebody else but why the others vanyel sighed and flexed his shoulders for pretty much the same reasons as shavri had people i knew and cared for wanted a child but for one reason or another couldnt produce one without outside help featherfires mother isnt shaych but there wasnt a single tayledras male she felt the right way about to have a child with she had twins brightstar is feathers brother stef recalled all the fantasies hed had about his parentage how hed never known who even his mother was do you ever wish youd i dont know had more of a hand in their raising he worked his thumbs into the nape of vanyels neck with the silky hair covering both hands i know theyve got parents who really want them but thats just it they have parents who really want them van replied ah thats it thats the worst of the aches right there i see what fandes means about musicians having talented hands really love the only reason brightstar and jisa know im their father is that its necessary for them to know brightstar evidently has all my gifts jisa could get backwash from a magical attack on me because she has magegift in potential they have to be prepared featherfire is so like her mother they could be twins and arven doesnt even carry potential as far as i was able to check they all know who their real parents are the ones who love them he chuckled then whats funny stef asked oh just that whatever it is that makes someone shaych it probably isnt learned or inherited brightstar has a half dozen young ladies of the tayledras with whom he trades feathers on a regular basis and hed probably have more if he had the stamina trades feathers stef said with puzzlement tayledras custom when you want to make love to someone you offer them a feather if you want a more permanent relationship its a feather from your bondbird oh that gave his fertile imagination something to work on and feathers were easier come by in the dead of winter than say flowers van was finally relaxing under his hands in fact from the way his head kept nodding the herald was barely awake which meant stef could probably coax him into bed without too much trouble of course he may not get much sleep stefen sighed contentedly and slowly ran his fingers through vanyels hair grateful just for his lovers presence van relaxed for the first time in three months and gave himself over completely to the gentle strength of stefs callused hands stef felt the cold more than most he was so thin it went straight to his bones so hed built the fire up to the point where he was comfortable that meant that even without his tunic van basked in drowsy warmth the magefocus glowed just above his heart touching him with a different sort of warmth that piece of amber was truly extraordinary it might have been made for him fitting into his cupped hand perfectly meshing with his powerpatterns and channeling them with next to no effort on his part given how things had worked out perhaps it had been in the same way that the rosequartz crystal hed given savil years ago had seemingly been made for her though it had been given to him hed told stef the truth though if the bard had bought the thing with dishonorable coin he couldnt have worn it if stef had failed to realize why that kind of perversion of his gift was wrong vanyel would have had misgivings every time he put it on stef had changed though van had never tried to change him hed become a partner someone van could rely on despite his youth and because hes my partner he had to know about jisa and the others partners shouldnt have secrets from one another that information could be important some day its good to be able to tell someoneespecially him it was so easy to relax letting all his responsibilities slide away for a moment he felt himself drifting off into a halfdoze and didnt even try to stop himself pain he didnt realize that hed jumped to his feet until he found himself staring at stef from halfway across the room he blinked and in that instant between one breath and the next knew kilchas that pain was heraldmage kilchas and he was dying or being killed suddenly violently an unexpected side effect of the new web unless someone was magically cut out of the web every herald would know when another herald died as the companions already knew and as vanyel knew that something was wrong the death bell began tolling and he grabbed his tunic from the back of the chair beside the one hed been sitting in pulling it on hastily over his head something was wrong something to do with kilchas and he was the only one who might be able to see what it was but he had to get there stef fell back a step startled van what did i the death bell tolled drowning out the rest of his words stef had been at haven long enough to know what that meant but hed never seen a herald react to it the way vanyel had and hed never heard of a herald who had reacted before the tolling of the bell van he said and the herald stared at him as if hed never seen him before van he said again which seemed to break vanyel out of whatever trance hed gotten stuck in vanyel grabbed his uniform tunic and began pulling it on over his head van stef protested its the death bell theres nothing you can do and even if there were you just got back youre tired and youve earned a rest let somebody else take care of it van shook his head stubbornly and bent down to reach for his boots i have to go i dont know why but i have to stefen sighed and got both their cloaks his that had been draped on a hook behind the door and vanyels spare from the wardrobe as soon as the herald straightened up from pulling his boots on stef handed him the white cloak and swung his own scarlet over his shoulders vanyel paused hands on the throatlatch of his garment where are you going he asked in a startled voice stefen shrugged with you if youre going to run off the first night youre home at least i can be with you but stef vanyel protested you dont have to i know he interrupted thats one reason why im doing it anyway lover he held the door open for the herald and waved him through it come on lets get going someone had already beaten vanyel to the scene there were lights and moving shadows at the base of one of the two flattopped towers at the end of heralds wing the storm had blown off some time after vanyel got in the sky was perfectly clear and the night windless and much colder than when hed arrived the slush had hardened into icy ridges that he and stef slipped and stumbled over to get to the deathscene kilchas lay facedown on the hardened snow one arm twisted beneath him head at an unnatural angle he was dressed in a shabby old tunic and soft breeches with felt houseshoes treven cloak wrapped tightly around him knelt beside the body a very young blond guardsman stood next to him holding a lantern that shook as the hand that held it trembled there was this kind of cry he was saying as van stumbled within hearing distance i looked up at the tower and he was falling limplike like somebodyd thrown a rag doll over i ran to to catch him to try to help but he was the young man shuddered and gulped so i came to get help my lord which was when you bowled me over in the corridor treven said coolly touching the bodys shoulder with care you can go get me a healer but i think hell just confirm that the poor old man died of a broken neck and smashed skull though the young heir spoke with every sign of complete composure van felt him shaking inside this was trevs first closeup look at the violent death of a fellow human and all his calm was pretense not that it ever got easier emotionally with time and repetition it was just easier to be calm about taking care of it trev vanyel touched the young mans shoulder at the same time as he spoke trev and the guardsman both jumped the lantern swung wildly in the guardsmans hand making the shadows jerk and dance and making the body appear to move for an instant trev ill take it from here if you want but i think youve got things well in hand his first impulse had been to take over this after all was not the first time hed seen death near at hand it was not even the first time hed seen the death of someone he knew and cared for no that had happened so often hed given up counting the times but taking over from trev would have meant shoving the young heir into the position of hangeron when what he needed to do was start assuming his authority the sooner he started doing so the more readily others would accept that authority when randi died so even if the young heir didnt have any experience in handling situations like this trev should be the one in charge treven took a deep breath and looked very much as if he wanted to hand that authority right back to van but instead he said only this really isnt my area of expertise herald vanyel would you mind having a look here van nodded beside him stef shivered and pulled his cloak a little tighter vanyel knelt down beside the whitefaced heir and examined the body without visible sign of emotion though he wanted to weep for the poor old man the neck is broken and the front of the skull as well he said quietly he looked up though all he could see of the top of the tower was the dark shape of it against the sky kilchas has an observatory up on the top of this tower he told treven did he say anything about going up there tonight another pair of heralds had joined them tantras and lissandra lissandra huddled in on herself as though she was too cold for her cloak to warm her oh gods the woman said brokenly yes he told me that he was going up there if it cleared at all tonight phryny was conjuncting aberdenes eye or some such thing only happens once in a hundred years and he wanted to see it he was so excited when it cleared up at sunset she sobbed and turned away hiding her face on trans shoulder he folded his cloak around her and looked down at the three kneeling in the snow poor old man tantras said hoarsely he must have gotten so wrapped up in what he was doing that he forgot to watch his step therere probably ice patches all over the top of that tower trev replied and the parapet is only kneehigh its only enough to warn you that youre at the edge not save you from falling he stood up folding dignity around himself like a new cloak that was overlarge stiff and a trifle awkward guard would you please see that kilchas body is taken to the chapel ill inform joshel and have him see to whats needed from there the guardsman stood up saluted and trudged toward the guard quarters leaving the lantern behind before too long his dark blue uniform had been absorbed into the night treven turned to vanyel thank you herald vanyel if tantras and lissandra dont mind ill have them stay with me to get things taken care of youve just come in from a long journey and you should get some rest he coughed uncomfortably as if he wasnt sure what to say or do next vanyel started to object but realized that he didnt have any grounds for objection it looked like an accident everyone else accepted it as an accident but van didnt couldnt believe that it was nevertheless all he had to go on were vague and illdefined feelings nothing even concrete enough for a herald to accept so he thanked treven to stefens quite open relief and returned across the crusted snow to the warmth and light of the heralds wing he was at the door when yfandes mindtouched him van she said sounding troubled weve found kilchas companion rohan hes dead he was off in the far western comer of the field and he prompted her and i dont like it theres no sign of anything wrong but i dont like it we just dont fall over like that unless we die in battle or by accident were called and we generally have time to say goodbye to our friends before we go could the shock of his chosen dying like that have killed rohan van asked may be she replied reluctantly most of the others think thats what did it but youre not convinced it was kind of comforting that she shared his doubts im not convinced it doesnt feel right i cant pinpoint why but it doesnt van are you going to stand there all night stef asked holding the door open and shivering visibly sorry ashke vanyel said giving himself a little mental kick i was talking to fandes the others found kilchas companion dead she says it doesnt feel right to her the heat of the corridor hit him and made him want to lie down right then and there he fought the urge and the attendant weakness stefen looked at him with puzzlement i thought that companions never outlived their chosen he said and vice versa so whats wrong fandes just doesnt like the way it seems to have happened rohan was off by himself in the farthest corner of the field and none of the others knew he was gone until they found him stefen looked disturbed thats not the way things are supposed to happen he replied slowly at least not the way i understand them i think youre both right theres at least something odd about this van reached the door of his room first and held it open for the bard it may just be the new webspell he said as he closed the door behind them took off his cloak and flung it into a chair its supposed to bind us all together some of that may be spilling over in unexpected ways like onto our companions stefen draped his own cloak on top of vanyels here he offered let me help you out of that tunic and go lie down we can talk about this while i give you a better massage than the one that was interrupted ill play opposition and try to find logical explanations for everything you find wrong stef im absolutely exhausted vanyel warned unlacing his tunic and allowing stef to pull it off if you really get me relaxed ill probably fall asleep in the middle of it and once i do you wouldnt be able to wake me with an earthquake if thats what you need then thats what you should do the bard replied pushing him a little so that he sat down or rather collapsed onto the bed meanwhile let me get the knots out of you while we talk about this why dont you pull fandes into this too if shes worried you probably should anyway and she may find holes in my arguments fandes van called here want to listen in on this were going to try and see if im just overreacting to kilchas death because of exhaustion neatly put and that could be my problem too go ahead ill be listening she sounded relieved vanyel yielded to stefs wishes and sprawled facedown on the bed stefen straddled him and reached into the top drawer of the little bedside table what vanyel began turning his head to look then when stefen pulled out a little bottle of what was obviously scented oil asked in surprise how did that get in there i put it there stef said shortly get your head back down and relax in a few moments his warm hands were slowly working their way upward along vans spine starting from the small of his back vanyel sighed and gave himself up to it now what doesnt fit in the way kilchas died stef asked and dont you start tensing up on me you can think and stay relaxed kilchas has a little enclosure up there van said thinking things through slowly the roof is glass if he doesnt want to he doesnt have to go out in the cold i cant see why he would have been outside and he certainly wasnt dressed for the cold what if the glass was covered with snow or ice stef countered it probably was you know i agree yfandes said reluctantly everything else was good point but why was he wearing slippers rather than boots stefen rolled his knuckles along either side of vanyels spine while he thought because he didnt know the glass was going to be iced over until hed already climbed the stairs to the roof and it was too far for him to climb down and back up again just for his boots he was an old man after all and his quarters are down here on the ground floor van gasped as stef hit a particularly sore spot all right i can accept that too but hes had that observatory for years he always knows knew exactly where he is up there why should he suddenly misstep now because he didnt stef answered immediately he was doing something hed never had to do before he was cleaning the glass on the roof of his little shelter trying to chip the ice off he lost his balance or he slipped that sounds just like kilchas stubborn old goat vanyel tried not to tense as stef hit another bad knot and began working it out why not get a servant to do it he asked no time stef hazarded as the fire in the fireplace cracked and popped this thing he was going to be watchingit would have been about to happen and he figured if he had to find a servant then wait for him to do the job hed miss part of what he wanted to see either that or he was sure a servant wouldnt do it right or both that sounds like kilchas too the air filled with the gentle scent of sendlewood vanyel felt sleep trying to overcome him and fought it off if he just fell he said slowly why when i felt him die did i only feel pain why didnt i feel him fall i dont know stef said pausing with his hand just over vans shoulderblades i dont know how these gifts of yours are supposed to work but kilchas was an old man van what if he was already dead when he fell what if his heart gave out on him thats pretty painful i guess and if his heart suddenly gave out couldnt that cause his companions to do the same maybe thats why he was found the way he was vanyel closed his eyes suddenly too tired to try to find something wrong with what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary situation youre probably right he said fandes do you agree quite reasonable she said wearily thats very typical of heartfailure the shock goes straight to us too and kilchas rohan was as old as he was thats a much more logical explanation than foul play its just that so few of you live long enough these days for your hearts to fail that i forgot that i think we may be overreacting because were tired and were so used to treachery and ambush that we ignore other answers love fandes agrees with you he began the stef started something that had nothing to do with a therapeutic massage and he murmured a little exclamation of surprise have we disposed of the topic ashke stef asked breathing the words into his ear his chest pressed against vanyels back i think yfandes said tactfully that its time for me to get some sleep good night dearheart good night love he replied then his attention was taken elsewhere and it was quite a while before either he or stefen actually slept fifteen vanyel forgot all about his misgivings in the weeks that followed his time was devoured by council meetings audience sessions where he and treven stood as proxies for randale and longdistance spellcasting desperation at being unable to be two places at once had led him to discover that he could work magic through a herald without the magegift provided that the herald in question was both a thoughtsenser and carried magegift in potential he immersed himself in the nodes so often he began to feel very much akin to the tayledras he often returned to his room at night long past the hour when sane folk retired when he did so he found stef invariably curled up sleepily next to the fire light from the flames making a red glow in his hair for he refused to take his own rest until van returned the bards patient care was the one constant in his life besides yfandes and as fall deepened into winter he came to rely more and more on both of them just to keep a hold on sanity and optimism in a world increasingly devoid of both karse had declared holy war on the evil mages of valdemar though as yet they had done nothing about it the agents both the lord marshal and the seneschal had in place reported that the prophetking as he styled himself had his hands full with rooting out heresy in his own land but no one was under any delusions the consensus was that as soon as the followers of the sun lord needed an outside enemy to unify what was left of the populace there would be an army of fanatics hammering the southern border that would only add to the bandits who had taken over the buffer zone between the two countries motley bands of brigands who had escaped or been turned loose during the revolution those who had been accused of magery and fled their homes but had declined to cross the border and opportunists who preyed on both sides at least there wont be any mages in the prophets pay the seneschal said as they all leaned over the maps and tried to find weak points in their defenses maybe the archpriest replied dubiously his tour of the south had garnered mixed results on the whole he was happy with the outcome for his presence had kept any overt activities to a minimum the net result however was that there were no enclaves of the sun lord in valdemar any more roughly half of the devotees had been so revolted by the fatherhouses actions that they had converted to some other way the rest had decamped across the border to karse to join their fellows the holdings themselves had gone to those who had remained behind thus staying in the hands of those who had remained loyal to valdemar supposedly loyal at any rate both the seneschal and the archpriest were keeping a wary eye on them in case some of these conversions were intended as a ruse to cover later subversion that there were spies planted in the midst of these enclaves was a given what do you mean maybe asked the seneschal hand poised above a marker representing a guard detachment whats the difference between a miracle and a magic spell the archpriest asked looking from arved to van and back again a miracle comes from the gods magic comes from a mage the seneschal replied impatiently thats purely subjective the archpriest pointed out to the layman there is no discernible difference the prophet can easily have mages within his own ranks claim their powers are from the sun lord and be completely within strict doctrinal boundaries damn youre right the lord marshal said softly i wonder how many he does have theres no way of knowing vanyel replied as they all turned to look at him i dont think he has anyone a herald couldnt counter though my operatives arent reporting any miracles other than healing and the odd illusion not even when the prophets children are trying to capture mages the powerful mages in the pay and employ of the karsite crown were all known as such and have either been killed or fled the country thats not to say that the magegifted wont end up in the sun lords priesthood in the future id virtually guarantee that but they wont get effective training because there wont be anyone experienced enough to train them thoroughly and they probably wont be permitted to use their gift combatively why not the archpriest asked van smiled thinly and fingered a marker representing an agent because if they learn what they can do whats to stop them from declaring themselves the chosen of the god and doing exactly what the prophet did only with more success because they have miracles to prove their power the archpriest mused his eyes halfclosed interesting speculation its fortunate that you are on our side vanyel van bowed with intended irony a herald tends to be altogether too well acquainted with the ways of treachery for anyones comfort including his own my lord he said one could say that it is part of the job to know and not use the archpriests smile was genuine and his eyes warmed with it i am aware of that my son i think that most of you would have been comfortable within the ranks of the clergy had there been no companions to choose you most vanyel chuckled knowing the archpriest was blissfully unaware of his relationship with stefen some maybe but i assure you my lord not all by no means all we are far too worldly for most orders to ever accept us he would have said more but suddenly his eyes burned a giant hand closed itself around his chest as his lungs caught fire he tried to breathe and only increased the pain his heart spasmed once twicethen exploded he found himself sprawled facedown over the table the rest of the councillors his father among them frantically trying to revive him he stared at the lines of the map just under his nose unable to remember what they were vanyel he was very cold and his chest hurt turn him over you fools he cant breathe he blinked as the shadows danced around him trying to recall exactly whereand whohe was van yfandes said weakly making a confusion of voices inside his head and out are you all right whats wrong what happened has he ever had a spell like this before he stirred dazed the mappaper under him crackling the council meeting i was in the council meeting van a little more urgent fandes give me a moment what he gasped he tried to push himself away from the table but his arms were too weak and trembling and he was too dazed to even think of what to do someone two someonesgrabbed his arms one on either side and pulled him up trev and joshel they lowered him into a chair just as the death bell began tolling lissandra he knew it even as the other two looked at each other over his head and spoke the name simultaneously you go treven told joshel find out what happened he shook vanyels shoulder gently is that what you felt is that what happened to you just now vanyel nodded and schooled himself to reply i yes something very painful very sudden like what happened with kilchas only worse he shuddered i dont understand why am i feeling them die why is this happening to me and no one else maybe because you set the spell treven hazarded the rest of us know what happens after the fact but you feel it at the time or maybe its happening just because the two of them were in the original web with you or because theyre close by physically we havent had any herald deaths at haven but kilchas and lissandra i suppose he put his head down on his knees still dizzy a lot of good im going to be if i black out every time a herald dies he was still in too much quasiphysical pain and too much in shock to feel the emotional impact of the other heraldmages death fandes what about her companion were looking yfandes said shortly shonsea dropped out of our minds just as you felt lissandra die are you going to be all right i think soi we found her yfandes interrupted the northern end of the field it looks as though she was running and fell and broke her neck vanyel sighed and closed his eyes if she felt what i did im not surprised it came as enough of a shock to make her fall something horrendous happened whatever it was his head throbbed with aftershock and it was increasingly hard to think he raised his head with an effort when joshel came back into the council chamber coughing it looks like she had an accident with her alchemical apparatus joshe said when we got to her chamber it was full of fumes of some kind we had to open a window to clear them out look he held up a glass jar it was frosted on the outside thats what those fumes did closest to the spill ate into things we found a container of some kind over a small firepot had broken that was where the fumes were coming from all we can guess is that it cracked and spilled the stuff into the fire and lissandra breathed in a fatal dose before she could get the window open it felt like my lungs were on fire vanyel said i couldnt breathe and my eyes were burning she might not even have been able to see to get the window open joshe continued as corrosive as those fumes were she must have been nearly blind we found her halfway between her workbench and the door lissandra should have known better than to work with something that dangerous in her chamber vanyel thought vaguely what on earth possessed her to do such a thing the stillroom at healers collegium has adequate ventilation against accidents and she hasnt got any secrets from the healers but his head was pounding and he couldnt seem to get any further than that i need to get something for my head he said thickly getting to his feet treven looked at him in concern this hit you awfully hard he said i know youve been overworking do you want to take this session up later he shook his head no he replied we havent the time to spare you have audiences right after this then randi has a private audience session with the rethwellan ambassador ill be all right treven smiled weakly you always are he said with gratitude i dont know what wed do without you some day youll have to do without me van reminded him grimly im not immortal well lets get on with this my operatives say the next move will be for karse to declare holy war on rethwellan too trusting that the mountains will keep the queen from coming at them the more fools they the lord marshal replied heres what shes pledged us if they make a move like that the fire in savils room hissed and popped at them and the lateafternoon sun shone weakly down on the gardens outside the window van sat back in his chair and tried not to look as if he were tired of hearing his aunts plaints i dont like it savil said fretfully first kilchas then lissandra both of them heraldmages its no accident what else could it be vanyel asked reasonably nibbing one of his shoulders he was still stiff and sore from his fit this afternoon weve been all over that no one found anything out of the ordinary no signs of tampering magical or otherwise just the result of miscalculation a coal fell down to the grate and a shower of sparks followed it i still dont like it she replied stubbornly shaking her head what if the tampering wasnt with their equipment but with them their minds or their bodies a healer could easily have stopped kilchas heart a mindhealer could have made lissandra think she was putting something harmless on the fire youd never detect that kind of tampering shes getting old he thought sadly shes getting old and frightened of everything in her oversized overstuffed chair she looked thinner and terribly frail there were lines in her face that had never been there until this winter it seemed that like the tayledras she was failing all at once shes aged more in the last six months than in the last six years savil love why would a healer do something like that he asked it just isnt logical you dont have to be a healer to have healing gifts she countered you have them so do i moondance is a healing adept it could be a rogue mage with the gift a kind of antihealer great good gods now shes inventing enemies whoever heard of anything like that all right then he replied patiently who weve no indication that anyone is using mages against valdemar right now she frowned what about the one that nearly killed you theres no sign of that kind of magical attack in either kilchas death or lissandras he reminded her and the attempt on me was not directed at valdemar i think that must have been a purely personal vendetta and nothing more ive made a lot of enemies in the last few years and its all too likely to have been one of them van she said unhappily im worried i think its stretching coincidence first the incident with you then kilchas is killed then lissandra please listen to me vanyel sighed ill tell you what aunt savil if itll make you feel more confident ill strengthen your wards but i dont think they need it youre an eminently capable mage as you very well know youre my superior at ritual magics kilchas was very old and inclined to try and do things he shouldnt because he was stubborn lissandra worked with very dangerous substances all the time the odds just caught up with both of them savil scowled at him and the fire hissed as if it felt her anger vanyel ashkevron youre being more than usually dense if i were ten years younger abruptly she deflated and shrank back down into her chair but im not she said sadly im older than kilchas and just as vulnerable im holding you to your promise van strengthen my wards ill take any help i can get because i believe i will be the next target and i cant get anyone else to agree with me not even you vanyel stood up feeling guilty savil i dont blame you for overreacting you knew both of the others better than i did ill be happy to strengthen your wards as soon as i get a moment free and im absolutely certain that in a few more weeks well be laughing about this i hope so savil said unhappily as he moved toward the door i truly hope so he stifled a surge of annoyance and bade her good night as affectionately as he could manage it wouldnt cost him more than a candlemark and a little energy to strengthen her wards and if it made her less paranoid it was worth it he closed the door behind himself and literally ran into stefen in the hall outside i hope youre through for the day the bard said in a weary voice as he caught vanyels arm because i certainly am its my turn to need a backrub the rethwellan ambassador wouldnt talk unless i was out of the room and randale couldnt sit up unless i was in the room so they compromised by sticking me in a closet vanyel chuckled tiredly and put his arm around stefens shoulders nobody has me scheduled for anything more and im not inclined to let them know im free lets go ill give you that backrub more than a backrub i hope stef said shyly i think i might be able to manage that vanyel said into the bards ear good stef said ill hold you to that later much later as vanyel drifted off to sleep he remembered what he had promised savil oh well he thought drowsily i can take care of it tomorrow its not that urgent and i didnt promise exactly when id do it just that i would when i got some free time the fire had burned down to coals with a few flames flickering now and again above them and stef was already asleep his head resting on vanyels shoulder it was the first moment of peace together theyd had since returning from forst reach the first entire evening theyd been able to spend together without either of them being utterly exhausted or worried about something and it was the first evening van hadnt had to spend in the nodes drawing energy for later use or channeling it elsewhere he stroked stefs silky fine hair and the bard murmured a little in his sleep im not going to spoil it now it can wait until morning he watched the fire through halfclosed eyes listening to stef breathe and waited for sleep to take him then the peace of the evening shattered vanyel he was out of bed and grabbing his clothes before stef woke van savils cry was cut off abruptly and vanyel doubled up and fell to the floor pain knives of fire slicing him from neck to crotch lungs aching for air teeth fastening in his throat then nothing he found himself gasping for breath curled in a fetal position on the floor stefen staring at him from the bed with his eyes wide with fear it had felt like an eternity yet it had taken only a few heartbeats from the moment savil called him until now savil he grabbed his robe from the floor beside him where he had dropped it and struggled to his feet pulling it on he burst out the door and ran down the corridorjoined by every other herald in the wing just as the death bell tolled this time he hadnt been the only one to feel the deathstruggle and this time there was no doubt this was no accident savils door was locked vanyel kicked it open his aunt lay in the center of a circle of destruction furniture overturned lamps knocked over papers scattered blood everywhere some of the others heraldtrainees who had probably never seen violent death before gasped and turned green or blanched and fled claw and teethmarks on savils throat and torso showed that shed put up a fight a trail of greenish ichor and a brokenbladed knife told that her enemy had not escaped unscathed but there was no sign of it and the trail ended at the locked door not that it mattered to him the damage was already done and this time vanyels hardwon detachment failed entirely while the others checked the locks and looked for clues or any sign of what had attacked her he sank down to his knees beside the body and took one limp hand in his and wept oh gods savil you were right and i didnt listen to you now youre gone and its all my fault some of the others stopped what they were doing and looked at him with pity and concern very few of them had ever seen vanyel emerge from behind the cool mask of the firstranked heraldmage of valdemar fewer still had seen him break down like this especially in public he had heard that he had a reputation for such coolness and selfisolation that even fellow heralds seemed to think nothing could crack his icy calm they were finding out differently now she thought someone was targeting the heraldmages he said brokenly to no one in particularly she was afraid she was going to be next she asked me to help her and i just thought she was being hysterical i promised to strengthen her wards and i didnt i forgot this is all my fault shes never going to sit there in her chair and expound at me again i cant ever ask her for advice shell never take on father for me she was my mother in everything but flesh and i failed her i failed her when id promised to help her he hung his head and closed his eyes choking down the sob that rose and cut off his breathing savil savil im so sorry and sorry isnt enough sorry wont bring you back tears escaped from under his closed eyelids and etched their way down his cheeks he couldnt swallow he could hardly breathe a hand touched his shoulder he looked up slowly through eyes that burned and vision that wavered with tears van tantras said quietly i know youre in no shape to do anything but youre the only heraldmage left and we cant check all the magical locks she had to see if they were violated he blinked then reckoned up in his head ail the deaths over the last couple of years oh gods im not just the only heraldmage they have left here im the very last heraldmage there arent any more but me he wiped the back of his hand across his eyes and rose slowly to his feet clear everyone out he said in a low and deadly calm voice as a coldness settled in his heart and icy anger steadied his thoughts ill need some room to work the wards werent violated van stood in the middle of the room and scanned every inch of it with magesight the wards were fading now that savil was dead but they were still strong enough to read she had warded all four directions above and below weaving protection atop protection and all glowed with the bright blue that meant no strand and no connection had been broken and the only hole was the one he himself had made when he broke down the door the wards werent violated the locks and lockingspells are all intact whatever it was came in before she set the wards what was the damned thing anyway there was still a trace of the greenish ichor left more than enough to identify the creature if it was something vanyel had encountered before this but it wasnt it wasnt even close to anything he knew and the magical signature it had left behind when it broke the spell that gave it its disguise was entirely new its intelligent he decided it has to be and its not abyssal or id at least recognize that much of its signature which only leaves one possibility its created or its from the pelagirs or both his only option now was to try alone what he and savil and the two tayledras had done together try to see into the immediate past he wouldnt have tried it if he hadnt seen it done by an expert and if the time he wanted to see hadnt been so recent he wouldnt have been able to do it alone the longer he waited the fainter the traces would be his best chance at discovering anything would be to cast the spell now this instant you son of a bitch whoever whatever you are youre not getting away im going to hunt you down if it takes me the rest of my life he sat down on the cold bare floor next to where savil had been found and tapped recklessly into the node far below haven his need anger and sorrow drove him deeper into it than he had ever been or dared to go before he grasped the raw power with unflinching hands manipulating it like soft halfmolten iron he forged it into the spell on the anvil of his will and tuned it to himself through the medium of his magefocus then he cast it loose when he opened his eyes the room was as he had left it when hed last seen savil alive he was sitting just beside savils big chair it was early evening by the thin light coming in the windows and she didnt seem to be in the room this must be just after i met stef he thought and guilt ate at him acid in his wounds of loss the wards were not up and there was nothing in the room that did not belong there vanyel froze the moment and searched everywhere even behind and underneath the furniture nothing everything was entirely as it should be he gritted his teeth and let time proceed again waiting as the twilight deepened and became true night as one of the servants came in lighting the lamps and leaving fresh candles in the sconces another brought in a heavy load of wood and fueled the fire nothing at all out of the ordinary wait a moment he froze the timestream again and examined the candles minutely with magesight nothing at all odd about the candles but when he turned his sight on the wood the entire pile glowed an evil green and when he dug deeper at it the wood gave him the same signature as the ichor but it wasnt enough not quite he needed to see how the thing had looked when it dropped its disguise and where it had gone afterward he forced himself to let the timestream start up again his heart lurched when he saw savil enter the room no not now he told himself forcing himself to be cold and unemotional its not the time for that not while im tapping a node i cant afford to give up concentration for emotion he regained control over himself just as his aunt turned away from him and put up her wards even though he was watching the woodpile he didnt see it actually change the creature was that fast he froze time again catching it in midleap and savil in midturn well at least im not slipping he thought still locked in that icy detachment that creature isnt anything ive ever encountered before it was mostly like a raven but with toothed beak evil red eyes and powerful legs that ended in feet bearing knifesharp handsized talons not even the tayledras knew all of the creatures that roamed the pelagirs but somehow this birdthing didnt have the feeling of anything natural if that word could ever be applied to a beast from that magichaunted area still the bird looked wrong the teeth were too long for it to be able to actually eat with them and those claws were no good for anything except rending certainly it couldnt perch on anything like a tree limb with those talons and how would it feed young vanyel could not leave his own position but he could let the beast continue its leap little by little until he could see all of it he did so steadfastly ignoring the look of fear on his aunts face the panic as she realized she could not ready a blast of mageenergy before it reached her it was thumblengths away from her when he stopped the thing again and close examination of the rear proved what he had suspected it had no genital slit in fact it had nothing at all not even a vent it was as featureless behind as a feathercovered egg it was a construct a oneofakind probably created specifically for this task out of a real raven the only way it could obtain nourishment would be magically it was utterly dependent on the mage that created it and there would be no young that might escape the mages control that meant that the mage who had targeted savil was at the least more ruthless than vanyel and very likely more powerful as well power doesnt count for everything vanyel thought clenching his jaw on a rising tide of anger theres skill and theres how much youre willing to pay for what you want i want this bastard and i dont intend to lose him he sped up the timestream skipping ahead to the moment when savil was already dead and he had started to kick in the doorway he watched dispassionately as the birdthing wounded and bleeding again assumed its guise of a pile of wood this time beside the door he watched as he allowed himself to be overcome with grief and the creature took that moment of distraction to slip out the door he tracked it as it fled from the palace by the first exit it paused just long enough to attack one lone companion down and in shock with the loss of her chosen the others came to kellans aid but too late the thing rose up in triumph and fled its talons and beak red with the mingled blood of herald and companion while the rest of the herd shrieked their impotent anger after it and still he tracked it north north for several days ride on wings sped by more magic until it dropped back down to earth exhausted and weakened by its injury he sensed from its primitive thoughts that it was going to stay there for at least a week healing it knew it was safe enough no one knew it was there and no one could follow it that quickly that was all he could bear to see he let loose his control of the spell and it dissolved away leaving him sitting alone in the middle of the empty ruined room with dawn just beginning to color the sky outside the windows and stefen huddled in a cloak just inside the door they ttold me not to disturb you the bard stuttered looking pale and wan in the thin gray light but nobody said i couldnt wait here until you wwere done van im sorry i wwish i could do something you can vanyel replied shortly you can guard the door and keep everyone else out there was hurt in stefs eyes at his coldness but he ignored it fandes he called the rage in her mindvoice colored everything a bloody red gods damn them to the lowest hells that thing got kellan on its way out van i know that he interrupted and im about to extract a little revenge right now will you link and cover my back while i go hunting hunt away she snarled im right behind you that was all the assurance he needed once again he dove into the node pulled in all the raw power he could hold through the buffering effect of his amber focus and launched himself out again with all his channels scorched and tender but still perfectly functional he knew the general area where the thing had gone to earth and he still had that trace of ichor to use to find its exact location while he had that bit of the beasts lifefluid it could never escape him no matter how many disguises it assumed or how much magic it called up to cloak its presence with yfandes guarding his back he knew he neednt waste half his energy watching for ambush he tracked the thing into its hiding place with infinite patience he still had his tap into the node he could afford whatever expense of power it took to find the construct when he found it he also found something else it had shielding far more powerful than he had expected the creatures master wanted it back evidently which made it all the more valuable to vanyel his resources were already stretched thin by distance he couldnt smash through those shields at this range but he didnt need to it was protected against real magic not mindmagic and one of his gifts was fetching with all of the power of the node to back him because he had both real and mindmagic he could fuel his mindpowers with mageenergies as no other herald could which was where his enemy had made a fundamental misjudgment he seized the thing shields and all belatedly it tried to escape but it hadnt a chance at that point and its master hadnt given it the ability to call for help it had been too late for the creature to escape the moment he knew its physical location as it struggled he could feel its rising panic and he smiled and pulled yes yfandes hissed eagerly in his mind by no means enough to distract him he was used to her commentaries and encouragements in the back of his thoughts after all these years yes bring it here and well show them were not to be slaughtered at anyones whim the thing grabbed on to where it was and resisted his pull he simply tapped deeper into the node ignored the pain the rivers of fire that ran along his channels and pulled harder he ripped it loose as it shrieked in desperation yfandes supported him as he hauled it in she cushioned him from the effects of a reactionheadache something shed never done before enabling him to fling the creature down right on the spot where it had killed savil and pin it to the floor with raw nodepower stefen gave a strangled croak when it appeared but wisely remained where he was wise or perhaps frozen with fear van felt the panic coming from him in waves but had no time to worry about the bard just now while the beast squirmed and screamed both mentally and vocally he stripped the protections from its crude thoughts and ripped away every detail he could concerning its master north the direction it had fled in the first place the direction no one expected for an enemy north and an impression of the vast wilderness that could only be the forest of wendwinter and the ice wall mountains beyond but of the master himself nothing only darkness after ruthless probing that left the birds mind a broken bleeding rag vanyel decided that this was all the construct had ever seen of its master he contemplated the writhing creature at his feet with his mouth set in a grim line he had left it a ruin with nothing remaining to tell it how to get home or even how to defend itself it could no longer work the borrowed magics it had been given and it might not even remember how to fly if he let it go it would slowly starve itself to death and its master would never know what had become of it or even whether or not it had been successful in its task even yfandes lust for revenge seemed satisfied now at any rate she was silent and her anger no longer seethed at the back of his mind but his need for vengeance was not filled he gathered all the nodepower he could handle poured in channels that burned as hotly as his own need for revenge he made certain that there was still a line open between the bird and its creator it was too bad that the line was such a thin one one that he could not follow to its source he was going to have to find the perpetrator the hard way but the line was enough to punish the master through and he smashed the thing with one hammerblow of pure wild power the construct screamed its agony and as it died in the cold flames of magic the energy backlashed up the line van had left open to its creator the scream ended the thing glowed with the power van poured into it then incandesced until it was too bright to look at and still he fed the fire until the last of it was eaten away and there was nothing left but a few wisps of white feathery ash he turned toward stefen knowing that at any moment he would feel the effects of what he had just done yfandes couldnt protect him from the reactionheadache of overexertion of mindmagic much longer it was incredible enough that shed done it in the first place and his channels were pure agony that would take several hours of selfhealing to repair the bard stared at him his eyes wide and frightened his face pale as skimmed milk wwhat did yyou do ththat for he whispered looking at vanyel as if he expected the herald to lash out at him next i sent a message vanyel said quietly one that cant be mistaken for anything but what it is a challenge and a warning whoever did this whoever murdered savil is going to pay for it with his own life because this wasnt a personal vendetta this bastard is the same one thats responsible for kilchas death and lissandras and probably made the attempt on me as well so its a threat to valdemar and as such i am going to eliminate the source of the threat the reactionheadache hit then he brought one hand slowly to his head and swayed a little stef was instantly at his side supporting him he recalled the hurt in stefens eyes when hed cut him off earlier and grimaced stef he said awkwardly im sorry i loved savil she was she was he couldnt continue tears interrupted him she was the most remarkable and sweetest old bitch the gods ever created stef replied angrily with tears in his own eyes theres never going to be anyone to match her whoever did this to her i want his hide too not as much as you do but i want it too and ill do anything i can to help you get it he held vanyel half supporting him half embracing him its all right i understand vanyel shook his aching head i just hope you can keep understanding stef he said through the pain because this isnt finished yet it isnt even close sixteen vanyel had convened the entire council as soon as he was able to speak coherently the entire council including randale which meant that they met in his bedroom with shavri in attendance four stone walls surrounded them like the work room the royal bedchamber was an interior room entirely windowless hard on randi who seldom got to see the sun anymore but mandated by security assassins cant climb in the window if there arent any windows the room was warm but not stifling for the sake of appearances randi had been moved from his bed to a couch one as soft and comfortable as his bed but with a padded back so that he could sit up with full support the rest of the councillors brought in chairs from the outer rooms of the suite and arranged them around the couch with no regard for rank most of them took in vanyels pronouncement framed as a requestwith a stunned silence all but the king absolutely not randale said actually sitting up in alarm his voice sounded stronger than it had in months shavri paled a little and clutched the side of the couch we cant possibly spare you you cant afford not to let me go randale vanyel replied tightly keeping a rein on his temper whoever this is whatever his motive hes been targeting heralds and that makes him an enemy of valdemar and if he can pick heraldmages off from outside the border he can pick off anyone including you any time he chooses hed hoped that personal threat would give the king pause but randale didnt hesitate a second thats not a factor what is a factor is that you are the last heraldmage whos going to train the youngsters with the magegift who would even know what the magegift looks like and who is going to counter attacks by magecraft on the border if you arent here to answer the last question first van replied heralds ordinary heralds theyre not only capable of it ive managed to convince them that they can which was no mean feat he has trained several heralds in just that already joshel said reluctantly and weve learned from our operatives that there arent any mages on the karsite side any more at least none with any power after declaring magic anathema they wont have anyone to train mages either as for the youngsters van continued grimly in case you hadnt noticed no one has had any trainees with magegift for the past two years it was never that common to begin with and it seems to be appearing entirely in potential now only in potential shavri said looking shocked her glance going from vanyel to joshel and back again but why whats happened van shrugged and rubbed his thumb nervously along the arm of his chair i dont know but consider this so far as i can tell this enemy has picked heraldmages as his targets what if hes been making his job easier by killing the children with the magegift before they can be chosen it wouldnt be that hard all youd have to do is wait for the gift to manifest and send something to cause an accident no one would ever guess that the deaths were connected in any way that makes it all the more imperative that you stay shavri began her face settling into a stubborn scowl that makes it all the more imperative that i go vanyel countered pounding the arm of his chair with his fist what am i supposed to do tap into the nodes and sit around scanning the entire countryside waiting for some spell or creature to target an unknown child somewhere i dont even know if thats whats happening and if it is how do i stop it his throat tightened with grief and guilt but he forced himself to continue the thing that got savil spirited itself into the palace in haven and killed an experienced heraldmage under our very noses dear gods she called to me for help and im just down the hall from her and i was still too late to save her how in the seven hells am i supposed to catch this enemy again when i not only dont know where and when hell strike but who i have to carry the fight to him its the only way to neutralize him and if we dont he has to have a larger plan he cant be doing this for the fun of it do we wait for him to be ready to make his move or do we take him before hes ready which is better tactics i cant argue tactics with you vanyel shavri said resentfully as randale collapsed back against his cushions but i cant see what good its going to do you us or valdemar to go haring off into the unknown after some nebulous enemy who may just be vanyel was about to interrupt her when yfandes stopped him hold your temper van she said firmly were behind you and were going to take care of this we he thought in surprise but before he could ask her what she meant the face of every herald in the room went blank and shavri stopped in midsentence there was a long moment of silence broken only by the sounds of nonheralds stirring restlessly in their seats the candles placed in sconces all around the room flickered only when someone moved creating a momentary current in the air someone coughed uncomfortably fandes vanyel sent whats going on you have to go van she replied firmly this mage is too much of a threat we the companions i mean have been talking it over since you decided to go after him and we think youre right so were backing you and if the others wont listen to their own companions theyll hear from all of us the overtones to her mindvoice sounded both smug and a little ominous well just see how long any of them can hold out against that joshel shook his head at that point all right he said aloud breaking the silence so suddenly that the nonheralds started he gave vanyel a longsuffering look i dont know how you managed this he told the dumbfounded heraldmage mixed admiration and annoyance in his expression ive never heard of all the companions uniting to back a herald against king and council before i hope youre right vanyel ashkevron and i hope this isnt going to be too much for even you to handle one by one the others gave in shavri the last possibly because shavris bond with her companion was the weakest but finally even she acquiesced though not happily i hope youre satisfied herald vanyel she said on the verge of tears i thought you were our friend the others of the council looked uneasy embarrassed or both at this display of womanly vapors vanyel who knew it was more than that dared not waver from his resolve he knew why she was trying emotional blackmail she was afraid for randale and jisa but there was too much riding on this for him to allow her to manipulate his feelings for her randi and their daughter i am shavri but valdemar comes first you know that as well as i do he replied coolly bringing home to her the same lesson hed given randale years ago then how dare you ride off and leave valdemar unprotected she cried passionately making her hands into fists because i am protecting valdemar he said just as passionately this mage whoever he is doesnt dare leave me alive not after the way i destroyed his creature while he concentrates on me hell be ignoring valdemar and anyone in valdemar you should all be perfectly safe while he brings all his resources to bear on me and what if he kkkills you shavri said miserably what will protect us then shavri he said leaning toward her and catching and holding her gaze if i die ill either take him with me or leave him so crippled hell be no threat so help me i will protect valdemar with my last breath and if there is a way to protect her after my death ill find it he stared into her eyes for a long moment during which no one seemed to breathe then he sat back breaking the spell himself but i dont intend to die he said with a grim smile i intend to find this bastard and make him pay for what he did to savil and the others and if i have your permission to do so randale nodded wearily there doesnt seem to be much choice in the matter the king said for what its worth you have the permission of crown and council vanyel stood and bowed with deliberate grace to all of them im sorry if you feel that your decision has been forced he said but i cant feel sorry that you came to it valdemar is more important than any one man however powerful he seems to be thank you ill be leaving in the morning treven is ready to take full responsibilities as randales proxy and the heir joshel knows how to contact my operatives in karse and tantras can take over everything else ive been doing just as hes done in the past he looked around at the various faces of the councillors his father included im not indispensable you know he finished quietly no one is youre all the most capable people i know and if theres safety for anyone in this realm its in your hands not mine ultimately zhaihelleva my friends and with that he turned and left the room before anyone else could break downincluding himself stefen slipped inside vanyels door and shut it behind him quietly van was beside the bed neatly folding clothing and stowing it away in his travelpacks while he did not look up from his packing stefen knew that vanyel was well aware hed come in stef bit his lip unable to think of how to start what to say vanyel continued to ignore his presence perhaps hoping that stef would become discouraged and leave the silence lengthened as stefens palms grew sweaty and his throat tighter and tighter finally he blurted out the first words that came into his head youre not leaving without me he tried to make it sound defiant but it came out plaintive he pressed his back against the wood of the door as if he could physically bar vanyels way and waited for vans response stef van said without turning around i cant take you with me you know that he sounded as distant and cold as if he were on the moon why not stefen asked around the lump in his throat he was well aware that his words were very similar to what might be coming out of a petulant adolescent and too anxious to care youre not going into rethwellan this time theres no one to care if were lovers whats the difference if im with you or not finally vanyel turned around his face was set in a stony mask and his eyes were inwardfocused as if he was trying not to see stef only his shadow the difference is that youre not a herald youre not combattrained you cant even defend yourself from one man with a sword youre a liability stef i told you when we first how am i any safer here he interrupted desperately playing shamelessly on the guilt he knew vanyel felt over savils death savil wasnt safe if someone wants to use me against you all they have to do is wait until youre gone and take me anybody who can do whats been done so far could make one of those gatethings grab me while everybodys asleep and be gone before i could yell for help you said yourself i couldnt protect myself from one man with a sword how am i going to protect myself against something like that he balled his hands into fists to keep from gouging the wood of the door with his nails the room was much too hot and it was very hard to breathe vanyel seemed to waver for a moment the mask cracking then his lips tightened the fire flared up making his face look even harsher and more masklike i dont have time for this stef i have a job to do and youre only going to get in the way the words were deliberately hurtful and if stef hadnt felt a trace of contrary emotions through the bond that tied them together he might have fled at that moment hes so driven but i can crack that shell i have to just enough so that hell let me come with him but its a mistake to bring up savil again thats whats driving him im coming with you he said stubbornly moving away from the door and toward vanyel if you wont take me with you ill follow you if you set somebody to watch me ill get away somehow if you wont let me stay with you ill ride an hour behind you he stopped for a moment then made the last two steps in a rush taking vanyel in his arms before the herald could evade the embrace vanyel held himself away as stiffly as the night theyd first met but stef hid his face in vanyels jerkin anyway i dont care what you do he said into vanyels shoulder his cheek pressed tightly against the smooth leather i love you and im following you i dont care what happens to me as long as i can be with you what about randale vanyel asked in a strange hollow voice im not in love with randale stef replied a little defensively im not a herald you said that yourself and i dont see that i owe him anything therere a dozen healers that can painblock now three of them can do it while randales awake and talking im just a convenience he doesnt need me any more and with treven taking over full heirs duties he wont even have to do anything he doesnt feel up to shavri would probably dispute that vanyel said dryly but his rigid posture was softening she did stefen told him encouraged by that tiny sign and i told her she could force me to stay but she couldnt force me to play she looked like she wanted to throw something at me but she didnt she just told me what she thought of me it started with traitor and went downhill from there i imagine it did vanyel replied with a little cough she told me shed have me demoted that shed have me banned from the bardic circle stef continued feeling that vanyel was relaxing further i told her i didnt care and i dont he released vanyel a little and looked up into the heralds face lifting his chin defiantly it doesnt matter to me if i wanted a high position and all the rest of that i could have gone with that gemmerchant i used to want that kind of thing but i dont anymore what do you want stef vanyel asked softly his strange silver eyes full of pain and haunted by thoughts stef could only guess at besides you i dont know stefen said truthfully hed intended to say just you but something about the way van had asked the question compelled him to the exact truth i only know that without you no rank or fame would be worth having and what would you have done if randale had still needed you vanyel continued holding stefs eyes with his stefen swallowed his throat tightened again and a cold lump formed in the pit of his stomach i dddont know he replied miserably its too hard a choice and i didnt have to make it so does it matter he doesnt need me and he told shavri so he did for the first time since savils death vanyel smiled a very faint smile but a genuine one you didnt tell me that part you didnt let me get to it stef reminded him with an uncertain grin randale told shavri that he didnt need me and that id only pine myself away to nothing if i had to stay he said i should follow my heart and that i shouldnt let you stop me and that we needed each other vanyels arms came up and slowly closed around stefen i guess we do at that he said in a whisper and held stef so tightly the bard could hardly breathe will you let me come with you now he asked when he was certain van wasnt going to let go of him any time soon dont you ever give up vanyel asked amusement waning with exasperation and amusement winning no the bard replied sure now that hed won i already told you that he felt vans hand stroking his hair and sighed relaxing himself the cold lump in his stomach vanishing all right but only because i think youre right vanyel pushed him away enough so that the herald could look into his eyes youre probably a lot safer with me than here i can put better protections on you than ive ever put on anyone else including myself youll be invisible to magesight because ill make them all passive defenses that dont manifest unless youre attacked and its harder to find a moving target but stef please please promise me that if it comes to a physical battle youll run you dont know anything but streetfighting and i dont have the time to teach you enough of anything to do you any good ive lost savil if i lost you the look in vanyels eyes was not altogether sane and reminded stef uneasily of the expression hed seen once in the eyes of a brokenwinged bird stefen shuddered and pulled the herald back into an embrace i promise he said i told you i value my skin i wont risk it doing something stupid good vanyel sighed well i guess i should let you go pack he let go of stef reluctantly stefen backed a step away and grinned up at the herald he returned to the door opened it and pulled his packs in from the hallway i already have he said simply vanyel was awake at dawn and stef somehow managed to shake himself into a facsimile of alertness even though his body protested being up at such an unholy hour and his mind refused to admit that he was actually moving about van had gone completely over his packs the night before fortunately medren had helped stef put his kit together and there was nothing vanyel insisted upon that he did not already have and very little he insisted stef discard stef had already been in bed and asleep by the time van finished his own packing but he could be a very light sleeper if he chose so the night had not been entirely wasted although as he yawned his way through a sketchy breakfast he wondered if the night might not have been better spent in sleeping after all it was so dark that the stablehands were working by lantern light vanyel saddled yfandes with his own hands but suggested absently to stefen that he stand back and let the experienced grooms deal with his little filly they placed a different sort of saddle on her than stef was used to one identical to vanyels with the rear and front a little higher than his riding saddle and rings and snaffles all over the skirting he couldnt imagine what all those fastenings could be for especially when there werent any straps in evidence to be attached to them but then he didnt know much about horses anyway if that was the kind of thing vanyel wanted him to use he and melody would cooperate at least he hoped melody would cooperate she looked rather affronted by the rumpband then the grooms brought out two of the oddest animals stefen had ever seen horsetall spotted brown and white as hairy as the shaggiest of dogs they had long necks and rabbit like faces with big round deepbrown eyes one of them craned its long neck in stefens direction its nostrils widening and its split upper lip lifting stef tried to back out of its reach but melody was in the way and he was hemmed in by stalls on either side the grooms were so busy loading the beasts with packs that they didnt notice what the one nearest stef was trying to do he braced himself waiting for the thing to try and bite him hoping he could dodge out of the way before it connected but the creature only snuffled at him stirring his hair with its warm sweet breath melody twitched the skin of her neck and turned her head to see what was disturbing her stefan fully expected her to have a fit when confronted by the odd beast but she didnt even widen her eyes she just snorted in equine greeting and the beast stretched its neck still further to touch noses with her before going back to snuffling stefens hair as if in fascination finally the groom looked up from strapping the last pack down and saw what the creature was doing here now he said slapping its shoulder lightly the beast pulled its head back and turned a gaze full of disappointment on its handler dont you go alookin at me like that missy he said thems not roses you was asmellin twas the young lads hair she sighed as deep and heartfelt as any crestfallen maiden and closed her eyes the groom pulled the final strap tight and turned toward stef chirras he said shaking his head curious as cats they are you watch this un she likes flowers an anything thats brightcolored shell go sniffin at just in case it might be some posy she aint never seen afore he grinned some fool herald name of vanyel gave er a snowrose once an ever since shes been lookin fer flowers where there cant be none shed just carried my packs through a blizzard berd vanyel replied without turning around i thought she deserved a reward and i didnt have any sweets with me listen we plan to leave these two at the border at the last guard post is that all right whatre you gonna do for supplies the groom asked skeptically what i generally do live off the land now vanyel turned to face them i wouldnt have asked you for them now except that stef isnt used to this kind of trip and i dont want to make it too hard on him at the beginning whatever you say the groom replied the guard post is fine next replacement to come back down can bring em with thats pretty much what i thought vanyel took the leadrope of the other chirra from a young boy and fastened it to the cantle of his saddle while berd did the same with the flowerloving chirra and melodys saddle van mounted once his chirra was secure and stef followed his example you take care mlord van berd called after them as they rode out into the dark and cold vanyel halfturned in his saddle to wave but he neither replied nor smiled outside the walls of the city there was nothing to be seen except snowcovered hills and a farmhouse or two by the time they were a candlemark from haven the sky was as light as it was likely to get for the rest of the day the clouds hung low heavy and leaden the air felt a little damp and the only place stef wasnt cold was where his legs were warmed by contact with his horse vanyel lifted his head and sniffed the light breeze a few strands of silvered hair escaping from the hood of his cloak smells like snow he said the first words hed spoken since leaving the palace grounds stef sampled the air himself but it didnt smell any differently to him how can you tell he asked his voice sounding loud over the snowmuffled footfalls of the beasts on the road it just does van replied like rain only fainter and colder he looked back at stef and got yfandes to slow so that they were riding side by side i wont stop for you and i wont hold my pace back for you stef he said warningly i dont dare im holding back enough as it is taking chirras for the first leg the only reason im catering to your inexperience on this first stage is because my enemy is going to assume im coming straight for him at a companions pace and i hope this will throw him off i understand stef hastened to say i wont hold you back ill keep up you might but your filly isnt a companion van began then he got that listening expression that meant his companion was talking to him fandes says shell help he replied looking a little surprised i dont know what she plans to do maybe do something so that melody can keep up with her i hope so a companion is good for a lot more in the way of speed and endurance than an ordinary horse i bred both those qualities into stars line but theres still only so much a horse can do ill keep up stef repeated vowing to himself that hed die before he complained of soreness or fatigue hes so strange he thought so cold its like theres nothing in the world thats important except getting this enemy of his ive never seen him like this before is he always like this when hes working i wonder i have to stop this mage vanyel said quietly as if hed heard stefens thoughts i have to stef its the most important thing ive ever had to do can you understand that im sorry if it seems as though im being cold to you stefen shook his head no its all right he said hastily even though it didnt feel all right i told you i wouldnt fall behind and i wont youll have no reason to feel that bringing me along was a bad idea i hope youre right van replied bleakly although i must admit that it looks as though the weather is going to be a bigger factor in our progress than you are even as he spoke the first big fluffy flakes began falling from the lowering clouds stef looked up in puzzlement it doesnt look that bad he protested shifting in his saddle to relieve strained muscles inside his thighs vanyels eyes were closed and his brows knitted with concentration its not bad now he said slowly but it could get that way very quickly very easily this storm system goes all the way up to the border and the balances in it are quite delicate right now it looks as though its going to snow steadily but things can change that balance all too easily oh stef replied i didnt know you could predict weather like that vanyel opened his eyes and raised an eyebrow at him i cant he said i can only read weather i cant predict what its going to do its one of the first things i was taught after i got control of my magepowers the kind of magic i can do often disrupts weather patterns and i need to know if im going to kick up a storm if i build a gate or something of that nature oh like when lendel died stef replied absently lost in his own worries but vanyel stiffened and turned completely in his saddle to face the bard how did you know that stefen brushed snow away from his face and felt an odd little chill down his spine at the tone of vanyels voice and the odd expression he wore van actually looked frightened mostly startled but a little frightened savil must have told me or maybe jisa he said trying to make sense of his own muddled memories and vanyels reaction i remember somebody must have told me there was a big storm caused mostly by the gate being made it was probably savil since there was a lot of stuff about how magic works involved in the explanation i know savil talked to me about it after i asked her why van asked why did you ask her because its a part of you thats important stefen replied in a quietly defensive tone i never asked you about it because it seemed like you avoided the subject i didnt want to hurt you or anything so i asked savil if shed mind talking about it and she said no it had been long enough ago that she didnt mind anymore that was while you were getting back to yourself after that mage attacked us vanyel relaxed and lost his haunted look i talked to your parents a lot too stef said i hope you dont mind he tried to muster up a hint of mischief treesa and i have a lot in common she says im more fun to have as company than any of her ladies i helped her get herself settled in when they got here you know i didnt know vanyel replied with a kind of absentminded chagrin i just saw father taking to the job of councillor like a hound to the chase and i guess i just assumed mother would be all right she wasnt all right she got here and found out that she was in the same position savil said you were in when you first came here a provincial noble from the backwater twenty years behind the fashions with no knowledge of current gossip or protocol stef thought she saw less of you than before she was terribly lonely and if there had been a way to get home shed have taken it i thought she was fine it just seemed like after the first couple of weeks she was as happy as father van continued peering through the curtain of snow at the road ahead every time id see her she was the center of attention surrounded by others he paused for a moment then said was that your doing some of it stef admitted i coached her and i introduced her to countess bryerly and lady gellwin you probably hadnt noticed but there isnt much court at court with randi so sick and shavris time taken up with it the real court the social part has pretty much moved out of the crown section of the palace and into the nobles suites and those are the two that really run it countess bryerly is distantly related to the brendewhins so that made everything fine lady gellwin took treesa under her wing as a kind of protege put her in charge of a lot of the younger girls once she found out that your mother did a lot of fostering a month ago vanyel would have been deeply upset that he hadnt thought to make sure his mother was well settled in now he only said thank you stef i appreciate your helping her and continued to peer up the road thats not like him stef thought worriedly ive never seen him so obsessed before if he thought we could make any better time by getting off fandes and pushing her hed do it i dont understand whats gotten into him the snow was getting thicker there was no doubt about that it still wasnt enough to stop them or to slow them by too much but vanyel was obviously concerned he spoke in an absent tone of voice whenever stef asked him a direct question but otherwise he was absolutely silent and inwardcentered the morning lengthened into afternoon and stef was afraid to ask him to stop for something to eat and a chance to warm up even though they passed through three villages with inns that stef eyed longingly he was hungry but worse than the hunger was the cold snow kept getting in under his hood and melting sending runnels of icy water down the back of his neck he could hardly feel his hands or his nose there wasnt any wind but they were creating their own breeze just by moving and it kept finding its way in through the armslits of his cloak and melody was suffering too she walked steadily in yfandes wake with her head down and her eyes halfclosed she was tired and probably missed her warm stable as much as stefen missed his room and fireplace finally yfandes planted all four hooves in the middle of the road and refused to go any farther melody actually ran right into her rump before the filly realized the companion had stopped van seemed to come out of a trance all right he said crossly if thats the way you want it i guess i dont have a choice what stef said startled not you ashke yfandes she says shes cold and hungry and shes stopping whether i like it or not he dismounted and led her and the chirra over to the side of the road kicking his way through the soft snow stef had to make two tries at dismounting before he could get off hed never been so stiff and sore in his life and he had the sinking feeling it was only going to get worse but when he got under the tree he felt a little resistance in the air and when he passed it a breath of warmth melted the snow stuck to his hair it was more than just a breath of warmth the entire area beneath the branches was warm about as warm as a summer day what snow van hadnt cleared away was melting and yfandes was looking very pleased with herself van stef said hesitatingly is this a good idea i mean i guess you used magic to do this wont somebody spot it vanyel shook his head i used a tayledras trick its how they shield their valleys from the outside even to magesight this place looks absolutely the same as it did before we got here snowcovered trees and no humans itll stay that way until well after weve gone on he brushed snow from his cloak and grimaced there will still be a trace of magicuse here though and if my enemy knows i trained with the tayledras hell be able to track us by that about two days behind our real trail id rather not have done this but fandes said her joints were getting stiff and she had to get warm so i didnt have much choice stef had a sneaking suspicion that fandes had insisted as much for his sake as her own and he gave her a look of gratitude he hoped she could read to his astonishment she turned to look right at him and gave him a slow deliberate wink when vanyels back was turned rummaging in the chirras packs could we sort of change direction every once in a while to throw him off stef said hoping this meant van was going to warm up their resting place every time they stopped it wont do much good he knows were coming north after him and theres only a limited number of ways we can travel vanyel sighed and looked over stefs shoulder as if he wished they could get back on the road immediately stefen ate his meal in silence yfandes sidled up to him and he leaned on her grateful for the support and for her warmth it looks like the best i can hope for is that hell wait until im warm clear through before getting back on the road at any rate this is how well camp at night vanyel continued handing him cold meat bread and cheese and two apples i dont want to stop at inns there could be spies there and i dont want this mage to know exactly where we are stef split his second apple and fed half to yfandes and half to melody whatever you say van he replied hoping hed be able to get back on his horse when vanyel wanted to leave as long as i can be with you seventeen snow fell as it had fallen for the past three weeks as it seemed it would continue to fall for the next three weeks not a blizzard the wind when there was one was gentle and the temperature relatively warm but the snow was wet and heavy good snow for playing in as dozens of children making snowbeasts in their yards attested but it increased their travel time fourfold ironically considering how much stress vanyel had put on the fact that he would leave stef behind if he had to the chirras were forcing a path through the snow for the two riding and their progress was set by the chirras pace how many days can a snowstorm last stef asked huddled on melodys back shivering despite woolen underdrawers a sweater and a shirt under his tunic and two sweaters and his cloak over that its not the same storm ashke vanyel replied as he consulted a map then looked for landmarks they were supposed to reach the last guard outpost today at least according to vanyels calculations that outpost marked the end of the lands valdemar claimed and the beginning of territory held by no one except wolves two and four legged and other things the pelagirs reached into that territory and where they ended was anyones guess probably only the tayledras knew it also marked the point at which vanyel and stefens easy travel ended theyd be leaving the chirras behind and what little was left of the supplies and going on with what yfandes and melody could carry and what vanyel could conjure up by now stef was no longer so sore in the morning that he would far rather have died than get up and remount his horse but the cold never varied and once out of their little shelter of mageborn warmth in the morning he was chilled and miserable within a candlemark what do you mean it isnt one storm stef asked it hasnt stopped snowing since we left haven its a series of storms all coming out of the north van replied folding the map and storing it carefully in a special pocket on his saddle they generally blow out during the night and a new one moves in just before dawn the post isnt more than a couple of furlongs away we should make it there by dusk he looked back critically at stefen if they have it to spare we should get you some warmer clothing and a better cloak if i had known youd feel the cold this badly id have gotten it for you before we left stefen held his peace youre going to need it vanyel continued urging the chirra forward with yfandes following at its tail after this when we leave the gear and the extra supplies this trip is going to be much harder on you and not on you what are you made of van stone and steel i dont see how it can stef replied since for once van seemed to be waiting for an answer im already frozen most of the time because we may be frozen and hungry most of the time vanyel told him looking back over his shoulder well eat what i can hunt i refuse to use magic to bring helpless creatures to me unless im literally starving to death im probably a lot more used to being hungry than you are lord vanyel ashkevron stefen snapped i spent most of my life being hungry i may not be woodswise but im not as helpless as you keep trying to make me out to be vanyel recoiled a little his mouth tightened and he turned away i hope for your sake thats true stefen was all he said as he presented his back to the bard stef bit his lip and tasted the saltsweet of blood bright move stef very bright move what do you use for a mind dried peas he brushed snow and hair out of his eyes with a movement that had become habit and stared at the snowblanketed woods to his right and left but dammit i wish hed give me credit for being something more than a useless piece of baggage all right im not a herald i dont know how to survive on my own in the woods but i can help and ive been helping when mlord bothers to give me instructions unhappiness colder and more bitter than the cold welled up in his throat maybe he was right maybe i shouldnt have come maybe this whole trip is just showing him how little he needs or wants me maybe i should stay behind at this guard post suddenly yfandes stopped melody kept moving past the companion until vanyel reached over and caught her reins out of stefens hands then he caught stefens hands themselves im sorry stef he said that same woundedbird look back in his eyes i dont give you enough credit fandes just gave me an earful for some of the things ive been saying and doing to you stefen tried to smile its all right really it is no its not but i cant help myself stef the herald said through clenched teeth ill probably go right on doing this to you making you hurt making you feel like you wish youd stayed behind i just hope you can forgive me because it isnt going to stop everything has to take second place to what im doing about this enemy of mine can you understand that no stefen said truthfully but ill try vanyel dropped his eyes im glad youre with me stef he said in a whisper im glad youre sticking this out with me it would be a lot harder without you you remind me im still human just by being here you remind me theres something else besides the task ive been set something worth more than revenge but i say things i shouldnt because sometimes i dont want to be reminded of that stefen couldnt think of anything profound to say but the lump in his throat and stomach were gone and he felt a great deal warmer than he had in weeks he freed one hand from vanyels and touched his glove to vans cheek i love you he said simply as vanyels silver eyes met his again thats all that matters isnt it vanyel smiled a flicker of his old self and patted stefs hand lets go he said and let go of the bards other hand the sooner we get into shelter the happier youll be the listening look crossed his face again and he coughed fandes says to the nine hells with you humans you have cloaks the sooner we get to the shelter the happier ill be stefen smiled and when vanyel had turned his attention back to the trail ahead exchanged winks with the companion lady he thought at her we may not be able to mindspeak at each other but i have the feeling you and i are communicating very well lately the guard post meant a real fire a real bed and hot food and almost as important human voices voices that werent his and vanyels there was warmer clothing available wool underclothes from the guards winter stores sweaters one of the guardswomen knitted from mixed sheep and chirra wool the new furlined cloak that had belonged stef tried not to think of the ill omen to a guardsman that had died of snowfever before he could ever wear it and there was news of the north news that was at odds with their own mission they sat by the fire hot cider brewing in a kettle vanyel and the post commander slouched across a tiny table in the corner while stef warmed his bones right on the hearth lady bless not a thing but the occasional bandit and a bout of snowfever said the commander a handsome woman with irongray hair and a firm jaw since last summer we havent even seen the odd pelagir critter coming over not even rumors vanyel asked as stef warmed his feet at the fire and played someones old lute that had been found in the storeroom the tone wasnt exactly pure but the guardsfolk were certainly enjoying it so he tried not to wince at the occasional dull note no hint of activity up there at all not a thing the commander replied positively the only odd things this snow never seen it snow so much as it has in the past few weeks well you can see for yourself we shouldnt have more than one or two thumblengths on the ground right now and weve got it up to our waists with no end in sight you mean this isnt normal winter weather vanyel asked sitting up straight i thought my nephew was up here and carried on like the snow was above the rooftops by midwinter hellfires no this isnt normal the woman laughed if your nephew was that young journeyman bard we had through here poor lad one snowfall and he thought the end of the world was coming in ice but that was after some of my people scared him half to death with their tales normal winter gives us snow every couple of weeks not day after day cant say as i mind it though weather like this is harder on the bandits than it is on us we got clearing crews they dont and its damn difficult to move through woods this deep in soft snow stef knew that look the one vanyel was wearing now he finished the song he was on just about the same time as van made a polite end to his conversation and headed back to their room he gave the lute back to its finder claiming weariness and ignoring the knowing looks as he hurried after the herald the guest room did not have a fireplace and it was in the area of the barracks farthest from the chimneys given his choice this was not where stef would have gone the corridor was lit by a couple of dim smoking lanterns and stef would have been willing to swear he saw the smoke freeze as it rose into the air vanyel was a dim white shape a little ahead of him he managed to catch up with the herald before he reached their door what was it he asked seizing vans elbow what did she say he was half afraid that van would pull away from him but the herald only shook his head and swore under his breath i cant believe how stupid i was he said quietly as he opened the door to their room and motioned stef to go inside the candle beside the door and the one next to the bed sprang into life as they entered the kind of casual use of magic that impressed stef more than the nightly creation of their shelter because the use of magic to light a candle implied that van considered it no more remarkable than using a coal from the fire for the same purpose that was frightening that van could afford to waste power that way how were you stupid stef persisted what did she tell you other than the fact that theyre having odd weather this winter odd weather vanyel grimaced thats rather like saying randis a little ill you heard her theyve had weeks of snow not the couple of days worth they should have had he took his cloak down from the hook next to the door and bundled himself up in it do you still want to be useful he asked sitting down on the edge of the bed and looking up at stef with the candle flames reflecting in his eyes of course i want to be useful stef said uncertainly good stand by the door and make sure nobody comes in vanyel put his back against the wall and pulled the cloak in tightly around himself he cocked an eyebrow at stef as the bard shuffled his feet hesitantly thats not a light request im going into trance i made the basic mistake of assuming that since i didnt sense any magic in the weather around us that it wasnt wizard weather obviously i was wrong obviously stef murmured seeing nothing at all obvious about it so im going to be doing some very difficult weatherworking but im going to have to do it at some distance where these snowstorms are being generated when i do that ill be vulnerable he waited for stefen to respond after a moment light did dawn oh so if therere any agents here right this would be the time for them to act and since my magical protections are pretty formidable the easiest thing would be to come after me physically vanyel settled back and closed his eyes van what do you want me to do if somebody forces their way in here stef asked feeling for the hilt of his knife vanyel opened his eyes again i want you to stop them however you have to he said his eyes focusing elsewhere this is one place where your streetfighting skill is going to do us some good take them alive if you can but dont let them touch me one of those leechblades just has to touch the skin to be effective all right stefen replied feeling both a little frightened and better than he had since this trip started at least now he was doing something and van had admitted to needing him to do it you can count on me if i didnt think i could van told him closing his eyes again i wouldnt have asked you lover stef started at another noise the candle had long since burned down to nothing but he hadnt dared light another several times hed thought hed heard something outside the locked shutters on the rooms single window but nothing had ever happened the sound came again but this time he realized it was coming from the bed he groped his way over and sat down the shapeless bundle of van moved and the cloak parted letting out a faint mist of golden light stef gaped in surprise his present the amber magefocus around vans neck was glowing ever so slightly the light it gave off was just enough to see by anything happen van asked shaking long silverstreaked hair out of his eyes he looked like the old vanyel his face had lost some of that hard remoteness and he sounded like the old van as well his voice held concern for stef as well as need to know if anything had gone wrong i thought i heard something a couple of times but other than that nothing stef told him still staring at the pendant does it always do that does oh yes at least it has for a while thats the best gift anyones ever given me especially now van said his eyes and voice both warming he stretched throwing his cloak back a little and reaching high over his head ending with one hand lying lightly on stefs knee having the focus to feed raw power through has made a lot of this much easier on me i dont always have time to use it but when i do it extends my reach and my strength im glad you cared enough about me to find it for me ashke he smiled and stef warmed all through the snow should stop in about a candlemark and it wont start again the way it has been the abrupt change of subject didnt confuse stef as much a it might have this time so it was wizard weather then did you find out where it was coming from vaguely on the other side of this forest possibly up in the mountains van massaged his right hand with his left thats the strange part stef ive never heard of a powerful mage coming out of that area before a few tribal shamans certainly but never an adeptclass mage who says he has to have come from there stef replied taking vans hand and massaging it for him hes treating me like a partner now and not like a liability he could have come from somewhere else the pelagirs or iftel maybe and moved in there because theres no one there thats what i would do if i were a mage and wanted to build myself up before i took on the world id go up where there arent any mages no rivals no competition thats reasonable i suppose van admitted listen lover how upset would you be at not staying the couple of days we planned here at leaving at first light i told you i wasnt going to hold you back stefen said with a purely internal sigh of regret im not going to start now by breaking that promise if you want to leave well leave i was hoping youd say that van replied kicking off his boots stef took his cloak from him and started peeling off his own clothing expecting that as usual the use of magery would have left vanyel too tired to do anything but sleep until he felt vans hands sliding under his shirt here the herald breathed in his ear let me help you with that this may be our last real bed for a while in the morning that brief glimpse of the old vanyel was gone van was back to his new patterns remote silent face unreadable eyes wary stef sighed but he hadnt really expected anything different at least i know that down under the obsession hes still the same person he thought dressing quickly in a room so cold that his breath frosted so when this is over ill have him back again the way he was it was beginning to look like id lost the van i love they saddled up and rode out without more than a cursory farewell stef had learned how to take care of melody entirely on his own while theyd been on the road now he didnt even think twice about getting her brushed down and saddled he just did it without waiting for the grooms help most of what they were carrying was food for yfandes and melody there was a certain amount of provender out here even in the depth of winter and vanyel could if he chose forcegrow more overnight in their shelters he could even fetch a limited amount every night from the stores here at the guard post which was probably what he was going to do but the fact was it was harder to feed the horse and the companion out here in the winter woods than it was to feed the humans so their needs took priority over van and stefs stef was very glad for his new clothing motley though it was the moment they got out of the shelter of the palisade around the guard post though the sky was as clear as van had promised in fact for the first time in weeks stef saw the morning stars lythan and leander on the eastern horizonit was colder than it had been while it was snowing a lot colder already stefs nose was numb and he was very glad of the wool scarf wrapped around his ears under the hood of his cloak vanyel looked to the east where the sky was just beginning to turn pink and frowned a little but he said nothing only urged yfandes on into the marginally clearer place between the trees that marked what passed for a road up here the sun rose and at the moment it got above the treetops stef knew what had caused van to frown though weak by summer standards the clear sunlight poured through the barren branches and reflected off of every surface doubling even tripling its effect on the eyes the ground was a blinding undulating expanse of white bushes and undergrowth were mounds of eyewatering whiteness in fact stef pulled his head completely inside the hood of his cloak and rode with his eyes squinted partly shut after a few moments the only relief was when they passed through sections of conifers that overshadowed the road and blocked the sunlight once out of their shade the reflected sunlight seemed twice as painful as before still vanyel pressed on even though melody and even yfandes tripped and stumbled because they couldnt see where they were going and couldnt guess at obstacles under the cover of snow the farther they got from the border the thinner the snowcover became but the snow and the light reflected from it were still there still a problem even past midday and they did not take their usual break to eat and rest finally stef pulled melody to a halt she hung her head breath steaming sweating obviously grateful for a chance to stop yfandes went on for a few more lengths then paused it took vanyel several moments to notice that stef was no longer behind him he turned and peered back through the snowglare hooded whiteclad herald on his white companion he was hard to make out against the snow and he looked like an icestatue his voice was as cold as the chill air why did you stop because melody and yfandes need the rest you didnt take stef told him bluntly look at yfandes look at how heavily shes breathing how shes sweating they dont have the chirras in front of them to break a path van they need their rest at noon more than ever we dont have the time vanyel snapped interrupting him we dont have a choice stef countered yfandes will carry you until she drops but what good are you going to be able to do if you kill her he nudged melody with his heels and she covered the few steps between them stiffly and reluctantly he gestured at yfandes who had taken the same posture as melody head down eyes closed sides heaving van look at her look at what youre doing to her hellfires look at what youre doing to yourself you cant see you havent eaten or had anything to drink since before dawn and for what this enemy of yours isnt going anywhere hes going to be right where hes been all along but he knows were coming vanyel began so what difference does that make stefen sniffed fighting back that traitorous lump that kept getting in the way of what he wanted to say and rubbed his nose with the back of his glove he hasnt done much except throw a little snow at us so far and that snow might not even have been thrown at us van youre forgetting everything that makes you someone special that makes you a herald every time you start focusing in on this enemy of yours i mean thats really it he isnt an enemy of valdemar anymore hes a personal enemy someone you want to take on by yourself and youre running over everything and everybody in your path to get at him me randale even yfandes none of us matter as long as you can personally destroy this mage dont you see that dont you see what youre becoming you vanyels expression hardened still more and he drew himself up stiffly you have no idea of what youre talking about you arent a herald stefen you wouldnt even stand by randale how can you presume to judge that was as far as he got yfandes jerked her head up and trumpeted an alarm but it was too late men hundreds it seemedburst through the snowcovered bushes on either side of the road melody started awake at yfandes scream then shied violently at the shouting creatures running toward her stef clung to her saddle bewildered ambush he thought trying to hold onto melody as she bucked and shied again while vanyel did something with his hands and balls of fire appeared from nowhere to burst in their attackers faces but the exploding fire was the last straw so far as melody was concerned she screamed and fled stumbling down their backtrail and bucked stef off before they had gone more than two lengths stefen went flying headfirst into a snowdrift and came up scraping snow out of his eyes just in time to see vanyel cut an axewielding attacker in half with his sword while yfandes mashed in a second mans face with her hindfeet at that moment stef forget everything he ever was and everything he ever knew he was no longer thinking only feeling and the only thing he felt was fear and the only thing of any importance in the entire world was getting away from there he turned and ran ran as hard as hed ever run in his life with fear driving him and nipping at his heels ran along the backtrail and then off into the bushes with branches lashing at him and buried protrusions tripping him ran until he simply couldnt run anymore until the sounds of fighting were lost in the distance until he ran out of breath and strength and collapsed into the snow lungs on fire mouth parched sides an agony legs too weak to hold him he lay where he fell waiting for one of the ambushers to come after him and kill him fear making him whimper and tremble but too spent even to crawl but nothing happened he pulled in great shuddering breaths of air sobbing with fright while his body finally stopped shaking with exhaustion and began shivering with cold and still nothing happened he levered himself up out of the snow and there was nothing in sight no enemies not even a bird only the snowcovered bushes he had fallen into blue sky bare treebranches making a pattern of interlace across it and the churnedup mess of snow and dead leaves of his backtrail through the undergrowth he listened while fear ebbed and sense returned slowly he heard nothing nothing whatsoever and finally thought returned as well van dear gods i left him alone back there he struggled to his feet and fought his way back through the bushes staring wildly about still there was neither sight nor sound of anything dearest gods how could i do that once again he ran this time driven by guilt along the swath his flight had cut through the snow and the forest undergrowth he burst through a cluster of bushes onto the road and literally stumbled onto the site of the ambush there was blood everywhere blood and churnedup snow and dirt and bits of things that made stef sick when he saw them bits of things that looked like they had belonged to people then his eyes focused on the center of the mess on something he had first taken for a heap of snow yfandes down lying in a crumpled heap like a broken toy left by a careless child blood oozing from the stump where her tail had been chopped off no sign of vanyel no stef stumbled to yfandes side afraid of what he would find but there was nothing no body nothing yfandes had been stripped of her harness and saddle and a trail of footprints and bloody snow led away from where she lay no his legs wouldnt hold him his mind could not comprehend what had happened in all the endless things he had imagined there had been nothing like this vanyel had never been defeated he never could be defeated no no no his heart tried to deny what his eyes were telling him his mind was caught between the two in complete paralysis he touched yfandes flank with a trembling hand but she did not move and vanyel did not reappear to tell him that it was all a ruse his heart cracked in a thousand pieces no he flung back his head and howled damen the boy started fear so much a part of him that he no longer noticed it and looked up from the pot he was tending on the hearth across the smokefilled hall to the doorway the lord he cringed into the ashes on the hearthstones expecting lord rendan to stalk over and deliver a blow or a kick the men had gone out every day for the past two weeks on the orders of master dark and had always come back emptyhanded tempers were short and damen was usually the one who bore the brunt of those tempers but nothing happened and his fear ebbed a little he coughed and took a second look raking his hair out of his eyes with a greasy hand and peering through a thicker puff of smoke and soot that an errant breeze sent down the halfchoked chimney lord rendan stood blocking the open doorway arms laden with something bulky a scowl on his face but it wasnt the scowl damen had come to dread these past two weeks the one that told of failure on rendans part and punishment to come for damen the boy scrambled to his bare feet slipping a little on a splash of old tallow and scuttled through the rotting straw and garbage that littered the floor to the lords side here rendan growled thrusting the bundle at him damen took it in both arms the weight making him stagger as rendan grabbed his shoulder and turned him toward the hearth put it over there on the bench the lord snapped as his fingers dug into damens shoulder leaving one more set of bruises among the rest the boy stumbled obediently toward the bench and dropped his burden only then seeing that it was a saddle and harness bloodspattered but of fine leather and silverchased steel a saddle but we dont have any horses the lord threw something else atop the pile white and shining a cascade of silver hair a horses tail a white horses tail the raw end still bloody before damen could stir his wits enough to wonder what that meant the rest of the men crowded in through the keep door cursing and shouting bringing the cold and snow in with them damen rubbed his nose on his sleeve then scuttled out of the way he stood as close to the fire as he could for in his fourthhand breeches and tattered shirt he was always cold he counted them coming in as he always did for the number varied as men were recruited or deserted and may the gods help him if he didnt see that all of them had food and drink one handsworth two hands three and four hands and five limp bodies carried by the rest one cut nearly in half gerth the axe an no loss there damen thought with a smirk he concealed behind a cough one less bastard t beat me bloody when es drunk an try an get into me breeches when es sober the others dropped gerths hackedup body beside the door two more bodies joined his bodies blackened and burned heverd and jess damen dismissed them with a shrug they were no better and no worse than any of the others quite forgettable by his standards a fourth with the face smashed in was laid beside the rest and damen had to take account of the other faces before he decided it must be resley the liar a pity that the liar could be counted on to share a bit of food when the pickings were thin and there wasnt enough to go around provided a lad had something squirreled away to trade but there was a fifth body whiteclad and bloodsmeared certainly no one damen recognized and that one was thrown down beside the pile of harness not next to the door an old man he thought seeing the long silverthreaded hair but that was before they dumped him unceremoniously beside the bench then the face came into the flickering firelight and damen blinked in confusion for the face was that of a young man not an old one and a very handsome young man at that quite as pretty as a girl he was apparently unconscious and tied hand and foot and it occurred to damen that this might be what master dark had set them all ahunting these past two weeks he didnt have any time to wonder about the prisoner for a few of the men set to stripping the bodies of their fellows and quarreling over the spoils while the rest shouted for food and drink damen gathered up the various bowls and battered cups that served as drinking vessels and balanced them in precarious stacks in his arms he passed among the men while they grabbed whatever was uppermost on the pile in his arms and filled their choice from the barrel atop the slab table in the center of the hall drink always came first in lord rendans hall sour and musty as the beer always was it was still beer and the men drank as much of it as they could hold damen returned to the hearth wrapped the toolong sleeves of his castoff shirt around his hands and grabbed the end of the spit nearest him heaving the halfraw haunch of venison off the fire it fell in the fire but the men would never notice a little more ash on the burned crust of the meat he staggered back to the table under his burden of flesh and heaved it with a splatter of juices up onto the surface beside the barrel on top of the remains of last nights meal those that werent too preoccupied with gulping down their second or third bowl of beer staggered over to the table to hack chunks off with their knives now the last trip the boy picked up whatever remained of the containers that hadnt been claimed as drinking vessels and filled them one at a time from the pot of peasepottage hed been tending he brought them dripping to the table and slopped them down beside the venison saving only one for himself he was not permitted meat until the last of the men had eaten their fill and he was not permitted beer at all he sat on his heels next to the hearth and watched the others warily gobbling his food as fast as he could cleaning the bowl with his fingers and then licking it and them bare of the last morsel too many times in the past one or more of the men had thought it good sport to kick his single allotted bowl of porridge out of his hands before hed eaten more than half of it now he tried always to finish before any of the rest of them did but tonight the men had other prey to occupy them as damen tossed his bowl to the side and wrapped his arms around his skinny legs lord rendan got up still chewing and strolled over to the side of the prisoner the man was showing some signs of life now moaning a little and twitching the lord kicked him solidly in the side and damen winced a little grateful that he wasnt on the receiving end of the blow then rendan reached down and untied the man who didnt seem to understand that hed been freed the man acted a great deal like rendans older brother had after his skull had been broken lord gelmar hadnt died not right away but he couldnt walk or speak and hed acted as if he was fallingdown drunk for more than a week before rendan got tired of it and had him taken outside careful rendan hes like t do ye one of the men called out not with that spell on im the lord laughed that powder master dark sent down with his orders was magicked this un can hear and see us but he cant do nothing he kicked the man again and the prisoner cried out scrabbling feebly in the dirt of the floor just what is this beggar anyway kef hairlip asked whats so bleedin important bout him that the master wants im alive an talkin ow come e ad us an ever other bunch twixt ere an the mountains lookin fer im tan twoknives answered before the lord could standing up with a leaky mug in one hand and one of his knives in the other kernos balls boy havent you never seen a herald before he hawked and spat a gobbet of phlegm that fell just short of the prisoners leg bloody bastards give us more troublen fifty kingsmen cross the border an stick their friggin noses inta everbodys business like they got nothin else tdo he shoved his knife back into his belt and swigged the last of his beer then slammed the mug down on the table and strode forward to prod the prisoner himself some of the others muttered they all looked avid greedy more than half the band had longstanding grudges against heralds damen knew that from the stories they told though few of them had ever actually seen one mostly theyd been on the receiving end of herald planned ambushes or counterraids or been kicked in the teeth by herald magic without ever seeing their foe facetoface heralds damen had reckoned at least until now were like the hawkmen of the deep woods you heard plenty of stories about them and maybe even saw some of what they did to others that crossed their path but if you were lucky you never encountered one yourself well now they had one and he didnt seem quite so formidable so whats the masters orders about this bastard rendan tan asked prodding the prisoner with his toe again hes gotta be alive and talkin but what else rendan crossed his arms and looked down at the man who had gone very silent and stopped moving he hasta be alive rendan said after a moment but the master didnt say no more than that the rewards th same whether or not hes feelin chipper tan smiled crookedly his yellowed and broken teeth flashing as he tucked his thumbs into his belt well if thats all he said whatdye say t gettin some of our own back eh damen nodded to himself and tucked himself back farther next to the fireplace in the damp corner that he called his own he knew that smile knew that tone of voice he blanked what had followed the last time he heard it out of his mind he did not want to remember i think thats a very good idea tan lord rendan replied with a matching smile he hauled the prisoner up by the front of his tunic and threw him to tan who held him up until he stood erect then punched him in the stomach with all his considerable strength the man doubled over and staggered backward toward rendan who leaned back against the table and kicked him toward one of the other men this amused them for a while but after everyone had a turn or two the novelty of having a victim who couldnt fight back and couldnt really react properly to the pain he was in began to bore them as damen had known it would eventually the only thing that actually did fight back was the thing the man had around his neck it had burned whoever tried to take it and eventually they left it on him tan was the last to give up he kneed the man in the groin and let him drop to the ground limbs twitching he stared at the herald for a long time before another slow smile replaced the scowl hed been wearing he picked up a piece of the fancy horseharness a blueleather strap embellished with silver brightwork and turned it around and around in his hands the prisoner moaned and tried to crawl away but succeeded only in turning over onto his back he opened blindlooking silver eyes and stared right at damen though there was no sign that he actually saw the boy there was a bruise purpling one cheekbone and his right eye was just beginning to swell but those injuries were nothing at all most of the blows had been to the vulnerable parts of the body and damen knew of men whod died from less than the herald had taken the herald closed his eyes again and made a whimpering sound in the back of his throat that seemed to make up tans mind for him he reached for the mans hair with one hand still holding the harnessstrap in the other ah ysweet little horsey hah tan rose from his knees breathing heavily refastening his breeches whos next he asked laughing which o ye stallions gon mount our little white mare little pupss goods a woman damen couldnt watch hed been in that position before when theyd first lured him out here and away from another band with promises of gold and feasting exactly the same position except that hed been forced over the bench not a saddle and hed been whipped and brutally tied with ropeends instead of harness that was what he had tried hard not to remember he curled up in his corner and buried his head in his arms trying to block it all out he could hide his eyes but there was nowhere to hide from the sounds the weak cries of pain the rhythmic grunts the soft wet sounds and throaty howls of pleasure the creak of leather and jingle of harness it aint me this time he said to himself over and over it dont matter it aint me he rubbed his wrists and stared in frightened paralysis at the floor remembering how the ropes had torn into his skin and how the men had laughed at his cries of agony and finally he managed to convince himself though he waited with shivering apprehension for the ones who hadnt yet had a turn to remember that he was in the hearthcorner and that the bench was still unoccupied not everyone had a taste for tans sport though either they werent drunk enough or the man wasnt young enough to tempt them or any other of a dozen possible reasons including that they still secretly feared the herald despite his present helplessness or they werent convinced that master dark would be pleased with the results of this little diversion they all forgot damen was even there those that joined tan in the helpless mans rape and those that simply watched and laughed then wandered off to drink themselves stuporous and fall into one of the piles of old clothing straw and rags that most of them used for beds finally even tan had enough the noises stopped except for a dull sound that could have been the heralds moaning or the wind damen dozed off then only to feel the toe of a boot prodding the sore spot on his rib cage from the last kick hed gotten he leapt to his feet cowering back against the wall blinking and shivering it was lord rendan again go clean that mess up boy he said jerking his chin at the huddled halfclothed shape just at the edge of the firelight clean him up then lock him in the storeroom damen edged past the lord then fumbled his way across the drunk and snoring bodies to where the prisoner still lay hed been trussed and gagged with the harness knees strapped to either end of the saddle and as a kind of cruel joke the silverywhite horsetail had been fastened onto his rump he was very thin even fragilelooking and his pale skin was so mottled with purple bruises he looked like the victim of some kind of strange plague damen struggled with the strange straps and buckles and finally got him free of the saddle but even after the boy had gotten him completely loose the prisoner wouldnt or maybe couldnt do anything but thrash feebly and moan deep in his chest damen tugged his clothing moreorless back into place but the herald didnt even notice he was there get im inta the storeroom e says owm i spposed t do that damen spat in disgust squatted on his heels to study the situation and finally seized the man by the collar and hauled him across the floor and through the storeroom door the lord lit a torch at the fire and brought it over examining the prisoner by its light the herald had curled upon his side in a fetal position and even damen could tell he was barely breathing they did im fer sure he thought it im too hard one way or tother e don look like es gonna last th night evidently lord rendan came to the same conclusion he cursed under his breath then threw the torch to the ground where it sputtered and went out damen waited for the accustomed kick or slap but the lord had more important matters to worry about when lord rendan wanted to make the effort he could have even hardened animals like tan jumping to his orders before damen could blink he had a half dozen men on their feet shaking in their patched and outatheel boots before the boy had any idea what the lord had in mind those men were out the door and into the cold and dark of the night the lord returned to the storeroom with another torch and stuck it into the dirt of the floor and to damens utter surprise lord rendan wrapped the prisoner in his own cloak and forced a drink of precious brandywine down his throat stay with him boy the lord ordered laying the man back down again keep him breathing because if he dont last till the healer gets here master dark is goin t be real unhappy damen began shivering and squatted down beside the man piling everything that could pass for a covering atop him he remembered what had happened to lord rendans younger brother the last time master dark had been unhappy with the band sometimes you could hear him screaming when the wind was right master dark had decided to recreate a legend about a demigod whose eyes were torn out and whose flesh was food for the birds by day and regrew every night not even tan ate crewliepie after that though the carrionbirds grew sleek and fat and prospered as never before no damen did not want master dark to be unhappy not ever old man brodie bent over and ran his hands along the roan colts off foreleg he let his healing senses extend carefully into the area of the break just below the knee and let the energy flow a few moments later he checked his progress bone callus good and under if hmm knitting nicely no more running about creekbeds for you my lad ill bet you learned your lesson this time he withdrew as carefully as his meager skills would allow him to the horse shuddered and champed at the unexplainable twinge in its leg sidled away from the old man then calmed ach too rough on leaving he regretted his lack of polish every day of his life since hed failed as a healer the way hed barely get a job done never completely or with anything approaching style and never without causing as much pain to his patient as he was trying to curepain which he shared and pain which he could after several years of it bear no longer his teachers had told him that he was his own worst enemy that his own fear of the pain was what made it worse and made him clumsy he was willing to grant that but knowing intellectually what the problem was and doing something about it proved to be two different matters and that hurt too finally he just gave up turned in his greens and walked north until the road ran out here where no one knew of his failure and his shame he set himself up as an animal healer making a great show of the use of poultices and drenches purges and doses to cover the fact that he was using his gift his greatest fear had been that someday someone would discover his deception and uncover what he had been he stood up cursing his aching back and the colt with the ready forgiveness of animals sidled up to him and nibbled his sleeve brodies breath steamed illuminated by the wan light from the cracked lantern suspended from the beam over his head he was glad the farmer had brought the colt into the barn it would have been hellish working on a break kneeling in the snow thatll do him geof brodie said slinging the bag that held his paymenta fat smokecured hamover his shoulder the farmer nodded brusquely doing his best to mask his relief at not having to put down a valuable animal he wont be any good for races and id keep him in the barn over winter if i was you but hell be pulling the plow like his dam come spring and a bad foreleg isnt going to give him trouble at stud the colt sniffed at the straw at his feet thankee brodie geof larimar said abandoning his pretense at calm when i found im allus i could think of was that is dams over twenty an what was i gonna do come spring if she failed on me i predate your comin out in th middle of th night an all i appreciate the ham brodie replied scratching the colts ears and id rather you called me when the injuries are fresh its easier to treat em that way i coulda swore that leg was broke though geof went on inexorably and brodie went cold all over he couldnt put a hair worth o weight on it bad light and being hailed out of bed are enough to fool any man brodie interrupted here feel the swelling he guided the farmers hand to the area hed just treated still swollen and hot to the touch from the increased blood flow hed forced there dislocation and a hell of a lot easier to put back in when its just happened than if hed had it stiffen overnight ah the farmer said nodding sagely thatd be why e couldnt put weight on it exactly brodie relaxed once again hed managed to keep someone off the track he yawned hugely well id best be on my way could stand a bit more sleep geof showed him out and walked with him as far as the gate from there brodie took the lonely little path through the creekbottom to his isolated hut not isolated enough he brooded that dark bastard managed to find me for he hadnt been able to keep his secret from everyone three years ago a handsome young man had come strolling up to his very door and proceeded to tell him with an amused expression everything he didnt want anyone to know then informed him that he would make all this public unless brodie agreed to do him a favor now and again the favors turned out to be healing an endless stream of ruffians and bandits who came to his door by night each bearing master darks token their injuries were always the kind gotten in combat brodie asked no questions and they never said anything but after the first two when it became evident that these patients were never better than thieves and often worse brodie began taking a twisted sort of satisfaction in his lack of skill where they were concerned it only seemed right that in order to be healed these cutthroats suffered twice the pain they would have if theyd recovered naturally brodie was altogether glad that it was the dead of winter he seldom saw more than two or three of them during the coldest months he squinted up at the sky first quarter moon and the sky as clear as crystal it would be much colder come dawn he heaved himself up the steep slippery side of the cut and onto the path that led to his hut and froze at the sound of a voice about time ye ol bastid growled a shadow that separated itself from a tree trunk and strode ruthlessly toward him time t pay yer rent agin th master needs ye eighteen what in kernos name did you do to him brodie spluttered white and incoherent with rage having to patch up one of these bastards was bad enough but being called on to save one of their halfdead victims presumably so that they could deliver similar treatment to him again it was more than brodie was willing to take silently the man was catatonic and just barely alive raped beaten to unconsciousness a cursory examination told brodie he was bleeding internally in a dozen places and only a wiry toughness that gave the lie to his fragile appearance had saved him from death before brodie ever got there the socalled lord rendan shrugged its none of your concern healer he growled master dark wants this man and he wants him alive and able to talk you heal him thats all you need to know youd better do a good job too or else rendan smirked showing a set of teeth as rotten as his soul and his lessthansubtle threat chilled brodies heart this was more than simple risk of exposure then this was his life that was in danger now but if he showed his fear working with beasts had taught him that displaying fear only makes the aggressor more inclined to attack get out of here and let me work in peace he growled hoping the flickering of the single candle rendan had brought into the storeroom hid the shaking of his hands animals the lot of you worse than animals not even a rabid pig would do something like this go on get out and ill see if anything can be done and leave the damned candle you think im an owl and send in the boy i may need him hes practically useless but the rest of you are worse rendan lost his smirk confronted by defiance where he didnt expect it demands where he expected acquiescence and reluctantly sidled out leaving brodie alone with his desperate work gods of light brodie didnt have to touch the man to know that it was a good thing he was unconscious every nerve was afire with pain brodie removed the heap of rags covering him carefully all too aware of how the least little movement would make what was agony into torture for both of them the man was already a strange one hair streaked with silver as any old gaffer yet plainly much younger and under the bruises was a face that would set maidens swooning when brodie got down to his clothing he frowned trying to remember where hed heard of white garments like this man wore something out of valdemar wasnt it kingsmen of some kind not harpersheralds whats a kingsman of valdemar doing outside his borders well it didnt much matter the mans labored breathing told brodie that if he didnt do something quickly this particular kingsman would be serving from under the sod all right you poor lad brodie thought nerving himself for the plunge lets see how bad you really are stefs throat was raw and his eyes swollen when he finally got control of himself again he scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand and carefully slowed his breathing oh gods control yourself look at the facts stef vans gone this isnt doing anybody any good hes not dead or thered be a body besides id know if he was dead that means they took him away somewhere they left a trail even i can follow which means wherever they took him i can find him and if i can find him maybe i can get him loose he took steady deep breaths of air so cold it made his lungs ache and looked up at the dark starstrewn sky night had fallen while hed cried himself senseless there was a clear quartermoon so he should have no trouble reading the trail the ambushers had left the moon was amazingly bright for the first quarter so bright he had no trouble making out little details like the drops of blood slowly oozing from the stump where poor yfandes tail had been chopped off suddenly his breath caught in his throat shes bleeding dead things dont bleed but if she isnt dead why does she look dead magic has to be and magics the only way theyd have taken van down like the magic that got savil and the others and since i didnt see anything that acted like a mage before i well that means it was probably a magic weapon something any fool could use probably something still here galvanized by the thought he began searching yfandes body meticulously thumblength by thumblength searching for something anything that might qualify as a weapon he wasnt certain what it would be except that he had a vague notion it might be something very like that leechdagger the ploy had worked once and people tended to repeat themselves another dagger maybe or an arrow almost a candlemark later he found what he thought might be what he was looking for a tiny dart hardly longer than the first joint of his index finger buried in yfandes shoulder hidden by her mane it tingled when he touched it in the way hed come to associate with magic maybe it wasnt what he thought it was but he gripped it as carefully as he could and pulled praying he wasnt leaving anything behind yfandes drew a great shuddering breath then another and suddenly stefen was bowled over backward into a heap of bloodstained snow as she surged to her feet and pivoted on her hindquarters teeth bared eyes rolling looking for a target her eyes met his brodie ignored the aches of his body the noisy breathing of the child beside him he found himself doing things he never thought he could driven by a rage that increased with every new injury he uncovered the young man had some slight gift of healing and a boundless store of energy which was certainly what had kept him alive all this time the feel of bluegreen healing power was unmistakable and brodie approached the mans injuries cautiously after he first passed the mans lowlevel shields and encountered it it was well that he did so dear gods everywhere he looked there was healing magic lowlevel but comprehensive there was a fine net of healing holding each critical hurt stable sealing off the worst of the bleeding keeping the swelling down brodie had to insinuate himself delicately into that net replacing its energies with his own but once he did that he found that he now had an awesome amount of power available to him such a tremendous amount that it was frightening he isnt a healer and i cant see that hes a mage much less an adeptclass but where in the gods names did he get this reservoir of power from what is he and why is it dark wants him but there was something subtly interfering with brodies own powers and keeping the man from doing anything effective about his hurts then brodie identified what it was when he finally had a breath to spare and could take a more leisurely look at the major repair work he had ahead of him for when he probed into the mans abilities beneath a shell of external blockage was something that brodie suspected had to be magegift though the blockage had it so sealed off that until then the healer had not seriously considered that the man might be a mage but magegift tied in and integrated with all the others in quite a remarkable way so that interference with it rendered the rest of the mans abilities ineffective or impaired brodie smiled withdrew a little and contemplated the external matrix of the spellblock from within it was perfectly smooth perfectly created to leave no crack and no opening that a mage so entrapped could use to break it open but from the outside that was a different story entirely the outside of the thing was rutted creviced and full of weak spots brodie had no doubt that even a simple healer like himself could find some way to break it open after all if a healer could get through another persons shields to treat him he ought to be able to break into a blockingspell providing he could find something his power could work on half the battle was being able to see what was wrong or so his teachers had always told him if you can see it you can act on it was the rule brodie had never heard of a healer breaking a spell but after all the things hed done so far things hed have sworn that he at least couldnt do he was willing to try this one the spell probably accounted for the mans catatonia and no one had ordered brodie not to interfere with it rendan had in fact told him to do whatever it takes he actually had permission if oblique to do exactly what he wanted to do he smiled again seeing the perfect revenge for everything rendan and master dark had done to him within reach for when this man came back to himself again and found he was no longer blocked i just cant heal him without cracking this thing he said aloud to the boy just on the chance that the child might be a spy for his master he savored the words as he spoke them my goodness i cant imagine what it could be for but its certainly keeping me from doing my job the boy scratched his head then caught and killed a flea crawling across his forehead he looked at the wall beyond the healer incuriously brodie smiled again the childs no more than he seems no one is going to interfere and with that he set himself to examining the spellnet energypulse by energypulse and found much sooner than he expected the point of vulnerability the spell was also tied into the mans physical condition rendering his sense of balance useless and confusing his other senses so that sight and sound were commingled and impossible to sort out the man would be seeing speech as well as hearing it for instance and hearing color as well as seeing it but where the spell touched on the physical the healer had a point where his power could affect it and since the spell was an integrated unit once a weakness was exploited the rest could be disintegrated and destroyed from within brodie laughed out loud formed his power into a bright green stilettopoint and set to work chiseling his way into the spell stef froze yfandes eyes were glowing a deep angry red that cast a faint red light on the white skin around them hed never seen or heard of anything like it it was a reflection of rage he guessed and he wasnt sure she even recognized him hed seen what those hooves could do where is he growled a female voice seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere he couldnt help himself he gasped and looked wildly around wondering how anyone had come up on him without him noticing its me bard yfandes stalked stiffly up to him and shoved his shoulder with her nose knocking him over sideways what happened to van where is he all i remember is being darted he stared at yfandes stunned she must be mindspeaking me but how i dont have the gift i dont know he said aloud i i ran away i know that boy she snorted mentally and physically which was exactly what van told you to do if youll exercise your damned memory and stop having a crisis of conscience and i can speak anyone i choose to its one of the abilities companions try not to use if theres any way around it now how much time have you been wasting were the bastards still around or were they gone when you came back here i uh they were gone he stammered clambering to his feet but they didnt exactly try to hide their trail he pointed at the trampled snow just beyond her she swung her head around then turned back to him how long she demanded again it isnt much past sunset now he gulped and continued bravely it was late afternoon when i found you i thought you were dead i just sort of tyreenas blessed ass you went into shock bard youve never seen combat youve never lost a beloved and you went into thricedamned shock you pulled yourself together which is more than i would have given you credit for being able to do now are you ready to come with me and save him he nodded unable to speak then tie off my tailslump so i dont leave a track for the wolves to follow and lets get on with it shall we she raised her head and her eyes continued to glow with that strange crimson light i cant sense him which probably means they had more than just the dart and hes spellblocked from me but hes not dead they couldnt kill him without my knowing stefen searched what little had been left behind and found a thong tied to the handle of a broken axe he approached her flank with trepidation the thong held out stiffly in front of him she swung her head in his direction and snorted again pelias tits bard im not a horse im not going to kick you get on with it he stumbled over the lumps of frozen snow in his haste but managed not to fall too heavily against her he could feel her muscles stiffening bracing herself to keep him erect until he regained his balance he tied the bleeding stump of her tail off as hard as he could felt her wincing a little but didnt quit binding it until the bleeding stopped she craned her neck and rump around to survey his handiwork and nodded with approval good gods that hurts though now have you ever ridden bareback no he replied well youre about to learn vanyel prowled the dark sheltered corner of his mind that was the only place free of pain the only place that was still his and his rage seethed with all the redhot pent fury of a volcano about to erupt periodically he tested his bonds but they never yielded and he was forced to retreat again he wanted revenge he wanted to feel those others die beneath the lash of his anger as the construct had died he wanted to hear them shriek in pain and fear he wanted to destroy them so utterly that there would not even be a puff of ash to blow away on the breeze when he was finished and there was nothing he could do the spell confusing his senses was too strong to break out of even when theyd freed his hands and feet hed been unable to act on that freedom whoever had sent that spell powder had known what van was capable of and had integrated magicblocking with mindmagicblocking until there was nothing he could use to lever himself out of his encapsulation whoever no this could only be the work of his enemy no one else knew him so well knew his weaknesses as well as his strengths and vanyel had tipped his hand by using fetching to retrieve the construct telling his enemy in effect exactly what he was dealing with he cursed himself for having the stupidity to play right into his enemys hands and his anger built until that was all there was white rage and the hunger to kill then suddenly one of the walls he had been flinging himself against vanished giving him the opening he needed he burst his mageborn bonds and roared up out of himself wild as a rabid beast every deadly weapon in his arsenal sharp and ready and looking only for a target any target stef found that riding bareback at least on yfandes was not as hard as hed thought it would be moon or no in broad daylight melody had stumbled and missed paces and he had no idea how yfandes was finding her way in the neardarkness she flowed along the rough ground like a scenthound nose to the ground relying on him to keep watch for enemies what he was supposed to do about those enemies he had no idea snow had blown over the tracks they were following once they got up out of the sheltered hollow where theyd been ambushed that didnt seem to bother yfandes much only once did she cast about herself for the trail when they came up on a large meadow silver and seamless under the moonlight with a stiff breeze still scudding snow across it in sinuously snaking lines she looked out over the white expanse and circled around the edge under the trees until she came to a place where she could pick the trail up again stef felt entirely useless just a piece of baggage on yfandes back you wont be useless when we find them came the dry unsolicited voice in his head you may be more involved than youd prefer now will you kindly think of snow please what he replied startled youre broadcasting distress to anyone able to pick up thoughts and that distress is very much centered on van i dont think they have a real mage or mindgifted with them but we darent take the chance so will you please think about snow or concentrate on how cold you are those are ordinary enough thoughts that they shouldnt give us away he huddled down a little farther into his cloak and did as he was told looking up at the thin clouds drifting over the moon shivering every time the breeze found its way down the back of his neck or in the armslit of his cloak he tried very hard to concentrate on how miserable he was feeling on how he wished he was sitting beside a roaring fire with wine mulling on the hearth and vanyel dammit with wine mulling on the hearth and nowhere to go or sinking into a warm featherbed he stopped that one before it started or standing before a feastinghall crowded with adoring listeners his stomach full of a fine dinner and better wine and his ears full of praise he managed to dwell on that image for quite some time until a particularly sharp gust of wind cut right through his cloak and gave him more thoughts of cold and misery to dwell on he managed to feel quite sorry for himself before too very long and dwelling on his own unhappiness made it a lot easier to forget van and what their attackers might be doing to him it seemed as if theyd been traveling for an awfully long time though its nearly dawn fandes said but thats not too surprising i hardly expected them to ambush us too near their own stronghold the trail is getting very fresh though and she stopped suddenly and flung her head up to catch the breeze hitting him in the face with the back of her skull and nearly knocking his front teeth out sorry theyre near i smell woodsmoke heated stone burned venison and them get down and well take this quietly theres bound to be a sentry but whether itll be on the walls or outside them lets hope its outside stef thought flexing his stiff hands then sliding off her back to land kneedeep in snow we wont be able to get past him if theres a sentry on the wall and i dont know the first thing about taking one out he let yfandes lead the way picking his feet up carefully to keep from falling over anything finally she stopped right on the edge of a screening of bushes careless lazy or stupid she said and for a moment he wondered if she meant him theyve let all this undergrowth spring up on the edge of their clearing she continued her mindvoice thick with contempt we can come right up to the walls without anyone ever seeing us ah there he is stef look up there just above the door see him stef picked his way up to the bushes and looked sure enough there was something there pacing back and forth a little a shadow among shadows on the top of a wall that even in the dim moonlight showed severe neglect the squarebuilt keep would not have lasted a candlemark in a siege thats the sentry and thats the only one they have she paused a moment now what that means is that this is probably the only way into the building which is not very good for us i could just walk up there he offered im a bard i could just pretend im a traveling minstrel in the dead of winter the middle of nowhere minstrels dont travel in winter if they can help it how the blazes did you get out here and why did you come they may be stupid but theyre probably suspicious bastards uh i could say i was turned out of my post she snorted have you seen any great houses since three days before the border my inn then the innkeepers wife and i why here this isnt a very promising place its all but falling to pieces im cold and hungry and i wouldnt care if it was the first place i saw with people and food and fire wait she raised her head to look over his somethings happening with no more warning than that the center of the building went up with an earnumbing roar in a sheet of red and green flames stef squeaked and hid his eyes with his forearm then peeked under the crook of his elbow the entire front of the building had burst outward in the time hed hidden his eyes the door was splinters and the right side of the keep had already collapsed outward there were screams but no sign of fire and stef realized then that what hed just seen was an explosion of magepower get on yfandes ordered and he scrambled onto her back she didnt even wait this time until hed settled himself she just leapt through the bushes with the bard clinging to her mane and trying desperately to get a grip on her with his legs she raced across the small expanse of clear ground between the bushes and the keep and crashed through what was left of the door coming to an abrupt halt just inside he blinked his eyes burning from the foul smoke blowing into them and tried to make out what was going on here inside the building there were fires small ones furniture burning piles of rags smoldering men with horror and nausea stefen realized that fully half of what he had thought were burning piles of flotsam were actually burning bodies aflame with the same bloodred fires van had used to destroy the raventhing and some of the piles were thrashing and screaming he tumbled from yfandes back as she pivoted lashing out with hooves and teeth at a man running by he tried to make some sense of the confusion looking without consciously realizing he was doing so for van and then the fires rose higher reflecting off a single figure the red glare concealing until this moment the fact that the man wore shredded whites scarlet magefires turned his whitestreaked hair into a cascade of ripping shadow threaded with blood just beyond a group of terrified men crouched against the far wall cowering away from him some pleading some simply trying to melt into the stone of the wall in numb fear vanyel stef shouted the herald turned around for a moment but a movement by one of the men he had cornered made him turn back to face them it was vanyel but not a van that stefen recognized like yfandes his eyes and the magefocus around his neck glowed an identical angry red and beneath the glow the eyes were not sane his clothing was tattered and bloodstained and his face disfigured with bruises but it was not that mistreatment that made him impossible to identify it was those furious mad eyes eyes which held nothing in common with humanity at all vanyel gestured and one of the men shivering against the wall jerked upright and stumbled toward him as he did so the last of the screaming stopped though the fires continued to burn in eerie silence in that silence the mans whimpering pleas for mercy were sickeningly clear vanyel laughed what mercy did you grant me scum he replied in a soft conversational voice it seems to me that i remember you it seems to me that you were the first and the last to sate yourself little white mare i believe you called me he gestured again and the bandit stooped like a clumsilycontrolled marionette and picked something up from the floor it was the splintered end of a spearshaft ragged but as sharp as anything of metal the bandits arms jerked again and the jagged end of it was placed against his stomach the bandits eyes widened his mouth opened but nothing emerged there was a popping sound and as the point of the wood penetrated the bandits clothing stefen realized with horror that vanyel was forcing the brigand to disembowel himself controlling his body with mindmagic no he screamed van no he flung himself between the two and faced that frightening mask of insanity his hands held out in pleading van youre a herald no matter what they did to you you cant do that to him the red glow died from vans eyes for a moment then his jaw hardened and something like an invisible hand pushed stefen out of the way the bard stumbled and fell to the filthy floor but was up again in a breath and right back between the herald and his victim the brigand fell onto his back writhing then stiffened as vanyel stepped forward van van dont if you do this youll be just as bad as he is dont let him do that to you dont let them make you into something like they are vanyel froze with his hand still outstretched then the angry red glow faded first from his eyes then from the pendant at his breast he blinked and sanity returned to his face he looked around at the carnage he caused and his face spasmed his mouth twisted as if he was going to be sick but his eyes went to two bodies beside a storeroom door and stayed there one of those bodies was that of an old man with the kind of pouch an herbhealer often carried spilled out on the floor beside him the other body was too small to be an adult it had to be a child vans posture betrayed him tense and legs slightly bent hes going to bolt stef realized wondering if he could tackle the herald before he broke and ran no hes not yfandes said firmly and interposed herself between vanyel and the door something broke open and suddenly stef felt what vanyel was feeling absolute revulsion at the deaths the massacre he had caused despair at the knowledge that he had killed at least one innocent two if the boy could be counted in that category contemptible worse than contemptible hateful insane under the selfloathing the fear that yfandes and stef would both repudiate him would hate him for what hed done and cast him out of their lives and hearts no van stef walked carefully toward him slowly with yfandes maneuvering to keep vans escape blocked listen to me its not your fault you were in pain your mind was confused you werent able to think of anything except hurting them back thats part of you everybody has that as a part of them youre not a god above mistakes its just a part of you that you lost control of for a little if it had been me id probably have done a lot worse things than you did fandes herded the herald in close enough that stef could get vanyel in his arms he did so before van could evade his embrace the herald shuddered all over his body like a terrified animal weve a problem bard yfandes said grimly theres a lot worse damage than we thought and through her powers she permitted him a glimpse of a little of what had been done to van a glimpse that suddenly made vans speech about being sated and little white mares understandable stefen choked and then had to make a conscious effort to start breathing again the bandits seemed to realize that vanyel was no longer a threat and began slipping past the three of them to vanish into the thin gray light of dawn beyond the walls stef ignored them they didnt matter what mattered was van he held vanyel but not in a way that would confine him lightly and tried to send back love along the link between them the last of the brigands the man whod nearly impaled himself at vanyels command crawled toward the shattered door leaving a bloodsmeared trail he scrambled to his feet when he reached it and tumbled out of sight beyond a pile of toppled stone blocks i dont think hell live long out there stefen thought i cant really admit to caring much if he does gray light filled the hollow of the wrecked hall and the magefires died and went out leaving smears of black ash where the burning bodies had been vanyel stood shivering and tense in stefens arms while the sun rose over the walls of the keep finally as the sun touched his bloodsoaked tangled hair he collapsed into stefs embrace yes stefen thought weve won the first round it wont be the last yfandes said smoldering anger beneath her words theyve broken him then its up to us to put him back together come on vanyel he said softly lets go lets get you somewhere warm and safe stef found the tack and the configurations it had been twisted into made him tight with anger he managed to get it all untangled got yfandes saddled and bridled then she knelt and van practically fell into her saddle ld ask you to put the supports on him she said after she stood up again but i have a pretty good idea stef answered her wishing that the bandit van had nearly impaled hadnt gotten away im nowhere near as innocent as van still thinks i am hed just get thrown back to last night if he felt restraints vanyel had fallen into a halfstupor shock stef guessed and at this point the last thing he wanted to do was rouse him i can walk beside and steady him in the saddle if you dont go too fast he told the companion good thank you she moved off a few steps hows that that will do he kept one hand in the small of vanyels back holding his swordbelt and one clutching the front of vans saddle now if stefen tripped he wouldnt fall and take van with him where are we going he asked as she led him through the wreckage of the doorway and into the sunlight several trails of footprints led away from the place and she looked around for a moment anywhere except where those lead she replied finally other than that i really dont know perhaps white sister said a strange very dry voice you should determine a direction before setting out the bushes directly ahead of them rustled and something largevery largestepped out from among them perhaps i can help the voice continued stef groped after a knife his eyes fixed on the creature his heart right in his throat this beast whatever it was looked something like a wolf but was much bigger than any wolf stef had ever heard of or seen its shoulder was as tall as his waist it had a thin rangy body with long legs and a head with a very broad rounded forehead forwardfacing eyes and jaws dear gods that thing could bite my arm in half and never notice i could singer but i wont the thing lolled out its tongue in a canine grin i see you recognize my folk white sister tell him thats a kyree stef a neuter i think yfandes bowed her head to the creature and stef relaxed marginally one with a very powerful gift of mindspeech or you wouldnt be able to hear him er it indeed right on all counts the kyree padded elegantly across the snow toward them i am the farranger for the hot springs clan i felt the magic and i came we are like in power white sister and you know my kind can i give you a direction do you know the tayledras she asked the kyree nodded we have a treaty with them all clans of the folk this one is wingbrother to ktreva she tossed her head at her rider he raised his head and peered keenly at vanyel then we are honorbound to give you more than direction we must give you aid and shelter though of my own will he added over his shoulder as he turned i would have done so anyway his lip lifted as he sniffed audibly the things here were a foul uncleanly folk and the world is well rid of them in time they might have been a danger to my clan yfandes followed the kyree beneath the trees where it turned northward i am yfandes this is stefen and my chosen is vanyel she said formally the kyree looked back over its shoulder for a moment i am aroon he replied just as formally there is deep mindhurt with the one you call your chosen stef felt yfandes shoulder muscles relax a little yes have you a mindhealer among your clan i fear not aroon replied regretfully yet the talents of the singer and yourself and the safety of our caves may suffice do not count the prey escaped until it wings into the sky i think you should know sir stef said hesitantly that the men that were here served someone who is our enemy hes killed a lot of people and hes a very powerful mage adeptclass easily yfandes interjected i doubt very much that hell be pleased with the way things have turned out and he wont hesitate to kill you if you give us shelter and protection stef took a deep breath afraid this would mean the creature would change its mind yet feeling better that hed told the kyree about the dangers involved the dry voice warmed a great deal we have often been called insular and isolationist aroon replied and there is some truth to that but if the one you speak of would indeed kill those of whom he knows nothing to achieve his vengeance on you then he is our enemy as well and you are well deserving of our protection and as the tayledras and the white sister will tell you that is not inconsiderable particularly for a clan with a winged one yfandes heaved a great sigh you have a shaman then indeed the kyree chuckled comparable to your adeptclass and i doubt me that this enemy of yours has ever encountered the magic of the folk if he can even find you on this continent i would be greatly surprised so tell me all that you know of him warned ahead is armed ahead yfandes touched vans leg with her nose before answering they called him master dark sunset saw them entering the mouth of the cavecomplex that the kyree called home in the foothills of the very mountains vanyel had been aiming for to stefens considerable amazement the caves were not dark they were lit by glowing balls of light of many colors each one so aroon told them representing the last lifeenergy of a kyree shaman created before he she or it passed out of the world the blue are those that were mages he told them as he led them through a gathering crowd of curious kyree that had gotten word of their arrival the kyree didnt press about them or hinder them in any way but stef felt their eyes on him alight with a lively curiosity the green aroon continued those that were healers the yellow those that were godtouched and the red those that had mostly mindmagic the globes of softly glowing light showed stef wonders hed have been glad to stop and examine more closely if he hadnt been so worried about van stone icicles grew toward stone tree trunks stone pillars flowed toward the ceiling on either hand stone curtains as rippling and fluid as real fabric cloaked off farther chamberslight from globes behind them showed that and the light passing through them made stef catch his breath in wonder at their beauty and it was warm down here and getting warmer whats making it so warm stef asked throwing his cloak back and taking off his scarf the springs aroon told him we have both hot and cold springs here i shall ask you while you stay here that you light no fires the smoke will be trapped you see and cause us difficulties but do not fear the winters cold or that you must eat your food raw there is one spring fully hot enough that you may cook meat in it and as for the white sister i think we can provide id worried about that she admitted tubers grain that we shall fetch from those humans greedy enough to deserve being robbed and mushrooms that we grow ourselves he laughed silently we are not wholly carnivores im relieved to hear it yfandes began when they passed beneath a smooth nearly circular arch and into an enormous cavern centered with a stone formation so incredible stef could hardly take it in the kyree apparently appreciated it as well for it was surrounded by glowing lights placed to display it best the thing looked like some kind of incredible temple but one that had grown rather than been built at the foot of this enormous structure lay a snowwhite kyree one with eyes as blue as yfandes stef saw when they approached her closely forgive me for not rising the kyree whispered into their thoughts but i am fatigued from cloaking your arrival she chuckled something i am sure you appreciate i am hyrryl the shaman of the hot springs clan be welcome yfandes bowed as deeply as she could without dislodging van our thanks gracious lady stef said for them both my thanks for your honesty with aroon i think that first to warm you from your journey and to cleanse you the springs would be the best place for all of you she looked up at the semiconscious herald appraisingly you have one deeply hurt the healing will not be easy stef finally blurted out what hed been thinking since they met aroon lady i dont think i can im just a bard i dont know anything about about healing something like this i you are one who loves and is beloved she replied gravely that is not the answer to everything but it will give you a beginning you are a bard and you are practiced with words use that words can heal words and love together can more often achieve what magic cannot aroon bowed and moved away then yfandes followed and stef had no choice but to go along as they left that cavern for another stef noticed it was getting hotterand there was a great deal of moisture in the air shortly after that he knew why as they emerged into a cave filled with multileveled hot springs yfandes stopped beside one that steamed invitingly lit from above by a globe as yellow as sunshine get him down stef strip him and get him into the water and get into there yourself then do what seems best why he asked doing as he was told im going with aroon hyrryl is a healer and i need that gift right now dont worry ill be back and if van starts having problems ill be there in a blink he stripped vanyel of his boots shirt and tunic hesitated over the underbreeches and decided to leave them on yfandes turned and headed wearily back toward the cavern entrance and stef saw how she limped the cuts he hadnt noticed before in his anxiety for van how worn and exhausted she looked and decided not to ask her to stay even though he felt badly in need of her support all right ashke he said quietly as he slipped van down into the hot water and the herald started to revive from the stupor hed been in lets see if words and love really are enough life in the kyree caverns had a curious dreamlike quality to it stef ate when he was hungry slept when he was weary and forced himself to put all thoughts of time and urgency out of his mind any weakness in vanyel would be fatal once he left the caverns master dark would surely be eager to have them in his hands and sooner or later they had to leave the protection and hospitality the kyree clan was providing them yfandes helped helped a great deal in fact but it became very obvious that since most of vans mental and emotional trauma stemmed from the brutal serial rape hed suffered it was his lover that would have to be the prime mover in helping him become whole again stef discovered a patience in himself that he had never once suspected he took things so slowly that it was frequently yfandes who fretted at the pace he was setting sometimes van needed to be alone more than he needed either of them when that happened stef took himself off to some other cavern and made yfandes come with him there he usually found himself surrounded by kyree all as hungry for music as any group of humans hed ever encountered he didnt have an instrument but they considered his voice instrument enough theyd accompany him with surprisingly complex rhythms tapped out on skin drums made for the use of paws and tails and a low crooning drone they sang deep in their chests their sound was so unique it filled him with a compulsion he would never have expected it made him want to compose something for them something to use their distinct sound he soaked with vanyel in the hot springs yfandes lying in the heat nearby it was days before van could bear to have stef touch him and far longer for anything more and sometimes stef was so tied up inside with frustration longing and emotions so confused he couldnt sort them out himself that hed go off to some dark corner and cry himself hoarse hyrryl would find him there and when he was ready he would talk to her for hours as van talked to him never minding that his was the only voice and she ran on four feet instead of two she spoke to him in strong affectionate terms and gently encouraged him to continue his songcarving with the kyree he was flattered and admitted that it actually seemed to be helping him more than it was entertaining the clan hyrryl closed her eyes and chuckled silently assuring him wordlessly not to be too sure about that stefen found himself telling her everything about his life over the days many things he had never told vanyel and some things hed never before thought of as significant he often wondered if van ever confided in her as well but if he did stef never learned of it then one night van sought his solitary bed not for loving but for comfort which was by far the harder for him to need again the comfort of arms around him and the trust to sleep in the same bed as someone else and from that moment there was no turning back nineteen vanyel had called a private meeting of the three of them as soon as he felt he was ready to face the world again aroon had directed them to a small sidechamber lit only by a single green globe all right vanyel said quietly sitting crosslegged against a stone pillar sipping at a tin cup rescued from his saddlebags full of cold water heres what were up against he looked from stefs troubled eyes to yfandes calm ones at least i had enough sense to clean out rendans mind before i killed him even if i didnt do it in the approved manner i got all this from ransacking the bandit lords thoughts this mage this master dark has been operating for a long long time vanyel sat back and grasped his crossed ankles nervously rendans father served him in fact this past year he actually began recruiting bandit groups seriously but before that he had at least four or five along the border at any one time why stef asked puzzled whats the point if hes up past the mountains and were down here because he didnt plan to stay there yfandes replied van nodded and ran his hand through his hair exactly as i said hes been operating a long time long enough that he began all this before elspeth was born the northlands are harsh cold and populated mostly by nomadic hunters and caribou herders he wanted power over somewhere more civilized valdemar yfandes cocked her head sideways why us because this is a guess mind the pelagirs are protected by the tayledras and iftel was too tough a nut to crack he smiled crookedly iftel is very quiet unless you rouse them and that deity of theirs whatever it is takes a very proprietary and active interest in the wellbeing of its people not even a circle of adeptclass mages wants to tackle a god i could wish we could get it to act beyond its borders so he decided he wanted valdemar stef sat in the far corner and mended vans tunic with careful tiny stitches some of the gear had been retrieved with yfandes saddlebags but most was lost and vanyel hadnt wanted to go back for it whats he been doing about it hes been killing heralds van said bluntly but doing it so carefully that no one ever suspected rendan knew a fair amount more than he ever told his men rendans father was in a real position to know a great deal since he had enough magegift to be useful to master dark vanyel knew a great deal more than that since he hadnt been exactly concerned with ethics at the time hed raped rendans mind away from him in a heartbeat he couldnt subvert us he couldnt take us on openly so he destroyed us singly the heraldmages were the easiest for him to identify at a distance and the ones he considered most threatening and i was right hes been killing children and trainees making it look like accidents for a very long time now getting the children the moment their magegift manifested if he could like tylendel like me hes been doing this for years without detection vanyel continued and the only reason he tipped his hand with me is because i was a different and more powerful mage than he expected and because im the last he didnt have to worry about detection by the others and he really wanted me out of the way and and stef prompted vanyel closed his eyes a moment and because hes ready hes bringing his forces down here to invade rendan didnt know when but probably this spring he was lying and he knew it so did yfandes but she didnt call him on it all those dreams the ones of dying in the pass they werent allegories for something else they were accurate but i still dont know when hes coming through if i go get help now it could be too late to stop him one mage can hold him and however many troops and minor mages he has with him if its done in the pass but an army couldnt stop him if he makes it to the other side and the forest so what are we going to do get help stef asked looking relieved vanyel shook his head no not until ive got accurate information were going up through crookback pass so i can see what hes got thats why ive been fighting myself love i knew just as well as you did that any weakness would give him an opening to destroy me and that includes wanting vengeance van felt strangely calm whatever came he hoped he was ready he had tried to deal with all his fears alone and what he had left was resignation and purpose he hoped it would be enough to carry him through what was to come master dark had to be stopped if it would take a sacrifice of one to stop him vanyel would willingly be that sacrifice yfandes understood she too had fought for valdemar and the people of valdemar all her life but van didnt think stef would so stef wouldnt learn the truth until it was too late this was something quite different from the need for revenge that had driven him up here he didnt hate master dark with the allconsuming passion that had eaten him as well he hated coldly what the mage had done and what he wanted to do valdemar was in peril but more than that if this mage was permitted to take valdemar he would move on to other realms yfandes and hyrryl agreed iii cherish the time i have left and ill stop him however it takes and if my death is what it takes ill call final strike on him not even an adept can survive that all right stef agreed reluctantly if thats what you want thats what well do van smiled a little sadly thank you ashke i was hoping youd say that stef trudged alongside of yfandes with vanyel walking on the other side both of them holding to her saddlegirth so that she could help them over the worst obstacles the path was kneedeep in snow and wound through stony foothills covered in virgin forest fallen limbs and loose rocks provided plenty of things to stumble over crookback pass was so near the kyree caverns that hyrryl and aroon were visibly agitated to learn of master darks plans the pass was the southernmost terminus of the only certain way through the mountains that anyone knew at least in valdemar stef looked over fandes back at the herald toiling along with his head down and the sun making a halo of the silver strands in his hair van caught him at it and gave him one of those peculiar sad smiles hed been displaying whenever he looked at stef lately van had been very strange since hed recovered loving dear gods yes but preoccupied inwardfocused and a little melancholy but quite adamantly determined on this expedition so far it had been fairly easy except for the heavy snow and the odd boulder the kyree kept this area of the forest free of snowcats and wolves and it was really quite beautiful if you had leisure to look at it which they didnt both van and yfandes seemed determined to get up to the pass as quickly as possible with only one riding beast melody had vanished completely and stef only hoped shed found her way to some farm and not down a wolfs throat the only way to make any time was to do what they were doing both of them walking but using fandes strength to get them over the worst parts the hills theyd been traversing got progressively steeper and rockier and by midafternoon they were in the mountains just below the pass itself that was when vanyel called a halt stef was afraid that van was going to insist on a cold camp but he didnt they searched until they found a little halfcave then spent the rest of the time until dark searching out dead wood with the provisions the kyree had given them more dead rabbits than stef had ever seen at one time in his life and the fire van started they had a camp that was almost as comfortable as the kyree caves stef would have preferred a real bed over the pine boughs and their own cloaks but that was all theyd have van smiled at him from across the fire the damage to his clothing and person a bit less noticeable in the dim firelight sorry about the primitive conditions ashke but id rather not let him know we were coming any display of magic will do that if hes still trying to guess where we are ill be a lot happier stef tore another mouthful of meat off his rabbitleg wiped the grease from the corners of his mouth and nodded thats all right i dont mind im just glad youre not after him the way you were and id rather he didnt know where we were either im just glad were finally going to get this over with then we can go home and just be ourselves for a while vanyel blinked rapidly then pulled off his glove and rubbed his eyes smokes bad on this side he coughed then said softly stef youve been more to me than i can tell you youve made me so happy happier than i ever thought id be i never did as much for you as id have liked to and if it hadnt been for you back there i stef scooted around to vans side of their tiny fire tell you what he said cheerfully ill let you make it up to me hows that for a bargain vanyel smiled and blinked i might just do that by midafternoon of the third day they were into real mountains though sunlight still illuminated the tops of the whitecovered peaks around them down on the trail they were in chill gloom stef shivered and hoped theyd be stopping soon then they rounded a curve in the trail and crookback pass stretched out before them a long narrow valley it was as clean a cut between two ranks of mountains as if a giant had cut it with a knife too clean stef took a closer look at the sides of the pass the rock faces looked natural enough until about ten manheights above the floor of the pass from there down they were as sheer as if they had been sliced and as regular magic van whispered he must have carved every difficult pass from here back north this way dear gods think of the power think of what it took to mask the power he looked up above the area that had been carved if we walk along the floor of the pass well be walking right into the path of of anything coming along stef looked where he was looking and saw what looked like a thin thread of path is that the original pass up there do you think van nodded look see where it joins the route were on this is the original trail right up until this point then the old trail climbs and the new one stays level stef studied the old trail what he could see of it you couldnt bring an army along that at least not quickly but you can on this van studied the situation a moment longer lets take the old way as far as we can we might have to turn back but id rather try the old route first id feel too exposed otherwise stef sighed seeing his hopes for an early halt vanish all right but if i spend the night camped on a ledge i wont be responsible for my temper in the morning van turned suddenly and embraced him so fiercely that stef thought he heard ribs crack its not your temper im worried about ashke he whispered its you i dont want anything to happen to you i need that to know youre safe if i know that i can do anything i have to then just as suddenly as he had turned he released the bard lets get going while theres still light he said and began picking his way over the rocks to the old trail yfandes nudged stef with her nose and he took his place behind van with the companion bringing up the rear from then on he was too busy watching where he put his feet to worry about anything else the trail was uneven icy and treacherous strewn with spills of boulders that marked previous rockslides after they came across one pile that had what was clearly a skeletal hand protruding from beneath it stef started looking up nervously at every suspicious noise and to add to the pleasure of the climb the right side of the trail very frequently dropped straight down to the new cut it was not an experience stef ever wanted to repeat although for the first time in days or the daylight at least he wasnt cold the opposite in fact there was something to be said for the exertion of the climb after all night fell but the full moon was already high in the sky and vanyel elected to push on by its light they were about halfway across the pass and according to the kyree there was a wide flat meadow on the other side and a goodsized stand of trees that meant firewood and a place to camp safe from avalanche stef was very much looking forward to anything wide and flat his back and legs ached like theyd never hurt before and once the sun was down the temperature dropped his labor was no longer enough to keep him warm and his hands were getting numb just one more rise bard yfandes whispered into his mind then its downhill suddenly vanyel dropped flat and stef did the same without asking why he crawled up beside the herald who had taken shelter behind a thin screening of scrawny bushes vanyel turned a little and saw him coming put his finger to his lips and pointed down stef wriggled up a little farther so he could see expecting a scouting party or some such thing below them instead he saw an army they covered the meadow the snow was black with them and they were not camped for the night there were no bivouacs no campfires just rank after rank of men lined up like a childs toy soldiers stef wondered what they were waiting for then saw that there was movement at the farther edge of the meadow where the next stretch of the trail began more men were pouring into the meadow with every candlemark and they were probably waiting for the last of them to join the rest before making the last push through the mountains by night so that no prying eyes would see them master dark was bringing his army into valdemar and there was nothing on the northern border that could even delay them once they came across the pass vanyel wriggled back stef followed him what are we stef whispered in a panic van placed his finger gently on stef s lips silencing him youre going to alert the guard post yfandes will take you and with only you on her back shell be able to do anything but fly ill hold them right here until the guard comes up but stef protested its not as stupid an idea as it sounds van said looking back over his shoulder back there where the old trail meets the new one mage can hold off any size army and if the guard can come up quickly enough one detachment can keep that army bottled up on the trail below the pass for as long as it takes for the rest of the army to get here but none of that is going to work if i dont stop them now here stef wanted to object but he couldnt vanyel was right even a bard could see that this was a classic opportunity and a classic piece of strategy and master dark couldnt possibly have anticipated it youd better just stef began fiercely and couldnt continue for the tears that suddenly welled up dammit van i vanyel took stefs face in both hands and kissed him with such fierce passion that it shook the bard to his marrow i love you too youre absolutely the best friend the dearest love ive ever had ill love you as long as theres anything left of me now go quickly i wont have my whole attention on what im doing if youre not safe stef backed away then flung himself on yfandes back before he could change his mind hang on she ordered and he had barely enough time to get a firm grip on the saddle with hands and legs when she was off vanyel watched them vanish with the speed only a companion could manage just short of flying stef weighed far less than he did which should improve yfandes progress then he climbed down the sheer slope to the floor of the new trail he had to make the best possible time to get to the end and the bottleneck and the only way he was going to be able to do that would be to take the easiest way getting down was the hard part when he got there he found that the ground was planed so evenly that he could run first he began a weathermagic that would bring in the clouds he sensed just out of sight then run he did he was out of breath by the time he reached his chosen spot but he had plenty of leisure time to recover when he got there in fact the worst part was the waiting he had placed himself right where the old trail made that sharp turn into the new and they wouldnt be able to see him until they were right on top of him and he couldnt see them which made things worse he tried not to look around too much this was the exact setting of his dreams and he didnt want to be reminded of how they had all ended foresight is just seeing the possible future he reminded himself probing beneath the skin of the land for nodes and setting up his taplines now filtering them through his magefocus so that the power would be attuned to him and he wouldnt have to use it raw moondance told me that ages ago and if anyone would know the tayledras would the first dream was almost twenty years ago things have to have altered since then and if i remember what happened in them i may be able to alter the outcome some of those dreams even had lendel in them with me instead of stef twenty years lendel had died at seventeen van had met stef when the bard was seventeen there was time enough between lendels death and now stef was exactly the right age to have been born about that time more things sprang to mind the dreamtime encounter with lendelthe things he had said the way the tayledras treated stef and the way savil had taken the bard under her wing after that it was all beginning to make a pattern the way he called me ashke without ever knowing the word no yes what other answer is there he came back to me lendel came back as stef somehow and savil and the hawkbrothers knew but there was no opportunity to think about this revelation for the first of master darks forces had just begun to round the bend in the trail and it was time to put his plans into motion as little bloodshed as i can manage particularly with the fighters they could be spellbound ignorantwhatever the clouds he had been calling loomed above the mountains hiding the peaks and full of lightningcrackles just waiting to be released vanyel was happy to oblige them he called lightnings down out of them to lash the ground just ahead of the first rank as he simultaneously illuminated himself with a blinding blue glare of magelight the lightning exploded the trail in front of him the icecovered rocks screaming as the powerful force lashed them heating them enough to turn the ice into steam in an eyeblink vanyel kept his eyes sheltered by his forearm so that he alone was not blinded the first ranks of the forces were however blackarmored men stumbled blindly forward pushed by the ranks behind them shouting in fear and anger all right thats one point of difference from the dreams already i fought them magicagainstweaponry i didnt intimidate them right off the chaos calmed as vanyel stood ready energies making his magefocus glow the same blue as the light behind him his hands tingling with power the ranks of armed men and strange beasts stirred restively the fighters watching him through the slits in their helms in this much too the dreams had been right under the armor they were a motley lot and only half of them looked human but they were armed and armored with weapons and protection made of some dull black stuff and carried identical round unornamented black shields and the stumbling chaos he had caused had been righted in short order that argued for a great deal of training together this was the army he had taken it for the ranks in front parted as in the dreams and a wizard stepped through there was no doubt of what he was he was unarmed and unarmored and the power sat heavily in him making him glow sullenly to magesight but it was the power of bloodmagic as was the power of the second the third and the fourth fourtoone then master dark to follow vanyel flexed his fingers and hoped yfandes had gotten stef to safety by now lets see if these lads know how to work together or if i can divide them stefen hung on and closed his eyes fighting his own panic hed never been on or even near anything going this fast before the ground rushing by his feet and the violent lurching as yfandes leapt obstacles were making him sick and frightened with the kind of fear that no rational thought was going to overcome they had already covered the same amount of ground that had taken the three of them a day and now stef was quite lost im doing a kind of fetching bard only im doing it with us thats why we seem to be jumping a great deal and why youre sick besides you two got rather sidetracked you had to come at the pass obliquely im going straight back stef gulped shes doing fetching only with us no wonder my stomach thinks it got left behind it may have lights showed up ahead against the dark of the trees torches along the top of a wallthe lights of the guard post stef couldnt believe it it hadnt been nearly long enough but it was yfandes thundered into the lighted area in front of the gate as sentries came piling down off the walls she stopped with all four hooves set in a shower of snowand bucked violently stefen wasnt expecting that he flew over her head and landed in a snowbank he thought he was going to land all right but his breath was knocked out of him and his head cracked against a buried log and he saw nothing but stars and heard hoofbeats vanishing into the distance followed by a babble of voices hands hauled him out of the snow he shook his head to clear his eyes and immediately regretted doing so his head felt like it was going to explode and colored lights danced in front of him but his vision cleared enough for him to see as he looked up that one of the people striding out of the gate was the commander she recognized him immediately great good gods she exclaimed what in the nine hells are you doing here wheres the herald his head was swimming and his vision blacking out but he managed to get all of his message out the commander turned white and barked a series of orders the alarm bell began ringing so did stefs ears the commanders aide shoved stef over to one side and men and women began pouring out of the barracks hastily arming and armoring themselves as they ran into their ranks stef wasnt sure if he was going to be able to stand much longer his knees were going weak the post healer emerged took one look at him and started toward him arms forward and that was all stef knew before the ground quietly but violently introduced itself and darkness came over him vanyel trembled with exhaustion but the nodes were still pouring their power into him and two of the wizards lay charred and dead on the icy ground in front of him of the other two one had tried to flee and been cut down by his own men and the other was a mindless drooling thing that crawled over to the side of the trail and lay there curled on its side theres another difference i didnt defeat the wizards in the dream i fought them to a standstill he assessed the damage to himself and came up relatively satisfied there was a slight wound to his right leg blood was running down his leg and into his boot to freeze there he was a bit scorched but really the damage so far was light although a young boy whod never been in combat as i was thenwould have been convinced that every hurt was fatal that may be the reason for that difference it may not be a difference at all well now its time for master dark to appear the front ranks parted again and a single elegantly blackclad figure paced leisurely through lit by red magelight as vanyel was lit by blue right on cue the young man was wearing black armor and clothing that had to be a conscious parody of heraldic whites he was absolutely beautiful with a perfectly sculptured face and body somehow that face looked oddly familiar it could just be that the face was so perfect it looked like the statue of a god of course if i didnt care how i wasted power i could look like anything i wanted too he was a reverse image of vanyel in every way from sable hair to ebony eyes to nightblack boots why do you bother with this nonsense he asked sweetly his lips curving in a sensual smile you are quite alone heraldmage vanyel his voice was a smooth silky tenor he had learned the same kind of perfect control over it that he had over his body the familiarity of his features bothered vanyel at first he thought it was because he very closely resembled the herald himself but there was more to it than that a kind of racial similarity to someone you are the young man repeated with finelyhoned emphasis quite alone tayledras he looks tayledras only reversed did he always look that way or did he tailor himself either way hes making a statement about himself the hawkbrothers and the heralds you tell me nothing i didnt already know as i know you he heard himself saying the tayledras have a name for you you are leareth the name means darkness leareth laughed oh yes i quite consciously chose that tayledras name hence master dark as well a quaint conceit dont you think as are he waved at the men behind him in their sinister panoply my servants very clever vanyel replied this has already deviated from the dreams in the dreams the mages stand behind him and this time there were four instead of three the fighters stayed out of reach letting the mages handle me maybe if i can stall the final confrontation long enough stef can get to the guard and they can get here in time you need not remain alone vanyel leareth continued licking his lips sensuously you need only give over this madness stretch out your hand to me join me take my darkness to you you will never be alone again think how much we could accomplish together we are so very similar we two in our powers and in our pleasures he paced forward one swaying step that rippled his ebony cloak and his raven hair or if you prefer i could even bring your longlost love to you think about it vanyel think of tylendel once more alive and at your side he could share our life and our power vanyel and nothing nothing would be able to stand against us vanyel stepped back and pretended to consider the offer dear gods doesnt he understand us at all nothing is worth having if it comes at the kind of cost he demands cant he understand how much i would be betraying stef lendel if i betrayed valdemar the cold seemed to gather about him chilling him and stiffening his wounded leg he cant know that i know hes lying either about his abilities or about the reward if i turn traitor or both i wonder if i can hold against him or even take him hope rose in him and he probed a little around leareths shields and hid a shock of dismay hes better than i am much better hes able to tap nodemagic through other mages so that it doesnt burn him out hes got a half dozen of those mages feeding him power from the other side of the mountain from tapped nodes hes going to kill me and then hes going to march right through here and take valdemar and i dont have enough left even in the nodes to call the final strike that will take him well leareth shifted his weight impatiently how can i stall for more time oh gods im going to die alone and for nothing thenlike a gift from the gods the hoofbeats of a single creature behind him yfandes thundered to a halt beside him and screamed her defiance at the dark mage he stepped back an involuntary pace or two his eyes wide with surprise yfandes raised her stump of a tail high and bared her teeth at him as vanyel placed one hand on her warm flank i told you i would never leave you when i chose you she said calmly i knew what our bond would come to then when i first chose you and i dont regret my choice i love you and i am proud to stand beside you there is not a single moment together that i would take back not one he asked moved to tears not one i will not let you face him alone beloved and i can give my strength to you for whatever you need her strength added to his would be enough just enoughto overcome leareths protections on a final strike vanyel raised his eyes to meet leareths and with one smooth motion mounted and settled into yfandes saddle and answered the mages offer with a calm smile and a single word no vanyel terrible pain then nothing a void where warmth should be stefen leapt from the cot screaming vans name the healer tried to hold him down but he fought clear of the man throwing the blankets aside in a frenzy of fear and grief i felt him die oh gods no no i cant have its just something else some magic hes still alive he has to be he ran out of the barracks out into the snow shoving people out of the way he stumbled blindly to the stables and grabbed the first horse he saw that didnt shy away saddling it with tack that seemed oddly familiar the filly snorted in his hair as he reached up to bridle her and he recognized her it was melody but that didnt matter all that mattered was the ache in his heart in his soul the empty place that said vanyel he flung himself on melodys back and spurred her cruelly as soon as he was in the saddle she squealed in surprise and launched herself out of the stable door as the healers and sentries shouted after him too late to stop him days later he came upon the battlefield riding an exhausted horse himself too spent to speak the battle was long over and still the carnage was incredible at the edge of camp one of the guardsmen stopped melody with one hand on her bridle and stef didnt have the strength to urge her past him he simply stared dully at the man until someone else camea healer and then someone in highrank blue he ignored the healer but the other got him to dismount the commander her face gray with fatigue her eyes full of pain im sorry lad the commander said one arm around his shoulders im sorry we were all too late to save him he wasgonebefore we ever got here but id guess you know that im sorry the dam holding his emotions in check broke inside him and he turned his face into her shoulder she held him as she must often have held others and let him cry himself out until he had no more tears until he could scarcely stand then she helped him into her own tent put him to bed on her own cot and covered him with her own hands sleep laddy she whispered hoarsely taint a cure but you need it hed tell you the same if she turned away he slept though he didnt think he could the mournful howls of kyree filled his thoughts and vanyels face vanyels touch candlemarks later he woke another guardsman sat on a stool next to the cot keeping watch beside him he blinked confused by his surroundings then remembered i want to see him he said sitting up sir the guardsman said hesitantly there aint nothin to see we couldnt find a thing just them lots of them then i want to see where he was stef insisted i have to please the guardsman looked uncomfortable but helped him up led him out and supported him as he climbed back up the pass bodies were being collected and piled up to be burned the stench and black smoke were making stef sick and there was blood everywhere and at the narrowest point of the pass where the mortuary crews hadnt even reached it was even worse stefens escort tightened his grip suddenly and yelped as a whitefurred shape appeared beside them hyrryls blue eyes spoke her sympathy wordlessly to stefen and he heard himself saying its all right theyre friends as another fell in on his left aroon the guardsman swallowed and they resumed their walk blackened burned and mangled bodies were piled as many as three and four deep and all of them wore ebony armor or robes the carnage centered around one spot a place clean of snow and dirt scoured right down to the rock with the stone itself polished black and shining hyrryl and aroon took up positions on either side of the pass and sat on their haunches almost at attention watching over the bard the guardsman bowed and retreated wordlessly and no one else came near stef stumbled tearblinded through the heaped bodies looking for one one white clad amid all the black there was nothing just as the guardsman had told him stef shook his head frantically then began looking for anything a scrap of white anything at all finally after candlemarks of searching a glint of silver caught his eye he bent and found a thin wisp of bloodsoaked white horsehair and beside it the magefocus he had given vanyel the chain gone the silver setting halfmelted and tarnished the stone blackened burned cracked in two he clutched his finds to his chest his knees gave way and he fell to the stone his grief so allencompassing that he could not even weep only whisper vanyels name as if it were an incantation that would bring him back the trees were a scarlet glory behind the dull brown of the guard post youre the bard aint you stefen the one that was with awe made the boys eyes widen his voice drop to a whisper herald vanyel stef tried unsuccessfully to smile at the young guardsman yes id heard about whats happening up here and i came to see for myself that got a reaction the boy started and his eyes widened with fear then the youngster straightened and tried to look less frightened than he was tis true bard stefen anybody comes into that forest as has bad intentions they dont come out again fact is it looks like it started the night herald vanyel died we found lots of them fellahs in the black armor as had run off inta the forest and ev one of em was cold meat id heard that stefen said dismounting carefully but id also heard some tales that were pretty wild the autumn wind tossed his hair and melodys mane as he handed her reins to the guardsman they aint wild mlord bard the men as we found stuck right through with branches or even icicles up t their waists in frozen ground they was spooky enough but lor an lady there was some tore tlittle bits by somethin and more just dead no mark on em just dead and the awfullest looks on their faces the boy shivered been like that ever since once in a while we go in there have a look around sure enough well find some bandit or other th same way they say the forest is cursed stef said absently shading his eyes with his hand and peering into the shadows beneath the trees beyond the guard barracks it sounds more like a blessing to me blessed or cursed tis a good thing for valdemar an we reckon herald vanyel done it stefen slnng his gitternbag over one shoulder his nearempty pack over the other and headed not for the guard post but the forest hey the boy protested stef ignored him ignored the shouts behind him and began his solitary trek into the forest they now called sorrows near sunset he finally stopped near enough he thought looking around i dont need to be in the pass to do this and this is where we were last happy together this or a place very like this he was at the foot of a very tall hillor small mountain the sun was setting to his left the moon rising to his right and there was no sign of any living person just the hill with a shallow cave under it the trees and the birds he gathered enough wood for a small fire started it and took out his gittern he played until the sun just touched the horizon all of vans favorites all the music hed composed sinceeven the melody of the song for the kyree and the song hed left a copy of back at bardic collegium the one hed never performed in public the one he had written for vanyel that he called magics price and then he put the gittern down carefully hed thought about breaking it but it was a sweet little instrument and didnt deserve destruction for sake of an unwitnessed dramatic scene he settled on wrapping it carefully and stowing it in the back of the cave perhaps someone would find it the ache in his soul had not eased in all these months people kept telling him that time would heal the loss but it hadnt theyd kept a close watch on him for months after he returned from the pass but lately they hadnt been quite as careful but then lately there had been other things to think about than one young bard with a broken heart hed taken the opportunity offered by the confusion of king randales death and king trevens coronation to escape them and make his way up here it hadnt been easy to get that vial of argonel and finally hed had to buy it from a thief he took it out of the bottom of his pack and weighed the heavy porcelain vial in his hand a lethal dose for ten or so he said should be enough for one skinny bard he set it down in front of him staring at it in the fading crimson light you drift into sleep not so bad easier death than he had easier than randis a lot easier than shavris finally he reached for it a shower of stone fragments shook themselves loose from the roof of the cave and one struck the bottle of poison it tipped over and rolled out of his reach then the cork popped out and it capriciously poured its contents into the dust he scrambled after it with a cry of dismay glancing worriedly at the ceiling of the cave go through with it you idiot said a cheerful voice in his mind and ill never forgive you that voice stef froze then turned his head very slowly something stood there between him and the forest van a much younger looking vanyel and a very transparent vanyel stef could see the bushes behind him quite clearly before he had a chance to feel even a hint of fear van smiled the alltoorare sweet smile stef had come to cherish in their time together a smile of pure love and real unshadowed happiness van he said hesitantly ii cant be im going mad oh dear gods please let it be tears began to well up and he shook them out of his eyes as he reached out with a trembling hand van is that really van reached out at the same time his hand and just his handgrew solid momentarily solid enough that stef was able to touch it before it faded to transparency again it was real real and solid and warm it is oh gods it is how stef asked through the tears what happened vanyel shrugged a completely vanlike shrug something happened after i took leareth out with the final strike i had a choice most heralds have a couple of choices they can go on to the havens or come back like the tayledras say people come back i was given another option another option this i know it doesnt look like much vanyel smiled again then sobered the problem is that i was the last heraldmage valdemar needs a guardian on this border a magical one master dark wasnt alone and he left apprentices so that was my choice to stay and guard yfandes too fandes and i are part of the forest now he hesitated a moment stef i asked for something before i agreed and you get the same choice you can join me but but stefen cried leaping to his feet stirring the dust from the nowforgotten pebble attack but what anything ashke whatever i have to do to be with you vanyel moved closer and made as if to touch his cheek you can join me but there are conditions you can only come when its time there are things i cant tell you about but you have to earn your place theres something that needs to be done and you are uniquely suited to do it i wont lie to you beloved its going to take years what is it stef demanded his heart pounding his throat tight tell me you remember how worried i was about people thinking that heralds were somehow less than heraldmages stef nodded its gotten worse since you i mean you were the last theres no one to replace you no one to train new ones no way to find new ones i mean now youre a legend van and the people tend to think of legends as being flawless thats where you come in you have to use your gift to convince the people of valdemar that the gifts of heralds are enough to keep them safe you and every bard in the circle which means that first you have to convince the other bards then the circle has to convince the rest of the realm vanyel held out both hands in a gesture of pleading the bards are the only ones that have a hope of pulling this off stef and you are the only one that has a hope of convincing the bards but that could take a lifetime stefen cried involuntarily dismayed by the magnitude of the task then as vanyel nodded he realized what that meant in terms of earning his place exactly van said his eyes mournful exactly do you still love me enough to spend a lifetime doing the work ive left to you a lifetime alone i wouldnt blame you if van stef whispered looking deeply into those beloved silver eyes van i love you enough to die for you i still do i always will i guess he hesitated a moment more then swallowed down his tears i guess he finished managing to dredge up a shaky tearedged smile if i love you enough to die for you it kind of follows that i love you enough to live for you and there are worse ways to die for somebody than by old age tell me about it for one moment all the starlight the moonlight seemed to collect in one place then feed into vanyel the figure of the herald glowed as bright as the full moon for a heartbeat and he solidified long enough to take stefen into his arms oh ashke he murmured and smiled lovingly then he was gone completely and without the evidence of the spilled bottle and the dust in his hair stef would never have known vanyel was there except in his mind the bard looked around frantically but there was no sign of him van wait he shouted into the still air wait how will i know when ive earned my place youll know came the whisper in his mind well call you epilogue herald andros leaned back in his saddle and stretched enjoying the warm spring sunshine on his back he looked behind him to make sure his fellow traveler was keeping up all right the old bard was nodding off again it was a good thing that ashkevron palfrey had easy paces or the poor old man would have fallen off a half dozen times why on earth do you suppose he wants to visit sorrows he asked toril his companion shook her head damned if i know she replied amusement in her mindvoice the very old get pretty peculiar he should be glad theres been peace long enough that someone could be spared to ferry him up here it still wouldnt have happened if i wasnt on my way to the temple in the first place he said poor old man not that anyone is going to miss him all of his old cronies are gone and hardly anyone even knows hes at court anymore toril tested the breeze for a moment maybe hes making a kind of memorial trip did you know hes the stefen vanyels lifebonded no he turned in his saddle to stare back at the frail slight old man dozing behind him i thought stefen was dead a long time ago well i guess he deserves a little humoring hes certainly earned it she shook her head in silent agreement and slowed until they were even with the bard bard stefen he said softly the bards hearing was perfectly good and he didnt want to startle the old man the bard opened his eyes slowly dozed off again did i he asked with a hint of a smile good thing this old man has you to watch out for him son do you have any idea of where youre going andros asked weve been inside the border of sorrows for the last couple of candlemarks the bard looked around himself with increased interest have we now well could be why i felt comfortable enough to go on sleeping i wish youd told me i could have saved you a little riding he pulled his old mare to a halt and slowly dismounted then pointed at a little grove of goldenoak at the foot of a rocky hillside thatll do lad all i want is to be left alone for a bit eh i know that sounds a bit touched but the old get pretty peculiar sometimes andros blushed at this echoing of his own thoughts and obediently turned toril away well my lady he said where would you like to go id like a good long drink of spring water she replied firmly and i can smell running water just over that ridge the water not only tasted good it felt good andros became very much aware of how dusty and sweaty the trip had made him and toril allowed that she wouldnt object to a bath either by the time the two of them were dry it was late afternoon and andros figured the old man would be ready to continue his journey when he returned to the grove the old man was gone the gittern was there though and the mare so andros just sighed and assumed hed gone off for a walk he began a search for the bard growing more and more frantic when not even a footprint turned up toril imposed herself in front of him waiting for him to mount he blinked at her wondering what on earth he was doing wandering around in the woods like this i must have had sunstroke he told her shaking his head in confusion what am what was i doing i wondered she replied with concern you wanted to see the battle site and i tried to tell you it wasnt here but you insisted it was dont you remember no he replied ruefully next time knock me into a stream or something would you he caught a twinkle in her eye but she replied demurely enough if its necessary its just that now were late and they really need a herald out here for relay work every moment were not there is trouble for the healers its just a good thing theres a full moon tonight oh horseturds andros groaned aloud you dont expect me to ride all night do you why not im the one doing all the work now get the packmare and lets get going why is there a saddle on this mare he asked frowning as he approached the palfrey and why isnt she fastened to your saddle already the second because you unfastened her youd better have the healers look at you when you get there her mindvoice was dense with concern i think you really must have had a serious sunstroke shes got a saddle because shes a present from joserlyn ashkevron to his sister and saddles dont grow on trees not even this close to the pelagirs youre right andros said rubbing his head then mounting id better talk to them well lets get going they rode off leaving a gittern behind them propped up against a tree when they were quite out of sightand hearingdistancethe strings quivered for a moment a knowledgeable listener might have recognized a ballad popular sixty or seventy years earlier a lovesong called my ladys eyes and a very keeneared listener might have heard laughter among the trees young male laughter tenor and baritone making a joyful music of their own to this day that gittern is grown into the tree it leaned against then the goldenoaks roots entwined around its strings in a gentle embrace and there are bright days when the winds whispers through the trees that the forest of sorrows seems the most inappropriate name possible appendix songs of vanyels time nightblades they come creeping out of darkness and to darkness they return in their wake they leave destruction where they go no one can learn for they leave no trace in passing as if all who watched were blind like a dream of evil sending nightblades passing nightblades rending into darkness once more blending leaving only dead behind first a threatand then a death comes in the darkness of the night and a dozen wouldbe allies have begun to show their fright when the nightblades strike unhindered and can take a life at will theres no safety in alliance and much peril in defiance it is best to show compliance and the karsite ranks to fill the chief envoy summons vanyel for one ally still seems brave and the treaty may be salvaged if vanyel this life can save herald vanyel feigns refusal senses one would play him fool thinks of treachery in hiding lets his instincts be his guiding his own counsel he is biding hell be no unwitting tool garbed in black slips herald vanyel to their last lone allys keep over wall and into window past all gates and guards to creep past all gates and guardsno magic has them wrapped in deadly spell they are drugged and they are dreaming some foe strikes in friendly seeming seea metal dart there gleaming vanyel knows the symptoms well now he hears anothers footstep soft before him in the dark and he hastes to lay an ambush while the nightblade seeks his mark now he waits beside the doorway of the allys very room and the nightblade all unknowing with a single lampbeam showing to a confrontation going not to fill another tomb out of shadow vanyel rises and he bars the nightblades way he has only that slim warningvanyel has him soon at bay when the guards have all awakened then he bares the nightblades face and all minds but his are reeling when he tears off the concealing and the envoys face revealing brings the traitor to disgrace my ladys eyes this is drivel its supposed to be its vanyels mothers favorite song van puts up with it because he can show off his fingering my ladys eyes are like the skies a soft and sunlit blue no other fair could half compare in sweet midsummer hue my ladys eyes cannot disguise her tender gentle heart she cannot feign she feels my pain whenever we must part instrumental now while i live i needs must give her all my love and more that she may know i worship so this one that i adore and while away i long and pray the days may speed and then i heartward hie i flee i fly to see her eyes again instrumental my ladys eyes each glance i prize as gentle as a dove and would that i could tell her why i dare not speak my love too high as far as any star her station is to mine too wide that space to eer embrace beneath her i repine instrumental shadow stalker it was just a week till sovven and the nights were turning chill and the battle turned to stalemate doublebluff and feint and drill when a shadow drifted northward just a shadow nothing more no one noticed that the shadows all grew darker than before no one noticed while the shadows seemed to creep into the heart but from then the fight for freedom seemed a fools quest from the start all the hopes that they had cherished seemed unreasoned and naive nothing worth the strength to pray for or to strive for or believe and the shadows stole the sunlight from the brightest autumn day as they sang a song of bleakness that touched every heart that heard as they whispered words of hopelessness all courage fled away and they wove a smothering blanket over all that lived and stirred herald vanyel came upon them and he sensed a subtle wrong and there was some magic working deeply hidden yes but strong and it moved and worked in secret like a poison in the vein like a poison meant to weaken this was magic meant to drain herald vanyel saw the shadows and they turned their wiles on him for one moment even he began to feel his spirit dim but he saw their secret evil and he swore eer he was done he would stalk and slay these shadows and destroy them one by one herald vanyel shadow stalker hunted shadows to their doom they turned all their powers upon him turned away from other men and although they strove to take him he unwove their web of gloom so the shadows fled his anger their creator sought again herald vanyel faced the singer who had sung them into life and she sang to him of grief and loss that cut him like a knife and she sang to him of selfhate and she wove a net of pain with her songs of woe and hopelessness bent to be vanyels bane so now what is there to strive for was the song she sang to him and the shadow came upon his heart the world grew gray and dim but the singer of the shadow did not know the foe she fought nor how dear he held his duty nor by what pain power was bought herald vanyel looked upon her and he saw through her disguise and she strove then to seduce him into death or madness sweet herald vanyel looked within him and he saw her songs were lies and he gathered up his magic then her powers to defeat herald vanyel raised his golden voice and sang of life and light of the first cry of a baby of the silver stars of night herald vanyel sang of wisdom sang of courage sang of love of the earths sweet soil beneath him of the vaulting sky above sang of healing sang of growing sang of joy and hope and dreams and the singer of the shadows felt the death of all her schemes it was then she tried to flee him but his song and magic spell struck her down and held her pinioned and she faltered and she fell then the singer of the shadows saw her shadows shatter there saw her lies unmade before her saw her darkness turned to day and how empty and how petty was the spirit then laid bare like her shadows then she shattered and in silence passed away windrider unchained windrider fettered imprisoned and pinioned wingclipped by magic his power full drained valdemars heir is defeated and captive with his companion by darklord enchained darklord of shadows his fetters is weaving binds him in darkness as deep as despair mocks at his anger and laughs at his weeping where is your strength now oh valdemars heir darklord has left them by shadows encumbered darshay and windrider trapped in his gloom deep in his prisons past hope past believing heir and companion will this be your tomb out of the shadows another draws nearer out of the twilight steals one furtive light shadows dance pain while the light sings despairing drawn here by darshay and windriders plight power newwon have the singer

and by fear is confounded flees the avenger windrider unchained demonsbane along a road in hardorn the place called stony tor a fearful band of farmers flees karsite border war a frightened band of farmers their children and their wives seeks refuge from a tyrant who wants more than their lives now up rides herald vanyel why then such haste says he now who is it pursuing whose anger do you flee for you are all of hardorn why seek you valdemar is festil no protection bide all his men too far oh vanyel herald vanyel we flee now for our lives lord nedran would enslave us our children and our wives hed give our souls to demons our bodies to his men king festil has not heeded or our peril does not ken now up speaks herald vanyel the border is not far but you are all of hardorn and not of valdemar you are not randales peoplecan call not on his throne but damned if i will see you left helpless on your own so forth goes herald vanyel and onward does he ride on stony tor he waits then yfandes at his side with nedrans men approaching he calls out from on high you shall not pass lord nedran i shall not let you by now herald vanyel only stands blocking nedrans way now who are you fool nothing that you dare to tell me nay now up speaks herald vanyel in a voice like brittle glass the heraldmage called vanyeland i say you shall not pass now there stands great lord nedran and behind him forty men beside him is his wizardbut he pales and speaks again so you are herald vanyelbut this place is not your land so heed me herald vanyel turn aside and hold your hand let be ill give you silver and i shall give you gold and i shall give you jewels fair that sparkle bright and bold and i shall give you pearls all the treasures of the sea if you will step aside here and leave these fools to me what need have i of silver more than sweet yfandes here and all the gold i cherish is sunlight bright and clear the only jewel i treasures a bright and shining star and i will protect the helpless even outside valdemar now i shall give you beauty slaves of women and of men and i shall give you power as youll never see again and i shall give you mansions and i shall give you land if you will turn aside here turn aside and hold your hand now beauty held in bondage is beauty that is lost and land and mansions bloodbought come at too high a cost and power i have alreadyall power is a jade so turn you back lord nedran if of me you are afraid lord nedran backs his stallion the wizard he comes nigh prepare yourself bold vanyel for you shall surely die the wizard calls his demons the demons he commands and vanyel herald vanyel only raises empty hands the wizard calls his demons the sky above turns black the demons strike at vanyel he stands and holds them back the demons strike at vanyel they strike and hurt him sore but vanyel stands defiant to raise his hands once more the sky itself descending upon bare stony tor now hides the awful battle the watchers see no more the wizard shouts in triumphtoo soon he vents his mirth for vanyel calls the lightning and smites him to the earth the clouds of black have lifted upon the barren ground stands vanyel hurt but victor the demons tied and bound he looks down on lord nedran his eyes grow cold and bleak now shall i give you nedran the power that you seek now vanyel frees the demons and nedran screams with fear he sets them on the karsites who had first brought them here he sets them on the karsites and on the karsite land they look down on lord nedran they do not stay their hand now vanyel calls the farmers go tell you near and far how thus are served the tyrants who would take valdemar i am the bane of demons who flees them i defend thus heralds serve a foemanthus heralds save a friend the shadowlover shadowlover never seen by day only deep in dreams do you appear wisdom tells me i should turn away love of mist and shadows all unclear nothing can i hold of you but thought shadowlover mist and twilight wrought

fear the night shadowlover lead me into light magics price every year companions choose as they have done before the chosen come with shining hopes to learn the heralds lore and every year the heralds sigh and give the same advice all those who would hold magics power must then pay magics price oh there was danger in the norththats all that vanyel knew an enemy of power dark sought heralds outthen slew but only those with magics gift were slain by silent rage till vanyel of them all was left the only heraldmage yes from the north the danger came beyond the border far the forest did not stay dark death nor did the mountains bar and vanyel criedwe die my liege and know not why nor where so send me north my king that i may find the answers there then north went vanyelnot alone though twas of little aid a bard was like to be to him and stefen was afraidhe feared that he would fail the quest a burden prove to be dared not let vanyel go alone to face dark sorcery so out beyond the border there beyond the forest tall into the mountains deep they went that stood an icy wall to find the wall had cracked and found there was a passage new a path clean cut that winding ran a level course and true this path was wrought by magecraft vanyel knew that when he saw the mountains hewn by power alone a power he felt with awe but to what purpose something moved beyond them on the trail they watched and hidand what they found there turned them cold and pale an army moved in single file by magic cloaked and hid an army moved on valdemar that marched as they were bid a darker force than weaponry controlled the men and place for vanyel lookedand vanyel knew an ancient evils face then vanyel turned to stefen and he told the bard to ride to warn the folk of valdemarthey call me magics pride its time i earned the namenow go ill hold this army back until the arms of valdemar can counter their attack so stefen rode and so it is no living tongue can tell how vanyel fought nor what he wrought nor how the herald fell the army camebut not in time to save the heraldmage although the pass was scorched and cracked by magic powers rage they fought the dark ones back although they came on wave by wave no trace they found of vanyel nor of his companion bravethey only found the focusstone the gift of stefens hand now blackened burned and shattered by the power that saved their land they only found the foemen who into the woods had fled and each one by unseen uncanny powers now lay dead as if the forest had somehow bestirred itself that day had vanyel with his dying breath commanded trees to slay and still the forest of the north guards valdemar from harm for vanyels dying curse is stronger far than mortal arm and every year the chosen come despite the old advice all those who would be magics pride must then pay magics price
