charles todd a test of wills i n this quiet part of warwickshire death came as frequently as it did anywhere else in england no stranger to the inhabitants of towns villages or countryside sons and fathers had died in the great war the terrible influenza epidemic had scythed the countyman woman and child just as it had cut down much of europe and murder was not unheard of even here in upper streetham but one fine june morning as the early mists rose lazily in the warm sunlight like wraiths in no hurry to be gone colonel harris was killed in cold blood in a meadow fringed with buttercups and cowslips and his last coherent thought was anger savage wild black fury ripped through him in one stark instant of realization before oblivion swept it all away and his body rigid with it survived the shotgun blast long enough to dig spurs into the mares flanks while his hands clenched the reins in a muscular spasm as strong as iron he died hard unwilling railing at god and his ragged cry raised echoes in the quiet woods and sent the rooks flying even as the gun roared in london where rain dripped from eaves and ran black in the gutters a man named bowles who had never heard of colonel harris came into possession of a piece of information that was the reward of very determined and quite secret probing into the history of a fellow policeman at scotland yard he sat at his desk in the grim old brick building and stared at the letter on his blotter it was written on cheap stationery in heavy ink by a rounded rather childish hand but he was almost afraid to touch it its value to him was beyond price and if he had begged whatever gods he believed in to give him the kind of weapon he craved they couldnt have managed anything sweeter than this he smiled delight spreading slowly across his fairskinned face and narrowing the hard ambercolored eyes if this was trueand he had every reason to believe it washe had been absolutely right about ian rutledge he bowles was vindicated by six lines of unwittingly damaging girlish scrawl reading the letter for the last time he refolded it carefully and replaced it in its envelope locking it in his desk drawer now the question was how best to make use of this bit of knowledge without burning himself in the fire he wanted to raise if only those same gods had thought to provide a way but it seemed after all that they had twentyfour hours later the request for assistance arrived from warwickshire and superintendent bowles happened by the merest chance to be in the right place at the right time to make a simple apparently constructive suggestion the gods had been very generous indeed bowles was immensely grateful the request for scotland yards help had arrived through the proper channels couched in the usual terms what lay behind the formal wording was sheer panic the local police force stunned by colonel harriss vicious murder had done their best to conduct the investigation quickly and efficiently but when the statement of one particular witness was taken down and inspector forrest understood just where it was going to lead him the upper streetham constabulary collectively got cold feet at a circumspect conference with higher county authority it was prudently decided to let scotland yard handle this situationand to stay out of the yards way as much as humanly possible here was one occasion when metropolitan interference in local police affairs was heartily welcomed with undisguised relief inspector forrest forwarded his request to london the yard in its turn faced a serious dilemma willynilly they were saddled with a case where discretion background and experience were essential at the same time it was going to be a nasty one either way you looked at it and someones head was bound to roll therefore the man sent to warwickshire must be considered expendable however good he might be at his job and that was when bowles had made his timely comments inspector rutledge had just returned to the yard after covering himself with mud and glory in the trenches of france surely choosing him would be popular in warwickshire under the circumstancesshowed a certain sensitivity for county feelings as it were as for experience hed handled a number of serious cases before the war hed left a brilliant record behind him in fact the word scapegoat wasnt mentioned but bowles delicately pointed out that it might be less disruptive to morale to loseif indeed it should come to thata man whod just rejoined the force please god of course such a sacrifice wouldnt be required a halfhearted quibble was raised about rutledges state of health bowles brushed that aside the doctors had pronounced him fit to resume his duties hadnt they and although he was still drawn and thin he appeared to be much the same man who had left in older and quieter naturally but that was to be expected a pity about the war it had changed so many lives the recommendation was approved and an elated bowles was sent to brief rutledge after tracking the inspector to the small drafty cubicle where he was reading through a stack of reports on current cases bowles stood in the passage for several minutes steadying his breathing willing himself to composure then he opened the door and walked in the man behind the desk looked up a smile transforming his thin pale face bringing life to the tired eyes the war hasnt improved human nature has it he flicked a finger across the open file on his blotter and added thats the fifth knifing in a pub brawl ive read this morning but it seems the army did manage to teach us somethingexactly where to place the blade in the ribs for best results none of the five survived if wed done as well in france bayoneting germans wed have been home by his voice was pleasant well modulated it was one of the things that bowles with his highpitched north country accent disliked most about the man and the fact that his father had been a barrister not a poor miner schooling had come easily to rutledge he hadnt had to plod dragging each bit of knowledge into his brain by sheer effort of will dreading examinations knowing himself a mediocrity it rubbed a mans pride to the bone to struggle so hard where others soared on the worldly coattails of londonbred fathers and grandfathers blood told it always had bowles passionately resented it if thered been any justice a german bayonet would have finished this soldier along with the rest of them yes well you can put those away michaelsons got something for you bowles announced busily framing sentences in his mind that would convey the bare facts and leave out the nuances that might put rutledge on his guard or give him an opening to refuse to go to warwickshire first month back and youve landed this one youll have your picture in the bloody papers before its done mark my words he sat down and began affably to outline the situation rutledge left the outskirts of london behind and headed northwest it was a dreary morning rain sweeping in gusts across the windscreen from a morbidly gray sky draped like a dirty curtain from horizon to horizon the tires throwing up rivers of water on either side of the car like black wings hellish weather for june i should have taken the train he thought as he settled down to a steady pace but he knew he couldnt face the train yet it was one thing to be shut up in a motorcar that you could stop at will and another to be enclosed in a train over which you had no control at all jammed in with a half dozen other people the doors closed for hours on end the compartment airless and overheated the press of bodies crowding him driving him to the brink of panic voices dinning in his ears the roar of the wheels like the sound of his own blood pounding through his heart just thinking about it sent a wave of terror through him claustrophobia the doctors had called it a natural fear in a man whod been buried alive in a frontline trench suffocated by the clinging slippery unspeakable mud and the stinking corpses pinning him there too soon his sister frances had said it was much too soon to go back to work but he knew that if he didnt hed lose what was left of his mind distraction was what he needed and this murder in warwickshire appeared to offer just that hed need his wits about him hed have to concentrate to recover the long forgotten skills hed had to put behind him in and that would keep hamish at bay youre to turn right here the voice in his head was as clear as the patter of rain on the cars roof a deep voice with soft scottish inflections he was used to hearing it now the doctors had told him that would happen that it was not uncommon for the mind to accept something which it had created itself in order to conceal what it couldnt face any other way shell shock was an odd thing it made its own rules theyd said understand that and you could manage to keep your grip on reality fight it and it would tear you apart but he had fought it for a very long timeand they were right it had nearly destroyed him he made the turn glancing at the signs yes the road to banbury and hamish strangely enough was a safer companion than jean who haunted him in another way in gods blessed name how did you uproot love how did you tear it out of your flesh and bone hed learned in france to face dying he could learn in time how to face living it was just getting through the desolation in between that seemed to be beyond him frances had shrugged her slim shoulders and said darling there are other women in a year youll wonder why you cared so much for one let go gracefullyafter all it isnt as if shes fallen in love with another man he swerved to miss a dray pulling out into the road without warning from a muddy lane running between long wet fields keep your mind on the driving man or well both be dead sometimes i believe wed both be better off he answered aloud not wanting to think about jean not able to think about anything else everywhere he turned something brought her back to him ten thousand memories waiting like enemies to ambush him the car the rain shed liked driving in the rain the glass clouded with their warm breath their laughter mingling with the swish of the tires the car a private intimate world of their own ah but thats the cowards road death is you willna escape so easily as that youve got a conscience man it wont let you run out and neither will i rutledge laughed harshly the day may come when you have no choice he kept his eyes pinned to the road as always refusing to look over his shoulder though the voice seemed to come from the rear seat just behind him almost near enough to touch him with its breath the temptation to turn around was strong nearly as strong as the desperate fear of what he might see if he did he could he had found live with hamishs voice what he dreadeddreaded more than anythingwas seeing hamishs face and one dayone day he might holloweyed empty of humanity in death or accusing pleading in life rutledge shuddered and forced his mind back to the road ahead the day he saw hamish hed end it he had promised himself that it was very late when he reached upper streetham the rain still blowing in gusty showers the streets of the town empty and silent and shiny with puddles as he made his way to the inn on the high street highland towns are like this on saturday nights hamish said suddenly all the good presbyterians asleep in their beds mindful of the sabbath on the morrow and the catholics back from confession and feeling virtuous are you mindful of the state of your soul i havent got one rutledge answered tiredly you tell me that often enough i expect its true the blackandwhite facade he was looking for loomed ahead ghostly in another squall of rain a rambling ancient structure with a thatched roof that seemed to frown disparagingly over the faded inn sign swinging from its wroughtiron bar the shepherds crook it read he turned in through a wisteriahung arch drove past the building into the inn yard and pulled the motorcar into an empty space between a small barred shed and the inns rear door beyond the shed was what appeared in his headlamps to be a square lake with pagodas and islands just showing above the black water no doubt the kitchen garden with its early onions and cabbages someone had heard him coming into the drive and was watching him from the back steps a candle in his hand inspector rutledge the man called yes im rutledge im barton redfern the landlords nephew he asked me to wait up for you rain swept through the yard again as he spoke and he hastily stepped back inside waiting to hold the door open as rutledge dashed through the puddles his bag in one hand the other holding on to his hat a minor tempest followed him across the threshold my uncle said you were to have the room over the parlor where its quieter at night its this way would you like a cup of tea or something from the bar you look like you could use a drink no thanks there was whiskey in his bag if he wanted itif exhaustion wasnt enough what i need is sleep it rained all the way heavy at times i had to stop beyond stratford for an hour until the worst had passed any messages just that inspector forrest will see you at breakfast if you like at nine better make it eight they were climbing a flight of narrow winding stairs the back way to the second floor barton who looked to be in his early twenties was limping heavily turning to say something over his shoulder he caught rutledges glance at his left foot and said instead ypres a shell fragment the doctors say itll be fine once the muscles have knit themselves back properly but i dont know they arent always as smart as they think they are doctors no rutledge agreed bitterly they just do the best they can and sometimes that isnt much redfern led the way down a dark hall and opened the door to a wide wellaired room under the eaves with a lamp burning by the bed and brightly flowered curtains at the windows relieved not to find himself in a cramped narrow chamber where sleep would be nearly impossible rutledge nodded his thanks and redfern shut the door as he left saying eight it is then ill see that youre called half an hour before fifteen minutes later rutledge was in the bed and asleep he never feared sleep it was the one place where hamish could not follow him sergeant davies was middleaged heavyset with a placidity about him that spoke of even temper a man at peace within himself but there were signs of strain in his face also as if he had been on edge for the past several days he sat foursquare at rutledges table in the middle of the inns small cheerful dining room watching as redfern poured a cup of black coffee for him and explaining why he was there in place of his superior by rights inspector forrest should be answering your questions but he wont be back much before ten theres been a runaway lorry in lower streetham and the driver was drunk two people were killed a nasty business sos this a nasty business colonel harris was well respected not the sort youd expect to get himself murdered he sighed a sorry death for a man who went through two wars unscathed but london will have gone over that rutledge had spread homemade jam on his toast it was wild strawberry and looked as if it had been put up before the war nearly as dark and thick as treacle poised to take a bite he looked across at the sergeant im not in london now im here tell me how it happened davies settled back in his chair frowning as he marshaled his facts inspector forrest had been very particular about how any account of events was to be given the sergeant was a man who took pride in being completely reliable a shotgun blew his head to bitsfrom the chin up just tatters hed gone out for his morning ride at seven sharp just as he always did whenever he was at home back by eight thirty breakfast waiting for him that was every day except sunday rain or shine but on monday when he wasnt back by ten his man of business mr royston went looking for him in the stables why rutledge had taken out a pen and a small finely tooled leather notebook on this day particularly there was a meeting set for ninethirty and it wasnt like the colonel to forget about it when he got to the stables mr royston found the grooms in a blue panic because the colonels horse had just come galloping in without its rider and there was blood all over the saddle and the horses haunches men were sent out straightaway to look for him and he was finally discovered in a meadow alongside the copse of trees at the top of his property davies paused as the swift pen raced across the ruled page allowing rutledge a moment to catch up before continuing mr royston sent for inspector forrest first thing but hed gone looking for the barlowe child whod gotten herself lost by the time i got the message and reached the scene the ground was well trampled by stable lads and farmhands all come to stare so we arent sure he was shot just there but it couldnt have happened more than a matter of yards from where we found him and no indication of who might have done it the sergeant shifted uneasily in his chair his eyes straying to the squares of pale sunlight that dappled the polished floor as the last of the rain clouds thinned as to that you must know that captain wiltonthats the captain mark wilton who won the vcquarreled with the colonel the night before shortly after dinner hes to marry the colonels ward you see and some sort of misunderstanding arose over the wedding or so the servants claim in the middle of the quarrel the captain stalked out of the house in a temper and was heard to say hed see the colonel in hell first the colonel threw his brandy glass at the door just as the captain slammed it and shouted that that could be arranged this was certainly a more colorful version of the bald facts that rutledge had been given in london breakfast forgotten he continued to write his mind leaping ahead of davies steady voice what does the ward have to say miss woods in her room under the doctors care seeing no one not even her fiance the captain is staying with mrs davenant shes a second cousin on his mothers side inspector forrest tried to question him and he said he wasnt one to go around shooting people no matter what he might have done in the war rutledge put down his pen and finished his toast then reached for his teacup he didnt have to ask what the captain had done in the war his photograph had been in all the papers when he was decorated by the kingthe captain had not managed to bring down the red baron but he seemed to have shot down every other german pilot whose path he had crossed in the skies above france rutledge had watched a vicious dogfight high in the clouds above his trench one july afternoon and had been told later who the english pilot was if it was true then wilton was nothing short of a gifted flier colonel harris had been a relatively young man for his rank serving in the boer war as well as the great war and making a name for himself as a skilled infantry tactician rutledge had actually met him oncea tall vigorous compassionate officer who had known how to handle tired frightened men asked once too often to do the impossible without warning hamish laughed harshly aye he knew how to stir men there were those of us whod have blown his head off there and then if wed had the chance after that third assault it was suicide and he knew it and he sent us anyway i cant say im sorry hes got his late is better than never rutledge choked as his tea went down the wrong way he knewdear god he knewthat hamish couldnt be heard by anyone else and yet sometimes the voice was so clear he expected everyone around him to be staring at him in shock he waved davies back to his chair as the sergeant made to rise and slap him on his back still coughing he managed to ask thats all youve done yes sir then we were told to leave everything for the yard and so we did just that what about the shotgun have you at least checked on that the captain says he used the weapons at the colonels house if he wanted to go shooting but none of them has been fired recently we asked mrs davenant if she had any guns and she said she sold her late husbands italian shotguns before the war the sergeant glanced over his shoulder and barton redfern came across the parlor to refill his cup when the young man had limped away again the sergeant added tentatively because of that quarrel of course it looks as if the captain might be the guilty party but ive learned in this business that looks are deceiving rutledge nodded and the murder was three days ago after last nights rain therell be nothing to find in the meadow or anywhere else along the route the colonel might have taken on his ride right then do you have a list of people to talk to besides the wardmiss woodand wilton and this mrs davenant as to that there arent all that many the servants and the lads who found the body laurence royston miss tar rant of courseshe was the lady that captain wilton had courted before the war but she turned him down then and doesnt seem to mind that hes marrying miss wood now still you never know do you she might be willing to throw a little light on how the two men got on together and theres mr haldanehes the squires son he was one of miss woods suitors as was the vicar davies grinned suddenly a wholly unprofessional glint in his eyes some say mr carfield took holy orders because he saw the war coming but actually had his heart set on the theater he does preach a better sermon than old reverend mott did ill say that for him we all learned more about the apostle paul under mr mott than any of us ever cared to know and i must admit mr carfields a welcomed change he recollected himself and went on more soberly the two sommers ladies are new to the district and dont go about much i doubt if theyd be helpful except that they live near where the body was found and might have seen or heard something of use to us rutledge nodded as redfern returned with a fresh pot of tea waiting until his cup had been filled before he commented miss wood seems to have been very popular shes a veryattractiveyoung lady davies answered hesitating over the word as if not certain that it was appropriate then of course theres mavers hes a local man a rabblerouser by nature always putting his nose in where it doesnt belong stirring things up making trouble for the sake of trouble if anything untoward happens in upper streetham the first person you think of is mavers thats not a likely motive for shooting harris in itself in maverss case it is hes been annoying the colonel since long before the war nothing weve ever been able to prove you understand but thereve been fires and dead livestock and the like vindictive acts all of them the last time when one of the dogs was poisoned the colonel threatened to have mavers committed if it happened again hes got a very sound alibiinspector forrest talked to him straightaway all the same id not put murder past him rutledge heard the hope in davies voice but said only ill keep that in mind all right then if that s the lot well start with miss wood she may be able to give us a better picture of this quarrel what it was about and whether it might have had anything to do with her guardians death ill want you there inspector forrest can spare you he capped his pen stowed the notebook in his pocket and reached for his cup davies looked stunned you didnt bring a sergeant with you then were shorthanded at the yard at the moment youll do but davies began panic sweeping through him then he thought better of what he had been on the verge of saying the man to speak to was forrest not this gaunt faced stranger from london with his clipped voice and bleak eyes then he bethought himself of the one fact hed avoided so far the one bit of evidence no one wanted to accept he had been told to wait until rutledge brought it up but the man hadnt mentioned it because he discounted it that would be too much to hope for more than likely the inspector intended to rub the sergeants nose in it now that he had his chance but davies knew it had to be dragged into the open like it or not you couldnt just ignore it pretend it didnt exist he cleared his throat theres more sir though i dont know what its worth surely they told you in london staring at rutledge waiting for some indication that the man knew that he didnt need to go into embarrassing detail sergeant davies read only impatience in the face before him as the inspector folded his napkin and laid it neatly beside his plate a possible witness sir he claims he saw the colonel on monday morning no the man didnt know it was hard to believe but for some reason he hadnt been told davies hurried on in the lane that cuts between seven brothers field and the orchard and he saw captain wilton standing there beside the horse holding on to the bridle and talking to the colonel who was shaking his head as if he didnt like what he was hearing this must have been about seventhirty maybe even a quarter to eight then the captain suddenly stepped back his face very red and the colonel rode off leaving the captain standing there with his fists clenched rutledge silently cursed london for ineptitude he pulled out his notebook again and asked curtly how far is this place from where the colonel was found dead and why didnt you mention this witness sooner the sergeants face flushed as to how far sir its at most two miles east of the meadow he answered stiffly and i was sure theyd have told you in londonyou see the problem is that the witness is unreliable sir he was drunk he often is these days even an habitual drunk has been known to tell the truth rutledge added another line then looked up we cant discount what he says on those grounds alone no sir but theres more you see heswell hes shell shocked sir doesnt know where he is half the time thinks hes still at the front hears voices that kind of thing lost his nerve on the somme and went to pieces lack of moral fiber thats what it was it seems a shame for a fine man like the captain to be under suspicion of murder on the evidence of an acknowledged coward like daniel hickam doesnt it it isnt right sir is it but london had said nothingbowles had said nothing in the far corners of his mind behind the spinning turmoil of his own thoughts rutledge could hear the wild derisive echoes of hamishs laughter misunderstanding the horrified expression on rut ledges face sergeant davies nodded sympathetically aye he said its hard to swallow i know you were in the war then my youngest brother was in the balkans lost both arms took it like a man not a shred of weakness in tommy he began to fiddle with his cup as he went on as if to distract himself from the rest of what he had to say of course we didnt know about hickam at first i just came across him that same morning lying under a tree on the lane sleeping one off when i tried to wake him up and send him off home he swore he was sober as a judge and told me i could ask the colonel and the captain theyd vouch for him i thought he meant generally you see the cup spun out of his fingers clattering against the sugar bowl and almost tipping over the cream pitcher davies caught it returned it to his saucer then plowed on trying to conceal the sense of guilt that was still plaguing him i didnt pay any heed to him at first i was in a hurry to find inspector forrest and tell him about the murder but hickams place was on my way back to upper streetham and he was in no shape to get there on his own by the time id reached his house listening to him ramble all the way it was beginning to sound a bit different from what id first thought so inspector forrest went to talk to him that afternoon and got a little straighter version and we couldnt just shrug it off could we right or wrong we had to take note of it didnt we it was an appeal for forgiveness an admission of responsibility for what had plunged warwickshire and london into this present predicament if hed left well enough alone if he hadnt bothered to stop in the first place no one would ever have thought to question the likes of hickam about the colonel or the captain there would have been no reason no need rutledge still fighting his own battle for control managed to keep his voice level but the words came out harsh and cold apparently without any sympathy for the sergeants moral dilemma what did captain wilton have to say about hickams story well nothing that is he says he wasnt in the lane that morning he was walking in a different direction he says hes seen hickam from time to time in the mornings reeling home or sleeping wherever he was or having one of his crazy spells but not on that occasion which doesnt mean that hickam didnt see him sergeant davies was appalled youre saying the captains lying sir people do lie sergeant even those who have earned the victoria cross besides hickams description of what he saw is strangely complete isnt it the captain holding the colonels bridle the captains face turning red the captain stepping back with clenched fists if it didnt happen that morning if hickam saw the two men together on another occasion it could mean that their quarrel on the night before the murder had its roots in an earlier confrontation that there was more animosity between the colonel and his wards fiance than we know at this point sergeant davies was dubious even so hickam might have misread what he saw there might have been a perfectly reasonable explanation what if the two men were in agreement instead of quarreling what if theyd been angry at someone else or about something that neither of them liked then why would wilton deny that hed met harris in the lane if this encounter did have some perfectly innocent explanation no i think youre on the wrong track there well what if hickam confused what he saw with something that happened at the front he doesnt like officers he might even have made mischief on purpose you cant be really sure can you hickam might be capable of anything the disgust in davies face was almost a tangible thing i cant answer that until ive spoken to hickam and the captain hamishs laughter had faded he was able to think clearly again but his heart was still pounding hard with the shock shall we start with them then instead of miss wood no i want to see the colonels house and his ward first the truth was he wasnt prepared to face hickam now not until he was certain he could do it without betraying himself had anyone guessed in london no surely not it was sheer coincidence there were any number of shellshocked veterans scattered across england rutledge got to his feet my car is in the back ill meet you there in five minutes he nodded to barton redfern as he walked out of the dining room and the young man watched the two policemen until they were out of sight then listened to rutledges feet beating a quick tattoo up the carpeted stairs while the sergeants heavy leather heels clicked steadily down the stone passage leading to the inn yard upstairs in his room rutledge stood with his hands flat on the low windowsill leaning on them and looking down into the busy street below he was still shaken only a half dozen people knew about his condition and the doctors had promised to say nothing to the yard to give him a year to put his life back together first the question was had bowles kept silent about hickam because he hadnt thought it was something that mattered or because he had known it was and might embarrass rutledge no that was impossible it had been an oversightor at most bowles had tried to make this murder investigation sound more attractive than it was a kindness he remembered bowles from before the war good at his job with a reputation for ruthless ambition and a cold detachment sergeant fletcher whod died in the first gas attack on ypres used to claim that bowles frightened the guilty into confessing ive seen em shaking in their boots and more afraid of old bowles than they were of the hangman nasty piece of work ive never liked dealing with him mind you he did his job fair and square im not saying he didnt but he wasnt above using any tool that came to hand not kindness then not from a man like bowles still what london had done didnt matter now because here in his own room away from davies watchful eyes and redferns hovering rutledge was able to think more clearly and recognize a very tricky problem what if hickam turned out to be right if it should come to an arrestso far there was not enough evidence to look that far ahead but assuming there washow could the crown go into a court of law with a daniel hickam as its prime witness against a man wearing the ribbon of the victoria cross it would be ludicrous the defense would tear the case to shreds warwickshire would be screaming for the yards blood and the yard for his he had wanted an investigation complex enough to distract him from his own dilemmas well now he seemed to have got his wish in spades the question remained was he ready for it were his skills too rusty to handle something as difficult as the harris murder successfully worse still was he too personally involved if so he should back out now this instant call the yard and ask for a replacement to be sent at once but that would require explanations excuseslies or the truth he straightened turned from the window and reached for his coat if he quit now he was finished professionally and emotionally it wasnt a question of choice but of survival he would do his best it was all anyone could do and if in the days to come that wasnt enough he must find the courage to admit it until then he was going to have to learn exactly where he stood what he was made of the words coward and weakling had stung but what rankled in his soul was that he had said nothing not one single word in hickams defense in betraying hickam he felt he had betrayed himself rutledge and sergeant davies arrived at mallows the colonels wellrun estate on the warwick road half an hour later the sky had cleared to a cerulean blue the air clean and sweet with spring as the car turned in through the iron gates and went up the drive completely hidden from the main road by banks of old trees the house didnt emerge until they rounded the second bend and came out of the shadows into the sun then mellowed brick and tall windows warmed to gold reflected the early morning light setting them off was a wide sweep of lawn mown to crisp perfection the flower beds sharply edged and the drive smoothly raked one glance and you could tell that not only had pride gone into the upkeep of this house but unabashed love as well to rutledges appreciative eye a masters hand had created this marvelously graceful facade for the stone cornices quoins and moldings around the windows enhanced rather than overwhelmed the effect of elegant simplicity that the designer had been striving for he found himself wondering who the architect had been for this was a small jewel where had such a gift taken the man after this but davies couldnt say the colonel now he would have told you and if he wasnt too busy hed have taken out the old plans for you to see that was the kind of man he was never a stickler for rank he knew his place and trusted you to know yours as rutledge got out of the car he found himself looking up at the windows above one of the heavy drapes had twitched he thought the slight movement catching the corner of his eye in france where life itself depended on quick reflexes you learned to see your enemy first or you died it was as simple as that the staff had already placed a heavy black wreath on the broad wooden door its streamers lifting gently in the light breeze a butler answered the bell he was a thin man of middle height fiftyfive or thereabouts his face heavy with grief as if he mourned the colonel personally he informed rutledge and sergeant davies in tones of polished regret that miss wood was not receiving anyone today rutledge said only what is your name johnston sir the words were polite distant you may tell your mistress johnston that inspector rutledge is here on police business you know sergeant davies i think miss wood is still unwell inspector he cast an accusing glance at davies as if blaming him for rutledges illmannered persistence her doctor has already informed inspector forrest yes i understand we wont disturb her any longer than absolutely necessary the voice was firm that of an army officer giving instructions brooking no further opposition certainly not the voice of a lowly policeman begging entrance ill enquire the man replied with a resignation that clearly indicated both personal and professional disapproval but just as clearly made no promises he left them standing in the hall before a handsome staircase that divided at the firstfloor landing and continued upward in two graceful arcs these met again on the second story above the doorway to form an oval frame for a ceiling painting of nymphs and clouds with a venus of great beauty in the center from the hall she seemed to float in cloud cushioned luxury far beyond the reach of mere mortals staring down at them with a smile that was as tantalizing as it was smug johnston was gone for nearly fifteen minutes hamish growing restive as the tension of waiting mounted said ive never been inside a house like this look at the floor man its squares of marble enough to pave the streets in my village and that stairwhat holds it up then its a marvel and worth a murder or two rutledge ignored him and the uncomfortable stiffness of sergeant davies who seemed to grow more wooden with every passing minute the butler returned eventually and said with illconcealed censure miss wood will receive you in her sitting room but she asks that you will make your call brief he led the way up the staircase to the first floor and then turned left down a wide carpeted corridor to a door near the end of it the room beyond was quite spacious uncluttered and ordinarily rutledge thought full of light from the long windows facing the drive but the heavy rose velvet drapes had been drawnwas it these he had seen stirand only one lamp on an inlaid table made a feeble effort to penetrate the gloom lettice wood was tall and slim with heavy dark hair that was pinned loosely on the top of her head smooth wings from a central parting cupping her ears before being drawn up again she was wearing unrelieved black her skirts rustling slightly as she turned to watch them come toward her inspector rutledge she said as if she couldnt distinguish between the upper streetham sergeant and the representative of scotland yard she did not ask them to be seated though she herself sat on a brocade couch that faced the fireplace and there were two upholstered chairs on either side of it a seventeenthcentury desk stood between two windows and against one wall was a rosewood cabinet filled with a collection of old silver reflecting the single lamp like watching eyes from the jungles edge sergeant davies behind rutledge stayed by the door and began to fumble in his pocket for his notebook for a moment the man from london and the woman in mourning considered each other in silence each gauging temperament from the slender evidence of appearance the lamplight reached rutledges face while hers was shadowed but her voice when she spoke had been husky and strained that of someone who had spent many hours crying her grief was very realand yet something about it disturbed him something lurked in the dimness that he didnt want to identify im sorry we must intrude miss wood he found himself saying with stiff formality and i offer our profoundest sympathy but im sure you understand the urgency of finding the person or persons responsible for your guardians death my guardian she said it flatly as if it had no meaning for her then she added with painful vehemence i cant imagine how anyone could have done such a terrible thing to him or why it was a senseless savage she stopped and he could see that she had swallowed hard to hold back angry tears it served no purpose she added finally in a defeated voice what has served no purpose rutledge asked quietly his death or the manner of it that jolted her as if she had been talking to herself and not to him and was surprised to find hed read her thoughts she leaned forward slightly and he could see her face then blotched with crying and sleeplessness but most unusual nevertheless with a highbridged nose and a sensitive mouth and heavylidded eyes he couldnt tell their color but they were not dark sculpted cheekbones a determined chin a long slender throat and yet somehow she managed to convey an odd impression of warm sensuality he remembered how the sergeant had hesitated over the word attractive as if uncertain how to classify her she was not in the ordinary sense beautiful at the same time she was far very far from plain i dont see how you can separate them she answered after a moment a blackedged handkerchief twisting in her long slim fingers he wasnt simply killed was he he was destroyed blotted out it was deliberate vengeful even scotland yard cant change that but the man who did this will be hanged thats the only comfort ive got there was a deeper note in her voice as she spoke of hanging as if she relished the image of it in her mind then perhaps we ought to begin with last monday morning did you see your guardian before he left the house she hesitated then said i didnt go riding that morning before he could take her up on that stark reply she added charles loved mallows loved the land he said those rides made up a little for all the months he spent away so he usually went out alone and it was never a fixed route you see just wherever his list for that day took himit might be inspecting a crop or a tenants roof or the state of the hedges or livestock anything and he came back feelingfulfilled i suppose it was a way of healing after all hed been through how many people knew what was on his list each day it wasnt written down it was in his head laurence royston might be aware that charles was planning to look into a particular problem if theyd discussed it but for the most part it was charless own interests that guided him i dont suppose you were a soldier inspector but charles once said that the greatest crime of the war was ruining the french countryside for a generation not the slaughter of armies but the slaughter of the land she leaned back out of the light again as if realizing that she was running on and had lost his attention i didnt go riding that morning rutledge considered those words ignoring the rest of what she had said it was as if that one fact separated her entirely from what had happened but in what way he had heard soldiers offer the same excuse to avoid discussing what they had witnessed on the battlefield but had not been a part of i wasnt in that assault i dont know and i dont want to know a denial then but was it a washing of hands or a means of telling the absolute but not the whole truth her face was still but she was watching him waiting in the security of the darkness for him to ask his next question her grief appeared to be genuine and yet she was doing nothing whatsoever to help him he could feel her resistance like a physical barrier as if they were adversaries not joined in a mutual hunt for a murderer she in her turn was silently counting her heartbeats willing them to a steady rhythm so that her breathing didnt betray her in feeling lay disaster not for this london stranger with his chill impersonal eyes was she going to lay out her most private emotions and watch them probed and prodded for meaning let him do the job he had been sent to do and why was it taking so bloody long charles had been gone for three days the silence lengthened sergeant davies cleared his throat as if made uneasy by undercurrents he couldnt understand for they were there strong undercurrents emotions so intense they were like ominous shadows in the room even hamish was silent changing his tactics abruptly rutledge asked what did your fiance captain wilton and your guardian discuss after dinner on sunday the night before the colonels death her attention returned to him with a swift wariness the heavylidded eyes opened wide for an instant but she answered surely youve spoken to mark about that id prefer to hear what you have to say first i understand that whatever it was led to a quarrel a quarrel her voice was sharp now i went upstairs after dinner ididnt feel well charles and mark were in the drawing room when i left them talking about one of the guests invited to the wedding neither of them liked the man but both felt they had to include him an officer theyd served with my guardian in the boer war and mark in france i cant imagine them quarreling over that yet the servants told inspector forrest that there had been angry words between the two men that in fact captain wilton had stormed out of the house in a rage and that colonel harris flung his wineglass at the door the captain had slammed behind him she was rigid her attention fixed on him with fierce intensity even the handkerchief no longer unconsciously threaded itself through her fingers he suddenly had the impression that this was news to her that she had been unaware of what had happened in the hall but she said only if they heard that much they must have been able to tell you what it was all about unfortunately they witnessed only the end of it i see as if distracted by some thought of her own she said nothing for a time and rutledge waited wishing he could know what was going on behind those longlashed eyes then she roused herself and repeated yes that is unfortunate isnt it still you must know that neither charles nor mark is a hotheaded man id hardly describe slamming a door in anger or breaking a crystal glass against it as coolheaded but well have the answer to that in good time rutledge responded noting with interest that she hadnt rushed to captain wiltons defense when she had been given the perfect opening to do just that yet she must have realized where such questions were leading oddly enough he thought she had and discounted it or ignored it accustomed to reaching beyond words into emotional responses he found her elusiveness puzzling but he couldnt be sure whether that was his faultor hers he took another tack giving her a second opening but in a different direction do you believe this man mavers might have killed the colonel apparently hes caused trouble for your guardian for a number of years she blinked then said mavers hes been a troublemaker all his life he seems to thrive on it he sows dissent for the sheer simple pleasure of it glancing at sergeant davies she said but turning to murder risking the gallows i cant see him going that far can you she frowned unless of course it might be just what he wanted she added thoughtfully in what way hes been everything from a conscientious objector to a roaring bolshevikwhatever might stir up people make them angry but everyone has more or less grown used to his ranting sometimes i even forget hes there laurencemr roystonalways said it was the best way to take the wind out of his sails but charles felt that it might tip mavers over the line that being ignored was the one thing he dreaded that it was anybodys guess what he might do then charles was a good judge of character he knew mavers better than the rest of us did still if i were you id be wary of any confession mavers made unless it was backed up by indisputable proof which was a decidedly puzzling remark she had just been offered a readymade scapegoat and she had refused it in his mind rutledge went back over what shed just said listening for nuances well if she was trying to shift the direction of the enquiry she had done it with an odd subtlety that was only just short of brilliant davies out of her range of vision was nodding as if he agreed with her about mavers being the killer and shed said nothing of the sort if it hadnt occurred to her that the captain needed defending why had questions about the quarrel made her so wary had harris been at fault there and she was trying to preserve his good name his reputation rutledge moved to the mantel hoping that the change in angles might help him see her more clearly in the shadows but her face was closed her thoughts so withdrawn from him that he might as well try to read the engraving on the silver bowl at her elbow the pallid light reached neither of them is there anyone else in the village to your knowledge with a reason to wish your guardian dead charles had no enemies she sighed there are those who might wish mark dead if you believe the gossips but charles he was never here long enough to make enemies he was a soldier and leave was a rare thing a time of respite not for stirring up trouble no land disputes no boundary quarrels no toes stepped on in the county ive not heard of them but ask laurence royston his agent he can tell you about running the estate and whether there were disputes that might have festered i cant help you there i only came here to live near the end of the war when id finished school before that i was allowed to visit on school holidays when charles had leave otherwise i went home with one of my classmates questioning her was like fencing with a willothewisp i dont know i cant help you there i didnt go riding that morning and yet he had believed her when she said that hanging the murderer would bring her comfort in his experience the shock of sudden violent death often aroused anger and a thirst for vengeance but it seemed to be the only natural anticipated reaction hed gotten from her why did she keep drifting away from him he was reminded by a shifting of feet that sergeant da vies was in the room a witness to everything she said a man who lived in upper streetham who presumably had a wife and friends was that the problem he rutledge was a private person himself he understood the fierce need for privacy in others and if that was the case he was wasting his time now how did you spend the morning before the news was brought to you she was frowning trying to remember as if that had been years ago not a matter of days i bathed and dressed came down to breakfast the usual then i had a number of letters to write and was just coming out of the library to see if mr royston might take them into warwick for me when she stopped abruptly then continued in a harsh voice i really dont recall what happened after that you didnt leave the house go to the stables of course not why on earth should i tell you i did one thing when id done another rutledge took his leave soon afterward davies seemed relieved to be on his way downstairs at the butlers heels showing an almost indecent haste to be gone but rutledge felt unsatisfied as if somehow he had been neatly outmaneuvered in that darkened room thinking back over what the girl had said he couldnt pinpoint any particular reason for disbelieving anything shed told him but doubt nagged at him she couldnt be more than twenty one or twentytwo and yet she had shown a selfpossession that was uncommon at that ageor any other and he hadnt been able to break through to the person underneath to the emotions that must be there to the unspoken words hed wanted to hear but that she had managed to hold back her detachment then that was what disturbed him as if she didnt connect the reality of violent death with the questions that the police were asking her no passionate defense of her fiance no rush to push mavers forward in his place no speculation about the nature of the killer at all it was almost he thought with one of those leaps of intuition that had served him so well in the past as if she already knew who the killer wasand was planning her own private retribution i cant imagine how anyone could have done such a terrible thing to him shed said not whohow then as he reached the foot of the stairs he remembered something else both sergeant davies and the butler had mentioned a doctor had the girl been given sedatives that left her in this sleepwalkers state detached from grief and from reality too hed seen men in hospital talk quietly of unspeakable horrors when theyd been given drugs stumbling to describe terrors they couldnt endure to think about until they were so heavily sedated that the pain and the frantic anxiety were finally dulled he himself had confessed to hamishs presence only under the influence of such drugs nothing else would have dragged that out of him and afterward he had tried to kill the doctor for tricking him theyd had to pull him off the man and hed fought every inch of the way back to his room it might be a good idea then to speak to the familys doctor before deciding what to do about lettice wood before the butler could see them safely out the door rut ledge turned to him and asked what was your name again johnston yes sir can you show me the drawing room please where the quarrel between the captain and the colonel took place johnston turned and walked silently across the polished marble to a door on his left he opened it showing them into a room of cool greens and gold reflecting the morning light without absorbing it miss wood had coffee brought in here after dinner and when the gentlemen joined her she dismissed me soon afterward she went upstairs sending for one of the maids and saying that she had a headache and would like a cool cloth for her head that was around nine oclock perhaps a quarter past at tenfifteen i came here to take away the coffee tray and to see if anything else was needed before i locked up for the night and you hadnt been into or near the drawing room between taking the tray in and coming to remove it no sir what happened then at tenfifteen at rutledges prodding johnston stepped back into the hall again pointed to a door in the shadows of the stairs and went on reluctantly i came out of that doorit leads to the back of the houseand started toward the drawing room at that moment mary was coming down the stairs who is mary theres seven on the staff here sir myself the cook her helper and four maids before the war there were twelve of us including footmen mary is one of the maids and has been here the longest next to mrs treacher and myself go on mary was coming down the stairs and she said when i came into view that she was looking to see if the banisters and the marble floor needed polishing the next morning if not she was going to put nancy to polishing the grates now that we were no longer making up morning fires and and at that moment johnston answered heavily the door of the drawing room opened and the captain came out i didnt see his facehe was looking over his shoulder back into the roombut i heard him say quite distinctly and very loudly ill see you in hell first then he slammed the drawingroom door behind him and went out the front door slamming that as well i dont think he saw me here or mary on the stairs he seemed to run out of words finish your story man rutledge said impatiently before the front door had slammed i heard the colonel shout that can be arranged and the sound of glass shattering against this door his hand drew their eyes to the raw nick in the glossy paint of one panel where the glass had struck with such force that a piece of it must have wedged in the wood do you think captain wilton heard the colonel in spite of himself johnston smiled the colonel sir was accustomed to making himself heard on a parade ground and over the din of the battlefield i would think that the captain heard him as clearly as i did and slammed the front door with added emphasis because of it it was a glass that shattered not a cup the colonel usually had a glass of brandy with his coffee and the captain always joined him when you cleaned this room the next morning did you find that two glasses had been used yes sir johnston answered perplexed of course which means that the two men drank together and were still on comfortable terms at that point in the evening i would venture to say so yes had you ever heard a quarrel between them before this particular evening no sir they seemed to be on the best of terms had they drunk enough do you think to have become quarrelsome for no reason or over some petty issue with respect sir johnston said indignantly the colonel was not a man to become argumentative in his cups he held his liquor like a gentleman and so to my knowledge did the captain besides he added rather spoiling the lofty effect hed just created the level in the decanters showed no more than two drinks had been poured one each do you feel having witnessed the captains departure that this was a disagreement that could have been smoothed over comfortably the next day he was very angry at the time i cant say how captain wilton might have felt the next morning but i can tell you that the colonel seemed in no way unsettled when he came down for his morning ride very much himself as far as i could see and miss wood was in her bedroom throughout the quarrel she didnt rejoin the men in the drawing room to your knowledge no sir mary looked in on her before she came down the stairs to see if she needed anything more and miss wood appeared to be asleep so she didnt speak to her what did the colonel do after the captain left i dont know sir i thought it best not to disturb him at that moment and i came back twenty minutes later by that time he had gone up to bed himself and i went about my nightly duties before turning in at eleven would you like to see mary now sir ill talk to mary and the rest of the staff later rutledge said and walked to the door there he turned to look back at the drawing room and then at the staircase under ordinary circumstances wilton would have noticed johnston and the maid as soon as he came out of the drawingroom door but if he had been looking back at charles harris instead he might not have been aware of either servant silent and unobtrusive behind him with a nod rutledge opened the front door before johnston could reach it to see him out and with sergeant davies hurrying after him walked down the broad shallow stone steps and across the drive to the car hamish growling irritably said i dont like yon butler i dont hold with the rich anyway or their toadies its a better job than you ever held rutledge retorted and then swore under his breath but davies had been getting into the car and heard only the sound of his voice not his words he looked up to say i beg pardon sir the heavy drapes of the sitting room upstairs parted a little and lettice wood watched rutledge climb into the car and start the engine when it had passed out of sight around the first bend of the drive she let the velvet fall back into place and wandered aimlessly to the table where the lamp still burned she flicked it off and stood there in the darkness if only she could think clearly he would be back she was certain of that prying into everything wanting to know about charles asking about mark and he wasnt like the elderly forrest there would be no deference or fatherly concern from him not with those cold eyes she must have her wits about her then the problem was what would mark tell them how was she to know she put her hands to her head pressing cold fingers into her temples he looked as if hed been ill this inspector from scotland yard and such people were often difficult why had forrest sent for him why had it been necessary to drag london into this business awful enough already without strangers trampling about why hadnt they left it to inspector forrest will we speak to mavers now sir no captain wilton next i think hes staying with his cousin mrs davenant shes a widow has a house just on the outskirts of town the other end of upper streetham from mallows he gave rutledge directions and then began to scan his notebook as if checking to make certain he had put down the salient points of the conversations with lettice wood and johnston i thought rutledge said that the servants claimed that the argument between the colonel and the captain concerned the wedding johnston said nothing about it it was the maid mary satterthwaite who mentioned that sir then why didnt you say so while we were there id have spoken to her straightaway davies flipped back through his notebook to a page near the beginning she said she went up to miss woods room to bring a cold cloth for her head and miss wood was telling her that she had left the gentlemen to discuss the marriage but the way miss wood said it led mary to think it wasnt going to be a friendly discussion and then having seen the end of the quarrel the maid merely jumped to the conclusion that that was what they were still talking about apparently so sir which was no evidence at all when is the wedding davies flipped several more pages on the twentysecond of september sir and miss wood and the captain have been engaged for seven months rutledge considered that in an hours timefrom the moment that lettice wood left the pair together until johnston had seen wilton storming out of the housethe subject of conversation could have ranged far and wide if there had been a discussion of the wedding at ninefifteen surely it would not have lasted an hour and developed into a quarrel at this stage the details having been ironed out seven months ago and the arrangements for september already well in hand without warning he found himself thinking of jean of their own engagement in that hot emotiontorn summer of a lifetime ago of the endless letters passing back and forth to france as they dreamed and planned of the acute longing that had kept him alive when nothing else had mattered of the wedding that had never taken place of jeans white face in his hospital room when he had offered her the chance to break off the engagement she had smiled nervously and taken it murmuring something about the war having changed both of them while he sat there still aching with love and his need for her trying with every ounce of his being to hide it from her shed said im not the girl you remember in i loved you so madlyi think anything would have been possible then but too much time has passed too much has happened to both of uswe were apart so long i dont even know myself anymore of course i still care buti dont think i should marry anyone just nowit wouldnt be fair to marry anyone yet despite the quiet voice and the scrupulously chosen words that tried desperately to spare both of them pain he could see the truth in her eyes it was fear she was deathly afraid of him mrs davenant lived in a georgian brick house standing well back from the road it was surrounded by an ivy clad wall with ornate iron gates and set in a pleasant garden already bright with early color roses and larkspur drooped over the narrow brick walk so heavy with rain from the night before that they left a speckled pattern of dampness on rutledges trousers as he brushed past them on his way to the door surprisingly mrs davenant answered the bell herself she was a slender graceful woman in her thirties her fair hair cut becomingly short around her face but drawn into a bun on the back of her neck tendrils escaping its rigorous pinning curled delicately against very fine skin giving her a fragile quality like rare porcelain her eyes were dark blue with naturally dark lashes making them appear deep set and almost violet she nodded a greeting to sergeant davies and then said to rutledge you must be the man from london her eyes scanned his face and his height and his clothes with cool interest inspector rutledge id like to speak to you if i may and to captain wilton mark has gone for a walk i dont think he slept well last night and walking always soothes him please come in she led them not into the drawing room but down a passage beyond the stairs to a comfortable sitting room that still had a masculine ambience as if it had been her late husbands favorite part of the house paintings of hunting scenes hung above the fireplace and on two of the walls while a collection of pipes in a low glassfronted cabinet stood beneath a small but exquisite canaletto this is a dreadful business she was saying as rutledge took the chair she offered him sergeant davies went to stand by the hearth as if her invitation to be seated had not included him she accepted this without comment simply dreadful i cant imagine why anyone would have wanted to kill charles harris he was a thoroughly nice man there was a ring of sincerity in the words an elderly woman in a black dress and white apron came to the doorway and after glancing toward her mrs dav enant asked would you care for coffee inspector sergeant when they declined she nodded to the woman and said that will be all then grace and close the door behind you please when the woman had gone rutledge said do your servants live in mrs davenant no agnes and grace come in daily to clean and to prepare meals agnes isnt here just now her granddaughter is very ill ben is my groomgardener he lives over the stables she lifted her eyebrows in a query as if expecting rut ledge to explain his interest in her staff can you tell me what state of mind captain wilton was in when he came home from mallows the evening before the colonel was killed his state of mind she repeated i dont know i had already gone to bed when he dined with lettice and the colonel i didnt wait up for him the next morning then he seemed a little preoccupied over his breakfast i suppose but then ive grown used to that lettice and mark are very much in love she smiled lettice has been good for him you know he was so changed when he came home from france darkbitter i think he hated flying then which is sad because before the warbefore the killingit had been his greatest passion now lettice is everything to him i dont think charles could have stood in the way of this marriage if hed wanted to rutledge could see that she was fond of her cousinand from her unguarded comments he gathered that it hadnt yet occurred to her that wilton might have killed harris it was interesting he thought that she spoke freely warmly and yet with an odddetachment was that it as if her own emotions were locked away and untouched by the ugliness of murder or as if she had held them in for so very long that it had become second nature to her it was a response to widowhood in some women but there could be many other reasons did captain wilton go for a walk on monday morning of course he likes the exercise and since the crash you knew that he crashed just before the war endedsince then riding has been difficult for him his knee was badly smashed and although its hardly noticeable now when he walks controlling a horse is another matter rutledge studied her an attractive woman with the sort of fair english beauty that men were supposed to dream about in the trenches as they died for king and country she was dressed in a soft rose silk that in the light from the long windows gave her skin a warm blush the same blush it might have when stirred by passion he found himself wondering if charles harris had ever been drawn to her a man sometimes carried a picture in his mind when he spent long years abroada tie with home whether real or fancied where does captain wilton usually walk she shrugged i cant tell you that where the spirit takes him i daresay one day as i came home from the village i saw a farm cart dropping him off at our gate and he told me he had walked to lower streetham and halfway to bampton beyond along the way hed picked a small posy of wildflow ers for lettice but it had wilted by then a pity i understand that he had a quarrel with charles harris on sunday evening after dinner do you have any idea what that was about with a sigh of exasperation she said inspector forrest asked me the same question when he came about the shotguns i cant imagine charles and mark quarreling oh goodnaturedly about a horse or military tactics or the like but not a serious argument they got along famously the two of them ever since they met in france on leave in paris i understand that the captain had spent some time here before he and colonel harris werent acquainted then charles was in egypt i think the summer my husband died and lettice of course was away at school the wedding arrangements then they appeared to be progressing smoothly as far as i know lettice has ordered her gown and next week she was to go to london for the first fitting the invitations have been sent to the printer flowers chosen for the wedding breakfast plans for the wedding trip madei doubt if mark would have objected if lettice had wished to go to the moon and charles doted on her he wouldnt have begrudged her anything her heart desired she only needed to ask what was there to quarrel about mrs davenant made the marriage sound idyllic such a piece of high romance that even death couldnt stand in its way and yet in the three days since charles harris had been found murdered lettice had apparently not asked to see wilton nor as far as he rutledge knew had wilton gone to mallows he was about to pursue that line of thought when the sittingroom door opened and captain wilton walked across the threshold he was wearing country tweeds and they became him as well as his uniform must have done fitting his muscular body with an air of easy elegance the newspaper photographs of him standing before the king had not done him justice he was as fair as his cousin his eyes as dark a blue and he fit the popular conception of war hero to perfection wrap a bluidy bandage around his forehead gie him a sword in one hand and a flag in the other and hed do for a recruitment poster hamish remarked sourly only they bombed poor sods in the trenches those fine airmen and shot other pilots down in flames i wonder now is burning to death worse than smothering in the mud rutledge shivered involuntarily wilton greeted rutledge with a nod making the same comment that his cousin had made earlier you must be the man from london inspector rutledge id like to talk to you if you dont mind he glanced at mrs davenant if you would excuse us she rose with smiling grace and said ill be in the garden if you want to see me again before you go she gave her cousin a comfortable glance and left the room shutting the door gently behind her i dont know what questions you may have wilton said at once setting his walking stick in a stand by the door and taking the chair she had vacated but i can tell you that i wasnt the person who shot charles harris why should i think you were rutledge asked because you arent a fool and i know how forrest danced around his suspicions hemming and hawing over my abrupt departure from mallows on sunday evening and wanting to know what charles and i were discussing that next morning when that damned fool hickam claims to have seen us in the lane as a point of interest did you and the colonel meet on monday morning in the lane or anywhere else for that matter no the single word was unequivocal what was your quarrel about after dinner on the night before the murder it was a personal matter nothing to do with this enquiry you may take my word for it there are no personal matters when it comes to murder rutledge said ill ask you again what were you discussing that sunday evening after miss wood went up to her room and ill tell you again that its none of your business wilton was neither angry nor irritated only impatient did it have anything to do with your marriage to miss wood we didnt discuss my marriage rutledge took note however of the change in wording my not our then did you discuss the settlement where youd live after the wedding how youd live muscles around his mouth tightened but he answered readily enough that had all been worked out months before the settlement was never a problem lettice has her own money wed live in somerset where i have a house and visit here as often as she liked he hesitated then added id expected after the war to go into aircraft design next to flying its what i wanted most to do nowim not as sure as i was why not when wilton didnt answer immediately rutledge continued for reasons of money wilton shook his head impatiently im tired of killing i spent four years proving that the machines i flew were good at it and thats all his majestys ministers want to hear about aeroplanes at the moment how to make them deadlier my mothers people are in banking there are other choices open to me but there was a bleakness in his voice rutledge responded to it recognizing it he himself had debated the wisdom of returning to the yard coming back to the business of murder before the war it had been another facet of the law his father had given a lifetime to upholding nowhe had seen too many dead bodies yet it was what he knew best then bringing himself up sharply he said more harshly than he had intended have you seen miss wood since her guardians death wilton seemed surprised that it should matter to rutledge no as a matter of fact i havent she apparently has no other family under the circumstances it would be natural for you to be at her side and so i would be if there was anything i might do for her he retorted stiffly look i went to mallows as soon as i heard the news dr warren was already there and he said she needed rest that the shock had been severe i sent up a message by maryone of the maidsbut lettice was already asleep warren warned me that it could be several days before she recovered sufficiently to see anyone ive made an effort to respect his judgment under the circumstances as you so aptly put it there isnt much else i can do as long as shes asleep in her bedroom but she hadnt been asleep when rutledge called dr warren has been sedating her then what do you think she was wild at first she insisted that she be taken to charles at once which of course warren could hardly do and then she collapsed she lost both her parents when she was four and i dont suppose she remembers them clearly charles has been the only family shes known rutledge took the opening hed been given tell me what sort of person charles harris was wiltons eyes darkened a fine officer a firm friend a loving guardian a gentleman it sounded like an epitaph written by a besotted widow something queen victoria might have said about prince albert in a fit of highflown passion which tells me absolutely nothing rutledges voice was quiet but there was a crackle to it now did he have a temper was he a man who carried a grudge did he make enemies easily did he keep his friends was he a heavy drinker did he have affairs was he honest in his business dealings wilton frowned his elbows on the chair arm his fingers steepled before his face half concealing it yes he had a temper but hed learned long ago to control it i dont know if he carried grudges or not but most of his friends were army men hed served with for many years i dont know if he had enemiesi never heard of any unless you wish to include that idiot mavers as for his drinking ive seen charles drunkwe all got drunk in france when we couldbut he was a moderate drinker as a rule and affairs with women must have been discreet ive never heard him described as a womanizer youll have to ask royston about business matters ive no idea how they stand you met harris during the war in france just at the end of in spite of the differences in age and rank we became friends a year ago when he heard i was coming out of hospital he brought me to mallows for the weekend thats when i met his ward if he had secrets he managed to keep them from me i saw nothing vicious mean or unworthy in the man the hands had come down as if the need for them as a shield had passed this was a better epitaph but still no help to rutledge who wanted the living flesh and blood and bone of the man and yet he died violently in a quiet english meadow this past monday morning and while everyone tells me he was a good man no one seems to be in any particular haste to find his killer i find that rather curious of course we want the killer found wilton responded coloring angrily whoever it is deserves to hang and what i can do i shall do but i cant think of any reason why charles should have been shot and you damned well wouldnt thank me for muddying the waters for you with wild useless conjectures then well start with facts when did you leave this house on monday morning where did you go at half past seven wilton had gotten himself under control again but his words were still clipped exercise strengthens my knee on monday i followed the lane that runs just behind the church and up the hill beyond skirting mallows i reached the crest of the ridge went on toward the old mill ruins on the far side of it which lie near the bridge over the ware then returned the same way this was not the lane where hickam claimed to have seen the colonel and the captain having words did you hear the shot that killed him or sounds of the searchmen shouting or calling i heard no shooting at all i ran into one of the farm people on my way home and he told me what had happened it was a shock he stirred suddenly as if reminded of it i couldnt really believe it my first thought was for lettice and i went straight to mallows did you meet anyone during your walk two people a farmers child who had lost her doll and was sitting on a stump crying i spoke to her told her id keep an eye open for the doll and asked if she knew her way home she said she did she often came that way to pick wildflowers for her mother later i saw helena sommers she was on the ridge with her field glasses and didnt stop just waved her hand what about the colonels man of business royston he went down to the stables looking for harris and got there just as the horse came in without its rider in time in fact to direct the search do you think hes honest or is there the possibility that the meeting he was expecting to have with the colonel at ninethirty might have been one he had reasons to prevent do you mean for example that royston may have been cheating charles embezzling or whatever had been caught and expected to be sacked at ninethirty when charles came in he frowned again considering the possibility i suppose he could have reached the meadow ahead of charles shot him and made it home again before the horse arrived in the stable yard assuming he took the shortcut over the stile and the riderless horse stuck to the track but you cant count on horses can you not if theyre frightened rutledge thought no one has mentioned a shortcut but charles never spoke to me about any trouble with royston wilton continued and of course theres the shotgun he hadnt taken one from mallows forrest checked those straightaway ive heard someone say that it would have been less surprising to hear you were the victim not harris across the room rutledge saw sergeant davies stir as if to stop him from betraying lettice wood but captain wilton was laughing you mean lettices other suitors might have had it in for me i cant see either haldane or carfield lying in wait to murder me can you sergeant the laughter died suddenly and a shadow passed over the captains face thats foolishness he added but with less conviction rutledge left the questioning there and took his leave mark wilton waited until he had heard the front door close behind the two policemen then sat down again in his chair he wondered if they had spoken to lettice and what she had said to them what would she say to him if he went to mallows now he couldnt bring himself to think about charles harriss death only what difference it might make he closed his eyes head back against the chair oh god what a tangle but if he kept his wits about himif he was patient and his love for lettice didnt trip him up it would all come right in the end he had to believe that as rutledge and the sergeant let themselves out they saw mrs davenant coming toward them with a basket of cut flowers roses and peonies with such a rich heavy scent that rutledge was reminded of funerals im sending these to lettice to cheer her a little have you talked with that man mavers i wouldnt put anything past him not even murder wed be well rid of him believe me he was haranguing people in the market square on monday morning nobody really paid any attention to himthey seldom do making a nuisance of himself thats all he thinks of rutledge thanked her and she went back to her flowers humming a little under her breath in quiet satisfaction as the car pulled away from the gate hamish said unexpectedly the captains a right fool and too handsome for his own good if a husband didnt want him dead a woman might ignoring the voice rutledge turned to davies and said where can i find daniel hickam we might as well talk to him and get it over with i dont know sir he lives in his mothers cottage at the edge of the villagejust ahead there that ramshackle one beyond the straggling hedge he pointed to a swaybacked cottage so old that it seemed to be collapsing of its own weight a bit at a time and leaving in doubt whether it would go first in the center or at the walls shes dead and hes taken over the place doing odd jobs where he can to earn his food they stopped by the hedge and went to knock at the door but there was no answer davies lifted the latch and peered inside the single room was dark and cluttered but empty he must be in town then so they drove on into upper streetham and saw laurence royston coming from the post office sergeant davies pointed him out and rutledge looked him over he was in his late thirties or early forties already graying at the temples neither plain nor particularly attractive but he carried himself well and had that appearance of solidity which people seem instinctively to trust whether trust is justified or not his face was square with a straight nose a stubborn chin and a welldefined jaw set above a heavy neck and broad shoulders rutledge blew his horn and royston turned at the sound frowning at the unknown man in the unfamiliar vehicle then he noticed sergeant davies in the other seat and came over to them as the car pulled into a space between two wagons inspector rutledge ive taken over the harris case and id like to talk to you if i may royston stuffed the mail he was carrying into his coat pocket and said here rutledge suggested the bar at the shepherds crook half empty at this time of day where they ordered coffee from redfern when hed gone royston said ive never had such a shock in my life as charless death even when i saw the grooms holding his horse and blood all over the saddle i thought he was hurt not dead i thoughti dont know what i thought my god the man came through two wars with hardly a scratch theres the boer musket ball in his leg still and a german sniper got him in the left shoulder in france but even that wasnt particularly serious i never imagined he shook his head it was horrible a nightmare you cant accept as real you were expecting to meet the colonel that morning at ninethirty yes for our regular discussion of the days work he liked to be involved when he could my father told me once that he felt colonel harris had had a difficult time deciding between the traditional family career in the army and staying at home to run mallows and you could see that it might be true so when he was there i kept him informed of everything that was happening why did you go down to the stables it wasnt like charles to be late but we had a valuable mare in foal and i thought he might have looked in on her and found she was in trouble so i went to see i needed to drive into warwick and if he was busy i wanted to suggest that we put off our meeting until after lunch there was nothing set for discussion that you were glad of an excuse to postpone royston looked up from his coffee with something like distaste on his face if anything id have been glad to postpone going into warwick i had an appointment with my dentist rutledge smiled but made a mental note to check on that how long have you worked for the colonel about twenty years now i took over when my father died of a heart attack i didnt know what else to do charles was out in south africa when he got home he liked the way id managed the estate and asked me to stay on it was a rare opportunity at my age i was only twenty but id grown up at mallows you see i knew as much about the place as anyone charles could have found a far more experienced man but i think he was glad to have someone who actually cared that was the way he did things he looked after his land the men serving under him and of course miss wood to the best of his ability and youll go on running the estate now roystons eyebrows shot up i dont know god i hadnt even thought about it but surely miss wood will inherit mallows theres no family i havent seen the colonels will is there a copy here or must i send to his solicitors in london theres a copy in his strongbox he left it there in the event he was killedwith the army i mean its sealed of course i dont know what it says but i see no reason why i shouldnt give it to you if you think it will help why would anyone shoot colonel harris roystons face darkened mavers mightve hes the kind of man who cant make anything of himself so he tries to drag down his betters hes run on about the bolsheviks for nearly a year now and how they shot the czar and his family to clear the way for reforms i wouldnt put it past the bastard to think that killing the colonel might be the closest he could come to doing the same but the colonel isnt the primary landholder in upper streetham is he no the haldanes are the davenants used to be just about as big but hugh davenant was not the man his father was and he lost most of his money in wild schemes then had to sell off land to pay his debts thats mrs davenants late husband im speaking of she was lucky he died when he did he hadnt learned a lesson as far as i could tell and shed have been penniless in the end but he had no head for business it was as simple as that who bought most of the davenant land harris he bought several fields that ran along his own but hal dane and mrs crichtons agent took the lions share she lives in london shes ninety now if shes a day and hasnt set foot in upper streetham since the turn of the century which leaves us with mavers wanting to shoot the czar and a choice between harris and the haldanes people like mavers dont think the way you and i do he had a running feud with harris and if he wanted to kill anyone hed probably choose the colonel on principle in fact he once said as much when the colonel threatened to put him away if he tried to poison the dogs again he said dog and master they deserve the same fate when did this happen before the war or later on yes before but you havent met mavers have you he has witnesses who say he was here in the village on monday morning making one of his speeches to people coming in to market royston shrugged what if he was nobody pays any heed to his nonsense he could have slipped away for a time and never be missed rutledge considered that it was a very interesting possibility and mrs davenant had made much the same comment do you think captain wilton killed harris royston firmly shook his head thats ridiculous whatever for daniel hickam claims he saw the colonel and the captain having words on monday morning shortly before the shooting as if a quarrel the night before had carried over into the morning and suddenly turned violent hickam told you that royston laughed shortly id as soon believe my cat as a drunken halfmad coward prepared for the reaction this time rutledge still flinched the words seemed to tear at his nerve endings like a physical pain through it he asked did you see the body yourself when word was brought that the colonel had been found yes royston shuddered they were babbling that the colonel had been shot and that there was blood everywhere and my first question was has any one of you fools checked to see if hes still breathing and they looked at me as if id lost my wits when i got there i knew why i tell you if id been the one whod done it i couldnt have gone back there not for anything i couldnt believe it was charles at first even though i recognized his spurs the jacket the ring on his hand itthe bodylookedi dont know somehow obscenelike something inhuman when royston had gone rutledge finished his coffee and said gloomily weve got ourselves a paragon of all virtues a man no one had any reason to kill if you dont count mav erswho happens to have the best alibi of the lotyoure left with wilton and that damned quarrel tell me sergeant what was harris really like just that sir the sergeant replied addressing the question as if he thought it slightly idiotic a very nice man not at all the sort youd expect to end up murdered very soon after that they found daniel hickam standing in the middle of the high street intent on directing traffic that no one else could see rutledge pulled over in front of a row of small shops and studied the man for a time most of the shell shock victims hed seen in hospital had been docile sitting with blank faces staring blindly into the abyss of their own terrors or pacing back and forth hour after hour as if bent on outdistancing the demons pursuing them the violent cases had been locked away out of sight but he had heard them raving at night the corridors echoing with screams and obscenities and cries for help that had brought back the trenches so vividly he had gone for nights without sleep and spent most of his days in an exhausted stupor that made him seem as docile and unreachable as the others around him and then his sister frances had had him moved to a private clinic where he had mercifully found peace from those nightmares at any rate and been given a doctor who was interested enough in his case to find a way through his desolate wall of silence or perhaps the doctor had been one of francess loversoddly enough all of them seemed to remain on very good terms with her when the affair ended and were always at her beck and call but he had been too grateful for help to care watching it was easy to see that hickam was used to vehicles coming from every direction and he directed his invisible traffic with efficient skill sorting out the tangle as if he stood at a busy intersection where long convoys were passing he sent a few one way then turned his attention to the left his hand vigorously signaling that they were to turn and turn now while he shouted to someone to get those sodding horses moving or called for men to help dig the wheels of an artillery caisson out of the sodding mud he snapped a smart salute at officers riding pastthere was no mistaking his pantomimethen swiftly turned it into a rude gesture that would have pleased tired men slogging their way back from the bloody front or the frightened men moving forward to take their place in france rutledge had seen dozens of men stationed at junctions in the rain or the hot sun keeping a moribund army moving in spite of itself yelling directions swearing at laggards indicating with practiced movements exactly what they expected the chaos around them to do many had died where they stood in the shelling or strafing and bombing trying desperately to keep the flow of badly needed arms and men from bogging down completely but the carts carriages and handful of cars of upper streetham merely swerved a little to miss hickam used to him and leaving him standing where he was in the middle of the road as if he were something nasty that a passing horse had left behind some of the women on foot hesitated before crossing near him drawing aside their skirts with nervous distaste and turning their faces in fear yet none of the village urchins mocked him and rutledge noticing that asked why for one thing hes been home nearly eleven months now since the hospital let him go for another he took a stick to the ringleader shouting at him in bastard french broke the boys collarbone for him he kept his eyes on hickam as he swung around to face another direction jerking his thumb at a line of convoy traffic locked in a past that no one else could share the lads father told us the boy deserved what he got but there were others who felt hickam ought to be shut up before he harmed anyone else people like hickamwell theyre not normal are they but the vicar wouldnt hear of an asylum he said hickam was an accursed soul in need of prayer god almighty hamish said softly thats you in five yearsonly it wont be traffic will it that you remember itll be the trenches and the men and the blood and the stink and the shells falling hour after hour until the brain splits apart with the din and youll be shouting for us to get over the top or take cover or hold the line while the nurses strap you down to the bed and nobody heeds your frenzied screams when corporal hamish ill see us both dead first rutledge said between clenched teeth i swear and davies startled looked at him in confusion you can see hes half out of his head davies said again uneasily as rutledge sat there rigidly staring at the disheveled figure in the middle of the sunlit busy high street the sergeant wasnt sure hed understood the london man and wondered if perhaps he had misquoted what the captain had said to the colonel ill see you in hell first should he correct rutledge then or pretend he hadnt noticed he wasnt sure how to take this manon the other hand he hadnt seemed to be in haste to arrest captain wilton and that counted for something out of his head no locked into it hickam must have been directing traffic when the shelling started and stayed with it until one came too close thats why hes behaving this way rutledge said half to himself its the last thing he remembers i dont know about that sir i do rutledge said curtly recollecting where he was and with whom yes sir davies answered doubtfully but i can tell you theres no talking to him now he wont hear you hes in his own mad world well have to come back later then well see the meadow where the body was found but first i want to find the doctor dr warren hes just down there past the inn you can see his house from here it was a narrow stonefaced building that had been turned into a small surgery and dr warren was just preparing to leave when rutledge came to his door and introduced himself i want to ask you a few questions if you dont mind i do warren said testily he was elderly stooped and graying but his blue eyes were sharp beneath heavy black brows ive got a very sick child on my hands and a woman in labor itll have to wait except for one of the questions are you prescribing sedatives for miss wood of course i am the girl was beside herself with grief and i was afraid shed make herself ill into the bargain so i left powders with mary satterthwaite to be given three times a day and again at night until shes able to deal with this business herself no visitors and that includes you ive already seen her rutledge answered she seemed ratherabstracted i wanted to know why youd be abstracted yourself on what ive given her she wanted to see the colonels bodyshe thought hed been shot neatly through the heart or some such well his head had been blown off at nearly pointblank range leaving a ragged stump of his neck and i had to tell her that before shed listen to me oh not that bluntly dont be a fool but enough to deter her thats when she fainted and by the time we got her to bed she was just coming out of it so i gave her a powder in some water and she drank it without knowing what it was and now theres a baby thats going to be born while i stand here discussing sedatives with you a first baby and the husbands worthless hell probably faint too at the first sign of blood so get out of my way he went brusquely past rutledge and out toward the inn where he apparently left his car during surgery hours rut ledge watched him go then ran lightly down the steps to his own car where davies was still sitting driving on down the high street rutledge slowed as da vies pointed out the track that began behind the treeshaded churchyard the one that wilton claimed he had taken it climbed up through a neat quilt of plowed fields mostly smallholdings according to the sergeant that ran to the crest of a low ridge and then it made its way down the far side to a narrow stone bridge and the ruins of an old mill a three mile walk in all give or take a little the church sat not on the high street itself but just off it at the end of a small close of magpie houses that faced one another on what davies called court street rutledge thought these might be medieval almshouses for they were of a similar size and design all fourteen of them he turned into the close and stopped at the far end by the lychgate in front of the church leaving the motor running he walked to the rough wall that encircled the graveyard hoping for a better look at the track he wanted a feeling for how it went and whether there might be places from which a plowman or a farm wife feeding chickens might overlook it he needed witnesses people who had seen wilton out for his morning walk and climbing this hill with nothing in his hand except a walking stick orhad not seen him at all which might be equally important the start of the track was empty except for a squabbling pair of ravens the rest of it ran out of sight of the village for most of its length for it followed the line of trees that bordered the cultivated fields and their branches shaded it this time of year he could see a cow tied out to graze and that was all returning to the car he asked can you reach the meadow where the body was found from this track aye you cant see it from here unless you know where to look but theres a smaller track that branches off from this one about two fields away from us if you follow that youll come to the hedgerow that runs along the boundary of the colonels land its there that the smaller track connects with another one running up from smithy laneill show you that because its where i found hickam drunk as a lord think of it as a rough h sir this track by the church and the other by smithy lane forming the legs and climbing to the ridge whilst the bar of the h is the smaller one cutting across yes i follow you once youve reached the hedgerow what then find a break in it and youll be in the fields where the colonel raises corn above them theres a patch of rough land thats put to hay between the hedgerow and a copse of trees on the far side of those trees lies the meadow thats the scene of the murder rutledge reversed back on the high street again he saw hickam weaving an uncertain path along the pavement his head down he was muttering to himself once or twice flinging out an arm in a gesture of disgust he looked half drunk now a man without pride or grace or spirit neither rutledge nor davies made any comment but both could see that there was no need to stop still driving in the direction he had taken to mallows earlier rutledge saw smithy lane some thirty feet ahead just as davies pointed it out to him an unpaved street it ran between the busy blacksmiths shop and a livery stable on the right and the ironmongers on the left beyond these businesses were six or seven rundown houses straggling up the slope of the hill toward the fields beyond where the last house stood the lane became a cart track and soon the cart track narrowed into a country path of ruts and mud puddles rutledge drove gingerly his attention on tires and axles but then the cart track eventually lost its way in a tangle of hawthorns and wild cherry and here they left the car as davies got out he said its here i found hickamhed fallen asleep in the leaves yonder and there he said pointing to the last open ground before the track faded into the path is where he claims he saw the colonel talking to captain wilton did you look for signs of a horseman here or the prints of wiltons boots in the dust inspector forrest came to look the next morning and then said wed best leave this business to scotland yard but were there signs of the two men not that he could see which probably meant that he hadnt wanted to find anything rutledge nodded and they moved on soon afterward passing the point where the rather overgrown track from the east met this one and thats the bar of the h sir like i said skirting a field of marrows they came at length to the hedgerows sergeant davies quickly found his way through them into the fields of young wheat beyond were on mallows land now he said the edges of the fields where they walked were still heavy with wet earth clinging to their boots in great clots the hayfield higher up was a wall of tall wet stalks rimmed with weeds burrs stuck to their trousers and wild roses caught at their coats davies swore once with fervent imagination as he was stung by nettles and then they were in the copse where walking was easier almost silent on a cushion of damp leaves they came out of the stand of trees into a small sunny meadow where the sound of bees filled the air the rain had washed away any signs of blood but the grass was still bruised and trampled from the many feet that had milled around the body he lay just about there chest down toward the wood one arm under him and the other outflung his legs were straight slightly bent at the knees but thats all id say he fell from the horse and never moved not even a twitch so his attacker must have come out of the trees just as we did say just here davies explained moving a few feet away from where the body had been found not more than ten feet anyway from where the body fell depending on whether the shot knocked him out of the saddle or he fell out of it if he was knocked out of it why was he on his face chest if he was shot from the front the force of the blast would have driven him out of the saddle backward even if the horse had bolted in terror his feet would slip out of the stirrups and hed have come off backward on his back sergeant or his side but not facedown davies chewed his lip i thought about that myself that harris must have been shot from the back to fall forward on his chest but that doesnt fit with the horsei saw it there was blood all over the saddle and its haunches but not on its ears or mane youd have thought if harriss head had exploded from behind not the front that the horses mane would have been matted with blood and brains then someone turned him over the search party they swear they never touched the corpse and there was no question but that he was deadthey didnt need to move him the killer then davies shook his head why would he do that hed be wanting to get as far away as he could in case someone heard the shot and came to see what it was rutledge looked around weve come two miles or thereabouts how far is the other track from this wood two miles a little more than that shorter if you dont mind rougher going than we just had so wilton could have reached the meadow either way from the lane where we came up if hickam is right or from the churchyard path if wilton walked that way as he claims he did aye but it isnt likely is it somehow i just dont see the captain waiting in the trees to shoot the colonel from ambush besides when hickam saw him he wasnt carrying a shotgun was he so where did he get the gun and where is it now a good question that youve scoured the area looking for it aye as soon as possible we had men in the trees there and in the tall grass but by that time who knows what might have become of the weapon the killers hidden it somewhere most likely looking about him rutledge thought it isnt where hes hidden it thats half as important as where he got it davies pointed and said look if you go down this hill over the fields yonder and across the stile when you come to another line of hedgerows you soon find yourself in the orchard behind mallows and that takes you to the gardens and the house itself of course you cant see it from here but the goings fairly straight if you know your way the lands a pie wedge like mallows is out on the warwick road and weve come up from the high street the crust so to speak runs from upper streetham to warwick up here now were at the point of the wedge having come up one side if we followed the other side that would be the hal dane property over there he turned to point generally in that direction then faced the way they had just come behind the church are the smallholdings you saw from the churchyard beyond them is crichton land this meadow then is farther from mallows the house i meanand the village than any other part of the harris property which means the killer chose this place because he felt sure the shot might not be heard there arent any other houses in this area no rutledge walked around the meadow for a while longer not knowing what he expected to find and finding nothing finally satisfied he called to davies and they started back toward the car but he changed his mind when he reached the field of marrows and said well walk along the trackthe crossbar of the has far as that other path coming up from the churchyard i want to see for myself how these two connect the track meandered but bore mainly eastward through plowed fields crops already standing greenly after the rain it joined the churchyard path in the middle of a stretch of fallow land more or less out in the open they were standing there while davies described how they could continue over the ridge to the mill ruins when they saw a woman in the distance her skirts blowing in the wind as she crested the ridge her stride long and competent and graceful sergeant davies shaded his eyes thats miss som mersmiss helena sommers she and her cousin live in a little cottage that belongs to the haldanes they let it for the summer now and again when theres no other tenant shes the woman who encountered wilton on his walk aye shes the one rutledge moved in her direction then well see if we can talk to her now davies hailed her in a baritone that carried clearly and she turned acknowledging the shout with a wave miss sommers was in her late twenties or early thirties her face strong and her eyes a clear and untroubled gray she stood waiting for them calling good morning this is inspector rutledge from london davies said more than a little shortwinded after the fast pace rutledge had set hes wanting to ask you some questions if you dont mind of course how can i help you she turned toward rutledge shielding her eyes from the sun as she looked up at him did you see or hear anything unusual on monday morning when colonel harris was shot i understand you were out walking yes i was but this part of the country is rather hilly and the echoes do funny things with sound i didnt hear a gunshot but once over the crest of the hill there i wouldnt be likely to if it came from this side she smiled indicating the fine pair of field glasses around her neck i enjoy watching birds and when i first came here i was forever getting confused id hear a song and swear my quarry was in that tree only to discover he was nothing of the sort he was in a bush over there and the next time it would be just the opposite the smile faded they say colonel harris was shot in a meadowthe small one beyond a copse of trees is that true yes she nodded i know where it is then i followed a pair of nesting robins there one afternoon i wouldnt have been very likely to hear any sounds from there im afraid did you see anyone captain wilton she answered with some reluctance i didnt speak to him but i did see him and he waved at what time was this she shrugged i dont know early i think around eight i imagine or a little after i was engrossed in tracking a cuckoo and was mainly glad that wilton wasnt the sort whod want to stop and chatter which way was he going the same way you are toward the old mill then yes i suppose so i wasnt really paying much attention he was just walking along here i saw him realized who it was waved and then went on my way did you know the colonel well hardly at all weve been here since april and he very kindly asked us to dinner one evening but my cousin is shy almost a recluse and she didnt want to go i did enjoyed the evening and that was that we spoke to each other on the high street and i waved if i saw him out riding but thats about all i can tell you and you know the captain well enough to be certain you did see him and not someone else she smiled the gray eyes lighting within a woman doesnt forget mark wilton once shes seen him hes very handsome how would you describe the colonel she considered his question as if she hadnt given much thought to the colonel before now he was younger than i expected and rather attractive in a quiet way widely read for a military manwe had a very interesting discussion over dinner about american poets and he seemed to know whitman quite well she brushed a strand of windblown hair out of her face he seemed a likable man on short acquaintance a very gracious host i cant tell you much more because i talked mostly to lettice wood after dinner and then to mrs davenant and shortly after that the party broke up how would you describe relations between wilton and colonel harris relations i hardly know she thought back to that evening for a moment then said they seemed comfortable with each other like men who have known each other over a long period of time thats all i can remember thank you miss sommers if you should think of anything else that might help us please get in touch with sergeant davies or me yes of course she hesitated then asked ive gone on with my walks i suppose thats all right my cousin frets and begs me to stay home but i hate being cooped up theres nowell dangeris there from the colonels killer she nodded i doubt that you have anything to fear miss sommers all the same you might exercise reasonable caution we still dont know why the colonel was killed or by whom well i wish you luck in finding him she said and went striding off a pleasant lady davies said watching her go her cousin now shes as timid as a mouse never shows her face in the village but keeps the cottage as clean as a pin mrs haldane was saying that she thought the poor girl was a halfwit at first but went over to the cottage one day to ask how they were settling in and saw that shes just shy as miss sommers said and on the plain side rutledge was not interested in the shy miss sommers he was tired and hungry and hamish had been mumbling under his breath for the last half hour a certain sign of tumult in his own mind it was time to turn back what bothered him most he thought striding along in silence was the colonel himself hed actually seen the man heard him inspire troops who had no spirit and no strength left to fight a tall persuasive figure in an officers greatcoat his voice pitched to carry in the darkness before dawn his own physical force somehow filling the cold frightened emptiness in the faces before him convincing them that they had one more charge left in them that together they could carry the assault and take the gun emplacement and save a thousand lives the next morningtwo thousandwhen the main thrust came and the remnants of a battered force did as he had asked only to see the main attack fail and the hill abandoned to the hun again within twentyfour hours yet here in upper streetham charles harris seemed to be no more than a faint shadow of that officer a quiet and thoroughly nice man as mrs davenant had put it surely not a man who was likely to be murdered how do you put your fingers on the pulse of a dead man and bring him to life rutledge had been able to do that at one time had in the first several cases of his career shown an uncanny knack for seeing the victim from the viewpoint of the murderer and understanding why he or she had had to die because the solution to a murder was sometimes just thatfinding out why the victim had to die but here in warwickshire the colonel seemed to elude him except to acknowledge the fact that once more he would be dealing with death he rutledge had never really thought through the problems of resuming his career at the yard at least not while he was still at the clinic locked in despair and his own fears to be honest about it hed seen his return mainly as the answer to his desperate need to stay busy to shut out hamish to shut out jean to shut out indeed the shambles of his life even back in london he had never really considered whether or not he was good enough still at his work to return to it he hadnt considered whether the skills and the intuitive grasp of often frail threads of information which had been his greatest asset had been damaged along with the balance of his mind by the horrors of the war whether he could be a good policeman again hed simply expected his ability to come back without effort like remembering how to ride or how to swim rusty skills that needed only a new honing now suddenly he was worried about that one more worry one more point of stress and it was stress that gave hamish access to his conscious mind the doctors had told him that he sighed and sergeant davies clumping along through the grass beside him said aye its been a long morning and weve gotten nowhere havent we rutledge asked forcing his attention back to the business in hand miss sommers said she did see wilton walking this track but where was he coming from the churchyard as he claims or had he walked by way of the lane as hickam claims met the colonel and then crossed over this way ordid he go after harris follow him to the meadow with murder on his mind but this way leads to the ruins by the old bridge just as he told us and miss sommers saw him here around eight she thought so were no nearer to the truth than we were before yes all right but since miss sommers saw him here hed be bound to tell us that he was heading for the mill wouldnt he no matter where hed actually beenor was actually going do you think hes guilty then sergeant davies couldnt keep the disappointment out of his voice there isnt enough information at this point to make any decision at all but its possible yes they had reached the car again and rutledge opened his door then stopped to pick the worst of the burrs from his trousers davies was standing by the bonnet fanning himself with his hat his face red from the exertion still following a train of thought rutledge said if miss sommers is right and wilton was up there in the high grass early on say eight oclock he might well have been a good distance from the meadow by the time the colonel was shot assuming as we must that the horse came straight home and the colonel died somewhere between ninethirty and ten oclock when royston went down to the stables looking for him aye he would have reached the ruins and the bridge in that time its true so youre saying then that it still hangs on hickams word that captain wilton was in the lane and when that was it appears that way without hickam theres no evidence where the captain had come from before he ran into miss sommers no evidence of a further quarrel and no real reason except for what johnston and mary overheard in the hall at mallows for us to believe that the captain had any cause to shoot harris sergeant davies brightened and no jury in this county is going to take a daniel hickams word over that of a man holding the victoria cross youre forgetting something sergeant rutledge said climbing into the car whats that sir davies asked anxiously coming around and peering into the car from the passenger side so that he could see rutledges face if wilton didnt shoot harris then who did and who turned the corpse over after lunch at the shepherds crook rutledge took out the small leather notebook made a number of entries and then considered what he should do next he had sent davies home to his wife for lunch while he lingered over his own coffee in the dining room enjoying the brief solitude what was harris like that seemed to be the key what lay buried somewhere in the mans life that was to bring him to a bloody death in a sunlit meadow or to turn it another way why did he have to die that morning why not last weeklast yearten years from now something had triggered the chain of events that ended in that meadow something saidor left unsaid something doneor left undone something felt something glimpsed something misunderstood something that had festered into an angry explosion of gunpowder and shot royston wilton mrs davenant lettice wood four different people with four vastly different relationships to the dead man royston an employee wilton a friend mrs dav enant a neighbor and lettice wood his ward surely he must have shown a different personality to each of them it was human nature to color your moods and your conversations and your temperament to suit your company surely one of the four must have seen a side to his character that would lead the police to an answer it was hard to believe that charles harris had no sins heavy on his conscience no faces haunting his dreams no shadows on his soul there was no such thing as a perfect english gentleman hamish had started humming a tune and rutledge tried to ignore it but it was familiar and in the way of songs that run unbidden through the mind it dragged his attention away from his own speculations and then suddenly he realized what it wasa halfforgotten victorian ballad called the proper english gentleman written by a less well known contemporary of kiplingsless popular perhaps because his sentiments were bitter and lacked kiplings fine sense of what the reading public would put up with and what it would turn from but the ballad had been popular enough in the trenches during the war hes a proper english gentleman who never spills his beer he dines with all the ladies and never shows his fear of picking up the wrongfork or swearing at the soup when its hot enough to burn him or jumping through the hoop of english society and all it represents but hes a damned good soldier in front of all the troops and marches like a gentleman in his fine leather boots and eats in the reg lar mess and calls the men by name and shares the dirty work with em whats called the killing game of english imperialism and all it represents but by his own hearthside hes a very different sort and he beats his tenants quarterly and no one dares retort he takes their wives and daughters and never stops to think that a man might someday shoot him when hes had enough to drink of english duplicity and all it represents hes the finest of examples and theres others of his kind who keep their secrets closely and never seem to mind that the man who sits at table and has their deepest trust might carry in his bosom the foulest kind of lust not english respectability and all it represents so watch your step my laddies keep your distance ladies dear watch out for english gentlemen and dont ever let them near their faces wont betray them their deeds are fine and true but put them near temptation and it really will not dofor certain english gentlemen and all they represent what was the secret behind charles harriss very proper face what had he done this apparently thoroughly nice man that had made someone want to obliterate him and to choose a shotgun at pointblank range to do it barton redfern was just removing the coffee things and turning to limp back to the kitchen when dr warren came through the diningroom door and seeing rutledge at the table by the window crossed hurriedly to him youd better come he said theyre about to lynch that stupid devil mavers mavers sprawled in the dust by the worn shaft of the villages market cross was bloody and defiant spitting curses as a dozen men tried to kick and drag him toward the broad oak tree that stood outside a row of shops there was murder in the angry faces encircling him and someone had found a length of rope although rutledge wasnt sure whether the initial intent was to hang mavers or tie him to the tree for a sound thrashing one man was carrying a horsewhip and when in the confusion a heavy blow intended for mavers caught him on the shin instead he wheeled and lashed out in retaliation the whip flicked across several heads and for an instant it looked as if a general battle might ensue while mavers called them all every unprintable name he could think of it was noisy dangerous chaos on the verge of turning even nastier as other men came running toward the scene shouting encouragement women had hurried into the safety of the nearest shops their pale faces peering out of windows in horror while the shopkeepers stood in their doorways demanding that this nonsense stop children clinging to their mothers skirts were crying and four or five dogs attracted by the din had begun to bark excitedly as hamish growled over the odds in some far corner of his mind rutledge reached the melee and began forcing his way through with rough disregard for victim or victimizer he used his voice with coldly calculated effect the officer commanding discipline authority in the flesh a man to be reckoned with thats enough let him go or ill have the lot of you up before the magistrate for assault touch me with that whip you fool and youll be flat on your back with your arm broken his unexpected onslaught scattered the attackers for an instant and rutledge quickly had mavers by his collar yanking him to his feet with blistering impatience now whats this all about dr warren had followed rutledge as fast as he could and reaching the market cross began catching men by the arm and calling them by name matt dont be stupid put that whip down tom george look at the lot of you your wife will take a flatiron to you for ripping that coat will wait and see if she doesnt mavers wiping his bloody nose on the sleeve of his shirt said to rutledge i dont need the likes of you to fight my battles for me a policeman stinks of his masters and i can smell oppression londons bourgeois fist in the backs of the people rutledge gave a jerk of his collar that silenced mavers with a choking grunt warren had stopped tonguelashing the disgruntled villagers still milling around the market cross and was already casting a professional eye over cuts and bruises and one swelling lip then the affair was over as quickly as it had begun and warren said take mavers to my surgery ill be there in five minutes rutledges eyes swept the circle of faces grimness changing slowly to sullen mortification on most of them and decided that there would be no more trouble here with one hand still gripping the rumpled collar he marched mavers down the street and across to the doctors surgery ignoring the mans protests and the stares of latecomers warrens housekeeper prim and neat in starched black was waiting in the doorway she looked at maverss condition with disgust and said dont you dare drip blood on my clean floor before going off to fetch cold water and a handful of cloths what the hell were you trying to do out there take on half the village rutledge asked standing in the entrance hall waiting for the housekeeper to come back one eye on the street i told the fools what they didnt want to hear i told them the truth his voice was thick and muffled from the swelling nose like a man with a head cold which was that they were too blind to see their chance and take it that their precious war hero had feet of clay that the colonel was nothing but an oppressor of the workingman and deserved what he got warming to his theme he went on its the fate of all landlords to be taken out and shot and their lands given to the peasants and here somebody has already gone and done the peasants bloody work for them im sure matt wilmore liked being called a peasant dr warren said coming through the door behind rutledge just when hes bought his own farm and is proud as punch of it his housekeeper arrived with a basin of water and wads of lint to use packing maverss nose but it wasnt broken only thoroughly bloodied that was tom dillinghams fist ill wager warren said with some satisfaction as he cleaned up maverss truculent face hes something of a legend around here he added to rutledge made enough money as a pugilist to buy a bit of land down by the ware hes not likely to take to being called a peasant either even those who are tenantshaldanes or mrs crichtonsarent going to swallow it peasants went out with wat tyler in or whenever the hell it was rutledge smiled mavers said can i go now warren washed his hands yes be off with you ive got more important things to do ungrateful fool rutledge led him outside and said dont be in any hurry mavers i want to talk to you about the colonels death he grinned the bloodshot eyes as yellow as a goats mavers was not a big man and had the wizened look of poor food and bad health in early childhood his face pointed and sallow his hair thin and a dusty brown but his eyes were vivid their color giving his face its only character you cant accuse me of touching him i was here in upper streetham that morning lecturing all those busy market goers on the evils of capitalism ask anybody theyll tell you as much but there was a gloating in the way he said it that made rutledge wonder what he was hiding mavers was very pleased with himself and not above taunting the police a born troublemaker just as everyone had said still such a man could put that sort of reputation to good use hiding behind it quite easily people might shake their heads in disgust but their perception of mavers gave him the freedom to make a nuisance of himself without fear of retribution what do you expect thats mavers for you or whats the damned fool going to get up to next people ignored him expecting the worst and getting it half the time not seeing him seeing only their own image of him what do you do for a living caught off guard mavers shot rutledge a glance out of the corner of those goats eyes what do you mean how do you find the money to live mavers grinned again oh i manage well enough on my pension pension sergeant davies came running toward them a smear of mustard like a yellow mustache across his upper lip ive taken care of that lot he said damned fools what have you been about this time mavers the inspector yonder should have let them hang you and be done with it maverss grin broadened and youd get fat wouldnt you without me to keep you from your dinner the trouble is davies went on paying no heed to mav ers theyve all been in the war or had family that was and the colonel was looked up to he tried to tell them the colonel had squandered the poor sod in the trenches while keeping his own hide safe but they know better the colonel kept up with every man from the village and visited them in hospital and saw to the families of the ones that didnt come back and found work for the cripples people remember that moneys cheap hamish put in suddenly or was he thinking of standing for parliament our fine colonel but no one heard him except rutledge it was decided to take mavers home to give the villagers time to cool off without further provocation and rutledge went back to the shepherds crook for his car he had just reached the walk in front of the door when someone called inspector he turned to see a young woman astride a bicycle her cheeks flushed from riding and her dark hair pinned up inside a very becoming gray hat with curling pheasants feathers that swept down to touch her cheek im rutledge yes she dismounted from the bicycle and propped it up against the railing by the horse trough im catherine tarrant and id like to talk to you if you have the time the name meant nothing to him at first and then he re memberedshe was the woman captain wilton had courted before the war he led her inside the inn and found a quiet corner of the oldfashioned parlor where they wouldnt be interrupted waiting until she seated herself in one of the faded chintzcovered chairs he took the other across from her and then said what can i do for you miss tarrant behind him a tall clock ticked loudly the pendulum catching sunlight from the windows at each end of its swing she had had the kind of face that men often fall in love with in their youth fresh and sweet and softly feminine rut ledge was suddenly reminded of girls in white gowns with blue sashes around trim waists broadbrimmed hats pinned to highpiled curls who had played tennis and strolled on cropped green lawns and laughed lightheartedly in the summer of then disappeared forever catherine tarrant had changed with them there was a firmness to her jaw and her mouth now signs of suffering and emerging character that in the end would make her more attractive if less pretty her dark eyes were level with intelligence clearly visible in their swift appraisal of him i have nothing to tell you that will help your enquiries she said at once i dont know anything about colonel harriss death except what ive heard but my housekeeper is mary satterthwaites sister and mary has told her about the quarrel between the colonel and captain wilton i know she added quickly mary shouldnt have but she did and vivian told me i just want to say to you that ive known markcaptain wiltonfor some years and i cant imagine him killing anyone least of all lettice woods guardian lettice adored charles he was her knight in shining armor a father and brother all in one and mark adores lettice hed never let himself be provoked into doing anything so foolish you think then that the quarrel was serious enough to make us believe that the captain is under suspicion that shook her quiet intensity she had come in defense of wilton and found herself apparently on the brink of damning him then she collected her wits and with a lift of her chin she said im not a policeman inspector i dont know what is important in a murder enquiry and what isnt but i should think that a quarrel between two men the night before one of them is killed will be given your thorough consideration and you dont know those two as well as i dodid then perhaps you should tell me about them tell you what that neither of them had a vile temper that neither of them would hurt lettice that neither of them was the sort of man to resort to murder yet they quarreled and one of them is dead then weve come full circle again havent we and im trying to make you understand that however angry charles might have made him at the moment mark wouldnt have harmed himleast of all killed him so savagely how do you know what might drive a man to murder he asked she studied him for a moment with those dark clear eyes and said how do you have you ever killed a man deliberately and intentionally not counting the war i mean rutledge smiled grimly point taken after a moment he added if we scratch wilton from our list of suspects have you got a name to put in his place mavers she said instantly i wouldnt trust him as far as i could see him but he was in the village on monday morning in plain view of half a hundred people she shrugged thats your problem not mine you asked me who might have shot charles not how he did it it appears that wilton was seen by several witnesses in the vicinity of the meadow where harris died i dont care where he was seen i tell you he wouldnt have touched charles harris hes madly in love with let tice cant i make you understand that why would he risk losing her are you still in love with him color rose in her face a mottled red under the soft fair skin the earnestness changed to a clipped tension i was infatuated with mark wilton five years ago he came to upper streetham one summer and i fell in love with him the first time i saw himany girl with eyes in her head must have done the same mrs davenants husband had just died and mark stayed with her for a while until the estate was settled and so on i envied her you know having marks company every day from breakfast to dinner shes only a few years older than he is and i was sure hed fall in love with her and never notice me then we met one sunday after the morning service he called on me later and for a time i thought he was as in love with me as i was with him she stopped suddenly as if afraid shed said too much then went on in spite of herself we made quite a handsome pair everyone said so hes so fair and im so dark and i think that was part of my infatuation too the trouble was mark wanted to fly not to find himself tied down with a wife and family and at that point in my life i wanted a rose covered cottage a fairytale ending for a moment there was a flare of pain in her dark eyes a passing thought that seemed to have no connection with wilton but was directed at herselfor at her dreams at any rate i had several letters from mark after he went away and i answered a few of them and then we simply didnt have anything more to say to each other it was over and it wouldnt have done for either of us does that answer your question not altogether her color was still high but he thought that it was from anger as much as anything else and that intrigued him he found himself wondering if mark wilton had been having an affair with his widowed cousinand using catherine tarrant as a blind to mislead a village full of gossips if shed guessed that her pride might have suffered more than her heart and she might defend him now to protect herself not him are you still in love with him he asked again no she said after a moment but im still fond enough of him to care what happens to him ive got my painting ive made quite a success of that and any man in my life now would take second place he could hear a bleak undercurrent of bitterness behind the proud declaration even the fairytale prince she managed a smile even a prince she had stripped off her soft leather gloves when she came into the inn and now she began to draw them on again i have the feeling ive only made matters worse have i for captain wilton not really so far you havent told me anything that would point in his directionor away from it nothing has changed as far as i can see frowning she said you must believe this if nothing else mark wouldnt have harmed charles harris of all people not even if lettice now inherits mallows startled she laughed mark inherited his own money years ago quite a lot of it thats what made it possible for him to learn to fly to buy his own aeroplane he doesnt need hers as she rose and said goodbye he considered for a moment whether she had come for captain wiltons sakeor for some private motive and what that motive might be not her own guilt as far as he could see if she still loved wilton killing charles harris was not the way to bring the captain back to her and jealousy would have been better served by shooting wilton himself or lettice then why was it that the bitterness and pain hed read in catherine tarrants voice seemed far more personal than the altruistic act of coming to a friends defense women hamish said unexpectedly they always ken the cruelest way to torment a man for whats hes done witting or no rutledge thought of jean and that day in the hospital when she had abandoned him to his nightmares shed intended to be kindthats what had hurt him most outside picking up her bicycle and leading it away from the railing catherine tarrant paused biting her lower lip busy with her own thoughts mrs crichtons estate agent came out of the inn and spoke to her as he passed but she didnt hear him oh damn she accused herself silently youve muddled everything you should have had the sense to leave well enough alone to stay out of it now hell start to pry and probe if inspector forrest had been handling the enquiry he would have listened to her hed known her family for ages he would have believed her without bringing up what happened in the war why on earth had they sent for someone from london instead of leaving this business to the local people but she knew the reason the finger of suspicion must be strongly pointing toward mark already and everyone in warwickshire was running for cover there had been a dozen photographs of the king and mark together hed dined with the prince of wales was invited to scotland to shoot had even accompanied the queen to a home for soldiers disabled by mustard gasand questions were going to be asked when he was arrested for a bloody murder involving another war hero buckingham palace would be icily furious then where was their case not just that stupid quarrel surely you wouldnt arrest a man simply because he had a roaring argument with the victim the night before there had to be more damning evidence against him than that and who were these people who claimed to have seen mark near the place where charles harris had died what else had they seen if someone had the wit to ask them the right questions for a moment she debated going straight to the davenant house and asking mark himself who the witnesses were but sally davenant would be there smiling and pretending not to notice how badly catherine wanted to speak to mark alone making the unexpected visit seem more like a ploy an emotional excuse to come back into his life and that would be hard to explain away she hadnt told rutledge the whole truth about mrs dav enant either but she didnt care about anyone else if mark could be protected she still wasnt certain why she was so determined to help him in the wild tangle of her emotions he was the man who had opened her eyes to passion and prepared her for what had come later and for that alone perhaps she owed him something there must be a better way of getting to the bottom of this shed find inspector forrest and make him tell her everything she wanted to know he wouldnt be like the londoner stark and unfeeling a man to watch that one steadying the bicycle she began to pedal absorbed in the question of how best to handle forrest catherine met him just coming home from lower streetham and looking tired he was middleaged thin and stooped more the university don than a village policeman he smiled when she hailed him and waited by the steps of his house miss tarrant thats a fetching hat youve got on my dear dont let my wife catch a glimpse of it or shell be pestering me for one just like it which was kind of him because his wife like many of the women in upper streetham cared nothing for catherine tarrant with or without a fetching hat on her head and it gave her the excuse she needed to say then will you walk along with me a little way id like to speak to you ive missed my lunch and ive got a headache you could toss the churchyard through will it take long this talking no not really she gave him her most winning smile and he said all right then ten minutes she had dismounted and he took the bicycle from her leading it himself as she strode down the quiet street beside him whats this all about then and catherine tarrant began to work her wiles mavers and sergeant davies were glaring at each other by the time that rutledge finally drove up in front of the doctors surgery they climbed into the car in silence and rutledge said how do i find your house mavers like the birds in the air youll have to fly to it or walk i live up behind the churchyard theres a path to the house that way did you buy this car from the wages of wringing the necks of felons or have you got private means does it matter either way im still an oppressor of the poor mavers grinned nastily his goats eyes alight with the zeal of his favorite subject horses earn their keep what does this bleeding motorcar do for mankind it keeps workmen employed putting it together and others earn their livings in the factories that supply the materials to those workmen have you considered that every person driving a motorcar is a benefactor he turned into the short street leading to the church and those workmen could be better employed building homes for the poor and growing food for the hungry and making clothes for the naked which of course you spend every free moment of your time doing a shining example to us all mavers growled youll have to leave the motor here by the lychgate and get your boots dirty on the path like the rest of us poor devils which they did marching behind mavers up the bare track that rutledge had seen just that morning it had begun to dry out in the sun although a thin coating of mud clung halfheartedly to their shoes but soon they turned off on a small rutted path that went over another rise and across an unplowed field to a shabby cottage standing in a clump of straggling beech trees the yard before it was bare of grass and a dozen equally shabby chickens scratched absently there paying no heed to their owner or his visitors when the three men arrived at the cottage door from somewhere around back a pig grunted and mavers said hes not mine he belongs to one of the farmers over on the crichton estate too illtempered an old boar to keep within sight of a sow but he still breeds fine and im not home long enough to notice the smell which was a good thing all in all as the breeze shifted the essence of pig was nearly breathtaking he went inside and rutledge followed the cottage surprisinglywas not dirty though it was as shabby inside as the exterior and the chickens there were four rooms opening off a short central hall the doors to each standing open in the first of them on the left side the only windows were overhung by beech boughs cutting off the sunlight and rutledge blinked in the sudden dimness as he crossed the threshold papers were scattered everywhere most of them poorly printed political tracts and handwritten tirades covering floor and furnishings impartially like grimy snow mav ers walked through and over them regardless and flung himself down in a chair by a small mahogany table at the corner of the hearth there was a lamp on it its smokeblackened chimney surrounded by stacks of books an inkstand of brass and a muchused blotter welcome to mavers manor he said adding with heavy sarcasm are you planning to stay to dinner we dont dress here youll do as you are he didnt ask them to sit who killed colonel harris rutledge asked do you know why should i know i mean somebody knows something it might be you if i knew anything id more likely shake the fools hand than turn him in to you which rutledge believed why did you feud with the colonel all those years suddenly maverss face turned a mottled red which gave the darkening bruises a garish air and he snarled because he was an arrogant bastard who thought he was god and never cared what he did to other people send that great lump davies out into the yard with the rest of the dumb animals and ill tell you all about your fine colonel harris rutledge glanced over his shoulder and nodded at davies who clumped out and slammed the door behind him as near as he could ever come to insubordination mavers waited until he could see davies fuming in the yard well out of hearing and then said he thought he was lord and master around here harris did mrs crichton never comes to upper streetham shes so old she hardly knows her arse from her elbow and the haldaneswell the hal danes were so well bred theyve nearly vanished a bloodless lot you cant even be bothered to hate but the colonel now he was something else there was pentup venom in the thick voice and mavers was having trouble breathing through his nose as his anger mounted almost panting between words he came into his own early after his father had a stroke and wound up being confined to a chair for the rest of his lifewhich wasnt all that longand in his eyes his precious son could do no wrong harris had the first motorcar in this part of warwickshire did you know that drove like a madman terrified old ladies and horses and half the children then he got his commission in the familys regiment and he came home swaggering in his fine uniform telling every man he met that the army life was for them had any girl he wanted paid his way out of trouble and raised hell whenever he felt like it my older brother joined the army to please him and he died in south africa with a boer musket ball in his brain he stopped but rutledge said nothing and after a time mavers went on more quietly my mother never got over thathe was her favorite a big strapping lad like her own father and my sister drowned herself in the pond one day because harris stopped fancying her i went to mallows to horsewhip him and got thrashed by the grooms instead ma called me a worthless whelp for daring to blame harris for annies weakness so i ran off to join the army myself and somehow he found out about it and he had me sent home for lying about my age but he wouldnt give me my job back in the stables at mallowshe told that bootlicking fool royston that they didnt want me there anymore because i was a troublemaker so thats just what i became trouble a thorn in his flesh and if you believe that one fine morning id shoot him down depriving myself of that lifelong pleasure youre a greater fool than you look rutledge heard two things in maverss diatribethe ring of truth and the echo of envy youre talking about a boy twenty perhaps not much older than that and you were what fourteen fifteen he said carefully the red flush returned to maverss face what does age have to do with it is there some special dispensation for cruelty if youre rich and under twenty you know there isnt but a man generally isnt judged by what he did as a boy hes judged by what he did as a man mavers shrugged boy or man hes the same besides the damage is done isnt it and the man at forty may be a saint but the rest of us are still bleeding from what he did when he was twenty whos to put that right whos to bring annie back or jeff or ma tell me rutledge looked around the room at the worn plain furniture and the threadbare carpet on the floor half hidden by the papers at the dampstained walls and the windows streaked with dust all of it dappled by the tree leaves outside as a passing wind stirred them and let in a little light hed met men like mavers before hungry for something they didnt have and ignorant of how to go about getting it hating those who had had life given to them easily lost men angry men dangerous men because they had no pride of their own to bolster their selfesteem hating doesnt put it right either does it the goats eyes were hard it does give life a purpose all the same preparing to go rutledge said as long as it doesnt lead to murder theres never an excuse for murder he was nearly out the door into the hall when hamish said under his breath but whos a murderer then the man who carried that shotgun yonder or the officer who shoots his own men startled rutledge half turned as if mavers had spoken not the voice in his own head and as he looked back he saw what had been concealed behind maverss chair and by mav erss body and by the books piled on the tablea shotgun leaning against the wall where it met the jutting corner of the hearth almost lost in the deep shadow there satisfied after her conversation with inspector forrest catherine tarrant rode slowly back down the high street threading her way through the lateafternoon shoppers and the workmen going about their business her eyes quickly scanned their faces but no one spoke to her and she didnt stop to ask the whereabouts of the one person she sought turning her head to glance down smithy lane she almost ran down a small boy dragging his dog behind him on a rope the dog was too interested in the smells along their route to pay much heed to its master and looked up with a wide sloppy grin when she braked hastily to avoid them george miller youve got that rope too tight she said but the boy gave her a frightened glance and tugged all the harder the dog followed him goodnaturedly and she sighed in exasperation then she saw daniel hickam come out of one of the rundown houses beyond the smithy upper streetham turned a blind eye to the profession of the two women who occupied this particular house as long as they comported themselves with reasonable dignity elsewhere it was whispered that they made a very good living at their trade because they could be depended on to pass their best customers on the high street the next day without a flicker of recognition catherine had once tried to hire the older of the two who had hair black as coal and eyes the color of the sea to pose for a portrait she was painting of an aging courtesan but the woman had turned her away in a fury i dont care what youre painting i have my pride miss tarrant and id rather starve than take money from the likes of you the words had hurt catherine had gone to london for her model but within three weeks had abandoned the portrait because her vision of it had somehow gone astray the face on the canvas had become a mockery color and lines without a soul technical skill without depth of expression pretending to inspect her tire to give hickam a head start catherine waited until he was beyond the last house finally disappearing among the shadows cast by the first of the hawthorns at the end of the stand of long grass then she began to pedal slowly after him taking her time so that no one would suspect what she was about to do whose weapon is that rutledge asked his eyes on mav erss face now yours what weapon the one just behind you rutledge snapped in no mood for the mans agile tongue why the hell hadnt forrest found this shotgun if mavers was a suspect then he could have obtained a warrant if necessary what if it is mavers asked belligerently ive a right to it if it was left in a will in whose will mr davenants will thats whose rutledge walked across the room and carefully broke open the gun it had been fired recently but when three days ago a week like the rest of the cottage it was worn neglected the stock scratched and the barrel showing the first signs of rust but the breech had been kept well oiled as if mavers was not above a bit of quiet poaching why did he leave the gun to you there was a brief silence then mavers said with less than his usual abrasiveness i expect it was my father he meant my father was once his gamekeeper and mr davenants will said i leave the old shotgun to bert mavers who is a better birdman than any of us my father was dead by then but the will hadnt been changed and mrs davenant gave the gun to me because she said it was what her husband wanted the lawyer from london wasnt half pleased i can tell you but the will didnt say which bert mavers did it alive or dead when was the last time it was fired how should i know or care the doors always open anybody can walk in here theres naught to steal is there unless youre after my chickens or need a shotgun in a bit of a hurry his normal nastiness resurfaced you cant claim i used it can you ive got witnesses so everyone keeps telling me but ill take the gun for now if you dont mind first ill have a piece of paper saying youll bring it back rutledge took a sheet from his notebook and scribbled a sentence on it then signed it under the mans baleful eye mavers watched him leave and then folded the single sheet carefully and put it in a small metal box on the mantel inspector forrest was waiting for them in the magpie cottage beyond the greengrocers shop that served as the upper streetham police station there was a small anteroom a pair of offices and another room at the back used as a holding cell seldom occupied by more serious felons than drunks and disturbers of the peace an occasional wife beater or petty thief this cell still had a heavy almost medieval lock on its door with the big iron key hanging nearby on a nail the furnishings were old the paint showing wear the color of the carpet on the floors almost nondescript now but the rooms were spotless leaning across a battered desk to shake hands forrest introduced himself to rutledge and said im sorry about this morning three dead in lower streetham another in critical condition two more seriously injured and half the village in an uproar i didnt like to leave until things had settled a bit i hope sergeant davies has told you everything you wanted to know he saw the shotgun in rutledges left hand and said hello what have we here bert mavers says this was left to him in a willor rather left to his father good lord so it was id forgotten about that and mrs davenant didnt mention it either when i went to see her about her husbands italian guns its been years his face was a picture of shock and chagrin we probably cant prove its the murder weapon but im ready to wager it was reaching for the shotgun forrest said with sudden enthusiasm used by mavers do you think if so why didnt he have the wit to put it out of sight afterward you never know with mavers nothing he does makes much sense forrest examined it carefully as if half expecting it to confess yes its been fired you can see that but theres no saying when is there still everyone claims he was in the village all morning is that true unfortunately it appears to be forrest fished in the center drawer of his desk and said heres a list of people ive talked to you can see for yourself rutledge took the neatly written sheet and glanced at the names nearly two dozen of them most were unfamiliar to him but mrs davenants was among them and roystons and catherine tarrants each of these people heard him ranting thats clear enough forrest went on he was plaguing everyone who came within earshot and each one will swear to that although the shopkeepers were too busy to pay much heed to him they remember that he was making the usual nuisance of himself and their customers were commenting on it putting it all together you can see that he arrived in the market square early on and was still there at midmorning he rubbed his pounding temples and gestured to the two barrelbacked oak chairs across from the desk sit down sit down rutledge shook his head i must find daniel hickam inspector forrest said surely you dont intend to take his statement seriously theres bound to be other evidence more worthy of your time than anything hickam can say if we keep looking hard enough he could see that the man from london was far from well and suddenly found himself worrying about that you dont have the patience and the energy to give to a thorough investigation is that it he thought to himself you want an easy answer then back to the comforts of london thats why the yard sent you then to sweep it all under the rug for them and its my fault i wont know that until ive spoken to him will i he cant tell you what day of the week it is half the time much less where he came from before you ran into him or where he might be going next minds a wasteland pity he didnt die when that shell explodedno good to himself or anyone else in his condition you took down his statement rutledge pointed out hamish relishing forrests remark was repeating it softly an echo whispering across a void of fear no good to himself or anyone else in his condition he turned away abruptly to shield his face from forrests sharp gaze and unintentionally left the impression that he was putting the blame squarely where it belonged i dont see what else i could have done sergeant davies reported the conversation and after that i had to pursue the matter forrest answered defensively whether hickam is mad or not but that doesnt mean we have to believe him i cant see how wilton could be guilty of this murder youve met him its just not like the man is it from what i can see it wasnt like the colonel to find himself the victim of a murder either well no not when you get right down to it but he is dead isnt he either his death was accidental or it was intentional and we have to start with murder because no one has come forward to tell us any differently no one has said i was standing there talking to him and the horse jostled my arm and the gun went off and the next thing i knew the poor devil was dead would you believe them if they did forrest sighed no only an idiot carries an unbroken shotgun which brings us back to mavers and his weapon if wilton was on either of those tracks on the morning of the murder he could have taken the gun from maverss house fired it then put it back before mavers came home from the village hickams evidence is still important and if captain wilton could do that so could anyone else in upper streetham for all we know forrest retorted doggedly theres still no proof there may be rutledge said thoughtfully captain wilton came to stay with his cousin when her husband died he undoubtedly knew about the will and the provision regarding the old shotgun it caused some problems at the time i understand i knew about it as well and had forgotten itso might he have its all circumstantial guessing what if the colonel was the wrong victim that sent forrests eyebrows up in patent disbelief what do you mean wrong victim you dont shoot a man at point blank range and get the wrong one thats foolery yes so it is rutledge answered its also foolery that the colonel was flawless a man with no sins on his conscience when people begin to tell me the truth captain wilton will be far safer assuming of course that youre right and hes innocent leaving sergeant davies to check on roystons dental appointment in warwick rutledge went searching for hickam on his own but the man seemed to have disappeared drunk somewhere like enough hamish said yours is a dry business man id as soon have a bottle myself which was the only time rutledge had found himself in agreement with the voice in his mind he turned the car toward the inn and his thoughts toward dinner which turned out to be interesting in its own way he had hardly cut into his roast mutton when the dining rooms glass doors opened and a man with a clerical collar came in stood for a moment surveying the room then made his way across to where rutledge sat he was nearing thirty of medium height with fair hair a polished manner and a strong sense of his own worth stopping by the table he said in a rich baritone inspector rut ledge im carfield the vicar ive just called again at mallows and miss wood is still unwell then i thought perhaps it might be wiser to ask you anyway can you tell me when the colonels body will be released for burial we havent held an inquest yet mr carfield sit down wont you id like to talk to you now that youre here carfield accepted the offer of coffee and said such a tragic business the colonels death so everyone says who might want to kill him why no one that i can think of yet someone did studying carfield as the man stirred cream but no sugar into his cup rutledge could see that he had the kind of face that would show up well on the stage handsome and very masculine beyond the twentieth row but too heavily boned to be called more than strong at close quarters the voice too was made to carry and grated a little in ordinary conversation the actor was lurking there behind the clerical collar sergeant davies had been right about that tell me about miss wood lettice very bright with a mind of her own she came to mallows several years back after shed finished school and shes been an ornament to the community ever since were all very fond of her over the rim of his cup carfield was quickly assessing the inspector noting his thinness the lines of tiredness about the mouth the tense muscles around the eyes that betrayed the strain behind his mask of polite interest but carfield misunderstood these signs putting them down to a man out of his depth one who might prove useful shes taken her guardians death very hard after all he was her only family girls are often very attached to their fathers you know harris could hardly be termed that rutledge commented dryly with a graceful wave of his hand carfield dismissed the quibble over ages in loco parentis of course from all i hear he may well have walked on water carfield laughed but it had an edge to it harris no if anyone fits that description its simon haldane not the colonel he was too good at killing you know some men become soldiers because theyve no imagination they dont know how to be afraid but charles harris had an uncanny aptitude for war i asked him about that once and he said that his skills such as they were came from reading history and learning its lessons but i found that hard to believe why the colonel was the finest chess player ive ever met and i have no mean skills at the game myself he was born with a talent for strategy that few of us are given and he made the choice about how to use it he fully understood that choice that war meant playing with mens lives not with prettily carved pieces on a game board but battle was an addiction he couldnt rid himself of rutledge said nothing carfield sipped his coffee then added as if he couldnt stop himself men from warwickshire who served under him worshiped him they tell me that on the battlefield he was charismatic but i call it more a gift for manipulation i dont suppose you were in the war inspector but i can tell you that sending other men into battle must rest heavily on ones soul in the end hamish stirred but made no remark he had no need to rutledge found himself saying then the kings of israel must not be sleeping peacefully in abrahams bosom as i remember they were at war most of the time carfield nodded graciously to parishioners who had just come in a man and his wife then turned back to rutledge make light of it if you wish but something deep down in charles harris was frightened by the man he was he was a gemini you see two forces in one body in my opinion he needed to come home to mallows from time to time because it brought him peace a sense of balance proof that he wasnt a man who actually enjoyed killing however good he might be at it his muchvaunted devotion to the land was perhaps merely a charade for his troubled conscience and captain wilton what do you think of him an intelligent man and a brave oneone would have to be to fly dont you think when ezekiel saw the wheel high in the middle of the air he claimed it was god at work weve come a long way since then havent we man has finally set himself on a par with the archangels the question is are we morally ready for such heights hamish made a derisive snort and rutledge busied himself with the caramel flan when he had choked down his amusement rutledge asked but would he kill a friend wilton none of us can see into the souls of others inspector least of all me ive always tried to understand my parishioners but they still have the power to surprise me just the other day is that a yes or a no rutledge asked looking up and catching an expression in carfields eyes that interested him the man was ably playing the role of wise village priest enamored by the part but his eyes were cold and hard as he answered rutledges question i would be lying if i said i liked the man i dont hes a private person keeps himself to himself i think that may be why he enjoys flyinghes there alone in his aeroplane out of reach and accountable to no one and a man who likes his own company more than he ought is sometimes dangerous hermits have been known to come out of their isolated cells and lead crusades havent they but murder he shook his head i dont know possibly if he were angry enough and determined enough or if it was the only possible way to get exactly what he wanted i think hes been used to that getting his own way people tend to idolize handsome daredevils for people substitute lettice wood rutledge thought to himself but discounting the jealousy carfield had offered a better evaluation of harris and wilton than anyone else sometimes hatred saw more clearly than love and it might be a very good idea to add carfields name to the very short list of possible suspects though what purpose harriss death might have served in the vicars eyes was yet to be seen he went over his notes after dinner sitting in his room until the walls seemed to close in on him no illumination came no connections faces voices yes but so far leading nowhere except possibly to wilton he remembered his father saying once after a tiring day in court it isnt actually a question of guilt or innocence is it its a matter of what the jury believes once weve told them what evidence there is on either side given the proper evidence we could probably convict god without it lucifer himself would walk free it was late when he got up to walk off a restlessness that prodded him into activity useful or not before the war it had been the case that drove him night and daypartly from a gritty determination that murderers must be found and punished he had believed deeply in that with the singleminded idealism of youth and a strong sense of moral duty toward the victims who could no longer speak for themselves but the war had altered his viewpoint had shown him that the best of men could kill given the right circumstances as he himself had done over and over again not only the enemy but his own men sending them out to be slaughtered even when he had known beyond any doubt that they would die and that the order to advance was madness and partly from his fascination with a bizarre game of wits like the colonel who was far too good at strategy hed had a knack for understanding the minds of some of the killers he had hunted and he had found the excitement of the hunt itself addictive man hed read somewhere was the ultimate prey and the police officer had the reinforcement of society to indulge in that chase rutledge had tried to explain his reasons to jean once when she had begged him to leave the yard and take up law instead like his father before him but shed stared at him as if he had spoken to her in russian or chinese then laughed and said oh ian do stop teasing me and be serious now it was his own uncertainties that left him with no peace his illusions as shattered as his mind why could he feel nothing about this murderer why he heard something in the shadowy alley to his left between the bakers shop and a small bootery a muffled cough and then hickam stumbled out singing to himself drunk again if anything worse than before rutledge thought with exasperation but at least he wasnt back in an imaginary france and there might still be a chance of getting a little sense out of him overtaking him in five strides rutledge put a hand on the mans shoulder to stop him speaking his name hickam shrugged it off irritably i want to talk to you about colonel harris rutledge said firmly prepared to block his retreat down the alley or a dash across the street ive come from london london is it hickam asked slurring the words but rutledge suddenly had the feeling that he wasnt as drunk yetas he wished he was and what does london want now a pox on sodding london a pox on sodding everybody the morning that the colonel died you were in the lane drunk thats where sergeant davies found you do you remember he forced the man to face him could smell the alcohol on his breath the unwashed body the fear hickam nodded his face was ghastly in the moonlight tired and strained and hopeless rutledge looked into eyes like black plums in a pudding and flinched at what he read there a torment much like his own did you see the colonel charles harris or anyone else i didnt shoot him i had nothing to do with it no one claims you did im asking if you saw him or saw anyone else that monday morning i saw themthe two of them he frowned i saw them he added with less certainty i told forrest i know what you told forrest now tell me he was angry the captain pleading they were sending us across to take the guns and he didnt like it you could hear the shellsthe bombardment had started he was beginning to shake i wont give up that easily he said ill fight whatever youve done ill fight you every step of the way the guns were ours at first but then the hun answered and they were close i could hear the screaming and i couldnt find my helmet and the colonel said dont be a fool whether you like it or not youll have to learn to live with it and i saw the captains face and knew we were going to die he was crying tears running down his face like the shiny trails left by garden slugs his mouth turned down in an agony of terror they sent me down the sunken road to see that the flankers found their way and the colonel rode off leaving the captain behind and i knew hed kill me if he caught me hiding there from the gunsi didnt want to die god help me arms wrapped protectively around his body he bowed his head and wept with a bottomless grief that silently racked him his shoulders shaking all dignity and identity gone rutledge couldnt take any more he fished in his pocket for coins and gave them to the man forcing them into the hand nearest him hickam lifted his head staring at him bewildered by this interjection of reality into his desolation feeling the coins with his fingers like a blind man here buy yourself something else to drink and go home do you hear me go home hickam continued to stare at him at a loss theyre moving up i cant leave youre out of it rutledge said go find the aid station and tell them you need something to drink tell them i said you could have it tell themfor gods sake tell them to send you home and without a backward glance rutledge wheeled and strode angrily down the walk to the inn hamish hammering at his senses like all the furies rutledge lay awake for hours listening to the murmurs of a pair of doves nesting under the eaves they were restless as if a prowling cat or an owl worried them the village was quiet the public bar had closed and only the big church clock striking the quarters disturbed the stillness of the night he had himself under control again and only redfern had seen him return taking the stairs three at a time hed nearly stopped to tell the man to bring him a bottle of whiskey but had enough sense left to remember whereand whohe was staring at the ceiling he decided he would call for an immediate inquest and have it adjourned hickam had been too befuddled to know what he was saying and god alone could imagine what sort of witness he would make in court yet rutledge was sure now that there was something locked in his mind tangled with the war tangled with his confusion and the fumes of alcohol and if dr warren could get the man soberand sanelong enough to question they might get to the bottom of this business for all they knew it might clear wilton as easily as it might damn him in spite of forrests dithering the trouble was there was too much circumstantial evidence and not enough hard fact the quarrel with harris at mallows the possibleprobableencounter with harris again in the lane the next morning the shotgun sitting in maverss unlocked house the direction wilton had chosen for his walk all appeared to point to the captain and the time sequence itself fit all quite neatly but this hadnt been a neat killing it had been angry vengeful passionate bloody where except for maverss tired rhetoric had there been such passion on a quiet june morning and where had it disappeared once charles harris had been cut down with such savage fury that was the mystery he was going to have to solve before he could find the killer so much passion it had to be there still banked like a fire and aroused it might kill again he fell asleep on that thought and didnt hear the bustle in the street at two oclock in the morning although rutledge went out directly after breakfast in search of him hickam was nowhere to be found after a fruitless waste of time rutledge decided that the man probably didnt want to be found and gave up cursing his own maudlin stupidity for not hauling him directly to the doctors surgery last night while he had the chance and forcibly sobering up the poor devil picking up sergeant davies at the station after giving forrest instructions for the inquest rutledge said as they got into the motorcar ive been to the cottage checked every street in town and the outlying lanes as well not to mention the churchyard and the livery stables is there any place i havent thought of davies scratched his chin that about covers it id guess but theres high grass hedgerows and any number of sheds about and we could send half the army out looking and still not find him drunks have a way of vanishing but when hes slept this one off and needs more gin hell surface soon enough he glanced at the inspector and decided that he hadnt slept well changing the subject he said i checked with the dentist in warwick its true royston had an appointment on the morning of the murder but he never came in of course thats not surprising no i think i should speak to helena sommers again before she hears about maverss shotgun coming to light how do we get there davies had just had a very unpleasant discussion with inspector forrest about duty it was his duty to assist london and equally his duty to stay out of scotland yards way as much as possible which seemed to his mind a simple contradiction of terms forrest hadnt been pleased either that rutledge failed to bring his own sergeant along and before the interview had ended a chastened davies was beginning to feel that that was his fault as well but there was no escape constable reardon in lower streetham couldnt be spared and warwick wasnt about to send over one of their men and constable miliken from upper streetham was still at home with a leg broken in two places from the kick of a halfwit horse that had accidentally poked its nose into a hornets nest and run amok afterward trying to make the best of a bad situation and feeling uncomfortable in the lengthening silence that was beginning to sound very loud in the car davies cleared his throat and offered a suggestion that he had been mulling over while shaving that morning i was thinking sir about who might have shot colonel harris and it seems to me weve overlooked one thing what if the killer hadnt come from upper streetham at all i mean someone from warwick or london or as far as we might know from canterbury or liverpool its possible of course rutledge answered for that reason i dont rule it out but were short on motives arent we well sir it seems to me were short on motives for everyone else i mean the colonel might have done something in the war someone might hold him responsible for the loss of a leg or a sons death or a wrecked career somebody wed never heard of in upper streetham and would have no way of knowing existed before we could leave the case as person or persons unknown wed still have to clear every suspect in upper streetham including the captain davies sighed aye thats true rutledge glanced across at him tell me something why is everyone so determined to believe wilton is innocent surprised davies said hes a war hero isnt he admired by the king and a friend of the prince of wales hes visited sandringham been received by queen mary herself a man like that doesnt go around killing people with a wry downturn of his lips rutledge silently asked how did he win his medals you fool if not by being so very damned good at killing with davies to guide him rutledge found the narrow road cutting into the haldane property that led to a small picturesque cottage standing isolated on a hillside surrounded by fields and trees wild roses climbing over low stone walls set off the grounds their scent filling the air with sweetness on the north side the wall was a good two feet higher a windbreak for the gardens that lay at its foot someone had made a valiant effort to rescue them from weeds and lupines stood like sentinels behind the sweet williams and the irises drawing up in front of the cottage rutledge got out and was immediately attacked by an irate gray goose that took instant exception to invasion by unexpected strangers in motorcars fending off the goose he called miss sommers no one answered and after a moment neatly outdistancing the irate fowl by doubling back the other way around the car he made it to the steps and knocked on the cottage door no one came and he was on the point of leaving when a sixth sense that intuitive feeling that someone is there in the stillness on the other side of a door made him knock again louder this time the sound attracted the goose and she ceased her attack on her reflection in the cars wing bearing down on rutledge with neck arched but davies had the presence of mind to blow the cars horn and she wheeled in midrun to hurry back to her first victim finally the door was opened a narrow crack and a soft voice said yes miss sommers inspector rutledge im looking for your cousin is she in reluctantly the door opened wider and a pale face stared out shes not here just now there was a birds nest she wanted to check this morning he noted the strong family resemblance in features but this cousin was quieter dowdier younger her hair was a mousy brown her eyes wide and fearful her dress a muted graygreen that did nothing for her complexion or her coloring do you know when shell be back he asked maggie sommers shook her head quickly not wanting to encourage him to wait she peered over his shoulder saw the goose attacking the front tires of the inspectors car saw sergeant davies laughing out of the passengers side and then ducked back almost as if recoiling from any responsibility for what was happening on her lawn shes helenas pet she said defensively i dont like her she terrifies me shall i put her in a pen or somewhere rutledge asked wondering how he was going to manage that feat but miss sommers shook her head again no shell leave me alone if im not hanging out the wash she hates that why do you wish to see helena i wanted to talk with her about captain wilton she saw him the morning that colonel harris was shot tears filled her eyes and he thought for a moment she was going to start crying that was awfuli was never so terrified in my life as when i heard about it he seemed like such a nice man you knew the colonel rutledge asked in surprise oh no no but sometimes he rode this waythrough the fields there maggie sommers said pointing thats his land just beyond the high wall the two estates meet there if i was out in the gardens or something hed wave at first i was afraid hed want to stop and chat but he never did and helena said i ought to wave back it wasneigh borly she said he probably thought it was she anyway shed met himat a dinner party she smiled timidly giving her face a little more life and color the tears forgotten i was invited too he could see why she had been called a recluse why there had even been the suspicion that she was simple but she was only unimaginably shy almost childlike he thought that all he would have to do was shout at her in a harsh voice and shed scurry back inside and shut the door and hide under the bed torn between sympathy and irritation he wondered where someone as brisk and active as helena found the patience to cope with maggie for an entire summer or perhaps she wasnt quite so timorous when left alone she was saying anxiously should i offer you tea oror coffee i dont know when helenas coming back truly i dont it would be useless to wait and theres the cleaning still to be done taking pity on her he left dodging the goose again but he was sorely tempted to sideswipe it after one last onslaught as he cranked the car the heavy wings had caught the side of his head a nasty clip as he bent over at least it wasnt a goat davies said enjoying himself youd have sailed over yon wall like one of the captains aeroplanes when they reached upper streetham again they found a message from dr warren saying that he must see them urgently he was in his surgery when they arrived and he took them upstairs to a small room with an iron bedstead a table a single chair and a very still form under starched sheets hickam warren said shortly what the devils happened to him rutledge demanded drawing up the only chair and sitting down to stare at the closed gray face he looks half dead he is alcoholic poisoninghe drank enough to kill himself a miracle he didnt ive never seen a man so full of gin in all my years of practice hickam must have the constitution of an ox rutledge felt a surge of guilt where did you find him how i was coming home last night from the pinters farmjust over the ridge one of haldanes tenants little girls in rough shape and id stayed until the sedative finally started to work this was about two in the morning hickam was lying in the middle of the road hed crawled that far though god knows from where and then passed out i damned near ran over him to tell you the truth of it didnt see him until the last minute because he was in the darker shadows cast by the trees along the high street there and i didnt have my headlamps ontheres something wrong with the fool things i was so tired that i thought it was a sleeping dog and swerved to miss it and damned near rammed the horse trough outside miss millards dress shop then i realized it was hickam and for a brass farthing would have just left him there in the road to sleep it off but i got the car started again managed to haul him into it and brought him here and a good thing too or wed have lost him for a fact rutledge could see the mans unsteady breathing the sheet over his chest rising and falling with soft but ragged irregularity and said are you sure hell live he found himself torn between wishing hickam dead and keeping him alive but if he died and it was rutledges doinghe cursed himself savagely warren shrugged nothing is sure in medicine but at least the odds are on his side now god knows there must have been a pint of gin still in his belly when i pumped him out and that would have killed him for certain before morning where did he find enough money to drink that much davies demanded leaning over rutledges shoulder for a closer examination of the sunken eyes the scraggle of beard the slack mouth without answering him rutledge glanced up at warren did you know ive been looking for him most of this morning forrest said something about it when i spoke to him about hickam thats when i left the message for you but if youre thinking of questioning him now youre mad hes too weak to know what hes sayingeven if he could manage to speak rutledge nodded he could see that much for himself but he said then i want you to keep him here until i can question him use any pretext you can think of tie him to the bed if you have to but keep him here out of harms way and no visitors absolutely none you dont seriously believe he can tell you anything useful warren scoffed a man like hickam nonsense rutledges eyes were dark with anger as he said why because hes a drunk a coward out of his head you might be the same in his shoes ive seen more shell shock cases than youll ever attend doctor and theyre tormented people with no way out of the prisons of their minds you werent in france or gallipoli or palestine and theres nothing in your medical practice to tell you what it was like and i suppose you know warren snapped rutledge caught himself on the brink realized in time where his outburst was carrying him and said only i was there still angry when he reached the car rutledge said to da vies tell forrest im holding dr warren responsible for hickam and if for any reason whatsoever he leaves the doctors care hes to be arrested on sight is that clear wherell you be then davies asked warily im going back to mallows to see what lettice wood might tell him alone and with no notes being taken glad not to be included in that visit davies hurried off to find forrest and rutledge was left with hamishs company on the drive out to the colonels home this time he was shown directly to miss woods sitting room and rutledge found it empty she came in through a connecting door after a few minutes still wearing black but with her face no longer invisible to him the drapes were drawn back and the suns warm reflection filled the room with a softness that was kind to her griefshadowed eyes and this time she offered him a chair facing the couch where she chose to sit in the opposite corner with her back to the light from the windows more he thought for her own comfort than from any desire to make the interview difficult for him but she was braced for somethinghe could see the tenseness in her body the clenched line of her jaw have you brought me any news she asked her voice still husky as she looked directly at him he noticed that her eyes were not the same color one was a smoky hazel a green flecked with brown and gray the other a warm green touched with gold startlingly odd yet very beautiful not yet were still exploring several avenues im trying to build a picture in my mind of colonel harris the sort of man he was the sort of life he led she brushed that aside with angry impatience ive told you he had no enemies someone killed him he reminded her someone wanted him dead he must have done something if only that one single act to rouse such terrible hate she flinched as if hed struck her but surely youve made progress she asked again after a moment you must have talked to other people laurence royston mark inspector forrest lettice wood was fishing he realized suddenly she wanted to know what had been happening what had been said theyve told me very little actually everyone says that your guardian was a very fine man everyone that is except mavers he said nothing about carfield she smiled a little more in irony than amusement id have been more surprised if he hadnt but charles was a very nice man he neednt have been my guardian you know he was barely grown himself at the time and it must have seemed a dreary job taking on the responsibility of a parent less childa little girl at thatjust when there was a war to go to to me he seemed as old as my father i was even a little frightened of him clinging to my nannys skirts and wishing hed go away then he dropped to one knee and held out his arms to me and the next thing i knew id cried myself dry and he was ordering a tea with all my favorite things and afterward we went riding which scandalized the household i can tell you because i was supposed to be in deepest mourning shut away in darkness and in silence instead i was out in the fields laughing and racing him on my pony and her voice cracked and she looked away hastily he gave her time to regain her composure then asked what sort of mood had the colonel been in the last few days before his death mood she repeated quickly what do you mean was he happy tired worried irritable distracted he was happy she said her thoughts fading where he couldnt follow her very very happy why disconcerted she said what do you mean why just that what had made him so happy lettice shook her head he just was then why did he quarrel with mark wilton she got to her feet and walked across the room for a moment he thought she was leaving that she would disappear into her bedroom and shut the door on him but she went to the windows instead looking out at the drive and seeing he thought very little how could i know the answer to that she countered you harp on it as if it was important it might be it might decide whether we must arrest captain wilton or not turning back to him a dark silhouette against the light she said after a moment because of one quarrel when you claim you dont even know what it was about was it a statement or a question he couldnt be sure we have a witness who says they quarreled again the next morning not far from where your guardian was killed even with her back to the window he could see how shaken she was her shoulders hunched suddenly her body tense her hands were still he waited but she said nothing as if shed run out of words and still no defense offered on behalf of the man she loved if captain wilton is guilty youd wish to see him hang for it wouldnt you rutledge asked harshly you told me before that you wanted to see the killer hanged then why havent you arrested him she demanded huskily why have you come here instead and told me these things why are you adding to my grief she stopped somewhere finding the will to go on to make her voice obey her brain what is it you want of me inspector why are you here surely not to ask my opinion of quarrels i didnt witness or to speculate on marks hanging as if he were someone id never met there has to be more reason than that she was insistent almost compellingly so then tell me what it is he was angry with her and wasnt sure why because hamish whispered shes got courage hasnt she and your jean never did she crossed to the hearth restless with pent up emotions fingers mechanically rearranging the flowers there as if their relative positions mattered but he knew that she wasnt aware of what she was doing youre the man from london the one they sent to find my guardians murderer what have you been doing since you got to upper streetham searching for scapegoats thats odd he said quietly catherine tarrant said nearly the same thing about making the captain a scapegoat for someone elses crime in the mirror above the hearth he saw her face flame the warm blood flooding under the pale skin until she seemed to be flushed with a fever and her eyes sparkled as they met his in the glass catherine what has she to do with this she came to me to tell me straightaway that she was certain captain wilton was innocent he was intrigued with the way her eyes darkened with emotion until you couldnt see the difference in them though why she might have done that before anyone had actually accused him of murder is still something of a mystery lettice wood bit her lip it was to spite me she said looking away from him im sorry why should catherine tarrant wish to spite you at wiltons expense because she thinks i let the man she loved die or at least was in a sense responsible for his death and i suppose this is her way of striking back at me through mark she shook her head unable to speak then she managed to say its rather appalling isnt it considering she stopped again tell me about it when she hesitated he said ive only to ask someone else miss tarrant herself captain wilton i doubt if mark even knows the story then tell me about her relationship with wilton she met him before the warwhen he came to upper streetham after hugh davenants death and i suppose there was a mutual attraction but nothing came of it neither of them was ready for marriage he could think of nothing but flying and shes quite a fine artist did you know she hadnt sold anything at that point i dont think shed even tried but soon afterward one of her paintings received a great deal of attention in a london show and she moved up to town the name suddenly clicked hed seen c tarrants work powerful memorable studies of light and shadow of faces with strength and suffering written in each line or scenes where color richly defined the landscape with a boldness that brought turner to mind his sister frances admired her enormously but somehow hed thought of the artist as older a woman of experience and style not the earnest girl hed talked to in the inn parlor lettice wood was saying when her father died early in she came back to run their estate on her own that must have been a heavy responsibility it was but there was no one else to take over and the only men left to work the land were either very old or very young or like laurence royston were trying to keep the large estates afloat food and meat quotas filled she looked down at her hands slim and white in her lap i admired heri was only a schoolgirl and i thought she was something of a heroine a part of the war effort doing a mans work when shed rather be in london painting going to parties and exhibitions was her lover someone shed left behind in london she shook her head you must ask catherine i tell you he was watching her closely she had stopped taking the sedatives he was sure of it now but she was still dazed a little unsteady as if the first shock of her guardians death hadnt really worn off or as if something was tearing her apart inside crowding out all other emotions except grief and she was struggling to find a way to cope you brought up the subject in the first place why if you wont tell me the rest of it i was trying to explain thats allthat she was turning the other cheek if you like showing magnanimity she was doing for me what i failed to do for her lettice swallowed hard or rubbing salt into the wound for all i know he continued to look at her his face cold with speculation lettice lifted her chin her eyes changing again as she refused to be intimidated it has nothing to do with charles and certainly not with captain wilton she said firmly its between catherine and me a debt of a sort nothing seems to have anything to do with charles harris does it rutledge stood up why didnt you go riding with your guardian that last morning her mouth opened and she gulped air as if he had struck her in the stomach with his fist but no words came and then with a courage he could see she got herself in hand and answered him are you telling me that he might still be alive if i had thats very cruel inspector even for a policeman from london there was no thought of cruelty miss wood he said gently in our first interview you yourself seemed to emphasize the fact that you hadnt gone riding that morning i wondered why thats all had i her dark brows drew together and she shook her head i dont rememberi dont know in what context i might have left that impression when i asked you if youd seen the colonel since his quarrel with the captain you answered i didnt go riding that morning as if that was somehow important important if he had asked me i would have gone but i knowknewhow much his early rides meant to him and i thought there was all the time in the world she checked shook her head wordlessly and then after a moment said in exasperation oh do sit down we cant both prowl this room like tigers in a small cage id like to speak to mary satterthwaite before i go if i may she said of course as if it was a matter of indifference to her and rang the bell then watched him silently as they waited hamish grumbling deep inside rutledges mind was uneasy with lettice wood his scottish soul disturbed by those strange eyes and the intensity that churned behind them but rutledge found himself drawn to her against his will to the emotions that seethed just beneath the surface and somehow seemed to reflect his own a woman of passion when johnston answered her summons she said the inspector wishes to speak to mary could you take him to the small parlor please five minutes later rutledge found himself in a pleasant room overlooking the gardens and face to face with a woman of thirty neatly dressed and primly correct she had fair hair and pale blue eyes and her cheeks were pink from nervousness rutledge asked her to describe what she had seen and heard coming down the stairs the night of the quarrel and she answered readily giving him almost verbatim the same words hed heard from johnston but he wanted more you have no idea what the two men were quarreling about no sir none was it the sort of quarrel that might have led to blows or to hard feelings mary frowned trying to bring back the scene as she remembered it they were very angry sir their voices were deeper rougher if you know what i mean i wouldnt have recognized it for the captains not if i hadnt seen him with my own eyes it wasnt a small matter theyd quarreled over ive never seen either of them that upset but theyre gentlemen both of them it would never have come to blows however bad it was there was a naive certainty in her words and rutledge found himself suppressing a smile what reason did miss wood give you for coming upstairs early she didnt give any sir but as i was brushing her hair she said shed left the gentlemen to discuss the marriage and i asked if shed be going up to london soon she said she didnt feel like thinking about what all had to be done in london not tonight so i thought she must have a headache starting especially when she asked for a cloth to cool her face she was that tense the way she always is when somethings troubling her so i helped her get ready for bed and left her to sleep strange isnt it that she wouldnt have wished to be present if it was an important discussion headache or not you must ask miss wood that sir but if they was to talk about business matters now the settlement or such it wouldnt have been proper would it and shed seemed a little restive all evening to tell the truth of it as if there were things on her mind or the headache was coming on the first fitting for the gown was next week and they say brides often get edgy over that miss wood herself never mentioned a headache or that she was feeling unwell no sir but i can always tell when theres something bothering her she doesnt need to say anything how long have you worked at mallows he asked as if that was more important to him than the evidence she had given her eyes flickered in surprise but she answered readily since i was twelve sir was the colonel a good master the best he was always considerate always polite saying please when he had no need to she bit her lip were all that upset yes i understand i hear that you have a relative who is housekeeper to miss tarrant thats right yes sir my sister how long has she been in miss tarrants employ the pale eyes narrowed warily since sir if you please or i should say she was mr tarrants housekeeper then is she happy enough there it would seem so sir and she met captain wilton when he was here in upper streetham before the war the wariness vanished oh yes sir vivian thought very highly of him he was very much interested in flying even then i understand indeed sir mad for it she said and teasing miss catherine about taking her up making her laugh and plead with him not to dream of it a pleasant man was he goodnatured wellmannered yes sir a gentleman not like she stopped short yes not like charles harris she turned a deep red and he realized that it was with anger not embarrassment oh no sir the german not the colonel and then with grave dignity she added ill say no more sir if you please and although he persisted for a time she was true to her word so he went to see catherine tarrant and found her in her studio it was a tiled highceilinged room that had been converted from an edwardian conservatory with light that illuminated without blinding and there was an earthy smell about it mixed with the odors of paint and of turpentine and oddly enough the ghostly scent of roses she was stretching a canvas when vivian who bore a faint resemblance to her sister mary led rutledge there and then left shutting the door quietly i didnt know at the inn he said that you were c tar rant my sister is a great admirer of your work he looked around at the paintings drying against the wall their colors gleaming like jewels in various corners of the room thats always nice to hear you never tire of praise the critics are generous enough with condemnation she glanced up and said but that isnt what brought you here is it whats happened her face was tense prepared nothing has happened that im aware of ive come to ask you about something that has been puzzling me thats all the german the slender stretcher in her hands snapped and she stared at him with a mixture of anger and exasperation i might have known as a general rule i find that men who were at the front are the least prejudiced in spite of what theyve suffered or saw their friends suffer im sorry you arent one of them he found a smile for her although she had made him angry in turn how do you know to tell you the truth i dont have any idea what im supposed to be prejudiced about why dont you tell me and then well see where i stand putting down the canvas she walked over to one of the open windows her back to him as a matter of curiosity who told you about the german several people have alluded to him he said carefully yes i expect they have she answered weary patience in her voice but i really dont see what it has to do with this enquiry she turned around lifted one of the paintings stacked against the wall beside her and began to study it as if she saw something she didnt like about it how can i be sure until i hear your side of the story she glanced up wryly youve been talking to lettice i think well everyone else has pawed over what happened with salacious enthusiasm why not scotland yard at least youll hear the truth from me not wild conjectures and the embroideries of gossip she put that painting down and picked up another keeping her voice coolly detached but he could see the way her hands gripped the canvas as she held it at arms length its very simple really during the war when there werent enough men to do the heavy work on the farms the government allowed people to take on german prisoners of war to help on the land most of them were glad to do it it was better than being cooped up in camp all day with nothing to occupy them mallows was allowed three germans to bring in the harvest one year and you she turned the painting a little as if to see it better yes i applied for one but he didnt work outi dont think hed ever seen a cow before much less a plow hed been a clerk in a milliners shop and although he was willing i spent most of my time trying to show him what he was supposed to be doing rutledge said nothing and after a moment she went on reluctantly so they sent me a new man and then someone to help him he was marvelous he could do anything make repairs plow birth a foal milk whatever was neededand he seemed to take pleasure in it he had grown up on the land but he hadnt actually worked it someone else did that for him he was a lawyer in bremen rolf was his namerolf linden andi fell in love with him it wasnt an infatuation this time it wasnt at all like my feelings for mark but rolf was a germanand as far as everyone in upper streetham was concerned the only good german was a dead one and he was a prisoner he went back to the camp every night hardly the stuff of high romance is it nothing came of it then he prompted after a time she seemed to have forgotten the painting in her hands and after a moment absently put it back in its place not at first then i realized that he loved me did he tell you that if so rutledge thought to himself the man was an opportunist whatever she had been led to believe no it happened rather prosaically he was gored by the bull wed brought in for the dairy herd and he couldnt be moved so i nursed him and when he was too ill to know what he was saying he said too much after that well somehow we managed to keep it a secret from everyone else but he was terrified that id find myself pregnant and late in i wrote to lettice to ask her to contact charles for mei thought he might use his influence to let us be married she walked aimlessly across the studio straightening the canvas on her easel picking up a dry brush and running the tip through her fingers frowning at a palette as if the colors on it were entirely wrong and all the while her eyes were hidden from him in all fairness she said as if to the palette i do believe lettice when she says she wrote to him i think she kept her promise behind the unemotional voice was a well of anguish and rutledge found himself thinking again of jean he knew what loss was how the mind refuses to believe the way the body aches with a need that cant be satisfied and the awful endless desolation of the spirit and as always when he was under stress hamish stirred into life you rant about your jean he said his voice seeming to echo in the high ceiling of the studio what about my fiona she promised to wait but i didna come back did i not even in a box theres nae grave in the kirkyard to bring flowers to so shell sit in her wee room and cry with no comfort to ease her grief not even a kiss did we have in that room though i saw it once desperate to silence him rutledge said aloud and more brusquely than hed intended go on what happened it all went wrong he was taken away sent elsewhere they wouldnt tell me where he had gone and then around boxing dayno one was quite certain of the date because so many people were ill and the records were all botched he came down with influenza no one told me that either she looked up suddenly her eyes hot with unshed tears it wasnt until the war ended and i had searched half of england for him that i finally discovered hed been dead for over a yeara year i went a little mad i blamed lettice and charlesfor rolf being taken away for his death for no word being sent to mefor all of it i told myself she hadnt tried to make charles understand how much rolf and i loved each other i was certain that charles never did anything more than glance at her letter and then send it straight to the war office it was the only way they could have learned the truth about rolf and me the only reason they would have punished us by taking him away charles had done nothingexcept betray us in the brightness of the skylight over her head he could see that her breathing was ragged her face settling into taut lines as she fought for control and she won no tears fell because the remembrance of anger had burned them out instead did you ever ask harris what hed doneor not done no it was uncompromising rolf was dead nothing would bring him back i had to learn to forget or i knew id be dead as well emotionally i mean which gave her a powerful motive for murder and could explain why shed defended wilton at the inn he looked around him at catherine tarrants work at the strength of her lights and darks the daring use of spaces the power of her colors at the emotions her subjects evoked even the bold black of her sketches set the imagination ablaze a mother and child locked in each others arms fierce pro tectiveness in the mothers face terror in the childs he had seen refugees on the roads of france who might have posed for that an old man clutching a folded british flag in his arms and fighting back tears as he stood in a small overgrown country churchyard staring down at the raw earth of a new grave if you wanted to capture the waste of war rut ledge thought what better expression was there than this the very antithesis of the dashing recruitment posters a girl in a rosesplashed gown whirling in ecstasy under the spreading limbs of an aged oak the lost world of the innocence and brightness and abandonment to joy that was gone forever there were landscapes heavy with paint storm clouds thrusting upward wind racing wildly through a high meadow waves lashing a rocky coast where watchers waited for stormbound ships to lure them inland he saw enormous control in each work the sure knowledge of exactly how much and how little made enough a natural gift of talent honed to a cutting edge by long experience the same control she had exerted just now but there was not a single still life among them as if the whirlwind in the painters mind couldnt be leashed that far he was finding it hard to relate the woman before him and the art he could see with his own eyes its unwomanly hamish said uneasily id not take my ease with one of those hanging above my hearth as if shed heard him catherine seemed to collect herself with an effort she saw rutledge examining her work brushing the dark hair aside she said with a sigh yes i know no one expects me when the artist is introduced everyone thinks c tarrant must be a man or one of those masculine women who wear trousers everywhere and smoke strong russian cigarettes ive considered wearing a patch over one eye and walking about with a trained ocelot on a leash were you listening at all i was listening and youre wrong i would have had no objection to your marriage not at least on the basis of lindens nationality i didnt know the man himself but i did and if you believe i might have shot charles out of some twisted need to revenge rolf i suppose i could have but what good would it have done i ask you a life for a life her mouth twisted in a sardonic smile charles harris for rolf linden do you think thats why i came to see you about mark to make certain that he didnt hang for my crime she laughed but there was no amusement in it it would be a terrible irony wouldnt it if mark was punished for what id done the two men ive cared for dead because of me who were the women in charles harriss life the change of direction sobered her how should i know he spent so little time here and when he was at home mallows absorbed him completely was he ever in love with anyone in upper streetham mrs davenant for instance why on earth do you ask that most soldiers carry a womans image in their minds like the photos of gladys cooper each man wore next to his heart in the trenches she considered that head on one side ive never really understood why sally married hugh yes he was attractive if you liked the neerdowell dashing romantic enormous fun always exciting and he could make your heart absolutely flutter when he wanted to be charming but as a husband he was hopeless for a time laurence royston was in love with her im sure of it i couldnt believe at first that mark wasnt but charles she shook her head slowly ill have to think about that with a smile to take the sting from his words he asked and you were you ever in love with charles harris she laughed this time a contralto laugh that rippled with humor of course when i was sixteen and went to my first ball it was at the haldanes and charles rescued me from the possessive clutches of my father who thought every man in the room must have designs on my virtue it would have been far more exciting if they had but charles was there splendid in his dress uniform and took pity on me so i promptly fell in love with him and slept with my dance card under my pillow for at least a month afterward he was a terribly attractive man not strikingly handsome like mark of course but with something about the eyes and the mouth that you remembered how much would you say your art was influenced by your relationship with linden beforeand after now theres an interesting question she said biting her lip as she gave it her attention id say he softened it if anything love teaches you humilitypatienceunderstanding and acceptance charles told me once that id have made a good soldier on the battlefield because i didnt know the meaning of fear you arent afraid until youve got something to lose but when you love someone or something youre ter rifiedtheres so much at stake then so much at risk you see driving back toward upper streetham rutledge saw laurence royston coming toward him on a magnificent bay hunter royston waved then drew rein indicating that he wanted rutledge to stop as well leaning down to speak to him royston said while youre out in this direction come to mallows with me and ill give you that will so rutledge followed him back to mallows this time he was taken to a small doorway on the western side of the house nearly hidden by a giant wisteria whose faded blossoms still bore a whisper of lingering scent royston unlocked it and then down a short stoneflagged passage unlocked another heavy door they entered a large room dark with paneling and bookshelves and tall cabinets but with a pair of windows behind the desk looking out on a pleasant shrubbery royston went to one of the cabinets beside the desk unlocked that with another key and brought out several bundles of papers sorting them with the swiftness of familiarity he quickly found what he was looking for and handed over a bundle tied in dark ribbon sit down man thats the more comfortable chair over there i use this one when ive got to read the riot act its hard enough to numb the bones youll notice the seal of this document hasnt been broken the will is just as it was when charles brought it up from london to put in the cabinet rutledge examined the seal carefully and agreed no it hasnt been touched as far as i can see he opened it and began to read ten minutes later he looked across at royston and said it seems rather straightforward the estate is left as you would expect and there are the usual bequests in addition to that royston smiled wryly i hope they include a sum for the church well have carfield ranting on the doorstep if there isnt hes very determined to have a new organ and something has to be done about the roof as well the old parsonage could come down around his ears for all he cares but the church is a different matter a proper setting for a proper man of god why isnt he interested in the parsonage he lives there doesnt he to tell you the truth i always believed that he had his eye on mallows by way of lettice of course charles said he would as soon see her married to a giant slug rutledge laughed it was cruel but apt he retied the ribbons and said ill keep this if i may when are the solicitors coming down from london not until after the funeral ive spoken with them and there are contingency measures to see to the running of the estate thats no problem frankly i dont think lettice is up to hearing the will read and i told them as much i expect to have the inquest tomorrow adjourned of course he asked one eyebrow raised for the time being yes rutledge considered him did you ever have a fallingout with harris royston shrugged we didnt always see eye to eye on management of the estate but you dont kill a man over marrows and hay or a new barn did you envy him after twenty years mallows must carry your imprint more than his but harris survived his wars he came home eager to take charge if miss wood inherited youd be master here again in all but name no he said tightly thats ridiculous but then he glanced away are you in financial trouble of any sort there was a sizable bequest to royston in the will following the recommendation that he be kept on as agent royston flushed but said no i dont gamble i havent time for wasting my money in other pursuits and im well paid have you ever borrowed money from harris unprepared for that roystons eyes flickered once he said tightly many years ago when i got into the devil of a scrape and couldnt get out of it on my own i was twentyone what did you do royston hesitated i borrowed his car without his knowledge there was a girl i desperately wanted to see down in dorset because i thought i was madly in love with her colonel harriscaptain he was thenwas in palestine and at the time it didnt seem like such a crazy thing to do taking the car he stopped and then added quickly there was an accident i wasnt a very experienced driver and so it was my fault whatever the law said i paid for what id donein more ways than one and there were hospital bills among other things id badly damaged a kidney thats what kept me out of the war later charles lent me the money to settle it all within five years id paid him back every penny it must have been a large sum any sum is large when youre twentyone and frightened out of your wits but yesit was large the car wasnt mine remember andsomeone was hurt it took every ounce of courage i had to confess to charles all he said was youve had a bad experience but theres no going back to change it so try to learn from it thats the only restitution you can offer and did you the eyes meeting his were level and sober for eight years or more i had nightmares about it the accident i mean reliving it i dont hold with freuds nonsense about dreams but i can tell you that nightmares strip the soul rutledge found no answer for that sally davenant watched her cousin for a while then said mark thats the fifth time youve read that page put the book down for gods sake and tell me whats wrong nothing he said smiling up at her i was thinking thats all dont tell me nothing when i know there is something youve walked around like a man in torment for days now and why arent you at mallows lettice must be frantic with grief and surely theres something you can do for her if only to hold her you did that for me after hugh died and it was all that got me through those first ghastly days and there are practical considerationswhos arranging the funeral you cant leave it to that dreadful man carfield hell give us a sickeningly long eulogy comparing poor charles to pericles or alexander and the solicitors in london could do worse with something coldly formal and military lettice will know best what charles would have wantedthe right scripture hymns and so on shes still under dr warrens care do you think being drugged into helplessness is going to solve anything for her whats wrong i ask you again something is you spent every free moment at mallows until the day charles died and its going to look decidedly odd if you arent there now he took a deep breath then said if im suspected of the murderand they wouldnt have brought in scotland yard would they if theyd believed it was mavers theyd have hauled him to jail and been done with iti can hardly go to lettice with that sort of thing being whispered all through the county she regarded him thoughtfully half in amusement and half in exasperation mark my dear thats carrying good manners to absurd extremes do you think lettice will care what the county believes shell want you beside her and that in itself will silence most of the gossips there was such desperate grief in his eyes now that she was suddenly appalled mark she began anxiety changing her voice making it strained and wary the first time i went i was turned awayif i go again and it happens a second time what do you think will be made of that almost weak with relief she said shed been given a sedative did you expect dr warren to invite you to her bedroom with no chaperone in the house betrothed or not he wouldnt have countenanced that rising from her chair she came to kneel beside his taking his hands in hers my dear lettice probably has no idea whats been said whos going to tell her rutledge for one she bit her lip yes rutledge the mans a menace probing and digging hes no fool sally and he wont leave until hes got what he wanted if only you and charles hadnt quarreled so publicly that last night how were we to know that the servants were still about besides he stopped then lifted her fingers kissed the tips and let them go she didnt rise but stayed there beside him her hands dropping to her lap i wish you would tell me what that was all about how can i help you if i dont know he rubbed his eyes and they burned as if he hadnt slept for a week they had felt that way in france he remembered when there was a push on and the planes went up as long as the pilots could stay awake to man them until blind exhaustion sent you stumbling back to quarters and the nearest bed it wasnt even a quarrel come to that we never got to the point of quarreling he said something that took me completely off guard and the next thing we knew we were both murderously angry mark looked at her his eyes bloodshot from the rubbing his tiredness there for her to see it died with charles at least pray god it did he added vehemently but the timing yes i know theres no getting around that is there sally and rutledge will have me exactly where he wants me if he ever finds out the whole of it hickam was a bloody nuisance but i could have dealt with him as it is charles might still reach out from the grave and take me with him she got to her feet and said with conviction then you must go to lettice now before everyone in upper streetham notices that you arent there mark dont you see youre being very foolish rutledge went to find johnston before he left mallows but instead came facetoface with lettice as she slowly descended the main staircase it was he thought the first time shed left her room since dr warren had taken her there and she seemed abstracted her body moving without the volition of her mind which was turned inward toward private visions no one else could share whatever they were she drew no comfort from them for she looked tired empty i thought you had gone away she said frowning as she saw him and recognized him well did you want some thingor someone ive just spoken to royston i wanted to let you know that the inquest will be tomorrow i wont be there she said quickly with an edge of panic i wont attend i shant expect you to attend there will bewe must address certain formalities and then i intend to ask for an adjournment he amended to spare her there was no need to go into more detail than that since royston had identified the body not lettice she turned to go back the way shed come and he stopped her i went to see catherine tarrant with her hand on the banister as if she gained strength from its support she came down the rest of the stairs and she asked when she was on eye level with him it was almost as if she thought he might be tricking her she told me about linden and she repeated and i understand the debt you referred to this morn ingyour fiances life for her lovers but theres another aspect of the situation one less pleasant could miss tar rant have shot colonel harris in revenge for lindens death brooding over what happened and convincing herself that he might have saved the german if hed tried punishing himand indirectly you lettice wood began to laugh bitterly at first and then in wild denial oh god she said thats too diabolical to contemplate the laughter turned to tremors that racked her body no i wont think about it go away i dont want to talk to you anymore rutledge had seen soldiers close to the breaking point begin to shake after a battle and he moved quickly to lead her to one of the ornate chairs standing against the wall once he got her seated he gripped lettices shoulders firmly and said stop it thats enough his voice was quiet but pitched to reach her through the emotional frenzy she fought him then collapsed in tears and for a moment he knelt by her chair and simply held her offering what comfort he could she smelled of lilies of the valley and her hair was soft against his face it was not professional and hamish was clamoring in the back of his head about the seduction of witches but there was nothing else he could do when the worst was over he went into the drawing room to ring for mary satterthwaite waiting for his summons to be answered he stood by the high back of the chair with one hand on lettices shoulder knowing from experience that the warmth of human contact was often more important than words and thinking to himself that this rather blew to the four winds his earlier impression that lettice wood knew who had killed her guardian dr warren had spent a harried morning in his surgery and added to that had been a sleepless night attending to hickam he was tired irritable and behind in his schedule as he started out on his rounds he was grumbling about a retirement long overdue and the ingratitude of villagers who seemed to think he was on call twentyfour hours of the day he looked in on the new baby he had delivered and found it flourishing but tonguelashed the father when he discovered that the mother had spent her morning bent over a full tub of washing ive told you mercy had a hard birth warren finished and youd have seen it for yourself if you hadnt been ten parts drunk that whole day now either you find someone from the village to lend a hand in the house or ill find a good woman and bill you for her if mercy hemorrhages shes as good as dead and then where will you and that child be he stumped back to his car and swore as he barked his knuckles trying to start it the next stop was briefer to call on an elderly widow ill with shingles and this time he left her a stronger powder to help with the pain from the long ropes of fluidfilled blisters that looped down her arm it was all he could do but the old cataractclouded eyes smiled up at him with a pathetic gratitude finally he reached the cottage on the haldane property where agnes farrells daughter meg lived agnes was tall spare and capable the most levelheaded woman hed ever met andin his opinionwasted as a housemaid when shed have made such an excellent nurse meg had married well her husband ted pinter would be head groom on the estate when his father retired and the cottage was as pretty as she could make it warren had always looked forward to his visits here because meg was as healthy as her mother and had gone through two pregnancies with no trouble at all the last one four years ago she was also a very respectable cook and never failed to send him away with a slice of cake or scones for his tea but the kitchen no longer smelled of baking and the woman who met him at the door had lost the bloom of youth and health meg looked forty and her mother twice that lizzie was a pretty little thing he thought bending over the narrow crib to peer down at the pale little face staring blankly at the wall but she wouldnt be for long if something didnt work soon she was as far as he could tell exactly as hed left her the day before and the day before that as well hed lost count of the string of days he had come here and yes nights too trying to break through that blank stare lizzie reminded him even more strongly now of those round cheeked marble cherubs that the haldanes seemed to want carved on all their family tombsand nearly as white and cold where once her skin had had the soft warmth of ripe peaches lizzie didnt move she didnt speak she never seemed to sleep and food pressed into her mouth dribbled out it as if shed somehow forgotten how to swallow except for an array of bruises that were already fading there was not a mark on her warren had looked with great care no sign of a head injury spinal injury bee sting spiders bite no rash no fever no swellings just this deathly stillness that was broken by fits of wild thrashing and screaming that went on and on until lizzie was exhausted and dropped suddenly back into stillness again agnes watched him watching the child and said theres no change not that we can see i got some milk into her again and a little weak tea most of the broth ended up on her gown meg her hands twisted tightly together added we thought ma and i that it was darkness she was afeared of but the screaming only happens when ted is near her hes got so he wont come into the room after a moment she added anxiously why should she be afeared of her own father she probably isnt warren said shortly wheres the boy i sent him over to my sister polly the screaming was bothering him he wasnt getting any rest at all teddy six was the image of his father and seemed to be made entirely of springs like a jackinthebox it doesnt seem to disturb her when i come near her warren went on thoughtfully who else has been in the house men i mean no one agnes said well pollys husband come to get teddy he stopped on his way home from the mill and was too dusty to set foot in the door but lizzie must have heard him she grinned tiredly saul quarles was the bass in the church choir with a chest to match local wits claimed that his voice carried farther than the churchs bell she couldnt miss him could she but she didnt cry scream not a peep is she going to die meg asked striving for calmness and failing wretchedly whats wrong with her warren shook his head she needs a specialist i saw a woman like this once early in my practice shed lost her baby and couldnt face it the spell passed in a week a little longer perhaps grief fright sudden changesthey can do things to the brain meg began to cry softly and agnes put her arm around the girls shaking shoulders there there she whispered but the words carried no comfort mary satterthwaite answering the summons of the drawing room bell was startled to find rutledge back at mallows when shed seen him out the door two hours earlier he was standing by one of the hall chairs a hand on lettice woods shoulder as if holding her there and the girl was shaking like a tree in the wind bristling at the sight of her mistress in such distress she rounded on the inspector from scotland yard and said whats happened then rutledge replied quietly i think you should ask miss wood lettice had stopped crying before mary came through the servants door but she accepted the fresh handkerchief the maid thrust into her hand and pressed it to her eyes almost as if to form a barrier between herself and the two people standing over hera shield when she lowered it rutledge could see that she was thinking again that shed used that brief instant of withdrawal to take a firmer grip on selfcontrol the trembling had stopped but shock still showed in the pinched whiteness of her face and in the effort she was making to overcome it she said huskily im all right mary truly i am its just lettice glanced up quickly at rutledges unreadable face marys sister was catherine tarrants housekeeper did he know that she wasnt sure how he might respond to the lie she was about to tell if he would understand why but she had to keep catherine tarrant out of this investigation if she could and the first step was preventing mary from gossiping theres to be an inquest and i expectsomething must be done about the services mary eyed rutledge accusingly mr royston will see to all that for you miss and the captain dont worry your head about it the inspector shouldnt ought to have sprung that on you it was ill done sir if you ask me to lettices relief rutledge said nothing shall i get one of dr warrens powders for you miss itll help im sure it will lettice shook her head vehemently no no more of those i cant abide them the inspector is leaving mary will you see him to the door she stood up in dismissal then faltered catching her breath her face even whiter if that was possible her eyes wide with alarm rutledge still carefully watching her reached out to steady her but mary was there before him quickly taking lettices arm and chiding you must eat something miss to keep up your strength i keep telling you it wont do sending your tray back untouched sit yourself down in the small drawing room and let me talk to cook shell find something you can fancy see if she doesnt lettice said yes all at once i feel as if im floating i hadnt realized she made an effort to smile anything will do it doesnt matter goodbye inspector she was gradually overcoming the shock her training and her own fierce will coming to her aid and as she turned to rutledge her chin lifted a little pride he realized about that other matter im sure youre wrong you took me by surprise but its a horridly convoluted theory isnt it and not very realistic if you actually think about it the bell at the front door sounded rutledge could hear it pealing distantly in the servants hall downstairs lettice closed her eyes as if shutting out the sound i dont want to see anyone she said quickly distracted mary turned to the policeman its my duty to answer that sir mr johnston isnt here just now hes gone into upper streetham take care of your mistress ill see to it rutledge said curtly and moved to the door before she could stop him lettice stepped just across the threshold into the drawing room a sanctuary of sorts he opened the heavy door only far enough to see who was on the step prepared to be equally curt with the caller it was mark wilton and the mans face mirrored his own surprise wheres johnston whats happened the captain said sharply and shoved the door wide with a suddenness that caught rutledge off guard is lettice lettice stood in the drawingroom doorway her pale troubled face turned in alarm toward the sound of the captains voice her emotions were still raw and rutledge had seen her reaction swiftly covered though it was more to the point so had wilton stepping into the hall he seemed suddenly at a loss for words his eyes sweeping her with a mixture of love and something else concern or fear rutledge intensely interested watched the pair of them for an instant neither of them moved neither spoke but a question was asked an answer given in a wordless exchange that lasted for no more than a matter of seconds he would have sworn before god and in a crowded courtroom that it was the look of silent conspirators that he saw pass between them and then mark was striding across the marble floor toward her while lettice came forward to meet him under the glorious painted venus overhead she moved with exquisite grace a tall slim woman in rustling black her hands held out before her palms down a blind look in her eyes a mixture of emotions in her face mark grasped her hands in his as if they were lifelines before leaning forward to kiss her gently on her left cheek this is the last thing that should have happened he said quietly to her alone you know i mean that yet rutledge could sense the suppressed feeling in the man an intensity that was both physical and emotional and was confused by his own reaction to it as if his hackles rose then he remembered with a jolt the way hed felt the last few times hed seen jeanwanting to hold her desperately in need of her warmth to keep the darkness away and yet afraid to touch her afraid of her rejection hamish deep in his mind said ominously shes a witch man this onell have your soul if you let her are ye no listening mary hesitated then quickly made herself scarce disappearing down the passage toward the servants door rut ledge drawn into the scene before him held his ground lettice gave a quick little shake of her head as if she couldnt think of anything to say in response to wiltons words or in denial still holding lettices hands wilton turned to rutledge and asked when will youerpermit us to make arrangements for the funeral rutledge saw lettice flinch in spite of wiltons careful words tomorrow he replied briefly after the inquest wilton stared at him wariness behind his eyes but he said only then ill speak to you later at the inn rutledge nodded wilton was right this was neither the time nor the place to discuss what form the inquest was going to take there was an awkward silence as if no one quite knew what to say next then wilton went on speaking to lettice now the words stilted meaningless even to his own ears sally sends her dearest love she wanted to come before this but dr warren insisted you were to have quiet and rest if theres anything she can do please tell me you know how fond she was of charles lettice said huskily thank her for me will you i dont know whats to be done nextthe service for one thing i dont think i can face the vicar she made a wry face not just now or the lawyers but i ought to send word to someone in the regiment leave carfield to me you neednt see him or anyone else if youd rather not and ill deal with the army if you like theyll want a memorial service of course when youre up to it but that can wait rutledge walked away from them to the stillopen door and lettice said unexpectedly raising her voice a little as if suddenly afraid he was leaving i expect you and i must also give some thought to the wedding mark i cantthe white gownim in mourning all the arrangements must be canceled the guests notified rutledge missed the look on wiltons face but the captain said only my love ill see to it as well you neednt worry about any of that now but her eyes were on rutledge and as he stopped by the door he could see that they were nearly the same color something must be done she said insistently i cant go through with it so many peoplethe formality no of course not i understand i promise you wilton said quietly you can trust me to take care of it taking her elbow he tried to lead her down the passage by the stairs toward the room where rutledge had spoken with mary earlier that morning there was a frown between lettices eyes now as if they werent focusing properly mary was going to bring me somethingsome soup i havent eateni feel wretchedly lightheaded mark yes im not surprised come and sit down then ill see whats keeping her rutledge quietly let himself out finally satisfied but hamish wasnt shes up to something he said uneasily yon captain now hes nobodys fool is he but that one will lead him a merry dance before hes finished wait and see aye youll find a woman at the bottom of this business and a terrible hate which woman rutledge asked getting into the car or havent you made up your mind the witch the painter or the widow hamish growled softly oh aye ive made up my mind its you that wont see where the winds blowing youre the wrong man for this murder and if you had any wit left youd drive straight to london and ask to be relieved i cantif i quit now youll have won ive got to see it through or put a pistol to my head but you know what will happen if you drag that poor sod hickam into court theyll crucify him and you along with him because the women will protect yon fine captain mark my words and theres no one left to protect you turning out of the gates rutledge said between his teeth when ive finished there wont be any need to drag hickam anywhere ill have other proof hamishs derisive laughter followed him the rest of the way back to upper streetham bowles had called from scotland yard when rutledge rang him back bowles said youve had two days whats happened were holding the inquest tomorrow and it will be adjourned i need more time he answered trying to keep the tenseness the uncertainty out of his voice there was an appreciative silence at the other end of the line and then bowles asked im being pushed for results myself you know i cant put them off with rutledge needs more time what kind of progress have you made weve found the shotgun at least i think we have the owner has witnesses that place him elsewhere at the time of the murder but the general consensus is hes got the best motive for killing the colonel the problem is i dont see what it achievedwhy now this feud between them is of long standing why not twenty years ago when it all started but the mans house is unlocked its isolated and anyone who knew about the shotgun could have walked in and taken it and several people did know it would have been a simple matter to put it back afterward im presently exploring who had the best opportunity not captain wilton i do hope rutledge answered reluctantly among others yes the palace will have a collective stroke if word of that leaks out for gods sake say nothing until youre absolutely sure which is why i need more time rutledge pointed out reasonably can we afford to make a mistake either way very well but keep me informed will you ive got people breathing down my neck i can go out on a limb for you at the moment but well need something soon or heads may start to roll mine among them yes i understand ill call you on monday morning at the latest he waited let the silence drag on but bowles had finished and cut the connection rutledge hung up unable to see the pleased smile at the other end of the line as bowles replaced the receiver the situation in warwickshire in bowless opinion was progressing exactly as he had planned still turning their conversation over in his mind rut ledge told himself that the exchange had gone well enough the yard wanted answers yes but it was also prepared to accept his judgment in the field rather than forcing him into hasty decisions a sign that nothing had been held back intentionally badly needed encouragement then whether the yard realized it or nothe should feel only a sense of relief but hamish who had a knack for cutting to the heart of rutledges moods asked softly why hasnt he asked about hickam then stopping by warrens surgery as he walked toward the inn rutledge asked the housekeeper for a report on hickam hes still alive if thats any help but he just lays there for all the world a dead man do you want to know what i think she gave him a penetrating look hes gone away so far back into that mad war he came from that he cant find his way home again while hes there on the bed not moving not seeing not hearing i keep wondering whats happening inside his head where we cant follow him god only knows rutledge answered her not wanting to think about it she frowned do you suppose hes afraid i watched him on the street sometimes and saw the anger in him and the strangeness that unsettled everybodywell of course it was unsettling we didnt know what to do about it whether to ignore him or shout at him or lock him up but when he was sober i saw the fear too and that worried me id not like to think that wherever hes gone hes taken the fear with him as well as the horrors of the war when he cant move he cant run from it rutledge considered her i dont know he told her honestly youre probably the only person in the town who cares ive seen too much suffering in my life not to recognize it even in a drunkard she said and that man suffered whatever he did in the war good or evil hes paid for it every hour since youll remember that wont you when and if you can talk to him i dont suppose you were in the war but pity is something even a policeman ought to understand and like him or not that man deserves pity she grasped the door firmly ready to shut it her face suddenly still as if she regretted offering opinions to a stranger call again after dinner if you want i dont expect hell come around before then if he comes around at all her voice was crisp again businesslike it wont do any good to try before that mind she closed the door leaving him standing there on the pavement hamish stirring again said if he dies and its proved you gave him the money that brought him to his grave a man with your past what do you suppose theyll do to you it will be the end of my career if not worse hamish chuckled a cold bitter sound but no firing squad you remember those now dont you the armys way of doing things a cold gray dawn before the sun rises because no man wants to see a shameful death that bleak hour of morning when the soul shrivels inside you and the heart has no courage and the body shrinks with terror you remember those dont you a pity id thought to remind you but rutledge was striding toward the inn head down nearly blundering into a bicycle ignoring the woman who hastily moved out of his path and the voice of someone saying his name the world had narrowed down to the agony that drove him and the memories that devoured him back in france back to the final horror the disintegration of all he had been and might be in the face of blazing guns the machine gunner was still there and the main assault was set for dawn he had to be stopped before then rut ledge sent his men across again calling to them as he ran and watched them fall his sergeant the first to go down watched the remnants turn and stagger back to their lines through the darkness cursing savagely eyes wild with pain and fury its no the dying its the waste corporal macleod screamed at him leaping back into the trench faces turning his way if they want it taken out so badly let them shell it rutledge pistol in hand shouted if we dont silence it hundreds of men will dieits our lot coming we cant let them walk into that i wont go backyou can shoot me here i wont go back i wont take another man across that line never again as gods my witness i tell you theres no choice he looked at the mutiny in the wild eyes surrounding him looked at the desolation of spirit in weary stooped shoulders and forced himself to ruthless anger theres never a choice aye man theres a choice the corporal turned and pointed to the dead and dying caught in a nomansland between the gunner and the lines but thats coldblooded murder and ill no be a part of it again never again he was tall and thin and very young burned out by the fighting battered and torn by too many offenses and too many retreats by blood and terror and fear tormented by a strong calvinistic sense of right and wrong that somehow survived through it all it wasnt courage he lacked rutledge knew him too well to think him a coward he had quite simply brokenbut others had seen it there was nothing rut ledge could do for him now too many lives were at stake to let one more stand in the way grief vied with anger and neither won hed had hamish macleod arrested on the spot and then hed led the last charge out into the icy slippery mud challenging them to let him do it alone and theyd followed in a straggle and somehow the gun had been silenced and there was nothing left afterward but to see to the firing party then hed sat with hamish throughout what was left of that long night listening to the wind blowing snow against the huts theyd somehow rigged in the trenches listening to hamish talk a hideously long night it had left him drained beyond exhaustion and at the end of it hed said ill give you a second chancego out there and tell them you were wrong and hamish had shaken his head eyes dark with fear but steadfast no i havent got any strength left end it while im still a man for gods sake end it now the shelling had started down the line when rutledge summoned six men to form the firing party it rocked the earth shook men to their souls pounding through the brain with a storm of sound until there was no thought left hed had to shout had to drag them reluctant unwilling through the falling snow had to position them and will them to do his bidding and then hed gone to fetch hamish one last time hed said it isnt too late man and hamish had smiled is it my death youre fearing then i dont see why theyll all die before this days out whats one more bloody corpse on your soul or do you worry ill haunt you is it that damn you do your dutyrejoin your men the sergeants dead theyll need you the push will come in less than an hour but without me id rather die now than go out there ever again he shivered shrugging deeper into his greatcoat it was the darkness that blinded them and the snow but dawn would come soon enough and rutledge had no choice the example had to be made one way or another he took hamishs arm and led him up the slick creaking steps and to the narrow level place where men gathered before an assault do you want a blindfold he had had to bring his mouth to hamishs ear to be heard he was shaking with cold they both were no and for the love of god untie me rutledge hesitated then did as he asked there was a rumble of voices strangely audible below the deafness of the shelling watchers he couldnt see somewhere behind the firing party the six men didnt look around standing close together for comfort rutledge fumbled in his pocket and found an envelope to mark the center of hamishs breast moving by rote not thinking at all he pinned it to the mans coat looked into those steady eyes a last time then stepped away he could hear hamish praying breathless words and then a girls name rutledge raised his hand dropped it sharply there was an instant in which he thought the men wouldnt obey him relief leaping fiercely through him and then the guns blazed too bright in the darkness and the snow he turned looked for hamish for a moment he could see nothing and then he found the dark huddled body he was on the ground rutledge reached him in two swift strides barely aware of the shifting of the noises around him the firing party had melted away quickly awkward and ashamed kneeling he could see that in spite of the white square on the mans breast the shots had not entirely found their mark hamish was bleeding heavily and still alive blood leaked from his mouth as he tried to speak eyes dark pools in his white strained face agony written in the depths begging the shelling was coming closerno the germans were responding rapidly shifting their range some falling short but rutledge knelt there in the dirty snow trying to find the words to ask forgiveness hamishs hand clutched at his arm a death grip and the eyes begged without mercy for either of them rutledge drew his pistol placed it at hamishs temple and he could have sworn that the grimacing lips tried to smile the fallen man never spoke and yet inside rutledges skull hamish was screaming end it for pitys sake the pistol roared the smell of the powder and blood enveloping rutledge the pleading eyes widened and then went dark still empty accusing and the next german shell exploded in a torrent of heat and light searing his sight before the thick viscous unspeakable mud rose up like a tidal wave to engulf him rutledges last coherent thought as he was swallowed into black smothering eternity was direct hitoh god if onlya little soonerit would have been over for both of us and afterwardafterward london had given him a bloody medal it was an hour or more later that rutledge walked down the stairs to the dining room for his lunch he wasnt sure how he had reached the inn how hed made it to his room whom he might have encountered on the way it had been the worst flash of memory hed suffered since he left the hospital and it had unnerved him shaken his fragile grip on stability but as the doctor had promised him in the end it had passed leaving him very tired very empty bracing himself as he opened the french doors he was prepared for redfern to comment or worse still for the other diners to stare at him in speculation and disgust but the room was nearly empty and redfern had a tight inward look about his eyes the limp was more pronounced as he came to take rutledges order and he leaned against the table been on it too much he said aware of rutledges perception then he shrugged its the stairs that are the worst the doctors say it will pass in time but he sounded dejected as if he had stopped believing in them rutledge spent what was left of the afternoon talking to inspector forrest in his office about the names in his notebook it was better than being alone better than letting hamish reach him again too soon and it was a way of thinking aloud that might lead to something that the local man knew and he didnt an idle hope he realized when hed finished and forrest sat there in silence reflectively scratching his chin and staring at the ceiling as if half expecting to find an answer written there what do you think rutledge repeated trying to keep his impatience out of his voice none of them is likely to be your murderer forrest said unwittingly emphasizing your as if setting himself apart from the whole business take miss wood for a start ive never seen a cross word pass between her and the colonel no nor ever heard of one and hed have given her whatever she wanted thered be no need for trouble over it what if she wanted what he couldnt give her forrest laughed and what would that be i cant think of a thing she didnt already have shes a lovely girl nothing mean or selfish or strongheaded about her well then wilton he was marrying the girl the surest way to lose her would be doing a harm to the colonel much less killing him here just before the wedding it would be insanity and what if they did argue the night before the murder what if it is true you cant make much out of thatnot enough for murder if you ask me not without more evidence than weve got then why wont wilton come straight out with the truth and tell me what caused the quarrel forrest shrugged it could be something that happened in france something only the two of them know about maybe something that captain wilton thinks the colonel wouldnt want known even after his death a personal matter yes thats what he said rutledge replied and got up to pace unable to sit still while he talked but we dont know do we and as long as we dont i intend to keep the quarrel in mind mrs davenant a very well respected lady she wouldnt be very likely to have a hand in murder and what reason could she have for it anyway i dont know was she ever in love with the colonel or with wilton theres never been a hint of gossip if she was in love with anyone but her husband she kept it to herself and somehow i cant picture her stalking the colonel with a loaded shotgun in her hand if she was jealous of lettice wood killing the colonel wouldnt help her any unless the captainor lettice woodwas blamed for it if the captains blamed for it shes going to lose him to the hangman isnt she and i cant see how shed put the blame onto miss wood besides if there was any real threat to miss wood i can see wilton stepping in and saying it was his doing the colonels deathto protect the girl and mrs davenant ought to know that as well as i do it would be a risk wouldnt it one shed have to consider and catherine tarrant forrest was suddenly wary whats she got to do with this then i know about the german linden she wanted to marry him and she wanted harris to clear the way for them instead linden was taken away and he died women have killed for less and what she felt for linden wasnt a girls infatuation it was passionate and real youre on the wrong track miss tarrant might have wanted somebody else to suffer too once she found out what had happened to the germanshe was that upset yes ill grant you that much but you dont bide your time you dont wait for a year or two not when you feel the way she did then you come in a rage for revenge hot and furious then you think shes capable of seeking revenge forrest flushed dont put words into my mouth where catherine tarrant is concerned i said she was that hurt she might have done something foolish straightaway out of sheer mad grief and shock but not murder rutledge studied him you like her dont you you dont want to think of her as a killer forrest answered stiffly ive always been fond of the girl theres nothing wrong in that and you dont know how people in upper streetham shunned her when they found out about her and the german treated her like dirt the lot of them my wife among them as if shed done something unforgivable how did they find out about linden i never did learn how but i had my suspicions she tried to move heaven and earth to find out where theyd sent the german and people started to talk gossip speculation but nothing anybody could pin the truth on so i think carfield was to blamehe was in warwick when she came back from london on the train and he offered to drive her home she was half sick with griefshe may have blurted out the whole story without thinking and hes one to pry he could have gotten around her at any rate he made some pious remarks on the next sunday about loving our enemies and healing the wounds of war just when the reality of the war was coming home to all of us the cripples and the wounded and the dead and the next thing i knew the story was racing all over upper streetham that catherine had been expecting to marry the prisoner only hed died that there had been something between them that shed even slept with him and the damage was done ive heard carfield was courting lettice wood oh yes indeed hed have liked to marry the colonels wardbut how much he cared for miss wood is anybodys guess there are those would say it was little enough that he isnt capable of loving anybody but himself and its true ive never seen a man so set on his own comfort his mouth turned down in distaste all right hes a man of god but i dont like him i never have royston what do you know about him a good man hardworking reliable there was a time when he sowed his share of wild oats his place at mallows going to his head a bit and he was one for the girls too but he settled down and got on with his life soon enough forrest smiled well were none of us free of that charge nothing between him and the colonel that you know about which might have led to murder i cant think of any reason for mr royston to shoot anybody he hasnt married hes married to mallows you might say there was a girl years back when he was about twentysix or seven alice netherby a lower streetham lass pretty as they come and sweet with it but frail she died of consumption and that was that hes always gotten on very well with catherine tarrant but hes not her sort if you know what i mean a countryman and shes a lady a famous artist ive a cousin living in london he says her works all the rage which brings us back to mavers doesnt it aye forrest answered with regret and it doesnt seem very likely that well prove anything against him worst luck the interview with forrest left rutledge feeling dissatisfied a mood reinforced by an encounter with mavers on his way back to the inn you dont look like a successful man mavers said his goats eyes gleaming with maliciousness youve got my shotgun but you havent got me and you wont mark my words ive got witnesses as many as you like so you keep reminding me rutledge said taking his own malicious pleasure in the sight of maverss swollen nose i wonder why because i enjoy seeing the oppressors of the masses oppressed in their turn and you might say that i have an interest in this businessa professional interest you could even call it rutledge studied him you enjoy trouble thats all the fact is i like to think i can take some of the credit for the colonels death that all those hours of standing in the market square speaking out against the landlords and capitalistswhile those village fools reviled mewerent wasted who knows i might have put the idea into some mind the first glimmer of the rising to come and the salvation of the masses from the tyranny of the few he cocked his head considering the possibility aye who knows it might just have its roots in my words the colonels killing which makes you an accessory i think but it wont stand up in a court of law will it i bid you a good daybut i hope you wont be having one he started to walk off pleased with himself rutledge stopped him mavers you said something the other day about your pension is that how you live a pension mavers turned around aye the wages of guilt thats all it is and who pays you the grin widened thats for me to know and you to discover if you can youre the man from london sent here to set us all straight there was a little dogcart standing in the road outside the inn when rutledge strode up the steps and redfern came to meet him in the hall hastily wiping his hands on a towel miss sommers sir ive put her in the back parlor second door beyond the stairs has she been here long not above half an hour sir i brought her tea when she said shed wait awhile rutledge went down the passage to the small back parlor and opened the door it was a pleasant room paneled walls and drapes faded to mellow rose at the long windows there was a writing desk in one corner several chairs covered in shades of rose and green and a small tea cart on wheels helena sommers stood back straight at one of the windows which overlooked a tiny herb garden busy with bees she turned at the sound of someone at the door and said hallo maggie told me you wanted to see me strangers at the house make her uncomfortable so i thought it best to come into town rutledge waited until she sat down in one of the chairs and then took another across from her its about captain wilton the morning you saw him from the ridge the morning of the murder yes of course what was he carrying carrying she seemed perplexed a rucksack a stick anything helena frowned thinking back he had his walking stick well he always does and that morning was no different from the other times ive glimpsed him nothing else youre quite sure should he have had something else were trying to be thorough thats all she studied him youre asking me arent you if the captain carried a shotgun has your investigation narrowed down to him why on earth would he kill colonel harris the captain was marrying the colonels ward wilton was there not a mile from the meadow shortly before the murder we have reason to think he wasnt on the best of terms with colonel harris that morning and so the captain marched up the hill hoping to run into charles harris carrying a shotgun through the town with him in the unlikely event hed have an opportunity to use it thats absurd rutledge was very tired hamish was growling restlessly at the back of his mind again why is it absurd he snapped someone killed the colonel i assure you weve got a body thats quite dead and quite clearly murdered yes i understand that she said gently seeming to understand too his frustration but whynecessarilyis the murderer someone in upper streetham colonel harris served in a regiment on active duty he was in france for five years and weve no idea what went on in his life during the war the people he met the things that might have happened the soldiers who died or were crippled because of his orders if i wanted revengeand expected to get away with it of courseid shoot the man on his home ground but not on mine you can take a train to warwick from anywhere in britain then walk to upper streetham carrying a shotgun she was momentarily at a loss then rallied no certainly not not out in the open but people do have things they carry without arousing suspicion a workman with his kit of tools salesmen with sample cases whatever and you dont wonder whats inside do you when you see someone carrying something that belongs with him you assume dont you that its all aboveboard rutledge nodded grudgingly she was right im not suggesting that it happened this way im merely pointing out that mark wilton needed a very powerful reason to kill his fiancees guardian practically on the eve of their wedding and he had heard lettice only hours ago putting off the marriage because she was in mourning it made sense what helena sommers had said and it gave him a very sound excuse for ignoring hickams statement but her argument also left him with the whole of england to choose from and nothing to go on in the way of motive or evidence bowles would not be happy over that helena seemed to appreciate his dilemma she said ruefully im sorry i have no business interjecting my views im an outsider here i dont know any of these people very well but i have met them and id hate to think one of them is a murderer not someone i know surely you must have heard that often enough he had but he answered i suppose its human nature as the clock in the other parlor began to chime the hour she got up quickly ive been away longer than i intended maggie will be wondering whats become of me i must go hesitating she added ive never been to war of course and i know nothing about it except what one reads in the news accounts but colonel harris must have had to do many things as an officer that he as a man wouldnt care to talk aboutwas ashamed of even when you find his murderer you may discover that his death has its roots in the war not in the affairs of anyone we know the war but if she was right the war also brought him full circle to mark wilton who had known harris in france or to catherine tarrant when hed seen helena to the dogcart and watched the haldane pony trot off down the main street rutledge went back to the station to rout out sergeant davies he sent him off to warwick to find out if he could about anyone who had arrived there by train shortly before the murder and come on to upper streetham a wildgoose chase sergeant davies thought sourly as he set out he knew his own ground and there hadnt been any unexplained strangers in upper streetham or even in lower streetham for that matterbefore during or after the killing except for that dead lorry driver whod been accounted for there were always eyes to see ears to hear if anyone passed through and news of it reached him directly or indirectly within a matter of hours strangers stood out nobody liked them and word was passed on but going to warwick waste of time though it was kept him out of the inspectors clutches and that counted for something as he was finishing his dinner rutledge looked up to see mark wilton standing out in the hall of the inn the captain saw him at the same time and crossed the dining room to rutledges table ive come to speak to you about the inquest and the release of the body i was just on my way out to see dr warren but that can wait can i offer you a drink in the bar thanks they went through to the public bar which was half empty and found a table in one corner rutledge ordered two whiskeys and sat down the inquest will be at ten oclock i dont expect it will last more than half an hour after that you can speak to the undertakers have you seen the body wilton asked curiously three days after death i didnt expect it to tell me very much i wasnt there to see it in place which is what counts i was there before they moved it half the town came to look i couldnt believe he was dead not after going through the war unscathed oddly enough thats what royston said wilton nodded you sometimes meet people who appear to have charmed lives there was a pilot in my outfit who was at best a mediocre flier shouldnt have lasted a month but he was the damnedest luckiest devil ive ever known invisible in the air the germans never could see him for some reason and hed find the field in any weather instinct almost crashed five times and walked away with no more than a few bruises id thought of charles as having a charmed life too i knew my own chances for surviving were slim but wed plan to meet charles and i in paris on our next leave and i always knew hed be there waiting whatever happened to me wilton shrugged that was comforting in a strange waycertainty in the midst of chaos i suppose rutledge knew what he meant there had been a sergeant in one company who always came back and brought his men back with him and men wanted to serve with him because of that the sergeants reputation spread across the front and someone would say it was a bad night but morgan made it pass the word along a talismanbad as the assault was it hadnt been bad enough to stop morgan hed asked the sergeant once how hed managed it when he ran into him on a mudswallowed road out in the middle of nowhere moving up for the next offensive and morgan had smiled now then sir if you believe anything hard enough he said you can make it happen but by that time rutledge had lost his own will to believe in anything and morgans secret wasnt any help to him he often wondered what had become of the man after the war wilton looked at the light through his glass almost as if it held answers as well as liquid amber then said quietly i was as surprised as anybody when i made it through to the end of the war rutledge nodded in understanding he himself had gone from being terrified hed die to not caring either way and then to the final stage wishing it would happen bringing him to a peace that was more desirable than life itself returning to charles harris as if he found murder an easier subject than war memories wilton cleared his throat and went on as i said i had to see for myself my first thought was my god lettice and my second was i still dont believe its true he stopped sorry you can ignore that he went on when rutledge made no comment i wasnt trying to sway your judgment no wilton took a deep breath i hear that hickam is dead drunk at dr warrens or ill the story varies depending on which gossip you listen to what else does gossip say that you havent found much to go on that youre floundering in the dark but thats not true i know whats in the back of your mind he smiled wryly if you didnt kill harris who did the comfortable answer would be mavers wouldnt it why not hickam who claims he saw you speaking to harrisarguing heatedly with him in his wordsin the lane why isnt it possible that he knew where to find a shotgun and decided in that confused mind of his that he was off to shoot the boche or to kill an officer he hated he wouldnt be the first enlisted man to do that in fact he might just as easily have chosen you as his target as charles harris a tossup given his drunken state the look of stark surprise on wiltons face was quickly covered but it told rutledge one thingthat hickams story might very well be true that hed seen the captain and the colonel quarreling for wilton had taken the bait without even questioning it hed immediately recognized the twist that could be put on hickams evidence and his mind had been busily considering that possibility just as alarm bells had gone off reminding him thatin his own statement hickam hadnt witnessed any meeting at all angry or not i suppose id never thought he was capable of such a thing mark answered lamely shellshockedmad perhapsbut not particularly dangerous feeling his way carefully he added and it probably wouldnt matter whether he actually saw charles that morning or just thought he did well it does make a certain sense out of this business i cant imagine anyone in his right mind shooting charles it would have to be a mavers or a hickam which was all very interesting taking another shot in the dark rutledge said tell me about catherine tarrant wilton shook his head no it was quiet firm irreversible he emptied his glass and set it down you knew her well when you were in upper streetham before the war you were in fact in love with her no i thought i was in love with her but her father was wise enough to see that it wouldnt do and he asked us to wait a year or two before we came to any formal understanding he turned in his chair easing his stiff knee and he was right a few months apart a dozen letters on each side and we soon discovered that they were getting harder and harder to write i think we both realized what was happening but there was never any formal ending the letters got shorter then further apart im still quite fond of catherine tarrant i admire her and i like her work was she painting then there was a clatter in the kitchens someone dropping a tray and then redferns voice sharply taking whoever it was to task oddly enough nobody seemed to recognize how talented she was yes shed mention something about a painting but you know how it was before the war most wellbred girls tried their hand at watercolors or musicit was rather expected of them rutledge recalled his sisters lessons and smiled frances could sing beautifully but her watercolors had generally been a welter of slapdash color sent running over the paper with an enthusiastic and generous hand not one to his certain knowledge had ever seen a frame she had studied assiduously searching for subjects and giving grandiose names to her work but her teacher had finally written miss rut ledge makes up in spirit what she lacks in talent and to everyones relief the lessons had ended there wilton was saying and no one thought anything about it when catherine said im doing a portrait of that old woman who used to milk cows for us remember her shes got a wonderful face he glanced wryly at rutledge least of all me i wasnt interested in anything that didnt have wings to it but that one later won a prize in london when i went to her first exhibit i was stunned i wondered where in gods name catherine had found such power of expression such depth of feeling how shed come to change so much in such a short time but she hadnt changedit was there all along and apparently id been blind to it i suppose thats the difference between infatuation and love if you come down to it and linden had he brought any of these changes about found the woman somewhere inside the sweet untouched girl youd met before the war wiltons mouth was grim ive told you ask miss tarrant about her personal life then you disapproved of the affair i was in france trying to stay alive i couldnt have approved or disapproved i didnt know until much later in fact it was charles who told me the first time he brought me down to mallows he thought i should be aware of it before i ran into her but catherine has never spoken of linden to me did she blame colonel harris for not handling their case properly with the army or blame lettice for not making it clear to her guardian that catherine was serious about this man i dont know i tell you except that charles would have done what he could if hed known for catherines sake if nothing else hed been fond of her but he didnt know i cant answer that i can tell you his headquarters was swamped with peoples letters wanting news about their sons their husbands their lovers he said once it was the hardest part of his job reading such letters sometimes they were sent to the wrong place or lost surely not a letter from his ward that wouldnt have been shoved in a sack with dozens of others and forgotten this time wilton stood up youre putting words into my mouth rutledge i dont know what went wrong over linden i dont suppose anyone does im sure that charles would have done his best for the pair of them he would try to help catherine my god he did what he could for anyone in upper streetham in one way or another so why not her what the war office did is anybodys guess some ignorant fool sitting at a cluttered desk in whitehall might have felt it his personal duty to prevent any relationship between prisoners and the home population whatever the colonel said about it bad for morale and all that and come to that it wouldnt have mattered the war was nearly over and if hed lived linden could have spoken for himself who could have guessed that linden would die of influenza still it decimated the country for gods sake no one was immune but because he was sent from here he died alone and no one told catherine not until long afterward wilton laughed harshly in war you cant keep up with every poor sod you send out to die i was a squadron leader i knew the hell of that a mans blown to bits in a trench shot down in flames chokes on gas and lies rotting in the mud you do your best you write letters about his bravery how much hed done for his country how much his comrades looked to him for an exampleand you dont even recall his name much less his face linden took his chances like any soldier at least she knows what became of him where hes buried rutledge watched his face remembering how catherine tarrant had looked when she spoke of searching for linden and remembering what sally davenant had said about wiltons love of flying changing to agony in the heat of battle and death and fear thats cold comfort to a grieving passionate woman is it after all the killing i came home to a heros welcome safe and whole invited to the palace and to sandring ham treated like royalty myself but i was there in a hospital in dorset when they brought in a man theyd found wandering in france didnt even know who he was whether he was british or germana shell of a man starving and begging on the roadside for a year or more more animal than human worse than hickam and i looked at him and thought i used to have nightmares about burning to death in a crash but there are worse things than that worse than being blind or without a limb lungs seared with gas face shot away guts rotted coming home safeand not knowing its over thats the bleakest hell im capable of picturing rutledge felt the blood run cold in his body wilton nodded and walked away unaware of what hed done in the dark recesses of his mind he heard hamish laughing and finished his whiskey at a gulp it burned going down almost bringing tears to his eyes as he fought to keep from choking or were the tears for himself think of anything he commanded himself roughly anything but that his mind roiled with emotion then settled into the dull pain of grief and despair think man for gods sake what was it theyd been talking about no who catherine tarrant what to do about catherine tarrant then how to find a key to her waving redfern away and getting to his feet the whiskey still searing his throat he walked out of the bar the person to answer that question was another woman sally davenant the next morning just before the inquest rutledge had an opportunity to ask inspector forrest if he knew the source of maverss pension but forrest shook his head i didnt know he had one but that explains why hes never had to lift his hand to a stroke of work if he didnt feel like it his father served the davenants ask mrs davenant if she knows anything about it the inquest held in one of the inns parlors was crowded with a crosssection of spectators who settled in early for the best seats and waited with patient expectation for something interesting to happen they quietly took note of who was and was notpresent and wondered aloud how the man from london would present his findings and more importantly what they would be no one knew anything about an arrestnever a good signbut rumor claimed that sergeant davies had spent most of the night in warwick and this could mean that the killer hadnt been an upper streetham man after all more than a few had pinned their hopes on bert mav ers such expectations were destined for disappointment the coroners court progressed with smooth timeliness from the finding of the body to the request for an adjournment while the police pursued their inquiries half an hour and it was finished the coroner an elderly man from warwick agreed to the police request stood up with decision and said thats it then before nodding to forrest and walking out to find his carriage a murmur of dissatisfaction trailed him like ghostly robes as he went sergeant davies had returned from warwick around six oclock that morning since he had to give evidence about finding the colonels body it had been a long night he was tired and irritable and his trip had been for nothing theres no reason to believe the killer came on the trains he said all strangers are accounted for and there arent any reports of stragglers along the road from warwick thats not to say someone couldnt have come from another direction but id give you any odds you like that he didnt arrive from warwick which was more or less what rutledge had expected he thanked the sergeant and then hurried to catch up with sally davenant who was walking along with another woman dark haired and neatly dressed in gray they parted just as rutledge reached them and sally turned to him smiling politely good morning inspector it was a beautiful morning the sky that particular shade of blue that comes only in june the air was scented with roses wild in the hedgerows and blooming in gardens birds everywhere children laughing not a day to consider the ramifications of a mans death id like to speak with you he said may i offer you a cup of tea yes id like one after that ordeal she turned to walk with him back toward the shepherds crook i only came for marks sake im glad you didnt require lettices presence mark says shes had a very rough time refusing to be drawn rutledge said i wanted to ask you about mavers about a pension he may have received from your husband or rather a pension that might have been left to his father as the shotgun was sally frowned i dont know anything about a pension inspector hugh had a very high regard for the mans father he was dependable honest and knew his job quite different from his son in every respect i can tell you hugh had no such regard for the mavers youve met yet he left him a shotgun he left it to the father and no one ever thought to change that article in the will when the will was read i made no objection to letting the shotgun go to the son because it was easier at the time than trying to fight over it i had many problems with my husband inspector he was a man who could charm anyone but he wasnt easy to live with that doesnt mean i didnt love himi did but his death was a difficult time for me emotionally i was torn between grief and relief to be honest and the problem of dealing with someone like mavers was beyond me id never have heard the end of it anyway whatever the lawyers promised and i wasnt going to put up with a lifelong vendetta as charles did how that man endured the endless bickering and trouble ill never know probably because he was never here long enough to be driven crazy but i was you see when they were seated in the dining room where redfern was trying to keep up with the demand for refreshment rut ledge ordered tea then said to mrs davenant what can you tell me about catherine tarrant her surprise showed in her face catherine whatever does she have to do with charless death i dont know id like a womans opinion of her sally davenant laughed wryly ah yes the men flock to her defense dont they i dont know why not that they shouldnt you understand she added quickly its just that men and women see things quite differently which still told him very little about catherine when the tea things had been set before them and sally had poured rutledge tried again did you know the german linden as a matter of fact i did he worked on her land and several times when i went to call he came around to take my horse tall fair quite strong she hesitated then added he was a little like mark you know i dont know quite how to put my finger on the likeness id never have mistaken one for the other but a fleeting resemblancesomething you felt rather than saw rutledge said nothing reaching for one of the little cakes on a goldrimmed china plate they were amazingly good he discovered after a moment she went on he was an educated man a solicitor i was told laterand in the ordinary way an acceptable suitor if hed been one of the refugees belgian or french there wouldnt have been any comment at all well very little but he was german you see those horrible monsters who shot edith cavell spitted babies on their bayonets killed and maimed british soldiersthe casualty lists were awful and when they came out you sighed with relief because someone you loved or knew wasnt on it this time then felt guilty for feeling relieved we hated the germans and to think of loving oneof marrying oneseemedun natural a woman coming through the dining room spoke to sally and walked on rutledge waited until she was out of hearing i understood that no one knew of their relationship at the time linden was taken away thats true but there was no doubt how catherine felt after the war she went a little mad trying to find him and then when she learned he was dead she was hardly herself for months carfield made matters worse by trying to make them better and the town has shunned her ever since most of the women and more than a few of the men wont even speak her name you said that linden reminded you of mark did he remind catherine too was she do you think still in love with mark sally davenant shook her head no that was over long ago i could have told you at the time that it wouldnt last mark always falls in love with the wrong women she stopped her mouth closing firmly her eyes defying him rutledge waited she shrugged after a moment and went on i didnt mean that the way it sounds of course but he thought she had what did you mean catherine hadnt discovered her talent when she met mark she painted yes but it wasnt the focus of her life if you see what i mean i think it would have come between them when she did and she hated his flying even if the war hadnt come along to separate them what chance would such a marriage have carfield came in smiled warmly at mrs davenant then nodded briskly to rutledge and lettice she hesitated then answered carefully i dont think it would have worked not in the end there was charles you see and lettice was devoted to him no man enjoys living in the shadow of such a devotion if hed been older yes mark could have relegated him to the fathers role mark could never bear to be second best it would have been charles this and charles that every time he turned around did lettice fall in love with wilton because he was the handsome hero her guardian had brought home for her an infatuation like catherines years ago no of course not shes rather mature for her years have you noticed probably it has to do with being orphaned so young she had to learn to be independent early on charles more or less cultivated that too well he could have been killed at any time and he wanted her to be capable of carrying on alone she wasnt a dewyeyed girl and i think thats what attracted mark to her hes been through too much to fall in love with a silly twit who thought he was dashing and exciting and mark is a very private man he would have to be to spend so much time alone in the air charles seemed soopen where hugh had devastating charm shallow though it was charles was the mosti dont know the most physically compelling man he could walk into a room and somehow dominate it just by being there men deferred to him women found him sympathetic that combination of strength and tenderness thats quite rare but of the three mark wilton was surely the most attractive she laughed as she poured herself another cup of tea then refilled his cup oh by far if he came in here right now every woman in the room would be aware of it and preen ive seen it happen too many times hugh had charm mark has looks charles had charisma the difference is that hugh and charles knew how to wield what theyd been given mark isnt a peacock and never has been its his greatest failing people expect too much from beauty which is why you feel he couldnt have lived in charles harriss shadow of course i think thats why he never fell in love with mehugh was one of those men who dominated with charm to tell you the truth hugh used it as a weapon to have his own way sending you to the skies one minute tearing your heart out the next and although i was close to hating him at the end it was too late id lost the ability to trust id have made a shrew of a wife for mark wilton and he knew it the words were said lightly with a smile but there was pain behind them in her eyes and in her voice rutledge heard it but his mind was occupied by what shed told him the first day hed spoken to herthat mark wilton would have been a fool to harm lettices guardian it was the surest way to lose her and yet just now shed contradicted that whether she had realized it or not shed given him a motive for murdernot her own motive but mark wiltons unless you turned it the other way aboutand asked yourself if the most complete revenge was to destroy all three of them lettice charles and the captain in one single bloody act whose repercussions would leave lettice as alone and empty as sally davenant herself could she also have betrayed catherine and her german lover women often sensed such thingshis sister frances always knew before the gossips what the latest scandal was almost as if she heard his thoughts sally said quietly but you wanted to hear about catherine not me her father taught her to shoot you know if shed wanted to shoot charles shed have known how to go about it but why now why after all this time id always thought of her as hot blooded to paint like that not coldblooded she let the thought trail off it was a wearing day hickam was still too ill to question and dr warren was testy from lack of sleep a child he was tending was dying and he didnt know why when rutledge tried to prod him over hickam he said come with me and see this child and then tell me damn you that hickams life is worth hers so rutledge went back to the meadow walking up and down it trying to see the murder the frightened horse the falling man he tried to feel the hatred that had led to murder worked out angles to see how the horseman and the killer had come together here in this one spot how long had the killer waited how sure had he been that charles harris would come this way had he known somehow where the colonel was riding that morning which would bring suspicion back to royston surely or lettice unless before the quarrel something had been said over dinner about his plans and wilton had remembered or perhaps the killer had simply followed harris from the lane wilton again or hickam what would bring catherine tarrant out so early on that particular june morning shotgun in hand murder on her mind or mrs davenant the damnable thing was except for catherine tarrants dead lover and mark wiltons quarrel and possibly mrs davenants jealousy there was nothing to make colonel harris a target not if mavers was out of the running and rutledge had to admit there was too little chance there of proving opportunity why couldnt he get a grip on the emotions of this case because there was something he hadnt learned questions he should have asked and hadnt relationships he hadnt found or because his own ragged emotions kept getting in his way why had he lost that strong vein of intuition that once had made him particularly good at understanding why the victim had to die at understanding why one human being had been driven to kill another was it lost innocence the knowledge that he himself was now no better than the killers he hunted no longer siding with the angels cut off from what he once had been he laughed sourly maybe it had only been a trick a game he was good at when he could stand back dispassionately from the searing flame of emotions a trick hed used so often hed come to believe in it himself he could hardly bring back an image of the man hed been in a realist hed told himself then accustomed to the darkest corners of human experience well hed discovered in the trenches of france that hell itself was not half so frightening as the darkest corners of the human mind not that it mattered all they expected of him now was that he do his job no frills no flamboyance no magicians artifice just answers if he couldnt do his job what would he do with his life he began to walk making his way from the meadow down to mallows trying to think which way the horse might have come what path had led harris here but that didnt work did it if harris had been in the lane speaking to wilton he must have been returning to mallows not starting out on his ride and why hadnt let tice chosen to go riding with her guardian that morning why had she said with such pain i didnt go riding with him as if in her mind this time had been somehow different he walked on following the contour of the land using his sense of direction to lead him toward the house in the distance he could see the chimneys of the cottage the two som mers women had rented for the summer and from one particular spot the church steeple rising among the treetops marking the village could you also see this part of mallows land from the church tower it was an interesting thought and farther along the distant rooftops of mallows itself and the stables what could be seen of the hillside from that vantage point could you follow colonel harriss progress and be certain of meeting him at one particular place or had the encounter been happenstance no because the killer had come armed ready to kill skirting the plowed fields where new growth was dark green and strong he found the orchards and the stile and a shrubbordered path at a fork that divided into one path of hardpacked earth pointing in the direction of the stables and sheds the other paved now and passing through a hedge to the landscaped grounds he came first to the kitchen gardens the herbs the flowers for cutting and then the formal beds that marked the lawns sure of his way now rutledge strode around a hedge badly startling a gardener on his knees in a patch of vegetables the man scrambled to his feet pulled off his cap and stared rutledge smiled ive come to see mr royston ihes not at home sir mr royston isnt he hasnt come back from the inquest that i know then ill go along to the house and wait thank you he nodded and the gardener stood staring after him perspiration unheeded running into the frown lines on his sunred forehead rutledge crossed the lawns to the drive and rang the bell finding himself asking to see lettice not laurence royston to rutledges surprise lettice wood asked him to come up to the small sitting room and was waiting for him there in the sunlight from the windows the inquest is over miss wood he said formally i havent any information to give you no i can see that she told him quietly gesturing for him to be seated there was a large crystal bowl of flowers on the table from sally davenants gardens or from mallows next to the severe black of her mourning the colors were richly bright making her face all the paler is it so hard a thing to find a murderer sometimes when heor shedoesnt want to be found and the trail is cold as it were he sat down in the chair facing her back to the window her eyes were dark with pain have you seen mythe colonels body caught off guard he said no i havent neither have i she stopped i read a story once when i was a child it was about medieval norway or perhaps scotlandan outlandish place it sounded to me where people didnt behave as englishmen did there was a death in the village and the chief couldnt discover whod killed the person and so he ordered everyone who came to the funeral to walk past the bier where the body lay and put their hand on the wound everyone did and nothing happened but the chief wasnt satisfied and then he found a man hiding under an overturned boat he didnt want to see or touch the dead he was afraid of what might happen if he did afraid the wound would cry out and accuse him of a sin that had nothing to do with murder and so hed run away i was too young to understand when i read the story i thought the frightened man was wiser than the restnot to want to touch the dead she had been toying with a small silver box she had taken up from the table beside her now she looked up at him but i wanted to go to charles hold himtell him again that i loved himtell him goodbye thats when the doctor explained what had been done to him and now i cant bear the thought of iti cant bear to think of charles at all because when i do i see aa monster you cant imagine how guilty it makes me feelhow bereft of comfort of any kind rutledge remembered the first corpses hed seen in france obscene smelling things inhuman grotesques that haunted his dreams stiff awkward uglyyou couldnt feel compassion for them only disgust and the dreadful fear that youd turn out like them carted off in the back of a truck like boards death is seldom tidy he said after a moment sometimes for the very old perhaps nothing is finished by a murder whatever the killer may expect she shook her head laurence royston told me that he had killed a child once quite accidentally shed run in front of his motorcar there was nothing he could do it was over in an instant but he still remembers it quite vividly the faces of the parents the grief the small crumpled body two children playing a game and suddenly death she smiled wryly at rutledge it was meant to help me see that none of us is spared pain meant kindly hes a very kind man but it was small comfort a bird began to sing in the trees beyond an open window the sound was sweet liquid but oddly out of place as a background to a quiet discussion of death do you still wish to see charless murderer hang he watched her face lettice sighed and asked instead do you truly believe catherine tarrant could have killed him i dont know the field is still wide catherine tarrant mark wilton or mrs davenant royston hickam mavers she made a dismissive gesture then youve made no progress at all youre whistling in the dark you then he couldnt decide if the scent that wafted to him on the slight breeze coming in the window was her perfume or from the flowers me rutledge said only i must keep an open mind miss wood if i were planning to kill anyonefor any reasoni would not have used a shotgun not in the face there are many ways to kill he said thinking suddenly of jean cruelty will do very well her face flamed as if hed struck her on her feet in an instant she stood there poised to leave what are you talking about no i dont want to hear it pleasejust leave ive nothing more to say to you her odd eyes were alight with defensive anger giving her face a wild and passionate force do what you came to do and go back to london im sorrythat wasnt what i intended to he found himself apologizing quickly a hand out as if to stop her from ringing the bell for johnston hamish stirred shell enchant ye wait and see go while you can but rutledge paid him no heed look at this from my point of view he went on so far the best evidence i can find leads me to mark wilton i dont want to make a mistake i dont want to arrest him now and then have to let him go for lack of proof can you see what that could do to his life or yours if you marry him now or later chances are you knew charles harris as well if not better than anyone the man not the soldier not the landowner not the employer help me find the colonels killer if you loved him at all she stared at him still very angry but she hadnt rung the bell instead she walked with that long graceful stride toward the window swinging around making him turn as well to see her what is it you want then for me to damn someone else no just to help me see that last evening as clearly as i can i wasnt there when the quarrel began but you can judge what might have happened if i ask the right questions she didnt answer him and he made himself think clearly made himself consider what might have happened three women three men catherine tarrant lettice wood sally davenant charles harris mark wilton and a german called linden he hadnt found a link that satisfied him and yet there were ties between them of love and hate linden was dead harris was dead and if hickams testimony in court was damning enough wilton would be hanged the men gone all three of them which in a way brought him back again to catherine tar rant is it possible he began slowly that whatever they may have discussed just after you went up to your room your guardian and captain wilton argued that night over miss tarrant that somehow the subject of miss tarrantor linden for that mattercame up after theyd finished the discussion of the wedding the defensive barrier was there again she answered curtly i cant imagine what youre talking about why should theyve argued about catherine could the colonel have warned the captain that catherine tarrant still felt strongly about lindens death and was likely to do something rash to harm one of them to spoil the wedding perhaps could the captain have refused to hear anything said against her defended her and made harris very angry with him if charles had been worried he would have said something to me but he didnt but you didnt go riding with him that morning there was no opportunity to tell you what was on his mind she opened her mouth to say something and decided against it instead she replied youre chasing straws a witness saw them together still arguing that morning shortly before the colonel died if they werent arguing over the wedding then over what or over whom with her back to the windows her eyes shadowed by the halo of her dark hair she said youre the policeman arent you then what about mrs davenant sally what on earth does she have to do with anything shes very fond of her cousin your guardian might have worried about that or conversely mark wilton might have been jealous of the place harris held in your life lettice turned to the flowers in the vase her fingers moving over them as if she were blind and depended on touch to know what varieties were there if mark had wanted to marry sally he could have done it any time these last eight years when he had leave during the war she went to london to meet him hes fond of her of course he is hes fond of catherine tarrant as well as for charles mark knows how i feelfeltabout him she bit her lip no feel i wont put it in the past tense as if everything stopped with his death as if you stop caring stop giving someone a place in your life i want him back again so desperately i ache with it and yet im afraid to think about himi can only see that awful terrible thing she lifted her head forced back the tears do you dream of the corpses youve seen taken aback he said before he thought sometimes i dreamed about my parents after they died but i was too young to know what death was i saw them as shining angels floating about heaven and watching me to see if i was good in fact the first time i saw the venus above the hall here at mallows i thought it was my mother it was a great comfort oddly enough after a moment she said in a different voice youll have to chase your straws without me im sorry theres nothing else i can do this time he knew he had to go he stood up id like to question your staff again before i leave will you tell johnston that i have your permission question them then just put an end to this it was a plea her anger had drained away into pain and something else that he couldnt quite identify and so he spent the next hour talking to the servants but his mind was on the lonely woman shut up in grief a few walls a few doors from wherever he went in that house mary satterthwaite nervously told him she wasnt sure what the master and the captain were arguing about but miss wood had said they were discussing the wedding and it appeared to have given her the headache she wanted only to go to bed and be left alone was it common for the colonel and the captain to argue oh no sir they never did except over a horse race or how a battle was fought or the like men often quarrel rather than admit theyre wrong you know he smiled and who was wrong in this instance the colonel the captain mary frowned taking him seriously i dont know sir she added reluctantly id guess sir it was the colonel why he threw his glass at the door i mean he couldnt throw it at the captain being as he was already gone but he didnt like it that the captain had had the last word so to speak so he threw his glass as if there was still anger in him or guilt or frustration men dont like to be wrong sir and i doubt if the colonel was very often which was a very perceptive observation he asked about relations between the captain and the colonel cordial he was told two quite different men but they respected each other in the end he asked to be taken upstairs to any rooms overlooking the hillside where the colonel had been riding in theory the hill was in view from a number of windows both in the family quarters and on the servants floor at this time of year with the trees fully leafed out it was different youd have to be lucky rutledge thought peering out from one of the maids windowsthe best of the lotto catch a glimpse from here youd have to know where the colonel was riding and be watching for the faintest flicker of movement and then not be certain what youd seen was a horse and man possible then but not likely tired with hamish grumbling in the back of his mind rutledge left the house and began the walk back to the meadow the far hedge and the lane where hed left his car two hours or more before he glimpsed maggie the quiet sommers cousin hanging out a tablecloth on the line he waved to her but she didnt see him the breasthigh wall and the climbing roses blocking her view he walked on somewhere behind her he could hear the goose honking irritably as if it had been shut away for the morning and was not happy about it rutledge smiled served the damned bird right back in the meadow where charles harris had been found rutledge ignored hamish and began to quarter the land carefully but there was nothing to be learned nothing that was out of the ordinary nothing of interest he went back over the land again moving patiently his eyes on the ground his mind concentrating on every blade of grass every inch of soil then he moved into the copse where the killer might have stood waiting still nothing frustrated he stood there looking back the way hed come looking at the lie of the land the distant church steeple hamish was loud in his mind demanding his attention but he refused to heed the voice nothing nothing except in the lee of the hedge near where he and the sergeant had cut through on their first visit something dull and gray and unidentifiable something he hadnt been able to see from any other part of the meadow what was it he walked down to the hedge keeping his bearings with care and found the place the thing hed seen he squatted on his heels and looked at it thinking it was a scrap of rotting cloth nothing ignoring the brambles he pushed his way nearer to it closer to it had shape and staring eyes reaching into the brambles he touched it then pulled it forward a doll a small wooden doll in a muddy faded gown of pale blue flowered print the kind of cloth that could be bought in any shop cheap cotton and favored by mothers for childrens clothes a girls dress with the leftover cloth sewn into a gown for her favorite doll hadnt wilton said something about seeing a child who had lost her doll rutledge picked up the little bundle of cloth and stared down at it hickam might not be fit to testify against the captain would a child be any more reliable as a witness he swore not bloody likely making his way through the hedge rutledge went striding down to the lane ignoring the high grass and brambles his mind working on how to deal with the child and with wilton hamish was silent now but somewhere he still moved about restlessly waiting when he got to his car left in the brushy overgrown lane rutledge swore again with infinite feeling one of his tires was torn as if viciously slashed with a knife or a sharp stick deliberately and maliciously damaged rutledge didnt need a policeman to tell him who had done this mavers rutledge sent the blacksmith to bring his car back to the village and then went to find inspector forrest but he wasnt inhed been called back to lower streetham on the matter of the lorry accident fortuitously rutledge told himself irritably it was long past time for luncheon and rutledge turned back toward the inn after a hasty meal he crossed to dr warrens surgery to look in on hickam he was no better awake but without any awareness in his eyes a dead mans stare was focused on the ceiling of the tiny room blank and without knowledge or pain or grief dr warren came in as rutledge was leaving youve seen him well its something that hes still alive i suppose ive got enough on my handsi cant stand over him you might see if the vicar will pray for himhe snortedits about all hes good for can you tell me if any young children live near the meadow where harris was found children dr warren stared at him girls then young enough to play with something like this he held out the muddy wooden doll dr warren transferred his gaze to the object in rutledges hand there must be seven or eight on the estate itself servants and tenants children more scattered on the farms thereabouts the gentry have china dolls not wooden ones as a rule why i found this under a hedge captain wilton says he saw a child that morning that shed lost her doll then ask the captain to find her for you ive got a breech birth to see to and after that a farmer whose ax slipped and damned near took off his foot if i save the limb itll be a miracle and he wont have the army to provide him with a false one if i dont rutledge stood aside and let him walk into the small surgery where warren restocked his bag and then set it on the scrubbed table you understand dont you that if hickam lives he may not have enough of a mind left to testify at all everything thats happened could be wiped out rutledge replied yes i know youve served the people of this town for most of your life who do you believe might have killed charles harris warren shrugged mavers of course that would be my first thought i dont know your captain well enough to judge him still lettice was going to marry him and charles was damned careful where she was concerned he wouldnt have stood by and let a fool sweep her off her feet catherine tarrant warren shook his head because of the german dont be an idiot man i cant see her lurking behind a tree with a shotgun can you if she had wanted harris dead shed have come for him at mallows the first day he was back from the war why wait until now but im not paid to find murderers thats your job and if you ask me youre damned slow going about it hamish chuckling deep in his mind said derisively youre half the man you were thats what it is ye left the better half in the mud and terror and brought back only the broken bits and london knows it rutledge turned on his heel and strode out the doll still in his hand he tracked down wilton having a whiskey in the inns bar morosely staring at the glass in his hand rutledge sat down at the small corner table and said early in the day for that not when youve come from the undertakers wilton said turning his glass around and around in his fingers the fool had never dealt with a headless man before he was half titillated half revolted would we be wanting the colonel in his dress uniform and how was that cut sir with a high collar or low would we wish a silk scarf to cover what waserthe remains would we wish for a pillow in the coffin to rest the shoulders upon of course sir and will you be wanting to inspect theerdeceased before the services the captain shuddered my good god he looked at rutledge when davenant died the old vicar was still alive and he went with me to attend to matters before we left davenants valet handed us a box with suitable clothing in it and that was that it was civilized simple an ordinary death rutledge shook his head as redfern started toward them to indicate that he didnt wish to be disturbed then he put the doll on the table mark wilton stared at it frowning what the hell is that a childs doll a doll you told me that on the morning harris was killed you ran into a child whod lost her doll on the path near the meadow oh yes i remember her shed been picking flowers or some such thing and then couldnt find the dollshed put it down somewhere or other i see she found it i found it now i want to find her wilton smiled tiredly to ask her if i was carrying a shotgun when she and i crossed paths first a drunken madman then a child good god nevertheless i have no idea who she was or what her name was small fair cheerfula child ive had very little experience with them im not even certain id know her again if i saw her but you wont mind accompanying the sergeant to visit the tenants on mallows land and in the farms above the church it was not a question wilton regarded him for a time youre quite serious about this entirely mark wilton sighed very well that night when lettice wood left you and harris together in the drawing room she said you were discussing the wedding where did the conversation turn after that to catherine tarrant wilton was surprised catherine why on earth should we have discussed hermuch less quarreled over her charles and i admired her if not catherine tarrant what about mrs davenant wilton laughed you are in desperate straits arent you did you think id shoot harris over the good name of my cousin what has she done to merit your attention rutledge shrugged why shouldnt i grasp at straws he realized that he was quoting lettice wood had her words rankled that much there hasnt been a rush of people breaking down the policestation door to volunteer information about harriss killer has there ive decided theres a conspiracy to keep me from finding out whats best hidden wilton stared at him eyes sharp and searching the thin weary face before him was closed and unreadable what had made this man so ill consumption war wounds the sickly often had a way of piercing to the heart of a matter as if their close brush with death made them more sensitive to the very air around them rutledge had spoken out of irritation exasperated with wilton and himself but the reaction had been completely unexpected yon pretty hero isnt what he seems hamish growled unlucky in love and good for nothing but killing but very good at that finally wilton said carefully a conspiracy to murder harris a conspiracy to hide the truth whatever it may be rut ledge amended wilton finished his whiskey i thought you were an experienced man one of the best london had thats what forrest told us if you can find one person in warwickshireother than that fool maverswho wanted harris dead ill willingly be damned to the far reaches of hell meanwhile ill find the sergeant and well tour the nurseries of upper streetham for this child who lost a doll little good may it do you he left lifting a hand to summon redfern rutledge sat where he was watching the stiff angry set of his shoulders as the captain stalked off unlucky in love hamish had said he considered that again catherine tarrants german lettice woods guardian and sally davenant who might not have forgotten what had become of her husbands old shotgun if charles harris had died of poison rutledge might believe in simple jealousy more easily but a shotgun that took rage hatred a need to obliterate as lettice had put it he could feel the fatigue dragging at him the stress and the loneliness the fear looking around for redfern rut ledge saw that he was alone in the bar and then carfield was coming through the doorway glancing his way inspector ive spoken with mark wilton he said crossing over to rutledges table weve settled on tuesday for the services i understand that dr warren hasnt lifted his embargo on visits to lettice i really feel as her spiritual adviser i should go to her offer her comfort prepare her for the very difficult task of attending the funeral could you use your good offices to persuade him that seclusion is the worst possible thing for a young woman with no family to support her rutledge smiled pompous ass didnt begin to describe the vicar i have no right to overturn a medical decision unless it has a bearing on my duties he said remembering lettices dread of having to cope with carfield and theres the matter of the reception after the service it should be held at mallows i sincerely believe charles would have wished that naturally i shall take charge i know the staff well enough theyll do my bidding why not at the vicarage rutledge asked after miss wood has greeted the guests she can go quietly home wilton will see to that or royston carfield sat down uninvited my dear man one doesnt serve the funerals cold baked meats at the vicarage for a man like charles harris who has his own quite fine residence thats what staff is for you know to do the labor one doesnt expect dear lettice to shoulder such a burden have you suggested to wilton that you wish to arrange the reception at mallows carfields eyebrows rose it isnt his home is it the decision is for others to make not for captain wilton i see he considered the vicar for a moment who told upper streetham that miss tarrant was in love with a german prisoner of war and wished to marry him the heavily handsome face was closed i have no idea i tried to make the village see that she had done nothing wrong that loving our enemies is part of gods plan but people are sometimes narrowminded about such matters why do you ask could she have killed charles harris carfield smiled why not ask me if mrs davenant did it all right did she the smile disappeared youre quite serious murder is a serious business i want to solve this one ah yes i can understand your dilemma with wilton so closely connected to the royal family carfield answered with a shrewdness that narrowly escaped shrewishness as well i shouldnt have thought that a shotgun was a womans weapon nor should i but that doesnt mean it wasnt a woman behind it at the very least even if she never touched the trigger with a shake of his head carfield replied women are many things but obliterating a mans face in that fashion is a bloody horrible business even for a man catherine mrs davenant letticethey are none of them farmwives who can take an ax to a chicken without blinking catherine tarrant ran her fathers estate throughout the war ran it yes but do you suppose she butchered cattle or dressed a hen perhaps she didnt know how bloody the results would be perhaps she intended to aim lower but the kick of the weapon lifted the barrel carfield shrugged then you must take into account the fact that during the last three years of the war sally dav enant volunteered to nurse the wounded at a friends house in gloucestershire which had been turned into a hospital she has no formal training you understand but mrs davenant did tend her husband through his last illness and theer intimacies of the sickbed were familiar to her dressing wounds taking off bloody bedclothes watching doctors remove stitches or clean septic fleshim sure you learn to face many things when you have to no one least of all sally davenant had seen fit to mention that rutledge swore under his breath but i cant think that it would lead her to commit a murder carfield was saying and why should she wish to kill the colonel i ask you why did anyone want to kill him rutledge countered ah now were back to why whatever the reason im willing to wager that it was deeply personal deeply can you plumb that far into the soul to find it are you telling me that as a priest youve heard confessions that give you the answer to this murder no people seldom confess their blackest depths to anyone least of all to a priest oh the small sins the silly sins even the guilty sins where a clean conscience relieves the weight of guilt adultery envy anger covetousness hate jealousy he smiled a rueful smile that belittled himself in a way but theres fury you know where someone acts in a blind rage and only then stops to think and feel or fright where theres no time for second thoughts or selfdefense where you must act or be hurt i hear of those afterward from the man who hits a neighbor in a rage over a broken cart wheel from the woman who takes a flatiron to her drunken husband before he beats her senseless from the child who lashes out bloodying a bullys nose and sometimes these things can also lead to murder well youve seen it happen i neednt tell you about that but whats deeply burned into the soul whats buried beneath the civilized layers of the skin is the more deadly because often theres no warning it even exists no warning even to a priest which was more truth than rutledge had expected to hear from the vicar however carfield went on before rutledge could answer him im not here to solve your problems but to attend to my own which brings me back again to mallows id speak to royston or to wilton if i were you id leave miss wood out of it if they agree they can break the news to her im her spiritual adviser and dr warren is her physician its his decision not yours carfield rose eyes studying rutledge the tired face the lines you carry your own heavy burdens dont you he said quietly i dont envy you them my god i dont but let me tell you this much inspector rutledge when you return to london this will still be my parish and i must still face its people the reception will be at mallows i promise you that he turned and strode through the bar ignoring redfern the younger man came limping across to rutledges table now theres a man id not want to cross he said glancing over his shoulder at the sound of the outer door slamming id turn chapel before id tell him what was going on in my head rutledge laughed wryly he wondered if redfern had overheard part of the conversation or was simply unwittingly confirming the vicars words redfern picked up the empty glasses and wiped the table with his cloth it isnt easy is it being from london and not knowing whats happening here but ill tell you theres no reason i can think of for any of us to shoot colonel harris save mavers of course born troublemaker there was a private in my company a sourfaced devil from the stews of glasgow who was bloodyminded as they come never gave us any peace until the day the germans got him i heard later that the ambulance carrying him to hospital was strafed everybody killed i was sorry about that but i was relieved that sammy wasnt coming back ever tongue as rough as the shelling by god i understand that mrs davenant was a nurse during the war is that true it was redferns turn to laugh embarrassed you could have knocked me over with a feather when she walked into the ward the day i was brought in still too groggy from what theyd been doing to my foot to know where i was god i thought somehow id landed back home the next day she was there again changing dressings i told the sister on duty id not hear of her touching me sister said that was enough nonsense out of me still they must have spoken of it because she left me alone you recognized her oh aye i did well why not i grew up in upper streetham and she never said anything then or later when youd both come back here to the village no and i can tell you it was a relief the first time she passed me on the high street without so much as a blink weve spoken since of course when shes been here to dine just good evening and what will you have and thank you no more nor less than is needed did she work primarily with the surgical patients or only wherever she was most useful i asked one of the younger sisters about her she said that mrs davenant had shown a skill with handling the worst cases and the doctors often asked for her no nonsense and no fainting tilly said she was best with fliers she knew how to talk to them and we got any number of those of course with her own cousin one of them i expect it was natural for her to find it easy to talk to them amputations cleaning septic wounds burnsshe didnt shirk them no not that i ever saw but shes not one the lads would feel free to chat up and laugh with not the way you did with tilly goodnatured nonsense thats all it was but not with the likes of mrs davenant yet the fliers were comfortable with her yes shed ask news of the captain and then theyd soon be easy around her shed ask news of the captain it always came back to the captain but he was beginning to think that whatever her feelings about mark wilton it would take more skill than he possessed to bring them to the surface rutledge went upstairs and along the passage to his room the sun was bright showing the worn carpet to worst advantage dust motes dancing in the light as he passed the windows the vegetable garden looked like a vegetable garden again not a sea of temples he thought the onions had grown inches since his arrival even the flowers in the small private garden between the inn and the drive surrounded by shrubbery were no longer flat and drooping from the rain but stood tall and full of blossom heads the lupines were particularly glorious his mother had liked them and filled the house with them as soon as they began to bloom shed had a way with flowers a natural instinct for what made them thrive his sister frances on the other hand couldnt have grown weeds in a basket but she was known throughout london for her exquisite flower arrangements and was begged to lend her eye for color and form to friends for parties and weddings and balls his door was ajar the maid finishing making his bed she apologized shyly when he stepped in saying that luncheon had been such a busy time theyd needed her in the kitchens no matter he said but she hastily finished her task picked up her broom and the pile of dirty linens and bobbed a curtsy of sorts as she left rutledge sat down by the windows wondering what he would say to bowles on monday possibilities werent evidence possibilities werent guilt bowles would have a fit if he knew how few facts rutledge possessed he wondered what luck wilton would have tracking down the child whod lost the doll he set it on the windowsill and looked at it too bad you couldnt bring a doll into the courtroom what could it tell what had it seen lying there in the hedgerow or heard rutledge grimaced a drunken shell shocked man a small child and a doll versus a war hero wearing the ribbon of the victoria cross every newspaper in the country would have a field day he needed a motive a reason for murder a reason why the colonel riding out that sunny morning had to die what had brought about his death something now something in the war something in a life spent largely out of england so far such questions had gotten him nowhere rutledge leaned his head against the back of the chair then closed his eyes he needed to find a young sergeant at the yard and train him someone he could trust hed ask bowles for names of likely men someone who could work with him davies was too busy trying to stay out of sight davies had his own commitments to upper streetham and like the vicar he had to live here long after rutledge was gone it was understandable but he needed someone to talk to about this case someone who was impartial whose only interest was finding the killer and getting on with it someone to share the loneliness and what would you tell yon bonny sergeant about me would you be honest with him ill not go away you cant shut me out im not your unhappy jean who wants to be shut out im your conscience man and it wouldnt be long before yon bonny young sergeant knows you for what you are getting quickly to his feet rutledge swore all right then hed do it alone but do it he would outside the inn he met laurence royston royston nodded and was about to walk on when rutledge said have you spoken with the vicar royston turned damned fool but yes i have and yes hes right charles would have expected to have the reception at mallows ive told him ill take the responsibility and ill see to the arrangements he neednt disturb lettice miss wood can you tell me if sally davenant worked as a nurse during the war at a convalescent hospital yes she did in a friends home in gloucestershire charles ran into her there once or twice visiting one of his wounded staff officers he felt she was very capable very good at what she did why do you think she volunteered actually she spoke to me about it before she wrote to mrs carlyle he grinned i told her shed hate it well i thought she might you see and if she expected to hate it it wouldnt be quite such a letdown she said then that she wasnt cut out to run a farm the way catherine tarrant was doing and she was damned if shed roll bandages or serve tea to the troop trains leaving londonladies makework she called it but she thought she might be useful with the wounded and she was worried about her cousin pilots didnt have a long life expectancy by rights wilton should have been killed in the first yeareighteen months she felt that staying busy would make the news easier to bear when it came there was a commotion in the street as two boys came swooping past chasing a dog with a bone nearly as large as its head in its mouth a woman on the other side of the street called jimmy if youve let that animal into the house royston watched the boys father died on the somme theyre growing up wild as hellions what was i saying oh about mrs davenant i couldnt serve he went on quietly i have only the one kidney as i told you the army wouldnt have any part of me and i suppose it was for the best hard on a man when everyone else is serving even the women charles told me i was doing my bit keeping mallows and the davenant lands productive you worked mrs davenants land yes her steward left before christmas in mad to fight mad to be there before it was all over he never came back and the old steward wasnt up to the work i did it and he kept an eye on things when i couldnt be there did you know hugh davenant well royston shrugged well enough hugh davenant made a wreck of his marriage one of those selfish careless bastards who go through life leaving grief in their wake never taking notice was she ever in love with her cousin he frowned ive wondered well it was natural i suppose to wonder but there was never anything to support speculation shes fond of him what was wilton planning to do after he married let tice live here at mallows no he has a home of his own in somersetive seen it a handsome house good rich land i cant picture the captain quietly growing lettuces and wheat with a laugh royston said his father was an architect his mothers familys in banking in the city even if he never flies again hell hardly be reduced to growing lettuces but when he came back to warwickshire hed stay at mallows not with his cousin right thank you royston rutledge stepped out of the way of a woman pushing a pram she acknowledged royston with a pleasant smile and walked on glancing at rutledge out of the corner of her eyes at the last minute royston waited until she was out of hearing youve made no progress then he shook his head i keep thinking about ithow someone could shoot the colonel down and then disappear so completely unless hes left the county but if hes still here theres been no change in his manner nothing to point to him it was a bloody vindictive sort of crime inspector and yet it doesnt seem to have changed the killer at all either to make him happier or make him angrier somehow i find that particularly horrifying dont you that someone could kill and not be marked by it rutledge watched laurence royston walk away down the busy street then brought his mind back to the task hed set himself he stepped out into the afternoon traffic following a woman with a pram standing by the market cross he looked up and down the main street two boys on bicycles passed him grinning trying to attract his attention but he ignored them mavers that monday morning when harris was shot had been busily haranguing the market goers both mavers and any number of witnesses had sworn to it but sally davenant for one had suggested that it was possible for him to disappear for a short time without anyone noticing his absence rutledge considered first of all maverss cunning and the distance from here to the meadow where harris died the gun was a problem if mavers went to his house first retrieved the shotgun then went to the meadow waited for harris shot him put the gun back and returned to upper streetham he would need at the very least some ninety minutes possibly even two hours too long hed have been missed all right then what if hed taken the shotgun and left it somewhere along the hedge before coming down to the village harangued the crowds disappeared and after the killing concealed the shotgun again in the high grass before returning to his post a long hour could he have done it that quickly it was a risk a calculated risk and rutledge wasnt sure that mavers was willing to run it on the other hand mavers liked nothing better than thumbing his nose at his betters rutledge nodded to the woman hed seen earlier with sally davenant his attention on maverss movements and then he brought himself up sharply and caught up with her as she crossed the street in the direction of the greengrocers touching her arm to attract her attention he introduced himself and said were you in upper streetham last monday morning did you by any chance hear the man mavers speaking out here in the street she was a pleasantfaced woman dressed well and carrying a small basket nearly full of parcels but she grimaced as rutledge asked his question you cant miss him during one of his tirades she said mores the pity could you tell me if he was there by the market cross yes he was as a matter of fact all the time part of the time she frowned considering and then called to another woman just coming out of the ironmongers shop eleanor dear eleanor was in her fifties with short iron gray hair and a look of competence about her she came across to them head to one side her stride as brisk as her manner inspector rutledge from london eleanor the first woman said this is eleanor mobley inspector she might be able to help you more than i cani was here only very early that morning rutledge remembered the name mobley from forrests list of witnesses he repeated his questions and mrs mobley watched his face as she listened oh yes he was here by the market cross very early on at least part of the time he went down along the street there closer to the shops and the inn for a while later i saw him near the turning to the church but he came back to the cross he usually does she gave him a wry smile i was trying to line up tables for the vicars summer fete a fundraiser for the church you know how it is everyone promises to contribute something for the sale all the same you cant let it go at that can youyou have to pin them down not my favorite task but this year im on the committee and market day brings most everyone into town i just catch them as i can i must have been up and down this street a dozen times or more he moved from place to place but as far as you know he didnt leave to go to the pub for instance or step into the inn not as far as i know but since i wasnt paying him much heed i cant be certain that im right about that he just seemed to be underfoot wherever i turned putting peoples backs up spoiling a perfectly lovely morning someone passing by spoke to the other woman calling her mrs thornton she acknowledged his greeting adding ill be along directly tell judith for me will you tom mrs mobley was saying to rutledge is that any help at all yes very much so what was on his mind that morning do you recall anything he might have been saying mrs mobley shook her head he was running on about the russians you can usually depend on that something about the czar and his family i remember something about unemployment too because i was thinking to myself that he was a lovely one to talk the strikes in london you dont really listen do you hes not a very pleasant man at the best of times mrs thornton put in and riding his hobbyhorse hesrepellent as helena sommers put it any good he might do is lost with every word that comes out of his mouth was miss sommers here on monday yes just around noon i think it was buying some lace for her cousin mrs mobley said i put her down for two cakes i was glad to have them mrs thornton bit her lip then said youll think it silly of me but i dont feel its safe for two women in a cottage in the middle of nowhere since the colonels death i mean since we dont know and helena might as well be alone her cousin is such a ninny i went out there to call one afternoon and margaret was working in the garden well that goose gave my horse such a fright and she was absolutely too terrified even to drive the silly thing away with a broom i think theyre probably safe enough rutledge said refusing to be drawn if you say so mrs thornton seemed unconvinced now if theres nothing else inspector he thanked them both and went back to the market cross threading his way between a buggy and a wagon piled with lumber if mavers had moved from place to place that monday morning and given some forethought to the shotgun he mightjust mighthave killed harris and gotten away with it from the market cross rutledge made his way to the lane where hickam had seen the captain and the colonel together where sergeant davies had found hickam drunk and rambling about the two men he looked about the lane for several minutes then walked to the first house and knocked on the door asking questions did you see daniel hickam in this lane on the monday morning that colonel harris was shot did you see captain wilton in this lane walking did you see the colonel on his horse riding through here stopping to talk to anyone did you see bert mavers anywhere in the lane coming or going toward the main street the answer was the same at every house no no no and no but at one of the doors the woman who answered raised her eyebrows at finding him on her doorstep youre the man from london then what can i do for you she looked him up and down with cool eyes he didnt need to be told what she was although she was respectably dressed in a dark blue gown that was very becoming to her dark hair and her seacolored eyes a tall woman of middle age and wide experience who saw the world as it was but more important seemed to take it as it was rutledge asked his questions and she listened carefully to each before shaking her head no she hadnt seen hickam no shed not seen the captain that morning nor mavers but the colonel had been here colonel harris rutledge asked keeping his voice level as hamish clamored excitedly what brought him this way do you know he came to leave a message by the door knowing it was an early hour for betsy and me but he wanted to put our minds at rest about the quarrel wed had with the vicar her mouth twisted half in exasperation half in humor mr carfield is often of a mind to meddle he likes to be seen as a thunderbolt you might say flinging the moneylenders out of the temple the whores out of the camp not that theres that much to go on about in upper streetham its not what youd call a regular sodom and gomorrah she caught the responsive gleam in rutledges eyes the colonel now he was a very decent man we pay our rent regular as the day but vicar had been onto that mr jameson about us and he called around talking eviction i could have told him who put him up to it but there was no changing his mind so the next time i saw the colonel on the street i stopped him and asked him please to have a word with mr jameson about it jameson aye hes the agent for old mrs crichton who lives in london and he manages her holdings in upper streetham well the short of it was mr jameson agreed hed been a little hasty over the evicting do you still have the message she turned and called over her shoulder to someone else in the house betsy could you find that letter of the colonels for me love in a moment a thinner smaller woman came to the door apprehension in her eyes and a creamcolored envelope in her hand she handed it silently to the older woman is everything all right georgie yes yes the inspector is asking about the colonel thats all she gave the envelope to rutledge adding he never came hereas a caller he was a proper gentleman the colonel but fair always fair if youd asked me id have said i knew most of the men in upper streetham better than their own wives and i cant think of one whod want to shoot colonel harris there were two words on the front mrs grayson thats me georgina grayson rutledge took the letter out of its envelope saw the colonels name engraved at the top and the date written in a bold black hand monday he scanned it it said simply ive spoken to jameson you neednt worry hes agreed to take care of the matter with carfield if there should be any other trouble let me know of it it was signed harris could i keep this he asked speaking to mrs grayson id like it back she said but yes if itll help turning to betsy rutledge went over the same questions hed asked earlier but shed seen no one not mavershe knows better than to show his face around herenot hickam not harris not wiltonmores the pity with a saucy grin but she added a sudden touch of venom in her voice i did see miss hoitytoity just the other day thursday it was following after that poor sot daniel hickam hed spent the night on the floor here too drunk to find his way home and we got a little food into him then let him go she was onto him like a bee onto the honey slinking after him into the high grass toward the trees she pointed as if they had only just disappeared from sight down toward the track that eventually led up the hill to mallows the one called georgie smiled wryly at rutledge catherine tarrant what did she want with hickam rutledge asked thursday was the day shed come into town to speak to him about captain wilton betsy shrugged how should i know maybe to pose for hershe asked georgie to do it once and georgie told her sharpish what she thought about that but it was him she did want she caught up with him where she didnt think i could see and stopped him talking to him and him shaking his head over and over then she took something from her pocket and held it out to himmoney enough to get drunk again ill wager he turned away from her but after only a few steps turned back and began speaking to her she interrupted him a time or two and then she gave him whatever it was she was holding and he shambled off into the trees she walked back down to where shed left her bicycle head high as you please like the cat that got the cream and then she was gone shes a german lover that one maybe shes got a taste for drunks as well the eyes of hate and jealousy mrs grayson said now then betsy it wont help the inspector to do his job if you run on like that miss tarrants business is none of ours he left them the letter in his pocket his mind on what it representedthe fact that the colonel had been in the lane on monday morning just when hickam had said he was and catherine tarrant had given hickam money when rutledge arrived at the inn wilton and sergeant davies were waiting there was a distinctly sulfurous air about them as if it hadnt been a pleasant afternoon for either of them but sergeant davies got to his feet as soon as he saw rutledge and said we think weve found the child sir turning to wilton rutledge said what does he mean arent you sure wiltons temper flashed as far as i can be shesdiffer ent but yes i feel she must be the one none of the others matched as well the problem is rutledge cut him short ill only be a minute then he went up to his room got the doll and came down again saying lets be on our way back there wilton asked and the sergeant looked mutinous back there rutledge said walking down the rear hallway toward his car he gave them no choice but to follow i want to see this child for myself he said nothing about georgina grayson as he drove to the cottage while it was as the crow flies only a little farther from upper streetham than the meadow where the colonels body had been found it was necessary to go out the main road by mallows through the haldanes estate and up the hill the last hundred yards on rutted road that nearly scraped the underpinnings of the car on the way he asked instead for information about the childs family shes agnes farrells granddaughter davies answered mrs davenants maid the one we met at her house on thursday morning no sir that was grace agnes was home with the child lizzies mother is agness daughter and the father is ted pinter one of the grooms at the haldanes they live in a cottage just over the crest of the hill from where the captain says he was walking when he saw lizzie and miss sommers that monday morning when meg pinter is busy the little girl sometimes wanders about on her own picking wildflowers but shes quite ill now sir like to die agnes says rutledge swore under his breath when one door opened another seemed to close whats the matter with her thats just it sir dr warren doesnt know her minds gone like and she screams if ted comes near her screams in the night too wont eat wont sleep its a sad case the car bumped to a stop in front of the cottage a neatly kept house with a vegetable garden in the back flowers in narrow beds and a pen with chickens a large white cat sat washing herself on the flagstone steps leading to the door ignoring them as they walked by agnes farrell opened the door to them he could see the lines of fatigue in her face the worry in her eyes the premature aging of fear but she said briskly sergeant i told you once and ill tell you again ill not have that child worried this is inspector rutledge from london agnes he needs to have a look at lizzie it wont be above a minute i promise it wont he cajoled and then well be on our way agnes looked rutledge over her eyes weighing him as carefullybut in a different manneras georgina gray sons had done whats a policeman from london want with the likes of lizzie she demanded i dont know rutledge said but i believe ive found the childs doll it was in the hedge near the meadow where colonel harris was killed captain wilton here says he met her on his walk that morning and she was crying for the doll id like to return it if i could he held out the doll and agnes nodded in surprise aye thats the one all right whatever was she doing in the meadow looking for ted no doubt meg pinter came forward and touched the doll her face was drawn with lack of sleep and a very deep fear for her child she goes out to pick flowers and thats all right she comes to no harm but once or twice shes gone looking for her father because he lets her sit on one of the horses in the stables if the haldanes arent about rutledge said do you think she was in the meadow that morning when the colonel was killed oh god meg exclaimed turning to stare at her mother id never even thought agness face twisted in pain and she shook her head she might have seen something he added as gently as he could but id like to have a look at her give her the doll no ill take it meg said quickly tears in her eyes but he refused to part with it i found it ill return it the two women uncertain what to do turned to the sergeant but he shook his head denying any responsibility in the end they led rutledge through the neat house to the small room with its silent crib lizzie lay as quietly as a carved child covers tidily drawn over her body her face turned toward the wall it was a bright room very pleasant with a lamp and a stool and a small dolls bed in one corner handmade and rather nicely carved with flowers in the headboard it was very much like the crib and empty even from the door he could see how the little girls face had lost flesh the body bony under the pink coverlet there had been so many refugee children in france with bones showing and dark haunted eyes frightened and cold and hungry they had haunted him too rutledge walked slowly toward the child wilton stayed outside the door but the sergeant and the two women followed him inside lizzie he said softly but she made no response as if she hadnt heard him as if she heard nothing a thin thread of milk drained out of her mouth on the sheet under her head and her eyes stared at the wall with no recognition of what she was seeing speak to her he said over his shoulder to meg she came to the bed calling her daughters name half cajoling half commanding but lizzie never stirred rutledge reached out and touched lizzie on the arm without any reaction at all megs voice dwindled and she bit her lip against the tears id never thought she said softly as if lizzie could hear her that she might have been there poor little mite poor thing she turned away and agnes took her in her arms rutledge went around to the other side of the crib between the child and the wall he stooped to bring his face more in line with her eyes and said with a firmness that hed learned in dealing with children lizzie look at me he thought there was a flicker of life in the staring eyes and he said it again louder and more peremptorily agnes cried out telling him to mind what he was doing but rut ledge ignored her lizzie ive found your doll the doll you lost in the meadow see he held it out close enough for her to see it for an instant he thought that she wasnt going to respond then her face began to work her mouth gulping at air she screamed turning quickly toward the door her eyes on the sergeant then on wilton beyond it was a wild scream terrified and wordless rising and falling in pitch like a banshees wail deafening in its power from such a small pair of lungs curdling the blood numbing the mind agnes and meg ran toward her but with a gesture rutledge held them back but the screaming stopped as quickly as it had started lizzie reached out and rutledge put the doll in her open arms she clasped it to her with a force that surprised him her eyes closing as she rocked gently from side to side after a time one hand let go of the doll and a thumb found its way to her mouth sucking noisily she clutched the doll and began a singsong moan under her breath agnes watching her said she does that when shes falling to sleep there was the sound of a voice then the front door slamming a mans voice called meg honeyi saw the car whos come is it that doctor warren was going on about lizzie opened her eyes wide and staring and began to scream again turning her back to the doorway the sound ripped through the silence in the small room ripped at the nerves of the people standing there meg ran out of the room and rutledge could hear her speaking to her husband leading him away from lizzie then the slamming of the front door after a time lizzie stopped screaming and began to suck her thumb again the doll held like a lifeline in her other hand after a minute or so the singsong moaning began as well the childs eyes began to drift shut a deep breath lifted her small chest and then she seemed to settle into sleep or was it unconsciousness thats the first time shes rested agnes stood watching for a time then shook her head slowly grieving she adored her fatherits cut him to the heart to have her like this carrying on so when he comes into the house not wanting him near her rutledge studied the child yes i think she really is asleep he said gesturing to the sergeant and agnes to leave let her keep the doll but ill need it later he followed them out of the room and saw wiltons white face beyond the sergeants stolid red one the screams had unnerved davies but rutledge thought that it was the doll and the childs reaction that had worried wilton more agnes said her voice shaking whats to be done then if she saw the man whats to be done i dont know rutledge told her honestly i dont know out by the car a horse was standing reins down in the middle of the yard meg was holding her husband in her arms as they came out of his house he stared over her head at them raw pain in his eyes i want to know whats going on he said whats happening to lizzie sheyour daughter was possibly a witness to colonel harriss murder rutledge said there was no easy way to break the news she may have seen him shot i found her doll in the meadow there captain wiltonhe gestured toward marksaw lizzie that morning as well crying for the doll im not sure yet how all of this fits together but that child is frightened to death of you can you think of any reason why ted shook his head vehemently ive nothing to do with it she was like that when i came home monday from the stables for lunch meg found her wandering lost like and brought her home she didnt speak she wasnt herself meg gie put her to bed and shesits been like that ever since his voice was husky with feeling are you sure about this id not like to think of her there in that meadow with a murderer or a man killed shes never had a harsh word spoken to her in her life shes been a quiet cheerful good little thing he stopped turned away the horse hed been riding ambled over and nudged his shoulder ted reached up to its muzzle without thinking stroking the soft nose rutledge watched him does your daughter like horses horses aye shes been around them most of her life not to ride but ive let her sit on their backs held her in front of me let her touch them she likes to touch their coats smooth it like always has rutledge gestured to davies and wilton to get into the car if you want my advice send for dr warren and let him take another look at her and stay away from her for a few days pinter if you can theres a chance that she can sleep now it ought to help when she wakes up if shes at all capable of talking send for me do you understand it could be very important for your sake and for hers ted nodded his wife and motherinlaw watchful wary but rutledge looking at them thought theyd do it stay away from her mind he added let her heal if she can agnes said ill see to it for now ive seen men suffer like that in the war he added shock can do that if thats whats wrong with her but dont let her be frightened dont let her scream that means shes remembering keep her warm and quiet and at peace let her sleep thats the main thing now he turned toward the car hamish silent throughout the half hour in the house said you ought to know about sleep its the only time youre safe the drive back to upper streetham was quiet only the sound of the tires along the road and once a dog barking furiously as they passed when they reached the inn wilton said only god im tired its been a damned long day sergeant davies got out stiffly and said id best say something to inspector forrest about this unless youd rather speak to him yourself sir it was the last thing rutledge wanted to do he said no thats all right ill see him tomorrow theres not much more we can do tonight anyway davies nodded to wilton and said until tomorrow then sir to rutledge before marching off down the street toward his own house wilton waited making no move to get out of the car but rutledge said nothing leaving him to break the silence in the end he did does the child damn me or clear me aware of the envelope in his pocket rutledge said only i dont know do you i didnt kill him inspector wilton said quietly and i dont know who did he got out closed the car door behind him and walked away his limp more pronounced than usual a measure of the tension in him rutledge sighed a child a doll a drunkard the evidence was still slim but the letter from harris to mrs grayson was something else it could very well send the handsome captain to the gallows that night rutledge lay in his bed listening to the street noises dwindle into silence then the sound of the church bell marking the passage of time he couldnt get lizzie out of his mind she was terrified but of what the roar of a shotgun the bloody death of a man of a killer shed seenand somehow recognized then why hadnt she screamed in terror at sight of mark wilton her father not the captain frightened her most why he wrestled with the puzzle for an hour or more and came no closer to an answer bowles he was supposed to call london on monday and speak to bowles a drunk a child a whore witnesses against the royal familys favorite war hero he rutledge was going to look a right fool at the yard aye and is it why theyve sent you to warwickshire then hamish asked a sick man whos not up to the business in hand wholl be blamed for muddling the evidence and give them a reason to let the captain off the hook is that what london wanted when it let you take on this bluidy murder rutledge felt cold was that the reason hed been given this case as the scapegoat for failure was that why they hadnt mentioned hickam hoping that the shock of discovering the truth might be too much for the balance of rutledges mind as well or alternatively if he was successful he was also expendable when he brought the wrath of buckingham palace down on the yards head he could be quietly returned to the clinic with regret that the experiment hadnt worked out for the yard for rutledge for the doctors whod had faith in him it was a frightening prospect while hamish rattled gleefully around in the silence rutledge fought his anger and his fear and the dreadful loss of hope a hope thatd buoyed him through the worst days at the clinic as he fought for survival and the harsh reality of returning to london he promised himself that he wouldnt return to the clinic he wouldnt go back to failure there were other choices there always were to a man who feared living more than he feared death sunday morning was overcast a misting rain fading into low heavy clouds that hung about upper streetham like ghosts the heat was oppressive wrapping the damp around people making their way to the church and wreathing the air inside with a breathlessness that even the open doors couldnt drain away rutledge went to see hickam before walking down to the church the man was sleeping when he arrived but the housekeeper was a little more optimistic about his condition still she wouldnt let rutledge come in stronger thats all i can tell you but the doctor now he was dragged out to the pinter farm last night tired as he was and he said it was all your doing her voice was sharp with condemnation hes not going to church this morning either i can tell you that not if you havent roused him up with your banging on the door but the childs all right she seems better he asked did she sleep no thanks to you get on with your own business and leave doctoring to those who know whats best rutledge thanked her and went on to the church the last of the parishioners were hurrying through the lychgate and he could hear the sound of the organ as he walked quickly down the court hed found before the war that going to the church the victim had attended sometimes gave him a better feeling for the atmosphere of the town or the part of london in question anything that brought the victim into better perspective was useful the oppressiveness of the morning hung around the church door and a flush of claustrophobia left him suddenly breathless he shook his head at the usher ready to lead him down the aisle to a seat and stepped instead into the last one on the back row where he could escape the heat and the crush of bodies before the first prayer someone slipped in beside him looking up he met catherine tarrants equally surprised eyes then she sat down and ignored him as she fumbled for her prayer book it was an old one he saw and she found her place without trouble the service was high church which befitted the image of a man like carfield he brought to everyones attention the fact that the funeral for charles harris would be held on tuesday morning at ten then spent several minutes lauding the dead man in a sonorous voice that echoed around the stone arches and through the nave youd have thought rutledge told himself that they were burying a saint not a soldier he let his eyes wander taking in the highvaulted ceiling the slender pillars and a small but very fine reredos behind the altar above that was a rather plain east window the rere dos was of stone a representation of the last supper and the figures had a grace about them that was pleasing the haldane family tombs were just visible from where he sat they were ornate marble with clusters of cherubs as mourners around the bases several of the figures were medieval a handful were elizabethan while the victorian representations were almost lavishly ugly the vicars sermon was on making the best of ones life using each idle minute with care recognizing that death might sweep in at any moment to wipe out the hopes and dreams of the future he never mentioned charles harriss name but rutledge was sure that every parishioner present knew exactly what his reference was rutledge spent most of the long exhortation studying the townspeople in the body of the church he could see catherine tarrant only out of the corner of his eye but several rows away was helena som mers with laurence royston just ahead of her captain wilton and sally davenant were down near the front and to their left were the two women rutledge had met near the market cross the day before mrs thornton and mrs mobley with their husbands to his surprise he caught sight of georgina grayson as well sitting alone in one corner a very fine hat on her head and wearing a dress of the most conservative cut in a most becoming but decorous summery green when the last prayer was said rutledge was on his feet and out of the church door away from the rising tide of people coming toward him he found a vantage point under a tree in the churchyard and watched for a time catherine tarrant had also come out almost as quickly as he had making her way toward a car with a driver waiting by the lychgate but the others were taking their time laurence royston came out strode down the walk and called to catherine as she was getting into the car she waited for him and he went to speak to her she shook her head smiling but firm mavers was lingering behind the lychgate watching rut ledge saw him and wondered what had brought him there sergeant davies came out of the church and stopped to speak to carfield effectively damming the flow of people for the moment royston said goodbye to catherine tarrant and her driver went to the end of the court to turn the car mavers came quickly to royston and began to speak very earnestly royston listened head to one side watching catherines departure then his attention came back to mavers and after a time he began to shake his head maverss reaction was interesting a flush of anger spread over his face and he began to bob almost frantically demanding something but royston seemed to take pleasure in telling him that it was no use rutledge was not close enough to hear but the movements of both men told enough of the tale mavers was furious for an instant rutledge thought he was going to lash out with his clenched fists and royston must have thought so too because he stepped back wary suddenly mavers turned toward the church and raised his voice making himself heard by the fresh flood of people moving out into the mist has god refreshed your spirits he demanded the fury mounting in him almost slurring his words do you feel sanctified or have you seen yon fat toad for what he is a mountebank a fool leading other fools down the path of lies and highflown words covering the emptiness of every soul here with their attention riveted on him he swung around to where a stunned royston was standing watching him and included him in the fierce denunciation theres not a christian in the lot of you not one soul not already damned and no one safe from the fires of hell heres a murderer of children hiding behind the coattails of a man who went to wars to do his killing aye you think you see the colonels fine agent but i know him for what he is a man who paid his way out of the laws clutches a rich mans money for the bloody deed and the colonel like a pied piper leading your sons off to war and maiming the lot of them in soul or body his funeral ought to be a time of rejoicing that hes dead before his time and yonders a whore wearing the dress of a proper lady while youand youand youhe was pointing to a handful of appalled menmake your way to her bed any chance youve got aye i know who you are ive seen you there he whirled to face another group of emerging worshipers and you lusting after your cousin while hes busy with moneyed ladies sucking up to wealth and you watching him like a starved woman sally davenants face flushed with a mixture of anger and speechless embarrassment wilton started toward mavers but the man said and the sergeant there the inspector over yonder quaking in their boots to arrest the kings friend who shot down the colonel in cold blood with a stolen shotgun and the man from london who lurks in shadows and tackles the pathetic likes of daniel hickam instead of doing his duty almost foaming at the mouth in his terrible need to hurt mavers paid no heed to the effect his words were having on the targets of his wrath he poured them out in torrents spilling over one another in a tangle rutledge began to move toward him cutting across the churchyard one eye on mavers the other on his feet among the damp tilted tombstones you with the feebleminded cousin who ought to be shut away for her own good and that artist the one who took a german to her bed and reveled in itthat other one with the witchs eyes hiding in her bedchamber with her lascivious desires and the inspector yonder with his cold sexless wife and tom malone the butcher who keeps his thumb on his scales the bloodless haldanes dead and not even knowing it ben sanders whose wife killed herself rather than go on living with him the sergeant who but wilton and rutledge had reached him by that time dragging him away from the lychgate bending his arms behind him until he choked from pain and stopped lacerating the townspeople with a tongue as sharp as a lash they hauled him with them down the length of the court his aggrieved cries echoing off the facades of the almshouses raising the rooks in the fields beyond the trees the look on wiltons face was murderous behind them rutledge could hear forrest running to catch up and the sergeants bull roar telling everyone at the church to pay no heed that the fool had run mad like a rabid dog but rutledge thought he had done no such thing stopping at the corner to hand mavers over to forrest rutledge turned on his heel and went back to the lychgate searching for royston in the crowd gathered there silent and avoiding one anothers eyes their faces stiff with shocked dismay unable to think of any way out of the churchyard that wouldnt take them past the rest of the parishioners equally paralyzed with indecision as rutledge scanned their faces he saw tears in sally davenants eyes though her chin was high and her cheeks still flushed helena sommers seemed to be trying to find something in her handbag her expression hidden by the widebrimmed hat she wore her hands shaking georgina grayson had moved away from the crowd to the tree where rutledge had been standing earlier her back to the churchyard her head tilted to watch the rooks soaring around the church tower royston was gripping a post on the lychgate staring at the worshipers on the other side of the wall a defensive look in his eyes his mouth turned down in shame as rutledge reached him he said its my fault i shouldnt have told him i should have thought about what hed do and now look whats happenedill never be able to face any of them again what did he want royston turned to rutledge as if surprised to find him there he wanted to know if wed read the will charless will he wanted to know if his pension was going to continue pension yes charles gave him a pension years ago why royston shrugged expressively it was his sense of responsibility the other sonthere were two boys and a girl in the family the mother had worked at mallows as a maid before she married hugh davenants gamekeeperthe other son died in south africa the daughter drowned herself when mavers ran off to join the army charles had him sent home he was told that as long as he stayed there and looked after his mother hed be paid a pension after the mother died charles didnt stop it he let it go on against my better judgment he felt he could stop mavers from getting into worse trouble than he had already it was threatening to cut off the pension as much as the threat of sending him to an institution that stopped the poisoning of the cattle and charless dogs a lever but charles planned to let it end with his death it wasnt quite the same version of the story mavers had told but rutledge thought that it was very likely that roystons was closer to the truth some of the color was coming back to roystons face and with it the shuddering acceptance of the immensity of mav erss revenge ive never felt quite so deliberately spiteful as i did when i told him that i was thinking that it was one of the few times in my life when i actually relished causing pain what i didnt realize was that i would cause so much god i feelfilthy rutledge answered harshly dont be a fool theyre all so horrified they dont know how it began or why leave it at that let them blame mavers dont give them a scapegoat it will ruin you and only a bloody idiot is that selfdestructive after a moment royston nodded he turned and walked away joining the others who were now coming by ones and twos and threes through the lychgate heads down hurrying toward the safety of home on the church steps carfield was alone staring after his flock with an empty face he hadnt come forward in a heavensent rage to defy mavers and protect his parishioners hed stood there missing the opportunity of a lifetime to play the grand role of savior and hero waiting in the shadows of the church door geared for flight and not for fight planning to make a hasty and unseen departure if need be unwilling to do battle with the powers of darkness in the form of one wiry little loudmouth with amber goats eyes a mountebank mavers had called him he looked across the churchyard and saw rutledge watching him with a swirl of his robes he vanished inside the church shutting the door firmly but quietly behind him rutledge walked slowly behind the last of the parishioners hurrying down the lane by the time he reached the high street he was alone that afternoon dr warren allowed him to visit daniel hickam rutledge stood in the doorway looking down at the man in the bed thin unshaven but clean and as still as one of the carved haldanes on the church tombs then as rutledge stepped into the room the heavy eyelids opened and hickam frowned knowing someone was there he moved his head slightly saw rutledge and the frown deepened with incipient alarm behind it dr warren moved out from behind rutledges shoulder and said briskly well then daniel how are you feeling man hickams eyes moved slowly to warren and then back again to rutledge after a moment he said in a croak that would have made a frog shudder who are you im rutledge inspector rutledge scotland yard do you remember why im here alarm widened his eyes warren said testily oh for gods sake tell the man hes done nothing wrong that its information you want where am i hickam asked is this france hampshire the hospital his glance swept the room puzzled afraid rutledges hopes plummeted youre in upper streetham dr warrens surgery youve been ill but someone has shot colonel harris hes dead and we need to ask people who might have seen him on monday morning where he was riding and who he was with dr warren started to interrupt again and this time rut ledge silenced him with a gesture dead hickam shut his eyes after a time he opened them again and repeated monday morning yes thats right monday morning youd been drunk do you remember and you were still hungover when sergeant davies found you you told him what youd seen but then you were ill and we havent been able to ask you to repeat your statement we need it badly rutledge kept his voice level and firm as if questioning wounded soldiers about what theyd seen crossing the line hickam shut his eyes again was the colonel on a horse rutledges spirits began to rise again yes he was out riding that morning he heard the echo of lettice woods words in his own then told himself to keep his mind on hickam on a horse hickam shook his head i dont remember monday morning thats it then warren said quietly still standing at rutledges shoulder i warned you but i remember the colonel on a horse in thein the lane above georgies house iwas that monday the creaking voice steadied a little go on tell me what you remember ill decide for myself whats important and what isnt the eyelids closed once more as if too heavy the colonel hed been to georgies hes lost it warren said at that let him be now no hes right the colonel had been to the grayson house rutledge told him under his breath now keep out of it hickam was still speaking and someone called to him another officer he shook his head i dont know his name hehe wasnt one of our men aa captain thats what he was the captain called to colonel harris and harris stopped they stood there harris on the horse the captain by his stirrup and then there was silence heavy and filled only with the sound of hickams breathing there was a push on wasnt there i could hear the guns they were in my headbut it was quiet in the lane he began again i tried but i couldnt hear what they were saying i could see their facesangry faces low angry voices clenched fists the colonel leaning down the captain staring up at him ii was frightened theyd find me send me back he stirred under the sheet face agitated so angry i couldnt hear what they were saying he started to repeat over and over the gunsi couldnt heari couldnt heari couldnt hear warren clucked his tongue lie still man its done with theres nothing to be afraid of now the unsteady voice faded then hickam said so softly that rutledge had to lean toward the bed to hear him while warren cupped his left hand around his ear ill fight you every step of the way rutledge recognized the words hickam had repeated them to him in the dark on the high street the night hed given him enough money to kill himself dont befoollike it or notlearn to live with it live with what rutledge asked hickam didnt answer rutledge waited nothing the minutes ticked past finally dr warren jerked his head toward the door and took rutledges arm rutledge nodded turned to go they were already in the hall rutledges hand on the door preparing to close it he stopped in the act realizing that hickams lips were moving the thready voice was saying something rutledge crossed the room in two swift strides put his ear almost to the mans mouth not the war it wasnt the war a sense of amazement crept into the words then what what was it hickam was silent again then he opened his eyes and stared directly into rutledges face youll think im mad in the middle of all that fighting no ill believe you i swear it tell me it wasnt the war the colonelhe was going to call off the wedding dr warren said something from the doorway harsh and disbelieving but rutledge believed it was finally the reason behind the quarrel it was as well the captains motive for murder the inn was remarkably quiet but rutledge stopped red fern in the hall and asked to have sandwiches and coffee brought to his room he wanted to think without distraction or interruption and redfern must have sensed this because he nodded and hurried off toward the kitchens without a word rutledge took the stairs two at a time in the passage near his room he paused as the first rays of a sultry overly bright sun broke through the heavy clouds storm signs he thought watching the light play across the gardens and then flicker out again theyd had a remarkable run of good weather as it was his eyes caught a splash of color in the small private garden and he looked down a woman in a broadbrimmed hat was standing there her back to the inn hands on her arms head bowed he tried to see who it was but in the gray light he wasnt sure he recognized her searching his mind for someone at the morning church service wearing a hat like that he drew a blank hed been more interested in faces than apparel and in reactions to maverss vicious denunciations leaning his palms on the windowsill he cocked his head to one side for a better line of sight behind him he heard limping footstepsredfern bringing up his lunch he straightened and turned to meet him redfern carried a tray covered with a starched white napkin a pot of coffee steaming to one side cream and sugar beside it the sandwiches a large and uneven mound rutledge gestured to the woman in the garden do you know who that is down in the private garden the woman with her back to us redfern handed the tray to rutledge and looked out thatsaye that must be miss sommers the netherbys brought her into town for the morning services but shes worried about her sister with a storm coming doesnt want to stay for lunch after all jimthats the stable boywent to see if mr royston or the hendersons or even the thorntons might take her home he reached for the tray again going on into rutledges room to set up the table rutledge stayed where he was for a moment longer hed have sworn it was catherine tarrant the small table by the window overlooking the street was ready for him when he followed redfern to his room if you dont mind sir you can just leave the tray in the hall when you go ill be back to pick it up when the dining room is closed were not all that busy today but you never know if it starts to rain we could be full he was already out the door when rutledge stopped him redfern did the colonel come here often to dine or did captain wilton bring miss wood redfern nodded sometimes but i think they went into warwick as often as not if they wanted a dinner lunch now that was different if the colonel had business in the town hed often stop in always left a generous tip never fussy mrs haldane simons mother was the fussiest woman alive there was no pleasing her the captains not one to demand service but he expects you to do a proper job and he knows when you dont miss woodhe smiled wryly miss wood is a lady and you dont forget that but shes a pleasure to serve never makes you feel like a wooden post with no feelings nicest smile ive ever seen i enjoy having her come in how did she and wilton get on he thought about it for a moment comfortably you could see that they were happy never holding hands or anything like that not in public but the way he held her coat or took her arm the way shed tease himthe closeness was there i was sometimesenvious i suppose my own girl married another chap while i was in hospital and they thought id soon be having my foot taken off when youre lonely it can hurt watching others in love there was a wistfulness in his voice as he finished hamish in the back of rutledges mind growled youd know about that then wouldnt you how it hurts and all youve got to ease your loneliness is me if theres a more dismal hell i havent found it rutledge almost missed redferns next words the last time i ever saw the colonel hed come here for lunch what when was that the tuesday before he died it was another day like this one overcast you could feel the storm coming everyone was jittery even the colonel didnt say two words to me all through his meal frowned something ferocious when miss wood came in looking for him he left his pudding and took her into that garden where you saw miss sommers just now i came up here to fetch some fresh linens for the maids and they were still there he had his hands on her shoulders saying something to her and she was shaking her head as if she didnt want to hear then she broke away and ran off as i came back down the stairs the colonel was just walking in from the garden looking exasperated and he said women but i had the feeling there wasi dont know an exhilaration there too as if in the end he expected to have his way i brought him another cup of coffee but he was restless and after drinking half of it he was gone you dont know what had upset lettice wood or the colonel it mustnt have been too important redfern answered i saw her the next day looking radiant walking down to the churchyard with mr royston i ought to be back in the dining room rutledge let him go with a nod of thanks he sat there biting into the thick beef sandwiches not even aware of the taste or the texture absently drinking his coffee there was a slice of sponge cake for dessert wilton had motive he had opportunity and he had access to a weapon all that was left was to clear up loose ends and then make the arrest and to explain to bowles on monday morning the reasons behind the decision was tuesday the day that the colonel had told his ward what he was planning to do to call off the wedding but why it was an excellent marriage from any point of view as far as an outsider could tell wilton and lettice were well matched in every waysocially financially of an age unless there were things about wilton that charles harris knew and didnt like then why allow the engagement to take place seven months ago because he hadnt known at the time what could he have learned in the last week that would have made him change his mind something from wiltons pastor present the only other person who could answer that question was lettice herself rutledge drove out to mallows in sunlight that poured through large cracks in the heavy black clouds bringing heat in waves with it lettice agreed to see him and he was taken up to the sitting room by johnston there was a little more color in her face this afternoon and she seemed stronger as he came into the room she turned to him as shed done before and said at once somethings happened i can tell its been a rather busy morning mavers was on the loose as services ended at the church he raked most everyone there over the coals as vicious a display of hate as ive ever seen royston the captain mrs davenant miss sommers the inspectoreven people i dont know lettice frowned why because hed just discovered that his pension from charles harris ended with the colonels death and he was furious she was genuinely surprised charles paid him a pension apparently lettice gestured to one of the chairs and sat down herself its the sort of thing charles might do stillmavers and a very good reason for mavers not to kill him but you said mavers didnt know the pension would end thats right he stopped royston as he came out of the church and asked if the will had made any provision for the pension to continue all those months when he agitated for harriss death mavers doesnt seem to have considered the fact that he might lose his own golden goose she sighed well you said there were witnesses who claimed mavers was haranguing everyone on monday morning he wasnt in the running anyway was he ive discovered that he could have been with a little planning but he isnt high on my list tell me what did you and charles harris argue about on tuesday at the inn or rather in the garden there the swift change in subject caught her unprepared and her eyes widened and darkened as she stared at him you might as well tell me about it he said gently i already know what harris and mark wilton quarreled about on sunday evening after dinner and again on monday morning in the lane harris was planning to call off the wedding i have a witness her color went from flushed to pale and back again how could you have a witness she demanded huskily who is this witness it doesnt matter i know thats whats important why didnt you tell me before why did you pretend when mark wilton came to the house and i was there to overhear that you were calling the wedding off because you were in mourning if charles had already ended your engagement she met his eyes hers defiant challenging youre fishing inspector let me meet this witness facetoface let me hear it from himor her you will in the courtroom i believe mark wilton shot charles harris after he was told on sunday night that the wedding was off and the colonel refused again on monday morning to listen to reason all i need to know now is why why your guardian changed his mind what wilton had done that made it necessary lettice shook her head you dont go out and shoot someone because a wedding has been called off in another year id have been my own mistress it wasnt necessary to murder charles she stopped her voice thick with pain it might have been if the reason was such that wilton could never have you mrs davenant has said shed never seen him so in lovethat youd given him a measure of peace something to live for when hed lost his earlier love of flying that hed have done anything you asked willingly and without hesitation a man who loves like that might well believe that in a years time your guardian would have convinced you that hed made the right decision breaking it off even turned you against wilton while he wasnt there to defend himself when he thought he was in love with catherine tarrant wilton waited for her because her father felt she wasnt ready for marriageand in the end she changed her mind it came to nothing that was different in what way when she didnt answer he asked instead is that why you didnt go riding with your guardian monday morning because you were as angry as wilton over what was happening she winced closing her eyes against his words but he inexorably went on is that why you had a headache and left the two men alone to discuss the wedding because youd already lost the battle tears rolled silently down her cheeks silvery in the light from the windows and she made no attempt to wipe them away i will have to arrest wilton you know that i have enough evidence to do it now but id prefer to spare you as much grief as i can tell me the truth and ill try to keep you out of the courtroom his voice was gentle again behind it hamish was restlessly stirring after a moment he took the handkerchief from his pocket and going to her pressed it into her hand she buried her face in it but didnt sob outside he heard the first roll of thunder distant and ominous rutledge stood by the sofa where she sat looking down at the top of her dark head wondering whether she grieved for mark wilton her guardian herself or all three that first day i was here you thought didnt you that mark had shot him i remember your words you didnt ask who had done the shootinginstead you were angry about how it was done i should have guessed then that you were a part of it that you already knew who it was she looked up at him such anguish in her face that he stepped back i am as guilty as mark is she told him holding her voice steady by an effort of will charlesi cant tell you why it was stopped the wedding but i can tell you what he said to me on that tuesday at the inn he said i was too young to know my own heart that he must be the one to decide what was best for me all that week i begged and pleadedand cajoledto have my way saturday evening when mark had gone home charles and i sat up well into the night thrashing it out thunder rolled again much nearer this time and she flinched startled the sunlight was fading an early darkness creeping in outside the windows the birds were silent and somewhere rutledge could hear a rustle of leaves as if the wind had stirred but the heat was oppressive now taking a deep shaking breath lettice went on charles was a very strong man inspector he had a fiercely defined sense of duty what he did on sunday evening wasnt easy for him he liked markhe respected him it was for my sake not because of any weakness in markthat he changed his mind about the wedding charles doted on youhed have given you anything you wanted then why not this one thingthe man you planned to marry because she said softly because he did put my happiness above everything else and he finally came to believe that mark wilton wasnt the right man and wilton who believed as strongly that he was the right man turned on his friend shot him out there in the meadow and with that one act lost any hope he might have had of marrying you i dont see how he gained anything by killing charles that he couldnt have gained by waiting unless there was something elsesome reason powerful enough that silencing charles harris was worth the risk of losing you forever something that might have destroyed captain wilton personally or professionally she looked up at him eyes defensive but resolute it was a strange test of wills and he wasnt sure exactly where it was leading or even if she knew the answer he wanted to hear all right i did think it was mark at firstnot because i saw him as a murderer but because of my own sense of responsibility over what had happened the feeling that hed done it to obliterate charles to get even i was half drugged ill with grief not knowing where to turn or what to do charles was dead theyd quarreled over the marriageone thing on the heels of the otherwhat else could i think but im not as sure now when mark finally came here i couldnt sense guilt i couldnt find any response in himor in me that ought to have been there if hed killed onlya terrible emptiness what did you expect shivers of premonition no dont offer me sarcasm give me credit for a little sense a little knowledge of the man i was planning to marry a flush of anger in her cheeks made her eyes glitter the unshed tears brightening them but still you called off the wedding in my presence you dont marry while youre in mourning then youll go ahead and marry him after youve mourned a decent length of time if he isnt hanged for murder shocked she stared at him ii dont lettice you arent telling me all of the truth he gave her time to answer him but she said nothing her eyes holding his unreadable once more defiant who are you protecting mark yourself or charles the wind had picked up lashing at the house sending a skirl of leaves rattling across the windows she got up quickly and went to close them from there she turned to face him again if you want to hang mark wilton youll have to prove hes a murderer in a court of law with evidence and witnesses if you can do that if you can show that he was the one who shot charles harris i will come to the hanging ive lost charles and if i truly thought mark had killed him and no one could actually prove it even though that was the way it had happened id go through with the wedding and spend the rest of our lives making him pay for it i care that much but i wont betray him if hes innocent ill fight for him not because i love himor dont love himbut because charles would have expected me to fight if mark didnt shoot harriswho did ah she said smiling sadly were back to where we were arent we well i suppose it comes down to one thing inspector what mattered most to mark keeping me or killing charles because he knewhe knewhe couldnt do both so what did he have to gain the storm broke then rain coming down with the force of wind behind it rattling shutters and windows and roaring down the chimney almost shutting out the flash of the lightning and a clap of thunder that for an instant sounded as if it had broken just overhead the rain was so intense that he stopped at the end of the drive in the shelter of overhanging trees rutledges face was wet his hair was matted to his head and the shoulders of his coat were dark with water but he felt better out of that house away from the strange eyes that told him the truth but only part of the truth he didnt need hamish whispering shes lying to tell him that whatever lettice wood was holding back hed find no way of forcing it out of her as the storm passed the rain dwindled to a light drizzle the ground steaming the air still humid and unbreathable he got out and started the car again then turned away from upper streetham toward the warwick road he drove aimlessly no goal in mind except to put as much distance between himself and the problems of charles harriss murder as he could for the moment youre drawn to her the witch hamish said and what will jean have to say about that no not drawn rutledge answered aloud its something else i dont know what it is do you suppose then that she bewitched the captain and the colonel as well that somewhere she had a hand in this murder i cant see her as a murderess hamish laughed you ought to know better than anyone that people kill for the best of reasons as well as the worst rutledge shivered what was it about lettice wood that reached out to him in spite of his better judgment reluctantly bit by bit she had confirmed hickams rambling words and wiltons own behavior his unwillingness to come to mallows after the quarrel or explain what it had been about reinforced the picture all too clearly and it was slowly inevitably developing the childs part in it still rounding the bend he saw the bicycle almost too late coming up on it with a suddenness that left decision to reflexes rather than conscious action he got the brake in time to skid to a stop in the mud wheels squealing as they locked sending him almost sideways hamish swore feelingly as if hed been thrown across the rear seat standing on the road was catherine tarrant bending over her bicycle she looked up in startled horror as he came roaring down on her driving far faster than hed realized faster than the conditions of the road dictated his bumper was not five feet from where she stood as the car came to a jarring halt killing the engine recovering from her shock she demanded angrily what do you think youre doing you damned fool driving like that you could have killed me but he was getting out of the car and she recognized him then ohinspector rutledge what the hell are you doing in the middle of the road you deserve to be run down he responded with a matching anger marching toward her fists clenched against his rising temper the unpleasant drizzle wasnt helping the chains brokeni dont know if something came loose or if i jammed it when i skidded oh for pitys sake dont just stand there put my bicycle in the back of your car before were both wet to the skin and take me home she was in a foul temper as well but dry he noticed as if shed found shelter somewhere from the worst of the rain they stared at each other faces tight with selfabsorbed emotions then she managed a wry smile look wed better both get out of the way or someone else will fly around that bend and finish us off take me home and ill offer you some tea you look as if you could use it i know i could he walked past her lifted the bicycle and carried it to his car she helped him put it in the backhe had an instants sharp sense of the ridiculous thinking that it would crowd hamish outand then came around to the passenger side not waiting for him to open her door he cranked the car got in and said did you miss the rain i was at the haldanes house theyre away i just went by to pick up a book simon promised to lend me she lifted a large heavily wrapped parcel out of the basket behind her and set it in her lap he brought it back from paris and thought i might want to see it something on the impressionists do you know them they talked about art as he backed the car and drove to her house and she left a servant to deal with the bicycle striding past the handsome staircase and down the hallway toward her studio without looking over her shoulder to see if he followed setting the borrowed book on a stool she took off her hat and coat then said get out of that coat it will dry faster if you arent in it rutledge did as he was told looking about for a chair back to drape it on catherine sighed well mavers most certainly put the wind up everyone in upper streetham this morning what did you think of his little show was it a show or was he upset she shrugged who knows who cares the damage is done i think he rather enjoyed it too lashing out its the only way he can hurt back with words nobody pays any attention to his ideas which is one of the reasons he might have shot charles harris yes i suppose it isto make us sit up and take notice well i wouldnt mind seeing him arrested for murder and taken off to london or wherever i didnt enjoy having my own life stripped for the delectation of half of upper streethamthe whole of it come to that everyone will talk not about what he said of them but about everyone else those who werent there will soon be of the opinion that they were catherine moved about her paintings touching them not seeing them needing only the comfort of knowing they were there thats a very bitter view of human nature oh yes ive learned that life is never what you expect it will be just as you come to the fringes of happiness touching it feeling it tasting itand desperately hoping for the rest of itits jerked away you have your art yes but thats a compulsion not happiness i paint because i must i love because i want to be loved in return wanted to be did you ever paint rolf linden startled she stopped in midstride once onlyonce could i see what you did hesitating she finally moved across to a cabinet in one wall unlocking it with a key she took from her pocket she reached inside and drew out a large canvas wrapped in cloth he moved forward to help her with it but she gestured to him to stay where he was there was a little light coming in through the glass panes overhead and she kicked an easel to face it then set the painting on it after a moment she reached up and undid the wrappings rutledge came around to see it better and felt his breath stop in his throat as his eyes took it in there was a scene of storm and light heavy dark clouds nearer the viewer a delicate light fading into the distance a man stood halfway between looking over his shoulder a smile on his face it was somehow the most desolate painting that rutledge had ever seen hed expected turbulence a denial a fierce struggle between love and loss something dramatic with grief but instead shed captured annihilation an emptiness so complete that it echoed with anguish he knew that anguish and suddenly he was convinced that lettice wood knew it also that that was what hed responded to in her catherine was watching his face unable to hear hamish but seeing the flicker of fear and recognition and a deep stirring of response while hamishhamish wept its never been shown it was all he could manage to say into the silence no she answered with certainty and never will be a maid brought in the tea and catherine quickly covered the painting putting it carefully back into its vault like a mausoleum for her love turning back to pour a cup for rutledge and then for herself she said unsteadily youve been there havent you he nodded the war yes but shes still alive sometimes thats worse she put sugar into her tea and handed him the bowl he helped himself finding relief in the ordinary movements of his hands then accepted the cream where were you going when you nearly ran me down she asked finally sitting down allowing him to do the same it was an overt change of subject she had closed the door between them again anywhere out of upper streetham why he reached for one of the small iced tea cakes as an excuse not to meet her eyes to think what about whether or not i have enough evidence to arrest mark wilton tomorrow morning for harriss murder he could hear her suck in her breath but she didnt say anything looking up he asked why did you track down daniel hickam on the thursday you spoke to me no dont bother to deny it i have witnesses you stopped him talked to him and then gave him money i felt sorry for him most people have forgotten that before the war he was a very good cabinetmaker better than his father ever was he made the frames for my first paintings and that easel nowhe probably shakes too much to drive a nail straight much less do finer work i try to keep an eye on him no you wanted to know what hed said about wilton i dont know yet how you found out about hickam possibly from forrest he watched that guess go home she wasnt as good at hiding her thoughts as lettice wood yes all right i was afraid for mark i still am he wouldnt have killed charles you come in here from london asking questions making assumptions you judge people even though you know very well theyre under a great deal of stress but it isnt the same as getting under the skin is it you cant do that you cant know them not in a few days time you havent got that skill hed had it once refusing to be sidetracked rutledge said only he had means opportunity motive its all there now out into the open then why are you telling me this if you know so much she cocked her head to one side considering him why were you driving out on the warwick road when you had all the evidence you need why are you involving me because i wanted to know what you would say when you heard she set down her teacup and are you satisfied he didnt answer after a moment she asked have you told london yet no not yet ill call superintendent bowles early tomorrow morning id prefer to have everything finished before the funeral services on tuesday upper streetham will be full of people then harriss friends fellow officers dignitaries they shouldnt be distracted from their mourning by police business therell be a great hue and cry when you do it it will upset the king and everyone else including the prime minister hes got enough on his plate right now with the peace talks it will bring the wrath of scotland yard down on your head it will ruin mark it could very well ruin you id be very careful before i did something i couldnt undo she was a very perceptive woman and she knew london that doesnt matter if he shot charles harris why should mark wilton go scotfree he couldnt have shot charles hes marrying the mans ward you dont seem to understand the importance of that the wedding has been called off of course it has lettice is in mourning but by next springor in a quiet ceremony at christmas since shes got no family and needs marks support no charles himself stopped the wedding and thats why he was killed catherine shook her head called off the wedding before he died you cant be serious why would he joke about that why should i no mark was going to marry her and he will once this nonsense is finished ill help him find someone in london to take his case if you go through with this i refuse to believe that mark could have done anything of the sort or charles for that matter whoever told you such a thing is either crazy or vindictive or both i absolutely refuse to believe it he left soon afterward stiffly thanking her for the tea and then finding his own way out catherine said goodbye with equal reserve and added as he reached the solarium doorway his coat over his arm dont be hasty inspector you owe that to mark you owe it to charles be very sure before you act rutledge drove back to upper streetham and left the car at the rear of the inn going in by the door hed used on the night of his arrival the back stairs were empty the inn silent he felt bone weary emotion was drained out of him and his body ached with tension i need to find forrest he told himself i need to attend to that warrant bring wilton in the sooner the better and wheres he going hamish demanded hes no the kind of man wholl run or he wouldnt have been so good at killing germans shut up and keep out of it i thought you wanted to see the dashing captain hanged aye hamish said i do but im not ready to see you crawl back to yon clinic and doctors that will stuff your mind full of drugs easing you into oblivion where theres no pain and no memory and no guilt to savage you ive not finished with you yet ian rutledge and until i have i wont let you crawl away and hide an hour later rutledge found himself at sally davenants door the maid grace opened it to his knock and said yes sir ive come to see captain wilton will you tell him inspector rutledge is here on official business she caught the nuances in his voice and her face lost its trained mask of politeness concern filled her eyes and she said is there anything wrong sir just tell the captain im here if you please but hes in warwick sir he and mrs davenant have gone to dine there she wasnt herself all afternoon and the captain suggested an outing to take her mind off the unpleasantness at the church this morning i doubt theyll be back much before eleven oclock sir he swore under his breath very well tell him ill expect to see him here at eight oclock tomorrow morning he nodded and walked off down the scented path among the peonies and the roses there was actually a certain irony about that appointment he thought driving back to the inn it was exactly one week from the time charles harris died the rain came back in the night and rutledge lay there listening to it unable to sleep his mind turning over everything hed learned in the past four days thinking about the people the evidence the way it was coming out now one or two loose ends to finish tomorrow and then hed be on his way back to london but the funeral was on tuesday and he found himself wanting to be there to watch lettice walk down the aisle of the church onon whose arm to see her one more time and in the light to exorcise the witchery hamish had been so worried about he could contrive it there was enough to do he neednt hurry back to that tiny cubicle in london where his mind was dulled by routine and hamish had freer rein it wasnt a night for sleeping in spite of the rain drumming lightly on house roofs and muffling the normal sounds of the village rutledge could hear the gutters running a soft ominous rush that echoed in his head and once a carriage rattling down the high street the church clock tolled the quarter hours and still his mind moved restlessly in a kaleidoscope of images of catherine tarrants paintings vivid reflections of her inner force of lettice woods unusual eyes darkening with emotion of roystons shame as he watched the faces of parishioners outside the church of carfields swift retreat from confrontation of wiltons lonely grief and a childs terror of a woman hanging out clothes in the sunlight a goose penned in the yard behind her of sally davenants cool shell hiding emotions she couldnt afford to feel of charles harris man and monster alive and bloodily dead of mavers with his amber goats eyes at mallows lettice wood lay on her bed and wished with the fervor of despair that she could turn back the slowly moving hands of the ornate porcelain clock on the table by her pillow turn them back to that moment when she had said with the blitheness of loving ive never known such happinessi want it to go on and on foreveri want to feel it in old age and look back on years full of it and you in the center of it and his warm indulgent voice laughing at her promising my dear girl when have i ever been able to deny you anything you wanted well be together always as long as the seas run and the stars shine and the earth lasts is that pledge enough for you the seas still ran the stars still shone and the earth was there still but her happiness had poured out with a mans blood in a field of wildflowers and there was no way she could put it back again and there was nothingnothing that would turn back time to that single glorious gift of love catherine tarrant sat in her studio in a darkness lit by heat lightning the patter of rain on the surrounding glass a counterpoint to her tears on the easel in front of her was the wrapped portrait of rolf linden she didnt need to take the cloth off she knew it by heart but it was mark wilton she was thinking about and charles harrisand how the body ached with longing for a man who would never come back to her she could forget sometimes when she was painting or in london somehow charless death and marks dilemma had stirred her feelings into life again and left her vulnerable while memories like longburied ghosts crept around her in the silence she made herself remember too what she owed mark he was awake as well metaphorically setting his house in order arranging his affairs and steeling himself to meet what was coming there was no way out for him he had to accept that still hed found the courage he needed in france and it hadnt deserted him yet it would be there when he needed it now from hero to gallows bait a great comedown for a proud man he thought with heavy irony if only he could guess what lettice would dobut there was one final duty to perform and after a while he decided that the best way to achieve it was with honesty rather than guile but in a cottage on a hillside above upper streetham a small child slept with the deepness of death without dreams for the first time in days the rain had drifted away by morning and a watery sun soon broke through the clouds strengthening rapidly until there was a misty apricot light that warmed the church tower and touched the trees with gold rutledge walked out of the inn door and stood for a moment watching the early market goers hurrying to set up booths or find a bargain a low murmur of voices and laughter the noises of traffic people coming and goinghed seen markets like this in a hundred english towns peaceful and bustling a week ago a man had died on market day mavers had made his way through the crowds shouting agitating locked in hatred and a child had been frightened nearly to death but a traveler strolling through upper streetham this pleasant summer morning wouldnt hear about it wouldnt be touched by it none of the drama none of the misery none of the lasting pain showed he turned and moved briskly down the sidewalk stopping at dr warrens for a report on hickam the man had had rather a restless night warrens housekeeper reported but hed eaten a decent enough breakfast and seemed a little stronger thats when the craving for gin will return as he improves she added the poor soul isnt out of the woods yet i can tell you and what hell do with himself when hes well enough to go home is another worry im told he was a cabinetmaker before the war rut ledge said surprise spread across her face aye thats true id forgotten and very good he was but not anymore not with hands that shake like leaves she picked up the broom shed leaned against the wall while talking to him theyve already started the tremors but hes stronger than he looks which is a good thing rutledge thanked her and turned back to the inn walking around past the small gardens to the car ten minutes later he was pulling up in front of the davenant house grace let him in and sally davenant came to meet him as soon as she heard his voice she quickly glanced behind him to see if rutledge had brought sergeant davies with him looking decidedly relieved to discover that he was alone good morning inspector weve been sitting on the terrace having a last cup of coffee wont you join us he let her lead him to the french doors that opened onto a slatefloored stone terrace overlooking the gardens there was a wide sweep of lawn edged by trees and set with beautifully manicured borders a graceful and pleasing design that someonehe wondered if it had been mrs davenant herselfhad chosen to match the architectural grace of the house an air of peace pervaded it with birds singing in the trees and a low hum of bees working their way through the blossoms beyond the balustrade the flower beds looked rather bedraggled from the storm but the scent of stock and peonies and lavender drifted softly on the morning air someone had swept the rain from the terrace and a set of white chairs cushioned in a pattern of gray rose and white encircled a wroughtiron table the breakfast things had already been taken away but a coffee tray gleamed brightly in the center wilton got to his feet as they came out into the sunlight and stood by the table not speaking his eyes on rutledge another cup for the inspector please grace sally was saying over her shoulder then do sit down inspector mark they sat and when the cup came sally poured rut ledges coffee passing it to him with a practiced smile well i dont suppose that half of upper streetham will dare to show their faces at market this morning she began hiding her own feelings quite well under a pose of wry humor i told you before that man bert mavers is a danger to himself and everyone else how charles she stopped then said how anyone put up with him for this many years is a mystery to me i dont think the inspector came to discuss mavers wilton said you wanted to see me last night rutledge he tasted his coffee and then answered yes as a matter of fact but it will keep for the moment have you and royston and carfield completed the arrangements for tomorrows services wilton stared out over the lawns yes everythings in hand iwas planning to see lettice this morning to show her what wed done what was expected of her who would be here there has been a great deal of mail telephone calls wires royston and johnston have kept up with it between them but i know most of these people personally who they are what they represent sally can help lettice with the proper acknowledgments afterward as for the reception weve kept carfield out of it as much as possible disgust tightened his mouth as he turned to rutledge the mans a threat to sanity he told johnston hed be there most of today to oversee the preparations the flowers and so on royston had to tell him to his face that he wasnt needed that the church was his responsibility and nothing else and hell do that well enough writing the funeral oration probably kept him awake most of the night sally said generously he means well mark hes been a great comfort to agnes worried about poor little lizzie and when mary thorntons mother died he took care of everything but i understand how you feel hes had his eye on lettice since she came here in wilton glanced at rutledge but said nothing rutledge finished his coffee and pushed back his chair id like to speak to you privately wilton if you dont mind sally rose no no stay here ive things to see to but there were too many windows overlooking the gardens and the terrace voices carried wilton put his hand on her arm enjoy the sun my dear i wont be long he couldnt see the look she gave him as he got to his feet and courteously waited for rutledge to follow it was a mixture of emotions dread love and indecision wilton took rutledge to the small parlor where theyd talked on his first visit and closed the door standing there his back to it as he said i expected you to come with the sergeant and a warrant for my arrest i had planned to but it occurred to me that marching you to jail in front of all those people coming in to market would cause miss wood and your cousin unnecessary embarrassment if you go with me now of your own accord well see to this business as quietly as possible so its finished is it he moved away from the door and crossed to a chair gesturing impatiently for rutledge to be seated i know what you and harris quarreled about after dinner sunday evening in the lane monday morning he was calling off the marriage and you were furious with him there was no reaction in his face who told you this i have two witnesses i think theyre reliable enough a third can prove that harris was there in the lane another saw him speaking to you and lettice have you talked to her yes at first she denied it then she admitted that charles had for reasons of his own changed his mind about the marriage i see he faced rutledge quietly enough but a nerve at the corner of his mouth twitched after a time he said yes all right charles changed his mind i thought he was wrong and i told him so we argued i didnt think this was information that the world needed to know thats why i wouldnt explain it to you i felt thatgiven timelettice and i could work out the problem of what to do charles harris was a very strong influence in her life i had to keep that in mind then she went along with his decision wilton shook his head i never had the chance to ask her how she felt charles was shotshe was given sedatives by warrenand the wedding had to be called off anyway my god she was grieving i couldnt very well barge in there and say i love you i still want to marry you will you go through with it and be damned to society and then there was the funeral to discusshardly the proper ambience for a declaration of love is it nowi havent much to offer her now have i listening rutledge could hear the ring of truthand the suspicion of a lie he had to remind himself that mark wilton had spent four years in the air over france surviving on his wits surviving because he was intelligent kept his nerve never let himself be outwitted or outmaneuvered did she ask you if youd shot her guardian no it was curt haughty pride speaking what will you tell her when she does when youve been arrested that youve decided i did shoot harris that ill fight you in court and with any luck make you look like a fool he frowned im not a barrister but ive got a chance i think the evidence against me is circumstantial no one saw me with a gun no one saw me actually shoot the colonel calling off the wedding might damn me but well see about that he caught the fleeting expression in rutledges eyes and said oh yes ive thought it all through most of the night ive also considered something else youll probably win in the long run the trial will end with not proved rather than an acquittal and that doubt that shadow will hang over me for the rest of my life did i or didnt i kill harris in some respects thats worse than the gallows i cant possibly expect lettice to marry me knowing she might wonder in the middle of the night if i had done it then you wont come with me now and give yourself up if i do its an admission of guilt in the view of most people he rubbed his eyes tiredly i cant afford to damn myself youll have to arrest me without fanfare i can promise you there will be no trouble over it but it will have to be a warrant why did charles harris change his mind about you about the wedding what had you done to turn him against the marriage to rutledges surprise a smile flickered deep in wiltons eyes ah i expect that information did die with charles harris then the smile faded and he said quite soberly i need a favor from you rutledge i dont know if you can grant it but im asking you at least to consider it i want to go to the funeral with lettice she needs someone besides that idiot carfield or simon haldane whos kind enough but damned ineffectual the regiment is sending a representative but lettice doesnt know him hes a stranger it wont be easy for her with her guardian dead and her fiance in jail you can lock me in a room in the inn tonight if thats any use ill agree to any terms you like just let me do this one thing and ill be very grateful i cant postpone an arrest why do you think ill shoot myself when you arent looking or run to france the only hope i have of a normal life is proving i didnt shoot charles a trial is as important to me as it is to you give me twentyfour hours rutledge looked at him trying to read the man behind the handsome face was an extraordinary strength and a gamblers instincts high in the clouds pitting his wits against another man with death as the price of losing he had come through duel after duel almost unscathed it was a remarkable record and his nerve had never broken hamish whod been silent most of the morning stirred to life but yours did thats why youve lost your skills man youve broken nerve mind spirit you arent the hunter anymore youre the prey he forced himself to think ignoring the voice in the back of his mind wilton was waiting patient watchful he wanted this very badly and he didnt like begging dredging up his own instincts rutledge sorted them out and made his decision all right then twentyfour hours but if you trick me by god ill crucify you wilton shook his head it isnt for me its for lettice and driving back to the inn hamish was raging the witch again shes cast a spell on you with those strange eyes and youve lost your soul no rutledge said concentrating on the road im beginning to thinkhe dodged a big yellow dog ambling peacefully across his pathim beginning to think i might have found it youve got the manwitnessesthe shotgunthe reason why yon fine colonel needed to die that morning youve done your work man dont throw it away on the contrary ive stumbled around in the dark letting other people tell me what was happening ive been terrified that someone might see my own terrors and turn them against me ive dreaded failure and done very little to prevent it i was lostlostand couldnt find my way back to if i cant do any better than this i deserve to be locked away in that damned clinic with the other wretched dregs of humanity if i want to survive ive got to fight for it he spent the day organizing his evidence finishing his report before he began he put in a call to bowles in london and said ive got enough proof to ask for a warrant tomorrow at noon the case is as strong as i can make it but not without some problems i think a good kc can fill them in and well have our conviction bowles listening finally interrupted i hope to god you arent telling me were going to arrest wilton the palace called this morning they want to know whether to send a representative to the funeral wiltons marrying harriss ward tell them to send someone who knew harris he was a good soldier he served the king well it doesnt matter about wilton rutledge if youve got this wrong the yard will have your head do you hear me leave the man alone unless youve got such proof that christ himself couldnt find a way out of it i wont be responsible if you humiliate the palace and disgrace the yard i wont rutledge said with more firmness than he felt if i do youll have my resignation on your desk by wednesday morning a hell of a lot of good that will be man after the damage is done i know thats why im taking my time rutledge hung up so much for the confidence and support of his superiors he felt suddenly isolated alone but loneliness was also a strength when you trusted you were more vulnerable you gave yourself away he would have told someone about hamish long ago if hed trusted as long as it was his own private hell he was in a sense far safer no one could reach him no one could destroy him except he himself in the muddle that was now his life by late afternoon hed covered sheet after sheet with notes and a framework for his evidence satisfied that hed been thorough he reread the pages it wasnt a clever work of detection nor was it complete since there were no eyewitnesses to the death itself except for the child and the doll she had been in the meadow not surprisingly the shock of what shed seen had frightened her into the blankness of withdrawal the secure world of no feeling no thought no memory and yet she hadnt responded to wilton at all when he came to her room it was her father who terrified her her father who couldnt come near her without provoking wild and mindless screams he got up from the table hed been using as a desk and moved restlessly around the room hed never been a man to enjoy being shut up indoors all day long he thought that that had unconsciously been one of several reasons why hed failed to follow in his fathers footsteps at the bar but the war the aftermath of being buried alive in a trench had turned an ordinary dislike into an almost rabid claustrophobia and police work at least took him outside much of the time before the walls began to close in upon him as they were now picking up his coat he went out and down the stairs planning to walk no farther than the lane in front of the church outside the inn the market was drawing to a close stalls shut up and ready to load on wagons the last of the market goers straggling from shop to shop in front of the milliners he saw helena sommers in earnest conversation with laurence royston she was standing on the sidewalk and he was in one of charles harriss cars and she was wearing the same hat rutledge had glimpsed in the inn garden on sunday after maverss malicious attack on everyone in the churchyard then she smiled at royston stood back and he drove on noticing rutledge on the sidewalk he waved charles harris had been fortunate in his steward rutledge thought few men worked so devotedly on another mans property without a stake in it for themselves hed probably spent more time and love on mallows than harris had ever been able to give was that because hed never had a wife to lavish time and love on it was an interesting possibility helena crossed the street saw rutledge and paused good afternoon inspector she indicated a large box in her left hand i didnt bring a black hat with me and i felt i ought to attend the funeral tomorrow i didnt know the colonel well but i was a guest in his home it seemscourteousto attend mr royston has been kind enough to promise to send a car for me she looked tired as if aware of it she added the storm yesterday left us mired in mud i had to walk into town today there was no way to take out my bicycle maggie is always terrified of thunder so she didnt sleep much and neither did i but it seems to have cleared the air in more ways than one a beautiful day he agreed and ive spent enough of it indulging myself ill be on my way before you go i wonderdid you notice a child out in the fields a little girl picking wildflowers on the morning of harriss death either before or after you saw captain wilton on the path she frowned thoughtfully no but that doesnt mean she wasnt there i was using my field glasses i could well have missed her there are often children about and i try to avoid themwell they frighten off the birds im watching the pinter children are usually wandering here and there the little girl is a charmer but with any encouragement at all the boy talks your ear off she smiled wryly to take the sting out of her words hell make his mark as a politician ive no doubt at all about that maggie will be looking for me i must go she walked away with a countrywomans clean swift stride he watched her wondering again how much of her interest in birds was real and how much was an excuse to be out of the cottage as often as she could or perhaps her cousin preferred to have the house to herself safe familiar ground in a rather frightening world makebelieve in the place of reality he felt a sense of pity knowing how harsh life could be for the maggies illequipped to cope with anything more demanding than domestic chores and small comforts glancing at his watch he saw that hed have time for a drink before dinner hed earned it time enough afterward for the last task on his list rutledge was greeted at the door of the pinter house by a wary agnes farrell long rays of the sun still warm at nine thirty gave her face a glow that faded as soon as she stepped back to allow him to enter the thinness of long nights of no sleep the sallowness of stress were marked in the dimness of the narrow passage between the door and the parlor how is the child he asked smiling down at her trying to be reassuring well enough she answered doubtfully eating sleeping but grieving somehow clutching that doll as if it was a lifeline meg appeared behind her mother wiping her hands on a dishcloth inspector she asked anxiously the childs illness had worn her too the confidence of youth lost the dread of death haunting her buoyed only by a blind hope that soon it would all be back as it had been normal and comforting good evening mrs pinter ive come to have a look at lizzie he said as if it was an ordinary thing to do on a monday evening if i may she glanced at her mother and then said uncertainly yes sir both women stepped back allowing him to enter and from their attitude he gathered that they were alone in the house that ted pinter hadnt returned from the haldane stables he had chosen his time well he thought with relief he began to move toward lizzies small room saying something about the lovely day that had followed the rain in an attempt to set them at ease they followed close together for comfort a lamp was burning on the low table and the child stared up at him as he came in with large sober dark blue eyes he wasnt really sure she saw him in the sense of comprehending that he was a stranger someone she didnt know and wasnt used to because there was no spark of curiosity no quick look at her mother to see if all was well instead there was an apathy about her still but she wasnt screaming and he took that as a good sign what did dr warren have to say he asked over his shoulder agnes answered he said it was what hed hoped might happen but didnt expect and wed have to see if this new quietness lasted in truth sir i think he was more than worried she might die she was wasting so fast meg added shes not in the clear yet as if hoping rutledge might take the hint and go now that hed done what he came to do instead he walked over to the bed lizzie imera friend of dr warrens he asked me to come and see you tonight in his place her eyes had followed him watched him but she said nothing he went on talking to her for several minutes telling her hed seen a woman with a basket of strawberries at market and a man with a dog that did tricks but nothing touched the blankness on her face rutledge wasnt accustomed to children but hed seen enough of the sad refugees on the roads of francehungry frightened tiredto know that it wasnt very likely that hed be able to break through the barrier of her silence on his own not without days of careful groundwork to gain her confidence he thought about it for a time watching those blue eyes wondering what the best way of reaching her might be he didnt have days to give hamish said softly your jean has such eyes your children might have been fair and very like lizzie turning to agnes rutledge said do you have a rocking chair surprised she answered aye sir a nursing rocker in the kitchen show me she did and he saw that he had come just at the end of their meal there was a chicken partly carved on the counter a bowl of potatoes sat on the table next to a half loaf of bread and a plate of pickles and dishes were stacked in a wash pan in the sink while a big kettle whistled softly on the stove the nursing rockersmall and without arms to allow a woman to breastfeed comfortablystood by the hearth worn but serviceable he carried it back to the bedroom turned it with its back to the doorway and said to meg youll want to finish in the kitchen then ill have a cup of tea if i may and a few questions for you she didnt want to leave but agnes said go on meg ill call you if i need you but meg still went out reluctantly looking back over her shoulder at rutledge with worried eyes rutledge waited until he could hear the familiar clatter of dishes and then said to agnes i dont want to frighten the child or make her uncomfortable but if youll sit here and hold her rock her as you must do sometimes she nodded good ill be here by the door and when shes settled at ease ill tell you what to say to her i dont know sir it wont harm her it might help andi need to know what she saw there in the meadow where colonel harris was shot i cant take the chance what if she saw the murder what if thats the thing that sent her into this decline we dont want to lose her not now she was an intelligent woman she knew the risk he was going to run trust me he told her gently let me at least try and so she went to the bed lifted the child in her arms talking in that soft singsong mothers the world over know by heart lizzie whimpered but seemed content enough when agnes went no farther than the chair sat down and began slowly to rock humming under her breath afraid shed soon put the child to sleepin fact he thought that might be her intentionrutledge said quietly ask her if she saw a man with a shotgun did you see a man carrying a gun love a big long gun that made a big noise did you see that love lizzie didnt stir did the noise scare you loud and nasty was it nothing agnes repeated her questions varying the words probing over and over again but lizzie was silent and still awake ask her if she remembers losing her doll that elicited no response although agnes tried several variations on that theme too but lizzie began to pluck restlessly at the front of agness apron its no good sir well try a different tack then ask herask her if she saw the big horse agnes crooned to the child to soothe her and then said softly in the same tones was there a big horse my lamb a big shining horse in the meadow was he standing still or riding along did you see the big horse lizzie stopped sucking her thumb eyes wide tense listening rutledge could hear meg in the kitchen speaking to someone in a low voice or singing to herself he couldnt tell which it was he swore silently irritated by the distraction and a man on its back did the big horse carry a man on its back high in the saddle the way you ride with your pa did you see the man love just like papa on the horse did you see his face the words were hardly out of her mouth before lizzie went rigid and began to scream the sudden change was alarming in the quiet room and agnes cried out now now loveydont fret sir papa papa papa papa nonodont lizzie screamed the words tumbling over one another the doll clutched tight as she struggled in her grandmothers arms meg came running and behind her were other footsteps rutledge had gone to agnes his back to the door and was bending over the child speaking to her when he was caught from behind and thrown hard against the wall scraping his cheek and all but knocking the breath out of him a mans voice was roaring dont touch herlet her be damn you let her be rutledge wheeled and ted pinter face distorted with rage charged at him again lizzie was standing rigidly in her grandmothers lap eyes squeezed shut shrieking nono no over and over again rutledge was grappling with pinter meg was shouting ted dont and her husband was yelling shes suffered enough god blast you i wont have her hurt anymore and then the little girl stopped screaming so suddenly that the silence shocked them all halting pinter in his tracks over his shoulder rutledge could see the childs face startled mouth wide in a forgotten scream her eyes were half scrunched closed half opened but the lids were lifting until they were wide unbelieving and then she was holding her arms out straining against her grandmothers shoulder a huge and shining smile on her tearstreaked face ted had turned toward her and as she said in wonder papa he made a wordless sound in his throat and went to her pulling her into his arms against his chest his features were crumpled with tears his head bent over his daughter meg was hanging on his arm half cradling both of them weeping too agnes both hands over her heart as if to keep it from leaping out of her chest was on her feet also staring at rut ledge with consternation in her eyes rutledge as stunned as they were stared back uncertain what hed done behind his eyes hamish was saying over and over again shes naught but a childa child the sunset was a thin red line on the western horizon as rutledge drove back into upper streetham his body was tired his mind a tumult of images and probabilities he made his way though the quiet inn and upstairs to his room shutting the door behind him and standing there lost in thought if the childs evidence was rightand he would have wagered his life that it wasmavers couldnt have shot harris well hed been almost sure of that from the perspective of timing an outside possibility a dark horse attractive as mavers was as a suspect but a closerun thing if hed actually done the killing but what else had lizzie changed the doll had been beside the hedge at the edge of the meadow half hidden under the spill of branches and leaves from that vantage point then lizzie had seen a horse and rider the man she was most accustomed to seeing on a horse was her own father living in the little cottage over on the other side of the hill at the end of a long and rutted road the pinter family was more or less out of the mainstream of village life yes lizzie had seen any number of horses lizzie had seen any number of menand womenriding but the man she was most accustomed to seeing and when she heard the horse coming toward her out there in the fields where shed been searching for wildflowers she had run toward the sound expecting to find her father but it wasnt tom pinter on that horse it was charles harris thundering toward her his horse already frightened and bolting only she hadnt known that for she hadnt been able to see the riders face instead shed seen only a bloody stump on a mans body and if her sudden screams had startled the horse making it shy away from her the gruesome burden on its back might finally have fallen out of the saddle faceor rather chestdown on the grass but lizzie in terror believing that the awful thing covered in blood was her own father had fled dropping the doll or had she been in the meadow earlier dropped the doll remembered where shed left it and on her way to fetch it encountered the specter of death he wasnt sure it mattered what did matter was that lizzie had been in the meadow had seen charles harris on horseback already dead but she hadnt seen the gun she hadnt seen wilton she hadnt been frightened by a loud noise at close range and the killer hadnt seen her which meant that charles harris might not have been killed in that meadow sergeant davies had said from the beginning that he wasnt sure exactly where harris had been shot but assuming that the pellets driving into his head and body had thrown him violently out of the saddle he would have dropped no more than a few feet either way from the scene of the killing i should have looked at the body and something elsethe fact that harris had been found on his chest not his back if hed been shot out of the saddle hed have gone down on his back if he fell out of the saddle after his horse had bolted the dead mans knees spasmodically gripping the animals sides in the muscle contractions of death if he fell out he might well have gone down on his face hamish whispering in the darkness that filled the room said you remember stevens dont you he was hit and ran on for a yard or more without a head to lead him and you had to pry the rifle out of his hands they were gripping it so tight as if he were still killing germans even though he didnt know it and mactavish who was heart shot and taylor who got it in the throat death seized them in an instant but they held on it was true hed seen it happen moving toward the bed he turned up the lamp and then walked across to the windows rested his hands on the low sill and looked out into the silent street a cool breeze touched the trees then brushed his face in the open window but he didnt notice where had harris been killed not that it matteredif the colonel hadnt been shot in the meadow it simply gave wilton more time to reach mav erss cottage pick up the gun and track him down but closer to the house someone might have seen him pull the trigger or heard the shot yet no one had come forward mark wilton had the best possible motive still rutledge had been involved with other cases where the best motive wasnt necessarily the one that counted mark wilton was by his own admission near the scene hed quarreled with the colonel because the wedding was going to be called off which made the timing of the death right to kill harris before hed made public what hed decided to do all the same rutledge knew hed feel better when hed answered the final two questions one why had harris called off the wedding and two where precisely had harris been shot rutledge straightened pulled off his tie and took off his coat there wasnt very much he could do tonight in the dark when everyone else was sound asleep but he found himself retying his tie picking up the coat again almost driven to action when it wasnt possible to take any action at all buffeted by the strongest feeling that time was running out wilton had said he wouldnt shoot himself he wouldnt take the gentlemans way out before he was arrested convicted and hanged but that was assuming he was innocent and could see that there was truly a chance for a very bright barrister to prove that there wasnt enough evidence to bring in a conviction if he was guilty however rutledge was almost sure that wilton wouldnt do anything rash before the funeral for lettices sake rather than his own but afterward bowles and the yardand the kingwould probably rejoice if wilton never came to trial but rutledge far from wanting his pound of flesh was determined to have that trial to prove or disprove his evidence to finish what hed begun with a carefully constructed suicide note left behind wilton could appear to be the victim not the villain he could leave behind enough doubt to overshadow anything hickam and that child and mrs grayson might say the case couldnt be closed in such uncertain circumstances without turning down the lamp rutledge walked out of the room down the stairs and out the garden door to his car it made a racket starting up in the stillness but there was nothing he could do about it the first of the funeral guests to arrive were probably sleeping and wouldnt hear it anyway he turned toward mallows driving fast his headlamps scouring the road with brightness but at the estate gates he changed his mind and stopped just inside them turning off his headlamps and pulling off into the rhododendrons that grew high and thick under the trees getting out of the car he stood still for a time listening a dog barking off in the far distance a lonely bark not an alarm an owl calling from the trees behind the house the light breeze sighing overhead he started to walk then giving the house as wide a berth as he could and soon found himself in the fields above it lying between mallows proper and the haldane lands moving through the darkness minding where he put his feet he kept the house to his right it was dark and the windows of lettices rooms shone like black silver in the night in the back there was a single light in one of the upper rooms where hed seen the servants quarters he could hear horses moving quietly in the stables stamping a foot rustling about in the straw and somewhere a groom coughed hed done enough reconnaissance missions during the war to move as silently as the night around him his dark clothes blending with the trees and the shrubs and the hedges and he was careful never to cast long shadows or hurry for an hour or more he roamed the fields above mallows looking for a likely place where a killer was safe out of sight of the house out of hearing where none of the tenants might stumble over him accidentally and see that shotgun but there was nothing that spoke to him no vantage point that caught his fancy look at it again rutledge told himself you were a ground soldier youd see it differently wilton flew his eye for terrain might not be as sharp as yours all right then a clump of saplings here a high hedge full of summernesting birds there a dip in the land like a bowl or dell where someone might quietly loiter a section of the roseclotted wall that separated the haldane land from mallows they were all possibilities the saplings in particular offered a shield from the house and thick brambles in which to conceal a shotgun and the hedgerow in one or two spots was almost as good for the most part the wall was too open especially on this side and the dell had no cover at all another thought struck him betrothed to lettice or not wilton would attract more notice on mallows land than would say royston who had every reason to move about in his daily tasks or lettice who lived there and had had the run of the place since she was a child in the spring with the fields plowed and the crops growing you left tracks but davies and forrest had assumed that charles was killed in the meadow and hadnt looked for tracks or blood or bits of flesh and bone finally he turned back still uneasy still driven by something he couldnt define not so much knowledge as a sense of alarm a distinct frisson that rippled along his nerves like the breeze rippling softly through his hair in front of mallows in the open where there was just enough ambient light he looked at his watch it was after two decent christian folk are all in their beds hamish began rutledge ignored him mallows was a house of mourning and charles had no close relatives most of the funerals guests would be staying the night in warwick or at the shepherds crook in upper streetham lettice would be alone as she had been for the past week since her guardians death there wouldnt be an opportunity to see her in the morning before the services beganand it would be callous to try afterward there was the reception that the vicar had his heart set upon no opportunity to speak to her then and after the reception time might have run out he turned and walked across the gravel of the drive to the front door with its black wreath darker than the night on the wooden panels after a moment he rang the bell and in the stillness fancied he heard it echo through the house like some gothic tale of latenight callers bringing bad tidings his sister had gone through a stage of reading them just before bedtime shivering under the covers with a mixture of horror and delight or scratching at his door for comfort when shed succeeded in terrifying herself too much to sleep rutledge was still smiling when johnston opened the door eyes heavy with sleep clothes stuffed on haphazardly he stared at rutledge recognizing him after a moment then said whats happened i have to speak to miss wood its urgent but dont frighten her theres nothing wrong inspector do you know what time it is man i cant wake miss wood at this hourtheres the funeral tomorrow shell need her sleep yes i know and im sorry but i think shed rather see me now than just as shes leaving for the church it took persuasion and a pulling of rank but in the end johnston went up the stairs into the darkness leaving rut ledge in the halflit hall after a time he could hear someone coming heels tapping on the floor it was lettice face still flushed with sleep hair falling in dark waves down her back a dark green dressing gown on over her night wear she came slowly down the stairs with her eyes on him and he said im sorry i wouldnt have come if it hadnt been so important it wont take long i promise you whats wrong is something wrong she asked no yes im in a quandary of sorts i need to talk to you she hesitated at the foot of the stairs looked toward the door of the drawing room then made up her mind come this way to the small parlor he followed her there and she found the lights bringing an almost blinding brightness into the room turning in the middle of the floor she gestured to a chair for him and then curled up on the sofa drawing her legs under her as if for warmth without the sun the room did seem chill comfortable to him after his long walk in the fields but cold to her after the warmth of bed as he sat down he saw that the soles of his shoes and one trouser leg had mud on them she saw it too and asked where have you been walking thinking look ill tell you whats bothering me i went to arrest captain wilton thisyesterdaymorn ing and he asked me to wait until after the funeral tomor rowthismorning it made sense i could see no reason to cause any more grief or embarrassment for you frowning she said yes thats true id rather not face it alone but youre telling me that the man whos accompanying me to the services is charless murderer the man wholl be sitting beside me while i grievei dont see how that will make it any easier for me or for mark do you think i only care about appearances i survived last monday morning alone i can survive this i hadnt expected to be telling you any of this not until afterward but you know where my suspicionsand the evidencehave been pointing she brushed a heavy fall of hair out of her face and said quietly yes you know ive learned about the source of the quarrel that the marriage was being called off you told me yourself that charles had decided to do it yes its motive miss wood it explains why charles had to die that particular morningthat monday not seventeen years ago or six months from now or next friday all right i can see that iid considered it myself which brought him back to his first impression of her that shed known who the killer was but i need to know why your guardian called off the marriage what does mark say she countered rutledge leaned forward in his chair trying to reach her with his words with the sense of haste driving him he says the reason isnt important that it died with charles but i think it may be very important in fact its crucial im concerned you see that if the cause was serious enough wilton might prefer not to stand trial and have it brought out into the open afraid that in the end wed discover what it was and use it in court and the whole world would hear what it was im afraid that he mightchoose the gentlemans solution instead shoot himself tears came to her eyes darkening them but hovered behind the lids not spilling over are you quite sure inspector i wouldnt have come tonight if i hadnt been sure it could happen not that it wouldbut that it could he said forcing himself to honesty but if i tell youyoure the police youll know what it is and then itll happen just as hes afraid it might and ill be the cause of it before he could deny it she said no i cant tell you something and then afterward say that i didnt mean it that you must forget id said it you cant forget it its your job you seetheres no separating the man from the job lettice he wasnt even aware that hed used her name no ive lost charles nothing will ever bring him back im going to lose mark one way or another i feel enough guilt already i wont add to it i tell you i wont the tears spilled over and she ignored them her eyes on his face have you ever been in love inspector so in love that your very lifes blood belonged to someone else and then just when it seemed that everything was wrapped in joy and you were the luckiest most fortunate most cherished person in the world had it snatched away without warning stripped from you without hope or sense or explanation just taken yes he said getting to his feet and walking to the window where she couldnt see his face it would be easy to say that the war came between us jean and me all those years of separation but i know its something deeper than that shes frightened by thethe man who came back the ian rutledge she wanted to marry went away in and the army sent a stranger home in his place five years later she doesnt even recognize him anymore as far as that goes im not sure that shes the girl i remember somehow shes grown into a woman who lives in a world ive lost touch with and i cant find my way back to it i came home expecting to turn back the clock you cant it doesnt work that way he stopped realizing that hed never even told frances that much no she said simply watching him seeingalthough he wasnt aware of ithis reflection in the dark glass you cant turn back the clock to where its safe and comfortable again his back was still toward her his thoughts far away she said dont put this burden on me inspector rutledge dont ask me to make a decision for mark wilton i already have just by coming here damn you he turned saw the flush of anger and hurt on her face and then out of nowhere he had his answer as if it had come through the night to touch him but he knew how it had comefrom his own recognition of the pain and the loss hed sensed from the start in her lettice wood wasnt grieving for mark wilton she was grieving for charles harris and it was charles harris that she loved who had come between her and the wedding in september who had called off the wedding because he wanted his ward andshe wanted him she saw something in his expression that warned her just in the last split second she was off the sofa in a flash on her way out of the room running away from him to the safety and comfort of her own apartments rutledge caught her arm swung her around held her with a grip that was bruising but she didnt notice she was struggling to free herself her dark hair flying in swirls around his face and hands its true isnt it tell me nono let me go i wont be a part of this ive killed charles ive got his blood on my soul and i wont kill mark as well let me go you loved himdidnt you he demanded shaking her god help meoh yes i loved him were you ever in love with mark she stopped struggling standing almost frozen in his hands then she began speaking wearily disjointedly as if it took more strength than she could muster and yet she didnt try to hide her face or those strange remarkable eyes did i ever love him oh yesi thought i did charles brought him home he believed id like him love him and i did i told myself that what id felt for charles was only a girls crush a silly thing you grow out of and id better hurry before id harmed what wed had between us since the beginning when i was a small frightened childan affection that was deep and caring and wonderfully comforting she took a deep breath as if steadying herself but tuesdaytwo weeks ago nowi was in the drawing room just finishing with flowers for the vases there and charles came in and ii dont know one of the bowls slipped somehow as i was lifting it back onto the bookshelf and he reached for me before it could fall on me and hurt me and the next thing i knewi was in his arms i was being held against his heart and i could hear it beating as wildly as mine and he kissed me her eyes closed for a moment reliving that kiss then they opened and he saw emptiness in them pain he stopped swearing at himself telling me it was nothingnothing and he was gone just like that i searched everywhere i finally found him he was having lunch at the inn and he took me outside into the garden where no one could overhear and he said it wasnt love it was just that hed been away from london too long hed needed a woman too long and touching me had made him forget who i was it was only his need speaking but it wasnt true it wasnt charles it was what we both felt and i was sure of it he wouldnt speak to me about it for days wouldnt listen to me stayed away from me as if i had the plague or something and then on saturdayi waited until hed gone up to his room and i came to the door and said i wasnt marrying mark that it wasnt fair to mark and that the wedding would have to be called off anyway and he just said all right as if id told him the cat had just had kittens or the rain had brought grasshoppers with itsomething that didnt matter but on sundayon sunday i went to his room again when he was dressing for dinner and he didnt hear me come in i caught him by surprise standing there buttoning his cuff links and when he looked upand i saw his facei ran there was suchsuch depth of love in his eyes as he looked up at me i couldnt bear it he came after me told me he was sorry hed frightened me and then he was kissing me again and the room was whirling about and i couldnt breathe i couldnt thinkmark had never ever made me feel like that hehe was aloof somehow as if his head was still in the clouds with his planes as if his heart was shut off somewhere and i couldnt touch it but charles wasnt that way and i didnt care then whether charles married me or not there wouldnt be anyone else in my life he let me go he told me to think clearly and carefully not to make a quick judgment that there was such a difference in our ages that i couldnt be sure and neither could he what we were feeling he talked about honor and dutyabout going away for a whileand i smiled and said id not be hasty but i knew i didnt need to consider and i was the happiestthe happiest woman on earth at that moment i didnt even think about mark and i paid for it the next morning because we had one night together charles and i and that was all all that ill have to take with me as far as my grave because it was beyond anything ive ever known and could ever hope to feel whatever happens to me i didnt go riding that morning rutledge heard those words again in the far corners of his mind lettice answering his question about how charles had behaved on the morning after the quarrel she hadnt lied shed told him the truth only in a fashion that she alone knew was an evasion for she had seen him that morning i didnt want pity i didnt want people pointing at me saying id had a love affair with charles and was the cause of his death i thought there would be enough evidencesome thingwitnessesthat would lead you to his killer without me when you came that first time i thought the only happiness id ever have again was seeing mark hang and then i realized with sergeant davies standing there by the door that anything i said would be common knowledge in the village before dinner and now how do you feel about wilton now rut ledge asked breaking the silence lettice shook her head i know he must have killed charles it makes sense the way it happened buti still cant see mark shooting him down in hot blood obliterating him wreaking such a terrible vengeance hes notdevious by nature not passionate or impulsive theres an uprightness in him a strength he wouldnt have fought to keep you hed have fought she said quietly but in his own way it was after eight when rutledge woke up the next morning head heavy with sleeplessness that had pursued him most of the night hed heard the church clock chime the hours until it was six oclock and light enough to see the birds in the trees outside his window before hed drifted into a drowsing sleep that left him as tired as hed been when he went to bed hed stayed with lettice an hour or more sitting with her until she felt able to sleep he thought it had been a relief to talk that shed feel better afterward but her last words to him as he began to close the heavy front door behind him were if i had it to do over id have loved him just the same i only wish i hadnt lost my courage now and said more than i meant to say i know shed cocked her head to one side looking at him her eyes sad yes i think you do dont humiliate mark if hes guilty hang him if you must but dont break him i give you my word hed said and hamish had quarreled with him all the way back to upper streetham rutledge had a hasty breakfast and went directly to the dav enant house but grace the maid informed him that the captain had already left for mallows and mrs davenant had gone with him as far as the church to see to the flowers he came back to town and found that there was already a gathering of people in the lane near the church though it was only a little after nine cars and carriages were lined up having brought guests from warwick and elsewhere and small groups were standing about talking quietly the church bell began to toll soon after ninethirty deep sonorous welling out over the countryside the hearse had already drawn up and the casket oak and bronze had been carried inside by men from charless regiment acting as pallbearers their uniforms red as blood in the sunlight rutledge walked about looking to see if sally was indeed in the church and found her giving instructions about the placement of wreaths in front of the coffin carfield magnificent in flowing robes was already greeting the mourners moving among them like a white dove in flocks of crows he went back outside catherine tarrant arrived saw him nodded and walked quickly to the church not looking to the right or left the women from upper streetham made a point of cutting her dead as she passed but several people from london spoke to her as if they knew her rutledge stopped sergeant davies when he arrived and asked have you seen royston i need to speak to him he wanted an invitation to the reception to keep an eye on wilton and he wanted to ask royston about the place where charles might have been killed davies shook his head he was supposed to be here and greet these people mr haldane is over there speaking to some of them beyond carfield the one with the fair hair rutledge could see the tall slim figure moving quietly from group to group sally davenant came out to join hal dane just as the car arrived with lettice wood and mark wilton she got out swathed in veils of black silk moving gracefully toward a half dozen officers who had turned to meet her she spoke to them nodding her head high back straight wilton just behind her with a quiet thoughtful expression someone from the war department came over rutledge recognized him from londonand then she moved on impressively calm and leaving behind her looks of admiration and warmth its a bloody show hamish was saying we stacked our dead like lumber or buried them to keep them from smelling and heres a right spectacle thatd shame an honest soldier rutledge ignored him scanning the gathering crowd as they moved through the lychgate and up the walk toward the open doors of the church overhead the bell began to count the years of the dead mans life and he saw lettice stumble wilton took her arm to steady her and then she was herself again he let them go inside and walked down to where the mallows car had been parked near the lychgate ready to take lettice back in time for the reception wheres royston rutledge asked the neatly uniformed groom sitting in the drivers seat has he already arrived i dont know sir i havent seen him at all the man said touching his cap mr johnston was looking for him just before we left inspector forrest came hurrying by on his way to the service the tolling had stopped and from inside the church the organ rose in solemn majesty the lower notes carrying the sense of loss and sorrow that marked the beginning of a funerals salute to the dead rutledge called to him keep an eye on wilton dont let him out of your sight its important ill do that sir he promised over his shoulder not stopping uncertainty that same sense of time passing of tension and of waiting swept him he wasnt sure why looking up he saw mavers hurrying past the end of the court head down and shoulders humped dr warrens car turning in to the court moved quickly to a space in front of one of the houses across from the lych gate warren got out saying to rutledge as he passed hick ams the sameneither better nor worse but holding on and eating a little why arent you in the church i dont know rutledge answered but warren had gone on not hearing on impulse rutledge walked around the church trying to see if mavers had taken the path up to his house in the fields but the man had vanished he kept on walking climbed over the churchyard wall and struck out into the fields but by the time hed reached the crossbar of the h that led to the other paththe one that skirted charles harriss fields and mallows landhe turned that way instead his back to maverss house soon he came to the hedge and the meadow and the copse of trees where the body had been found it had seemed very different last night in the dark somehow thicker more sinister full of ominous shadows nowit was a copse open and sunlit shafts of light like spears lancing down through the trees butterflies danced in the meadow rutledge moved on dozens of feet and two rainstorms had swept the land clean of any signs that might have led him to the answer he needed where had charles harris died where was the blood the small fragments of bone the sun was warm the air quiet and still some quirk of the land brought the sound of singing to him from the church a hymn he remembered from childhood a mighty fortress appropriate to a soldiers death hamish who had been quiet tense and watchful in his mind like something waiting to pounce in the vast secretive recesses of emotion said suddenly i dont like it ive been on patrol on nights when the huns were filtering like smoke out of the trenches and my skin crawled with fear it isnt night rutledge said aloud the sound of his voice was no comfort only intensifying his sense of something wrong he moved from field to field it hadnt taken long not more than twenty minutes since hed left the churchyard unconsciously hed lengthened his stride early on and now he was sweating with the effort but he couldnt slow down it was almost as if something drove him the saplings were not far now but what was it what was behind this dreadful sense of urgency from the start hed been afraid hed lost any skills hed once had hed tried to listentoo hard perhapsfor any signs that theyd survived and found only emptiness and yetlast night hed come close to feeling the intuition that had once been his gift hed followed his instincts not the dictates of others theyd been certain harris had died where hed fallen theyd been certain that no one in the village could have killed the colonel theyd been certain there was no case against wilton and hed found one he had his murderer didnt he then why didnt he feel the satisfaction that ordinarily came with the solution of a vicious crime because his evidence was circumstantial not solid or because there was still something hed overlooked something that hed have seen five years ago something thatbut for his own emotional tensionshed have thought of long before this he went through the stand of saplings without being aware of them his feet guiding him without conscious volition something was missing or someone yes that was it hed spoken to everyone of consequence in his interviews except one hed never asked maggie sommers what shed seen or heard that last morning of charles harriss life hed assumed she knew nothing and yet she lived across a stone wall from mallows land and colonel harris sometimes rode that way shed learned to return his wave shy as she was had harris passed the cottage that last morning had maggie seen anyone else rutledge swore impatient with her timidity hed treated heras everyone else didas all but witless he was in the fields now heavy with the scent of raw earth and sunlight what did she know that no one had thought to ask she would be the last person to come forward voluntarily that would have been unbearable agony for her and yetnow that he was sure the murder had happened somewhere other than the meadowher evidence could easily be critical it could damn wilton to the hangmanor free him for that matter maggie he realized could very well hold the key to this murder and hed overlooked it he glanced toward the distant stone wall seeing it with new eyes maggie hanging clothes on the line on monday mornings maggie working in her overgrown garden maggie always at home and close enough to mallows here to hear a horseman in the fields or a shotgun going off nearby maggie seeing the murderer for all he knew waiting among the trees or in the dell or coming over the rise maggie anxious and afraid of strangers watchful and wary so that she could hide herself inside the cottage before she herself was seen and a lurking killer unaware of a witness hed never even glimpsed and this was the time to speak to her while helena was at the funeral he doubled his pace as if afraid now that hed remembered her that she might be gone before he got there cursing himself for his blindness for seeing with his eyes and not with that intuitive grasp of people hed always had ahead he could hear something unidentifiable at first a loud insistent repetitive it was the goose at the sommers cottage something had upset the bird he could tell from the wild sound rising and falling without so much as a breath in between rutledge broke into a run ignoring the neat rows of young crops under his feet stumbling in the soft earth keeping his balance with an effort of will his eyes on the rosedraped wall that separated mallows from haldane land and the sommers cottage helena was coming into town for the services maggie was alone he could hear screams now high and wordless and a mans bellow of pain he was no longer running he was covering the ground with great leaps risking his neck he knew but unable to think of that as the screams reached a crescendo of something beyond pain reaching the wall he rested his palms on the edge of it swung his body over in one movement paying no heed to the long thornlaced roses that pulled at his clothes his feet landed among maggies pathetic little flowers on the far side of the wall trampling them heedlessly there was a motorcar in the drive down by the gate it was empty and he ignored it springing for the cottage seeing him coming the goose wheeled from her stand near the cottage door and sailed toward him wings out neck low prepared for the attack he brushed her roughly aside and was ten yards from the door when it burst open and a man came reeling out his face a mask of blood his shirt torn and soaked to crimson his trousers slashed and smeared it was royston something had laid open his shoulder rutledge could see the bluewhite sheen of bone thereand he plunged heavily off the steps and into the grass hardly aware of rutledge sliding to a halt almost in his path regardless of the pain he was inflicting rutledge caught him by his good shoulder and swung him around anger twisting his face into a grimace as he shouted damn you what have you inside the screaming went on watch her royston cried shes gotgot an ax his knees buckled the childthe child rutledge managed to break his fall but royston was losing blood rapidly his words weaker with every breath the childi killed without waiting for any more rutledge was through the door eyes seeing nothing after the glare of the sun but ahead of him was something a figure barely glimpsed a woman in black huddled on the floor at the end of the brown sofa two darknesses blending into one like some distorted parody of humanity humped and ugly a primeval dread lifted the hairs along his arms reaching her he grasped her shoulders saying are you all right has he hurt you what has he done to you she stared up at him face chalk white eyes large and wild in one bloody hand was an ax his own eyes were adjusting rapidly now the room was empty except for maggie and the assorted furnishings of a rented house he got her up on the sofa and she leaned back eyes closed is he dead she asked breathlessly in the voice of a terrified child noi dont think so she tried to get up but he pressed her back against the sofa holding her there trying to determine how much of the blood was hers how much roystons ill have to get helpill find helena and bring her to youshes at the church but maggie was shaking her head dazed but at least able to understand him her eyes turned toward the closed door at the far end of the room shes in there maggie whispered rutledge felt his blood run cold ill go noleave her i hope shes dead he mistook her meaning thinking that she was saying that death was preferable to the cataclysm of rape i saw her kill him she went on not taking her eyes from the bedroom door i saw her she shot colonel harris and it was for nothing it wasnt the right manshed thought it was but mavers saidand then that man out there admitted it was true that hed killed the child what child he asked thinking only of lizzie why little helena of course mr royston ran over her in his carin colonel harriss car and the check he sent was in the colonels name so we thoughtall these years we thoughtbut it wasnt the colonel helena got it all wrong there was a sudden spark of triumph in her eyes as if it gave her some obscure pleasure to think that helena had been wrong aunt mary and uncle martin always said she was better than i was so pretty so smart so fearlessthey said they wished the car had killed me not helena i was only adopted you see i wasnt theirs there was a lifetime of suffering in her words a lifelong misery because the wrong child had died in an accident and she had been blamed for living they asked for all that money and it wasnt enough to satisfy them they wanted her back again but she was dead and i was alive he wasnt interested in maggies childhood he had a man bleeding to death on his hands and god knew what behind that closed silent bedroom door so when helena discovered that the colonel lived here just across the wallthat he was our neighbor getting up from his knees his breathing still erratic and harsh he ignored maggie and started across the room to the bedroom forcing himself to face what had to be faced hamish had been babbling for the last five minutes a counterpoint to maggies slow painful confession but rutledge shut him out shut out everything but the long bright streak of blood down the door panel on the handle of the knob somehow maggie was there before him no leave her alone i tell you i wont let you go near herlet her die and with such swiftness that he couldnt have stopped her if his own life had depended upon it she was through the door and into the room turning the key in the lock behind her maggie he shouted pounding on the door but he could hear only her sobbing shed taken the ax with her there was nothing to do but try to break the door down with his shoulder or kick it down it took him three tries when it finally swung wide on broken hinges he was into the room before he could regain his balance there was only one bed narrow neatly made now covered in blood and only maggie collapsed across the pretty lemoncolored counterpane like a heap of rags stained and worn the ax was on the floor at her feet he turned wildly surveying the small room finding no one else the window closed the closet empty then he was beside the woman on the bed leaning over her lifting her gently black lifeblood welled beneath her thick and pungent the heavy ivory handled knife had plunged too deep there was nothing he could do her eyes were not able to see him but she was still alive just i had to do it she said i couldnt stand it anymore she knew that she always knew things before i ever did but for once she was wrongabout the colonel shell go to hell wont she for killing him and ill go to heaven with the angels wont i we couldnt share anymore not with that on her conscience where did she kill him rutledge asked by the wall when he came to speak to maggie she had the shotgun hidden there among the roses where he couldnt see it and she tried to ask him if hed been the one driving the car that killed helena but he wouldnt listen he told her not to be a fool that she was upset and not thinking clearly so she shot himshe lifted the gun and shot him and his head flew everywhere and the horse bolted before hed stopped bleeding and it was the most awful her voice faded he could see the blood trickling out of her mouth the way the body lay graceless and heavy it would only be a matter of minutes there was nothing he could do to stop the bleeding nothing anyone could do to put the torn flesh back together but he sat there beside her until her eyes told him she was dead then he got to his feet and began to search the cottage he found the shotgun in a closet and signs of one breakfast on the table and only one bedroom occupied the other with the mattress still rolled up and wrapped in a sheet two trunks holding clothes he went through each cupboard and closet looked under anything that might hide a body but there was no one he wasnt surprised taking a sheet with him he hurried out to bind up roystons bloody shoulder the goose smelling the blood had backed off behind the car in the drive roystons car hed come to take helena to church royston was very weak but alive rutledge with some experience in war wounds did what he could to stop the bleeding and then called his name trying to rouse him royston opened his eyes stared at rutledge with a frown then groaned with the mounting pain in there he managed hoarsely its over rutledge said curtly i got here a little early i was talking to maggie and she began to ask me about theaccident all those years ago mavers had said something helena had told her about it she said then she went into the bedroom to fetch helena and helena came out with the ax i didntthere was nothing i could do if you hadnt come stop talking you cant leave maggie here not with that madwoman maggies dead gentle god and helena died with her what she killed her cousin you killed helena in colonel harriss car when you were twenty you told me so yourself i dont understand there never was a helena onlymaggie and years of being told that helena was better and brighter and stronger than she wasuntil she believed it and tried to be helena herself and couldnt but somehow she created helena inside herself he shivered thinking of hamish wondering if one day in the future hed create the mans image in his own flesh and be a divided soul like maggie sommers and it washelenawho shot charles harris he got royston to his feet and somehow to the car then he was driving as fast as he could toward upper streetham watching the mans face watching the rough breathing someone fetched the doctor from the church and then warren threw them all out of his surgery as he worked over laurence royston all except rutledge who stood in the doorway watching the gentle swift hands moving across the savage wounds of the ax i dont know how this happened warren said over his shoulder it will be touch and go if he lives but hes got a strong constitution i think we can save him i wont give up without a fight the front door opened and rutledge could hear wiltons voice and then forrests he went out to speak to them leaving warren to his work later he called london bowles growled at him wanting to know what hed done about wilton nothing hes in the clear ive found the murderer shes dead what do you mean she what she so rutledge told him bowles listened grunting from time to time at the end of it he said i dont understand any of this business i know but the poor woman lived in such wretchedness that i cant blame her for trying to bring helena back to life youll have to check with the police in dorset see whats known about maggie its going to be routine i think i dont expect any surprises how can two women live in one body rutledge was silent how could he explain without betraying himself and oddly enough hed liked helena someday would other people like hamish better than ian rutledge it was a frightening thought the doctor had told him he wasnt mad to hear hamishbecause he rutledge knew that hamish didnt exist but maggie was different shed wanted helena to exist not out of madness but out of a bleak and lonely need to satisfy two vicious selfish adults trying to become the daughter theyd lost and mourned a desperate bid for love by a shy bewildered child until shed made helena live again and one day coming across charles harris in a town far from home suddenly helena wanted vengeance maggie lost controlwas in danger of losing herselfand when helena attacked laurence royston maggie had somehow found the strength to stop it once and for all bowles was saying and i dont really care what matters is that ive got the palace off my back now we can close the case sweep it all under the rug clear the captains good nameand were all back where we started from except for colonel harris rutledge thought and maggie sommers and lettice he felt waves of black depression settling over him swamping him no he told himself fiercely no i wont give into it ill fight and by god somehow ill survive i solved this murder the skills are there ive touched themand i will use them again whatever else ive lost this one triumph is mine yell no triumph over me hamish said im a scar on your bluidy soul that may be rutledge told him harshly but ill find out before its finished what were both made of afterward staring at the telephone bowles swore savagely somehow against all expectation rutledge had pulled it off scotland yard would be overjoyed with the results theyd bring the man home as a hero and he bowles would be left to bask in reflected glory once more that nonsense about the dead womanshed probably committed suicide and rutledge had been smart enough to see his chance to put the blame on her not wilton and no one in the yard would dare to question it not when so many reputations had been saved well theres always a next time beginners luck thats what it was and next time no convenient scapegoat would spoil the game
