alex scarrow october skies prologue the two little girls playing in the meadow by the stream were the ones who saw it first a pale form moving along the edge of the wood just inside the tree line they saw it at a distance moving slowly appearing disappearing reappearing amongst the foliage a chalkwhite stickman with no face and two dark holes where his eyes should be it turned to gaze at them for a moment swaying slightly as it studied them intensely across the stream surging with recent snowmelt from the peaks above and the tail end of a hard winter this was more than enough for the two girls they turned and ran as they stumbled up the incline of the meadow towards the edge of town they thought they heard the thing scream after them a sound both frightening and pitiful they ran across the small town down the closest thing to a main street busy with the midmorning midweek trade to their home whimpering in broken garbled sentences each talking over the other that they had seen a skeleton walking in the woods the skeleton was next seen by jeffrey pohenz a short while later jeffrey a willowy teen was outside by the back door of the traders store enjoying a crafty tenminute reprise from hefting bags of cornmeal leaning against the wall and savouring the unseasonably early warmth of sunshine on his face his mind was elsewhere on a particular promise made to him by a certain young lady last night anticipation of that was making the day at work drag interminably his concentration was shot to hell of course when he saw the skeleton suddenly emerge from a cluster of trees and thick tufts of untamed briar just across the yard littered with broken and beingmended chassis and wheel spindles the thought of this evenings exciting promise was instantly dismissed like some creature from hieronymus boschs visions of hell it shambled towards him with a lurching clumsiness bony arms and hands glistening brightly in the sunlight reaching out to him jeff decided not to dive through the back door into the store and run the risk of getting entangled with the clutter of goods within instead he ran around the back of the low wooden building towards the busier thoroughfare at the front stumbling out into the dusty open space and tripping over hardbaked wheel ruts that only a few days ago had been mud churned into grooves and ridges by large steelrimmed wheels jesus help me he screamed as he scrambled to his feet again theres a theres a theres a skeleton man round the back the nearest people to jeffrey were bemused at the sight of the mophaired lanky teenager stumbling over his own clumsy feet and bellowing with fear jeff turned to look back at the side of the wooden fencing around which hed just sprinted expecting to see that shuffling bonewhite creature emerge oh jesus its its gordon palmer a loader who worked out the front shook his head at jeffs delinquent craziness the boy was prone to goosing around at work a practical joker rather than a real grafter whatve you seen lad jeff looked up at him a skeleton it just charged out of the woods at me gordon straightened up sensing that maybe this time the boy might not be playing the fool it could be some goddamned nez perce hed heard that tribe sometimes wore chalkwhite body paint on raiding parties what exactly did you see jeff pointed to the wooden wall leading round to the rear of the compound his finger wobbled uncertainly just there i swear i saw someth and then gordon saw it for himself the skeleton staggered forward one bony hand held out and running along the wooden slats of the wall for support for guidance gordons first impression was identical to jeffs identical to the two little girls but then his eyes picked out other details on the shambling form the tattered scraps of clothing fluttering like ragged pennants on a washing line boots tattered and torn and held together by strips of vine or leather what the hell he muttered his terror replaced with horror of a different sort jeff standing beside him now began to pick out those same details and realised his error oh shit its a man other heads in the thoroughfare had by now turned and witnessed the thing as it took several tentative steps forward finally stumbling as jeff had done on one of the deep wheel ruts it fell forward landing heavily on the hard ridged ground and then curled up into a pitiful foetal position somebody get this poor sonofabitch some help gordon shouted as he rushed forward and knelt down beside the thing closer now he could see this quivering pale creature in rags had once been human but could barely be described as that now looking at the gaunt starvedtowithinaninchofdeath face the deeply recessed and shadowed eyes he saw an emptiness that would haunt him for the rest of his life and flavour the way he would tell this story to his children and their children those were the eyes of someone who had glimpsed the angel of death himself he leaned closer to the man well get you some help some food and water he whispered suspecting it was already long past doing the poor wretch any good those empty eyes met his and gordon swore for a moment that he saw the flickering flames of hell in those wide dilated pupils my god he may die right here gordon reached out and gently held one of this poor mans bony claws the loose folds of skin on his hands reminded him of the turkeywattle skin of an old man no man should die without a name can you tell me your name sir the mans thin leathery lips parted revealing impossibly long teeth gums withdrawn by malnutrition he struggled to say something little more than a mucousclogged rattle tell me again whispered gordon his face just inches away now he could feel tiny rapid puffs of fetid air against his cheek the man tried again panting with effort managing just the faintest whisper that sounded like rustling wings my name is ben the present chapter thursday sierra nevada mountains california julian cooke squatted down amidst the kneehigh ferns looking up at the thick canopy of pine needles and the stout straight trunks of the douglas firs around them before turning to look at the camera ready yeah im running rose replied selfconsciously he patted down his coarse dark hair and adjusted the round steelrimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose theres a rich tradition of fireside tales that come from this part of america the wilderness of the sierra nevada mountain range he started looking squarely at the lens of the digital camera that rose was holding they come in all shapes and sizes out here ghost stories stories of alien abductions sightings of bigfoot sightings of elvis julian arched his thick dark eyebrows and shrugged a trademark gesture the shrug the flickering expression of mild disbelief an understated gesture of gently mocking cynicism he sighed some of the people ive spoken to here will tell you of a giant indian spirit as tall as a house yet invisible moving through the woods leaving broken trees in its path then of course youll get those who talk of a hooded monk and others a witch seen moving in the halflight of dusk ive spoken to several people who confidently assure me that a friend has even captured the hooded figure on camera something that might just happen tonight if we get lucky his thick groucho eyebrows arched again behind the glasses and the hint of a tongueincheek smile played across his lips he held the expression for a couple of seconds then relaxed how was that he asked rubbing his cold hands together rose whitely nodded yup it was good a bit on the cheesy side maybe bugger it felt cheesy doing it i hate these talktocamera pieces she disconnected the camera and collapsed the tripod with a practised efficiency well we need a setup piece jules at the moment weve got more than enough footage of you interviewing the yokels she shot a glance towards the park ranger sitting patiently on a log nearby and sipping her coffee from a thermos im sorry grace i didnt mean it to sound like that grace shook her head no offence taken she replied with a gruff twentyaday voice rose turned back to julian anyway it looked good you looked like david attenborough crouching there amidst the foliage julian smiled did i he liked that well no not really rose looked up at the sky through the canopy of leaves and branches the languid white sky was beginning to dim i think were losing the last of our daylight for shooting julian nodded yup i think were done grace tipped the dregs of her coffee away screwed the cap on her thermos and stood up all right she said weve got an hour of light need to find a decentsize clearing to pitch the tents she bent down and scooped up her backpack slung her rifle over one shoulder and pushed through the undergrowth lets move out julian watched her for a moment groaning as he wearily picked up his pack and pulled the straps over his shoulders rose brushed past him carrying about twice the load camping pack camera and equipment and grinned she is something of a character isnt she rose filmed them using the nightvision filter julian sat next to grace both of them leaning against a mosscovered hump in the ground looking out across the large clearing at the tree line around them it was pitch black save for the faint light intermittently cast by the moon as heavy clouds scudded across the sky they spoke in hushed voices barely more than a whisper as julian interviewed her and out there amidst the trees her microphone picked up the wonderfully atmospheric creakings rustlings and nocturnal cries of the wilderness at night you ever seen anything out here grace you know whilst youre out patrolling the woods whispered julian the pupils of his wide eyes entirely dilated as he stared edgily out into the darkness around them the emeraldgreen grainy composition of night vision lent the scene an eeriness that rose knew was going to look good anticipation of something about to happen grace shook her head nope cant say i have get to hear a lotta things though the woods are as alive in the night as they are in the day mebbe more so she replied her breath puffed out into the cool night air rose had headphones on she could hear only what the directional mic was getting to her it sounded delightfully creepy a light breeze was teasing the firs and spruces around them the swaying branches produced a chorus of conspiring whispers in the background why do you think there are so many weird sightings and urban myths around these woods and mountains julian asked cutting into the silence grace measured her quiet reply we got a lot of history here in blue valley i guess when you got a bunch of history you get a bunch of boogieman stories she smiled we aint so used to having a lot of history around us not like you brits are julian nodded and smiled a branch snapped out in the darkness and julian jerked nervously spilling coffee from the mug he was cradling in his hands uh grace what the hell was that he swallowed anxiously his prominent adams apple bobbing like a fishermans float rose smiled at the grainygreen display in front of her jules plays the fool so naturally nothing replied grace calmly just dead wood falling it happens relax god i hate woods he gasped with a cloud of vapour anyway you were saying grace nodded history we got a lot of it here indian history followed by settler history you know emigrant pass isnt that far away from us emigrant pass its the one and only way through the sierra nevadas at least it was back in the s when something like half a million people were migratin west she continued rose listened intently to her dry throaty voice a mesmerising monotone of midwest vowels backwoods charm and a lifetime of marlboros a perfect voice for storytelling they called the route a number of things back then the south pass trail the emigrant trail the freedom trail i guess youd know it best as the oregon trail it was the route settlers were taking across the wilderness to oregon there wasnt one fixed trail though it was a bunch of different eastwest routes that mostly followed the platte river towards the rockies those trails crisscrossed each other each one promising some kinda shortcut that beat the others but no matter how much they all twisted and turned they all came together in the end they converged at one critical point grace pulled out a cigarette and lit up the flame of her lighter flared brightly across roses view screen and then it flickered out a moment later emigrant pass half a million stories came through that gap in the mountains she pulled on her cigarette her lips pursed and lined like a puckered tobacco pouch and they was superstitious people back then many strongly religious types devout types you know like the mormons for example julian nodded you ever hear the saying seeing the elephant nope it was a myth that grew up along the trail all the hazards of that journey the terrain the weather disease crooks indians it somehow all got rolled up into one frightening mythological beast the elephant the size of a mountaintop or a storm front or the size of a broken cart wheel if you caught a glimpse of the elephant ahead of you in the distance it was meant to be an omen an omen to turn back right away and go no further and you sure as hell did that and thanked god you saw the elephant from afar and not up close julian looked out into the darkness rose instinctively panned the camera away from him in the direction he was looking towards the tree line across the clearing do you think well see anything tonight he asked grace laughed a loose rattling sound like a leather flap caught in a wind tunnel maybe well see that elephant eh julian turned round to look at the park ranger then turned to look directly at the camera his mouth a rounded o those brows quizzically arched and his eyes wide like a nervous childs rose giggled silently jules had the kind of comedians face the camera loved chapter friday sierra nevada mountains california julian was woken by his aching groin oh great i need a piss he realised that he was going to have to step outside the tent bollocks he whispered to himself shit and bloody bollocks the campfire would be no more than glowing embers now and both grace with her reassuringly large hunting rifle and rosie were fast asleep tucked away in their own tents he really wasnt that keen on the idea of wandering over to the tree line for a necessary piss but grace had warned them to pee well away from the tents as the smell of urine could confuse a bear could be construed as territorial marking oh come on you wimp he chided himself he wrestled his way out of the bag fumbled for the torch and then having found it and snapped it on fumbled for his glasses two minutes and youll be back in bed snug as a bloody bug he squeezed out of his tiny tent and panned the torch around the clearing graces parting words for the night still playing around with his overactive mind did you know grizzlies can run as fast as a horse oh and the smaller ones can climb trees julian grimaced yeah thanks for that grace he hissed watching the plume of his breath quickly dissipate in the crisp night air he stepped lightly across the clearing navigating his way over the lumps and bumps of longdead and fallen trees the beam of his torch flickered like a light sabre through the wispy night mist picking out the uneven floor of the clearing carpeted in a thick spongy layer of moss he was surprised at how much it undulated and guessed that perhaps some time in the past someone had been logging here but never got round to finishing the job leaving an assault course of rotting trunks and branches for him to awkwardly clamber over he made his way to the far side of the clearing and came to a halt on the edge staring uneasily at a tangle of brambles and undergrowth leading up towards a wall of dense foliage the start of the wood he turned to look back at the tents sixty feet is that far enough away he decided it would have to do there was no way on earth he was actually going to step through the dense web of undergrowth ahead of him and into the woods no way this is good enough he unzipped feeling a sudden gottago rush that he couldnt contain any longer and with a long groan of satisfaction he let rip his torch picked out the steaming silver arc and he watched with detached interest as the jet of piss stripped away like a pressure hose cleaning a graffiticovered wall the delicate blanket of moss on a rounded log in front of him it wasnt until hed shaken off and tucked away and then played his torch more thoroughly across the small arc of exposed dark wood that his curiosity was piqued enough to take a step forward the exposed wood was curiously smooth not natural he reached out with his fingers and ran them along the surface it was old and evenly curved he rubbed a little further along the exposed arc moss rolling off effortlessly into little doughy balls under his fingers by the torchlight he could see the remains of a rusted metal band dislodged dark brown flakes tumbling from it he ran his torch down and noticed several unnaturally straight ridges in the mossy surface converging on a bumpy hub he rubbed the moss off one of the ridges to find the smooth weathered form of what quite clearly was wood once turned on a lathe a spoke he straightened up thats a wheel thats a wagon wheel chapter friday sierra nevada mountains california see he said waving at the clearing grace and rose looked around through the morning mist they could see it was about a hundred yards in diameter and roughly elliptical in shape the floor of the clearing seemed to be one large rumpled emeraldgreen quilt draped delicately over the messy floor of a childs bedroom whoa the whole clearings one big camp rose panned her camera round in a slow steady loop julian stepped towards a rounded hump knelt down beside it and rubbed away the covering moss exposing the spokes of another wheel another wagon he said and surveyed the clearing there must be several dozen wagons buried here graces eyes narrowed she pulled off her rangers cap and tucked a loose tress of silver hair behind one ear my god she said blowing cigarette smoke out of her nostrils a whole wagon train up here in our mountains sheeesh been walking these woods for years she turned to julian never knew this was here rose looked at grace this is quite a find isnt it grace nodded silently hell could be another donner party donner party party of emigrants that went missing on the way to oregon in the s they were too slow making for the pass and got snowed into the mountains not too far from here about a hundred miles further south ive heard of that said julian she nodded helluva grim story they went missing over the winter but were found come spring what was left of them i dont like the sound of that said rose yeah grace nodded they resorted to cannibalism the papers at the time were full of madeup variations of that tale people scared their kids with the story for generations after they studied the clearing in silence their eyes making sense of telling stories with the contours hidden beneath a century and a half of growth and organic detritus what we got here uttered grace is a heritage site that means ive got to call this in to the national parks service julian bit his lip in thought grace will you excuse me and rose for a moment change of plan he said quietly to her okay we came out here to basically poke fun at a whole load of gullible strawchewing rednecks and their stories of abductions and big foot sightings and glowy things in the sky rose nodded yeah im guessing we arent doing that now julian grinned christ no thats the sort of bottomshelf schedulefiller id love us to leave behind this he gestured at the clearing around them is like finding the bloody titanic but we wont have it to ourselves for long if shes calling it in jules i know grace is a good ol girl and wants to do the right thing after all in us terms this is ancient history to them itll be like finding stonehenge thats my point though this site will be crawling with archaeology students and american history lecturers julian nodded but we found it so surely we deserve the scoop do we not rose nodded that would be nice therell be a humaninterest story here rose a powerfully strong one and if we can find out who they were and how they ended up here and if they survived he looked around at the uneven floor of the clearing therell be all sorts of personal artefacts buried here to give us names theres bound to be family these people left behind descendants today wholl have a curious family story of their greatgreatuncle bill who travelled west to the promised land and was never heard from again julian turned to her i say we drop the stupid bloody project we were doing and instead lets dig up what we can on this errrm rose tapped her chin with her finger didnt someone commission this stupid bloody project you know money a paying customer stuff that realityuk are a truly shit reality channel paying us a pisspoor commission for this not to put too fine a point on it screw them rose looked sceptical but its money look i know moneys tight right now but ill find some other small independents wholl front some cash for us to work on this or better still ill talk to my old contacts at the bbc im still on chatting terms with sean and the guys on panorama everyones going to want a piece of this he looked across at grace who was squatting down and cautiously examining the wheel spokes hed exposed we just need a little time he said rose swung the strap of her kit bag off her shoulder and started to unpack her camera i should grab as much of this on film as i can you know whilst its still pristine julian nodded youre right ill talk to grace see if i cant convince her to delay a little before calling it in to her boss grace sucked in cool air through her teeth with a whistling sound see im gonna have to call this in to the parks manager seeing as this is a heritage site now julian nodded yeah mind you she sighed lord knows what theyll do with it stick a gift shop in the middle of it i guess flag it up as a place of interest to hike to she muttered exhaling a cloud of smoke and vapour and shaking her head gotta call it in though the park ranger shook her head sorry i got to inform someone about this the proper authorities you understand otherwise when it gets made public therell be all sorts of souvenir hunters out here pickin this place to pieces i know said julian youre right i suppose it has to be done but give us a little time just a week or so give rose a chance to film this site properly as it is now pristine because even before the parks service get a chance to stick up a gift shop and barbecue pits nearby therell be heritage buffs pulling this place apart marker poles pegged out across it itll look like a bloody building site with archaeology undergrads and tv news teams tramping carelessly everywhere grace regarded him silently with her steelgrey eyes you know how thisll go dont you asked julian everyonell want a piece of this the parks service state authorities local press national press grace shrugged the parks service had gravelled over a centuryold logging camp to build the blue valley camp site theyd even dammed the tahoe river to produce a scenic lake alongside it she knew exactly what theyd want to do with this place grace give me a chance to find out who these people were to find out their stories her windworn face creased with suspicion you want the scoop julian offered her a guilty smile well yes she said nothing please well be so very very careful i promise you she could already see the gift shop in the very centre several howitmusthavelooked dioramas dotted around and to one side a childrens play area floored with that safety rubber tarmac and for guest convenience electricity outlets embedded in the trunks of the surrounding trees she pursed her lips and discarded snickers wrappers for miles around this place im a researcher grace i used to work for the bbc its what i do best i can give faces and voices to the people who lie here before this place gets trampled im not sure look he said taking a deep breath what do you think a fox news team would do with this if theres even a hint that these people ended up like the donner party thats all theyll focus on and the likes of the national enquirer itll just be a sensational story about cannibalism thats it give me a week maybe two and ill find out who they were their dreams what drove them west how they ended up trapped here two weeks no more its sat here for what a hundred and fifty years is two more weeks rest going to do any harm she pulled a face he couldnt read as she reached for her crumpled packet of cigarettes and eased out another well not be up here all that time either just today and maybe come back for another day in a week or two well let rose get all the footage she wants and ill try and see if i can unearth any personal effects grace looked at him sharply gently ever so carefully he said throwing his hands up in surrender i dont want you pulling this place apart she said sternly julian put on his best pleading beseeching face a family dog begging beside a laden dinner table all right she said gruffly as she lit up you got two weeks chapter friday sierra nevada mountains california during the morning rose diligently filmed the site from all angles she had julian doing a variety of walkthrough shots she set up the camera in the clearing filming him and grace emerging from the tree line and pretending to act surprised at their discovery julian was impressed by how dutifully compliant grace was a sternfaced schoolmarmish lady who didnt seem the type to suffer this kind of foolishness gladly she generously played along by midmorning rose felt she had enough in the can and started taking highresolution closeup shots of some of the exposed remains as they explored the site delicately wiping away the veil of moss and peat it was becoming clear that there was a lot hidden beneath timbers that had once upon a time made up wagons had not fared well now rotten black and jagged like decayed teeth however nestling amongst these fragile skeletons of wood they were beginning to discover a multitude of personal effects that had been preserved surprisingly well in the last hour julian had unearthed a stash of ceramic items crockery much of it still in one piece stored as it was in barrels of cornmeal they found the rusted metal remains of a longbarrelled musket which grace called a kentucky rifle and the remnants of several wooden tool boxes one complete with a suite of carpentry tools their metal blades dull with corrosion nestling at the bottom of a shallow ditch surrounded by jagged ribs of wood that protruded from the ground like the long gnarled fingers of a clawing hand julian found something hed hoped hed find he squatted in the ditch teasing the wet peatlike soil aside his fingers traced around the edge of his find a small tin chest black and pitted with rust and decay but incredibly still firmly sealed he found a latch at the front no longer functioning of course time moisture and the elements had turned it into one solid nugget of flaking oxidised metal he pulled out a penknife and probed the latch with the tip of the blade it began to crumble what have you got there said grace standing over him julian lurched jesus i didnt see you there he pointed at the chest the whole things still sealed its incredible she stepped down into the ditch beside him and looked around at the ribs of wood protruding from the ground around them seems they built some kinda shelter out of each of the wagons they knew they were going nowhere grace nodded and thats when they turned on their wagons and pulled them to pieces they mustve been stuck here for a long long while a thought occurred to him no bodies so far grace why do you think that is the animals will have had them anybody died here would have been bear or cougar food before long surely thered be bones lying around though grace shook her head not here maybe go looking around hard enough youll find them all together stacked neatly into a hillside nook like hotdogs in a jar a bear larder could be one just a few hundred yards from here could be a mile away she smiled coolly at julian i reckon dumping a body up here in the mountains is just about the best way to get rid of it natures a great recycler she looked down at the chest julian was still holding you goin to open that up julian nodded i need to find some names if we can identify just one or two of the people who ended up here thatll be enough to get me started on the research grace looked unhappily at the chest for a moment you gonna be careful with it julian offered her a reassuring smile ill be very gentle grace she locked her eyebrows suspiciously studying him for a moment before curiosity finally won her over okay you go ahead and do it then all right julian smiled and then let out a deep breath nice and gently trust me with a twist of the penknifes blade the latch crumbled into a shower of flakes and fell away he tried to lift the lid but it was stuck firmly to the chest he ran the blade of his knife lightly around the edge of the lid dislodging more flakes and small clods of earth with another gentle twist it cracked open and in the stillness of the moment they heard the slightest whisper of air rushing in my god it was actually airtight whispered julian he looked up at her thats very good news he slowly eased the lid open muttering to himself so what have we got in here then it was a small chest with very little in it and to his immense relief bone dry inside he noticed a leather purse in the corner poking it gently he guessed there were coins inside he spotted a shaving brush with what he guessed were probably badgerhair bristles a milkglass water cup and a mirror with an ornate silver frame julian picked up the mirror and turned it over in his hands there was an engraving on the back be lambert read julian in a hushed voice he spotted a photo frame turning it over there was a fading sepia photographic portrait of a distinguished middleaged woman seated standing behind her and to one side was a young man in his early twenties fair hair parted tidily to one side and sporting lightcoloured sideburns and a modest moustache by the likeness of their facial features julian guessed them to be mother and son neither were smiling both looking intently at the camera it was a formal portrait he noticed the young mans hand resting gently on the womans shoulder a small gesture that communicated a lot they were close or perhaps this was a farewell portrait julian gently placed the frame back in the box and noticed beneath the other things a dark burgundy leatherbound notebook he reached in and pulled it carefully out then with a quick glance up at grace who nodded for him to go ahead he opened the front cover there was an inscription on the inside the gently looping swirls of a womans hand benjamin for all your adventures in the new world fill these pages with your exciting stories and then come home safely to me your loving mother he grinned and looked up at grace this is exactly the sort of thing i was hoping to find he gently flipped the first page over fragile yellowed by time overleaf a dated first entry in tidy copperplate little more than a few hastily jotted sentences a sketch of a quayside and as far as he was concerned the most useful scrap of information a bill of passage from liverpool to new york on a ship called the cathara excellent he laughed and looked up from the notebook thats more than enough to find out who this bloke was grace more than enough he lightly turned over a few more pages the entries growing longer and longer dense with meticulous handwriting and a few pencil sketches he spotted amidst the spidery pen strokes names used over and over preston keats sam emily then the writing became too erratic too dense and tangled and the ink towards the end too faint to easily decipher watereddown ink this guy was doing his best to stretch out an emptying inkpot there was a lot in this leather book he sensed perhaps the complete story of what had happened here but hed need to scan the pages and digitally clean them up to make them easily legible particularly the latter ones grace with your permission im going to take just this book with me okay nothing else she looked unhappy with that aint yours to take were going to need to photograph each page get a digital record of this immediately the papers fragile and theres very faint ink here towards the back julian turned a few pages very faint the writings almost like a watermark this should come out of the ground right now and be kept somewhere dark and dry she considered that for a moment he closed the notebook gently if i leave it out here itll deteriorate it needs to be taken out and digitised grace as soon as possible the woman considered that for a moment and then nodded okay thank you he said you know for trusting us julian looked up at the cold grey sky you think itll snow today grace shrugged snows due i guess usually as regular as clockwork she looked up at the pale featureless clouds i reckon though well need to head back soon we got us about six hours of daylight for hiking back to the camp site this afternoon julian stood up wheres rose ill get her to pack up her stuff he climbed out of the ditch and called out for her he could see the bright red flash of her anorak amongst the trees on the far side of the clearing she was stepping slowly through the tangled briar and roots with the camera braced firmly on her shoulder getting some mood footage grace meanwhile knelt down and ran her fingers over the rough pitted surface of the metal storage chest mr lambert mr benjamin lambert from england she muttered quietly through a plume of evaporating breath so you gonna tell us all about what happened here then are you chapter july benjamin lambert stretched in his saddle and felt the worn leather flex beneath him his rump was sore and he could feel that his left thigh rubbed raw by a roughly stitched saddle seam was beginning to blister beneath the frayed linen of his trousers it stung insistently with each rub as the pony he sat astride swayed rhythmically like a heavily laden schooner on a choppy sea but the minor aches and pains were rendered meaningless as he looked up from the sweating rippling shoulders of his pony to the sunbleached open prairie thousands millions of acres of land untamed and not portioned out by mankind no patchwork of fields manicured lawns landscaped rockeries or garden follies no cluttered rows of terraced houses or smokebelching mills spewing out grimy workers onto narrow cobbled streets and there were no gravel paths or smartly paved roads dividing up this expansive wilderness instead just the faintest almost indiscernible track worn into the summerbaked orange soil by earlier trains of heavily laden conestogas those that had passed this way earlier in the season ben savoured this infinite horizon defined so sharply between the swaying ochre of prairie grass and the fierce blue of a cloudless sky not a single solitary tree to punctuate it my god this is exactly what i came for this was an alien landscape for ben a citydwelling englishman used to every precious acre yard walkway and ratrun belonging by deed to somebody until hed sailed over to the new world and embarked on this exciting journey across an unmapped continent he realised every step hed taken thus far in his twentyfive years had been on ground owned by someone right now he was on land owned by absolutely no one he reined in his pony relieved to have that swaying motion cease for just a moment and give his back his rump and his thighs a little respite he took in the horizon low and undulating gently with a smooth curvature of modest hillocks and spurs to the west the hills grew more pronounced and shimmering in the heat the white peaks of the rockies danced not quite so far away now oh god this is wonderful he muttered to himself this this was why he came to see it all before swarms of humankind descended upon it and broke it up into a million homogenous parcels of fencedin farmland beside him the wagons rolled past each pulled slowly but assuredly by a sixteam of oxen he twisted in his saddle looking down the length of the train in all he had counted fortyfive of them some open carts many smaller rigs and a couple of dozen tenfooter conestogas with flared sides and sturdily contructed traps this particular caravan of overlanders was a blend of two parties that had happened to find themselves setting off into the wilderness from fort kearny at round about the same time and had merged to form a loose if somewhat uncomfortable alliance the smaller contingent was one he had joined at the very last moment five wagons that had coalesced outside the military outpost looking for others to share the arduous and hazardous trip fort kearny was considered by most overlanders readying themselves for the journey as the steppingoff point the very edge of the united states of america beyond that point it was gods own wilderness many families delayed at this outpost longer than they should gathering their wits their willpower supplies and mustering their wavering courage to commit to the crossing ahead of them ben had made his way here and chanced upon these five wagons in his carefree meandering way they were amongst the last wagons lingering around the fort preparing to leave over a shared evening meal with them and too much drink ben had casually announced that he intended to journey to oregon on his own trading on his skills as a doctor along the way and to write a book of his adventures and experiences they very quickly disabused him of that foolish notion assuring him that to travel alone with no plan more to the point with no guide would see him dead out there on the trail within days ben smiled at his own reckless bravado they had successfully managed to scare the shit out of him and he promptly decided to throw in his lot with them and even contributed a substantial portion to the pool of money that purchased the services of wild bill keats a prairie guide who dressed more like an indian than a white man keats confidently assured them he had led dozens of parties safely across to the far side of both the rockies and the more challenging sierra nevada mountain range beyond with keats came an indian partner broken wing a shoshone keats assured his clients one of the friendlier tribes the other contingent about forty mormon families led by their first elder and spiritual leader william preston had travelled down from council bluffs iowa and had arrived with great haste just as keats and the others were setting off with both groups intending to head west at the same time both equally keen to beat the season and cross the rockies the salt deserts and the nevada range beyond before the snows arrived it was keatss idea that both groups should combine there being safety in such numbers they set out from fort kearny on a fine morning the last day in may with the rumpled and leathery old trail guide announcing solemnly that they were the last party who were going to be able to make it across the mountains this year they left the fort behind with keats and his party leading the way and the mormon wagons behind led by preston hey mr lambert ben turned away from the distant peaks passing beside him was the dreytons conestoga the large wagon was perhaps more than this small family needed mrs dreyton was a widow ben guessed in her early thirties she dressed like all the other mormon women very modestly covered from neck to toe in a drabcoloured dress of hardwearing material every last wisp of her hair tucked away inside a bonnet for modesty she shared the wagon with her two children emily a pretty girl of nine or ten who made no secret of the fact that she adored ben and her older brother samuel a tall broadshouldered and muscular young lad of seventeen with a sunbronzed and freckled face topped with sandy hair the young man held the reins in one hand and waved with the other morning good morning ben shouted cheerfully across to them he reined his pony in and steered it and a second tethered behind and bearing all his worldly possessions towards them he fell into step beside their wagon which was clattering noisily with pots and pans dangling from hooks along the outside and the jingling of the oxen harnesses ahead of them samuel and emilys smiles were as wide as they were warm a marked contrast to most of the sourfaced and sternlipped members of prestons people hows the riding today asked sam ben shuffled in his saddle and winced my blisters have blisters i think you can always tie up your pony on the back and sit up here with me offered sam we got room emilys face poking through a canvas flap over her brothers shoulder lit up oh we got room mr lambert havent we momma mrs dreyton shot a cool glance back at her children and then at ben i dont think it would be appropriate she said flatly and emily put your sun bonnet on this instant mom emily chimed unhappily it makes my head hot she turned round to her do you want a face as brown as a savage emily shook her head then you best put it back on she then turned to stare at ben with an expression that quite clearly indicated there wasnt room on the jockey board ben quickly responded thats all right mrs dreyton im just fine where i am sam shrugged apologetically emily wilted he liked the two children the rest of their group had kept very much to themselves under the stern and watchful eyes of preston and his cadre of loyal elders they were all a little too sombre and cheerless to make easy travelling companions too churchy keats had grumbled after only a couple of days on the trail with them but these two youngsters were as bright and as welcoming a sight as a couple of shined pennies he turned his pony away wary that tongues amongst the neighbouring mormon wagons might start wagging if he loitered too close and for too long beside the dreytons ill bid you good morning ben doffed his broadbrimmed felt hat sam called out to him will you take a mug of coffee with us mr lambert when we stop at noon the young mans mother looked sharply at her son with steelgrey eyes ben nodded thats kind of you sam but maybe not today he turned round and with a jab of his knees urged his pony to break into a lethargic trot taking him up to the front of the column where the small contingent of wagons under keats rolled on through the dust chapter saturday blue valley national parks camp site california they emerged from the woods and onto the gravel parking area just as the pallid autumnal sun dipped down behind the brow of tree tops there were only two vehicles parked up here graces cherokee marked with the national parks service logo and the toyota prius julian had rented from hertz they exchanged goodbyes and grace gave them her home and mobile numbers to call when they were ready to trek out there again she firmly reminded them both that she was going to do the right thing and call in the find to the parks manager in a fortnights time and no later julian and rose thanked her watching her dump her pack in the boot and carefully put away the parks service issued hunting rifle in a case on the back seat she climbed in offered them a wave started up the cherokee and swung out of the parking area kicking up a rooster tail of stones and grit onto a single lane of road that wound its way down the mountainside to the nearest town blue valley a halfhours drive through some of the most beautiful scenery julian had ever seen you think shell keep her word asked julian not tell her boss rose nodded yeah i think so i think we won her round julian unlocked the car and dropped his pack on the back seat well rose what do you think she carefully placed her camera bag on the back seat setting the foldedup tripod down beside it i think we mightve hit the jackpot she muttered trying to keep an excited smile off her lips so were going to drop the other project then yup he replied pulling open the driverside door and sitting down its a nobrainer he added squeezing long gangly legs into the space beneath the steering wheel no discussion about it nope rose sighed as she sat down heavily beside him pulled the seat belt down and clicked it home yeah i really like the way this partnership thing works you decide stuff and i get to nod dumbly julian winced guiltily inside rose was a onewoman production studio deft with a camera a solid sound technician a shrewd editor hed be buggered without her she was the talent behind the films they had put together over the last few years julian was merely the vaguely recognisable tv face fronting their small company soup kitchen studios business was ticking over but it wasnt great they had a window of time to make their production company work that window was his rapidly fading clist celebrity status the general tvviewing public still recognised his face some might even still remember his name the cooke bloke julian had reached what now seemed to have been his showbiz peak five years ago as a regular host on a lateslot anarchical current affairs quiz show the panellists were the usual mixed bag of standup comedians redtop columnists and publicityhungry mps julian cooke had arguably been a household name for at least a couple of seasons prior to that he had spent about fifteen years working in the bbc as a production assistant then as a senior researcher he couldnt remember exactly how the transition from researchmonkey to frontofcamera personality had occurred but it had happened surprisingly quickly after hed put together a tongueincheek show reel in his spare time the quiz show never really took off but it led to some work as a presenter on various offthewall documentaries round about the same time hed stumbled across rose a media graduate knocking out amazingly satirical biting short pieces and uploading them onto youtube when he first saw her work she was already an established name in the tube community routinely getting hundredthousandplus views for each of her fiveminute films for julian soup kitchen studios was the right next step an agile little studio with plenty of technical knowhow and a recognisable figurehead and presenter capable of knocking out tv content quickly and cheaply in rapid succession they made half a dozen flyonthewalls following around a succession of characters a british national party parliamentary candidate a muslim cleric recently returned from guantanamo a veteran soldier from iraq attempting to rebuild his life and his face an exsoap starlet trying to launch her pop career the asbo king an objectionable hooded thug who enjoyed boasting and blustering about his criminal record dennis the dentist a charming old man who was serving an indefinite sentence for the serial murders of a dozen of his patients and tone a guitar band from reading on the cusp of success but never quite managing to make it it was a great series uncommon people since then he and rose had failed to capitalise on the success picking up shitty stockingfiller commissions like this one a seedy poke at american trailertrash and the weird crap they reckon theyve seen rose already had a dozen digital tapes full of interviews theyd had with an auto mechanic a waitress several bored college kids and a couple of old guys in the woods who made slowburn charcoal swearing blind theyd picnicked with sasquatch made love to jim morrison or seen the ghost of elvis wandering the hills and woods around blue valley julian sighed it would be nice to make some serious tv again yeah were dropping that bloody project he said starting up the prius fair enough rose agreed chapter july i should have written more in this dairy than i have i look in here and find my last entry is more than four days old i shall make immediate amends so we have travelled in this loose association for a while now out of fort kearny we are an interesting mix of people at this end of the train our guide keats insists our contingent refer to itself as the keats party since he has been employed as our trail captain rather than antagonise a man i fancy could skin and fillet me with one flick of his large bowie knife im more than happy to go along with that amongst our group ive found the most fascinating diversity of people you could ever hope to travel with our contribution to the long train of carts is just five wagons long with myself keats and his indian partner broken wing as the only members travelling without the encumbrance of one we have the mcintyres a family of four whose journey west so they tell me started in new york and before that cork in ireland their tales of squalor the overcrowded tenement buildings in new york the desperate gang fights amongst groups of immigrants sound quite grim then we have another family the bowens who hail from my home city more specifically from the east end just as grim a place as any ive seen in the five points the other two wagons are occupied by a darkskinned family i have spoken with the only one of them who knows enough english to manage a conversation mr hussein the head of the family his oldest son omar pilots the second wagon and also speaks a little english finally theres mr weyland from virginia who has only a twowheeled cart few possessions and a negro woman with him i dont know if she is his property i would prefer to think not it is an uncomfortable feeling to witness one soul owned like a shoe or a brush by another but i have seen him be both respectful and tender with her perhaps she is not his property perhaps ill ask ben sat back resting his aching spine against the soothing cool oak lid of his medicine chest he leaned all the way back and looked up at the starspotted sky nighttime in this wilderness was the sort of absolute darkness that he was still finding quite novel the streets and terraced houses of london maintained an everpresent amber twilight of flickering gas and oilfed lamps the wagons of their parties were drawn close together in a circular cluster the oxen corralled securely in the centre the preston party wagons were drawn together in their own cluster thirty or forty yards away not a huge distance but far enough to clearly make the point that they wished not to interact any more than was absolutely necessary keats was holding court around their campfire ben could feel the heat from where he sat warming one side of him while the other side gathered goose bumps from the fresh night air seen all kinds right across from independence to oregon keats replied in answer to a question from mrs bowen the trick of it maam is to know your tribes and know em well you got some that are so goddamned friendly you wonder how they managed to survive so long the other tribes well keatss voice trailed off and he shook his head after a moment of silence mrs bowen leaned forward mr keats intrigued ben carefully packed away his journal pen and inkpot into his chest and joined the huddle of people around the glowing warming flames mr keats you cant just say that and then leave us angin about mrs bowen persisted and looked at the others gathered nearby can e now he shrugged if it werent for it being mixed company maam ben cleared his throat i think id like to know what we stand to face along the way mr keats will it be friendly indians or not keatss hand cupped his bristly chin well now see thats why you got me showin you the way through to the other side aint it well be passin through lands of maybe a dozen different tribes pawnee lakota cheyenne arapaho ute shoshone paiute to name just a few keats looked at ben six seven years ago most indians was friendly back when the rush began but they kinda learned a whole lot since then they know it aint so smart riding in to greet wagon trains like ours too many bored settlers carryin guns and lookin for something to shoot at he said settling back against his saddle aint that right he asked broken wing the indian nodded silently puffing on his clay pipe and gazing distractedly at the flames dancing in front of him i remember heard a story from a few years back keats continued pulling out his own pipe and tobacco pouch there was this family mother and father with more kids n they could be bothered to count they stopped and made camp one evenin and then like we do they was up early the next morning whilst its still dark an off they set again only it werent until they gone some miles before they realised they was down one child both mrs bowen and mrs mcintyre gasped a group of men from the party was organised and they doubled back to try and find it led by the father they headed back to where they was camped and then searched some trees nearby keats paused as he packed his pipe and then produced a match now see they found that little child he said then struck the match held it to the bowl of his pipe and sucked he took his time puffing until the tobacco was well alight well asked mrs mcintyre you were saying the child they found the child all right keats continued safe and well being fed and played with by a group of young pawnee warriors would ya believe some say they was a raidin party looking to steal horses from the neighbouring lakota all tough young warriors these but playin with the child them indians had made camp right there where they found the child mrs bowen smiled them indians dont sound so bad after all then keats puffed on his pipe and blew a cloud of smoke camped right there over night just sos they could mind the child until the parents came back to get her well thats what some people say but well never really know whys that mr keats asked mrs mcintyre the father fired upon them the others joined in killed most of them right there there was a wary silence around the fire that popped and crackled feeding hungrily on the buffalo chips i told you the story sos you get the idea what them indians have seen of us an none of it is good he said shaking his head thing is they had about enough of us folk comin through shootin their buffalo and lettin em rot tossing aside our shit and spoils burning their firewood spoilin their creeks and pools shootin at them for no other reason than they were within range he shook his head they was real slow on the uptake at first but they got the measure of us folk now it sounds like youre on their side mr keats said mrs mcintyre shooting a glance at broken wing not ours dont get me wrong mdear he replied ill shoot a indian if i have to or a white man for that matter he turned to the others around the fire im just tellin you what you oughta know these last few years indians started turnin which is why you gotta be lookin at wagon trains of twenty and over now if you want to make it across alive which is why you need the likes of me and broken wing to lead you folks safely across the way so ventured ben the question still stands what type of indians are we likely to come across friendly ones or broken wing snorted a muted laugh keats chuckled well there aint no friendly indians no longer lambert just real cautious ones or real pissed ones and you want to hope to god young man that we only run into the first kind mr bowen a broadshouldered man who habitually shaved his head down to the wood and looked every bit the east end brawler put an arm around his wifes narrow shoulders don worry molly luv he said nodding politely at keats i reckon well be just fine with mr keats ere lookin out for us wont we keats nodded sright bowen i aim to lead you folks up a route i took last year takes us north of most other wellworn trails more into shoshone country than ute as we cross but will that take us longer asked ben keats fixed his dark eyes on ben and nodded good question young man were late in the season the only fools who set off now from independence or even fort kearny would be damn stupid fools my routes a little longer but a whole lot safer we want to make it to the far side of the rockies this side of september an across them sierra nevada mountains before october hits us but if we dont mrs bowen started to ask keatss salt and pepper eyebrows arched if we dont make it across in time she nodded her eyes wide and anxious we will mrs bowen we will just as long as we push hard and mind that you take good care of your oxen an grease your axles daily ben heard the scuff of several pairs of boots approaching through the darkness and those already seated around the dwindling flames were joined by mr mcintyre mr hussein and his son and mr weyland keats nodded with satisfaction seems like we got at least one person from each of our wagons here good i guess nows as good a time as any other one rule you folks should know up front we aint gonna stop for nobody keats looked at each of them in turn whatever happens oxen die in their harness wagon tongue snaps sickness hits a family any accidents the rest of us gotta keep rollin whatever what about those others asked mr mcintyre gesturing towards the mormon camp keats looked across at the wagons of the preston party hell its up to them they got their own trail captain that preston fella he can take my advice or leave it up to him but you folks hired me as your trail captain so you follow my rules understand youre serious asked ben youd ask us to leave someone behind but they might die oh yeah the old man nodded anyone left behind will die lambert and you people are gonna start seein the graves by the trailside pretty soon the leftbehinds thosere the real stupid folk who had horses pullin their wagons stead of oxen the stupid folk who ignored a creaky axle a day too long the stupid folk who got their head blasted off cos some dumb ass was ridin by with his rifle loaded and restin crosssaddle there was a sombre silence punctuated only by the crackle of the fire the elephant can kill in many diffrent ways folks sweep you off the trail with one blow of his trunk you be mindful of him you see him keats took a long pull on his pipe and blew out a cloud of acrid smoke you see him near or far thats the time to turn round keats youre scaring my missus said bowen good cause we got plenty to be scared bout not least of all is the weather the weathers been fine mr keats said ben lovely in fact keats laughed fine right now lambert but we still yet to beat it the old guide nodded westwards thats the thing we all gotta be mindful of though folks we dont beat the snow in those sierras then were in big trouble chapter saturday mknbc news studio utah i like to think i speak for the hardworking man on the shop floor those regular joes who pay taxes year in year out dont ask for favours dont run around breaking the law to quote andrew jackson the very sinews of this nation of ours he said offering his host a polite but sincere nod i think in recent years weve lost sight of the quiet guy the guy that just gets on with it doesnt complain about the cards hes been handed doesnt try and find someone to sue if everything isnt going quite right for him patricia donnell offered him a calculating smile which sounds to me and im sure to our viewers mr shepherd a very noble sentiment but what im trying to understand what im trying to get my head around is where you really sit in the political spectrum you see there will be those who look at your background an influential family old money in property and banking your strong christian views and ask themselves whether theyre looking at another republican candidate by a different name two things patricia two things you got wrong right there he said working carefully to keep his voice measured and calm and his pace deliberate and even my faith as you well know is church of latter day saints i am not a baptist nor an evangelical nor seventh day adventist i am a mormon theres a big difference there patricia secondly yes i come from a privileged background but weve all worked for that myself my father my grandfather through generations of putting our backs into it weve rightly amassed our wealth and whats wrong with that this is america but because of that he said raising a finger to stop her cutting in because i understand what work is i truly understand the work ethic that a mans toil deserves to be rewarded from the guy operating the factoryfloor machine to the guy sorting letters in the post room to the shift supervisor im not a republican candidate patricia shrugged youre making the right noises for the average republican voter he sighed and shook his head im offering something new something different a new realism common sense politics this nation has been strangled by the shared monopoly of democrats and republicans the man im talking directly to his eyes flickered to the camera in front of them is fed up with looking at washington and seeing this tug of war once every four years between two groups of people who in fact differ very little i mean these guys are in the pockets of the same lobby groups they only seem to care about prolonging their terms in office meanwhile out there in the real world theres problems need fixing patricia nodded there are those who are saying mr shepherd that you will end up just like other independent candidates from previous elections like ross perot like ralph nader spending millions and millions of your own money and getting lost in the void between the two main parties william shepherd smiled and held out three fingers in front of him which he proceeded to count off first there is no void between the two big parties they sit right on top of each other snug as two peas in a pod aping each others policies theres no void at all there miss donnell second i know this country is fed up with the both of them and begging for some new alternative you can feel it in the air like the static before a thunderstorm third he said tucking down the last finger i have the best campaign manager in the world on my side hes never put a foot wrong not yet she smiled quizzically and who well now its god of course chapter august if it aint a wheel then its a goddamned axle keats muttered irritably to ben and broken wing as their ponies trotted side by side towards the growing crowd of people gathering around a wagon that had slewed to one side he stretched up in his saddle and craned his neck to see over the milling circle of broadbrimmed hats and bonnets someones goddamned wheels buckled i betcha he added with a hint of disgust one of them mormon wagons if its the one im thinkin of i heard the wheel creakin yesterday an i damned well warned them about it too there were several dozen men women and children around the wagon which was canted over at an awkward angle household goods spilled out across the hardscrabble ground the team of oxen had been released from their yokes and now grazed oblivious to events on tufts of dry prairie grass some yards away keats dismounted and pushed his way irritably through to the front he watched as preston his sleeves rolled up helped several other men lift the wagons axle onto a block to level the wagon he waited until the heaving and puffing was done and the axle firmly secured before saying his piece preston he called out and then nodded towards the discarded broken wheel no way you gonna fix that ben dismounted and politely pushed his way through the gathered crowd to join keats whilst broken wing remained where he was a respectful distance back standing beside keats ben studied the wheel five of the spokes had split and the metal rim had buckled and twisted as the wheel frame had collapsed in on itself even to his untrained eye there was nothing at all to salvage from it preston looked up at keats taking his widebrimmed black felt hat off and wiping the sweat from his face on a shirt sleeve i believe youre right mr keats the wheel is im sure quite beyond repair the trail guide pursed his leathery old lips and shrugged well we cant sit around here all day talkin about it we got eight more miles to make today before we set down to camp preston nodded i understand but these people the zimmermans need a new wheel making we have those skills amongst our party preston pointed to one of the men standing next to him wearing like his first elder and every other man a white linen shirt a dark waistcoat and a black felt hat mr larkin is a smith and mr the jobs at least two days cut in keats we dont have the time to spend it so carelessly the whole train should be moving on prestons bushy blond eyebrows knotted above his dark sunken eyes he gestured towards the family a couple with a little girl and leave these people to fend for themselves would two days be worth their lives preston looked at the family ben followed his gaze and studied them both the parents were short and stocky their child a girl perhaps a year or so younger than emily dreyton because they will die alone out here keats these good people this precious child it was the first time ben had been up close to preston and heard him speak there was a powerful resonance to his voice and a magnetic charm in his long gaunt face these people trust me to lead them i will not abandon them not over one broken wheel which can be replaced with a new one against his initial judgement from afar ben found himself warming to the mormon leader keats snorted with derision then you shouldnt be a goddamned trail captain he pointed out across the grassy plain towards a small cairn of rocks you see those graves by the side of the trail those are leftbehinds unlucky folks who saw the beast and didnt turn maybe their wheel broke too or their oxen died or they drank foul water an got too sick to travel whatever they got left behind cause they was slowin down their party keats addressed mr zimmerman you should head back to fort kearny leave the wagon load yer supplies on the oxen and turn back mr zimmerman turned to preston william perhaps hes right preston shook his head firmly ill not leave you behind no one will be left behind and that is my final word on this keats shook his head with irritation then my people aint wastin a moment longer were too goddamned late in the season to be losin time like this he turned away from preston and pushed his way back through the crowd towards his pony one of the mormon men standing beside the wagons blockedup axle turned to preston william we have an ornate table in our wagon we could use the tabletop cut to size to replace the wheel it would be far quicker no more than an hour or two keats heard that and turned round anythin but a proper crafted wheel will put a strain on that axle the damn thing will snap the first rock it hits then we will proceed with a greater degree of caution preston replied firmly this wagon will slow us all down preston then we can start out a little earlier each morning keats shrugged casually shit do what the hell you want my partys movin on he swung himself up onto his pony but im tellin you this wagon will slow you down and you and your people will get caught in those mountains when the snow comes god will decide our fate mr keats not some little man who chooses to dress like an indian to impress his clients if it is his wish that we make it across to the other side then the snow will come a little later rest assured pfft keats spat on the ground and nodded for ben and broken wing to follow him cmon he grunted ben pulled himself up and together they headed away from the crowd towards their wagons taking their turn at the rear of the column bunch of goddamned fuckin zealots keats muttered to himself goin t get emselves in real trouble ben looked across at him so what are we going to do whatre we goin do he looked at ben incredulously hell were goin to leave em fools in our dust the group stirred uneasily at the suggestion leave them keats turned to giles weyland yes mr weyland we leave em right here and we press on weyland sported long almost feminine auburn wavy hair and a beard carefully trimmed down to little more than a golden tuft on his chin but sir did we not unite with them out of concerns for our safety he replied in the mellifluous and languid tones of a virginian the indians that lie ahead of us sir it was that particular issue ben noted that seemed to be on their minds the safety in numbers only yesterday they had passed a roadside message the bone express as keats referred to it carved onto the weathered boards of an abandoned conestoga surrounded by the withering carcasses of half a dozen horses they found a warning left by a group of overlanders that had passed this way earlier in the season indians up ahead party attacked some killed be vigilant we got us a choice here said keats we got two different things to busy ourselves worryin about folks the weather and them indians he snorted and spat now them indians may be a problem may not but the weather thats as regular as a goddamned clock that snow will come in october mark my words he looked across at ben whatever the hell that preston says about god willing it or not keatss profanity sent an uncomfortable ripple amongst his party the darkskinned man mr hussein stepped forward my faith is different one to this preston said mr hussein his accent thick and his english laboured the name we are use for pray to him is ullah but is same god i am agree with preston not leaving one behind it is haram keats shook his head horse crap he muttered look ere keats said bowen i aint too sure i want us splitting up from that preston lot not with us aving them savages up ahead to worry about keats looked across to ben and mcintyre i agree with mr bowen said the irishman he met his wifes eyes and she nodded see mr keats i think i speak for most of us said mcintyre looking at the others before he continued i think were more worried about the indians than we are about snow ben found himself in agreement is that not why we hooked up with the others in the first place there was a silence amongst them they watched their trail captain weighing things up he narrowed his eyes scratched his chin and cast a glance towards the peaks on the horizon then turned to broken wing the indian shrugged casually keats sighed you folks all of the same stupid getyourselfkilled opinion heads nodded silently what if we were to start a half an hour earlier each morning as preston suggested and take a little less resting time at noon can we not make up for the slower pace offered ben keats stroked his bristled chin as he considered the suggestion to bens surprise the old man finally nodded fine he said looking back at them but when and mark my words folks when that stupid makedo wheel or the axle holdin it breaks we wont be discussin it like some goddamned town council meeting we leave them behind understand they nodded in unison chapter september it has been hard work in recent days i have not written a word in here for a while we left the plains in the last few days of july and entered the rockies the trail through those spectacular mountains was not as hard as i had anticipated our trail captain keats put the fear of god in us ensuring we hasten on at every moment despite being slowed down by the crippled mormon wagon we crossed south pass on the last day of july gently descending from the mountains on to land so bare and arid that i can barely imagine anyone could survive here but keats assures us they do ute shoshone bannock they all manage after a fashion we have started to see graves more frequently by the trailside sometimes in ones or twos sometimes it seems whole parties there are those that have died because their horses have failed them and those that have died from sickness some of the graves were opened and the bodies unearthed keats said ute most likely did this scavenging for items clothes indians he says do not bury their dead once the spirit is gone they consider whats left as mere carrion he said the same fate awaits the zimmermans when their wheel finally collapses or their stressed axle breaks out here in this salty plain he says they will die quickly and be scavenged first by indians then by vultures mr lambert ben stirred mr lambert benjamin a voice whispered out of the darkness he put down his pen and screwed the lid tightly on his precious inkpot he recognised the voice coming out of the night nearby the lad had sneaked out under cover of dark several times before samuel into the small pool of flickering light from his writing lamp the lad emerged hand in hand with emily a grin of mischievous excitement stretched across her small bonnetframed face emily too he looked at sam will she not be in trouble being out this late mommas at an elders meeting with preston momma wont find out said emily they pray and talk late ben smiled all right then but id hate for you two to get in trouble both of them shrugged come on the pair of you said ben he nodded towards the campfire around which the children from the bowen mcintyre and hussein families sat and played together why dont we join the others he led them over to the communal fire there was a moment of awkwardness as the children sized each other up aware that emily and sam were from the other camp five minutes later names had been politely exchanged and emily was chatting with one of the mcintyre children annemarie a girl a year older than emily who was eagerly showing and sharing her small collection of dolls sam stayed close by bens side fascinated by the dark skins of mr hussein and his family and weylands negro girl and the quiet studied form of broken wing on the other hand the young lad was wary of keats spitting cursing and swapping dirty stories with mr bowen and mr weyland ben noticed sam also discreetly watching over emily across the flames smiling at her giggles of pleasure clearly proud of his little sister and how her evercheerful demeanour instantly charmed the other children and mrs bowen and mrs mcintyre he cares for her more like a father than a brother it made sense there was no father and sam was now of an age where he was becoming the man of their small family but there was a wonderful tenderness he had noticed between them over the last few weeks they were certainly much closer to each other than they were to that cold hardfaced mother of theirs sam would you like a little coffee he nodded ben poured and passed him a mug that he held tightly in both hands savouring both the warmth and the aroma do you have any other family sam uncles aunts grandparents left back east the community is our family he replied we arent allowed any family beyond that arent allowed outside of our church sam cast a glance across at the larger cluster of wagons across the way outside of his ministry but theyre not our real family theres only us he said looking back at emily i dont like it over there he continued were all alone never supposed to talk to anyone else sometimes it feels like were the only people in the world ben nodded it was a bit like that for me too when i was a kid i was an only child and my parents were always busy with other things thats why i like books can you read sam of course but were only allowed to read two ill presume the bible is one of them ben sipped his coffee and whats the other sam shook his head no not that not the bible preston says its full of mistakes and has been corrupted by the jews and the popes we read the doctrine and covenants and the book of new instruction ben looked puzzled never heard of those the doctrine and covenants and the book of new instruction are the only texts were allowed to read any more were not even allowed to read the book of mormon eh but youre mormons surely no sam replied quietly not any more preston wont have us call ourselves that now why he believes the faith has gone wrong been taken over by greedy men he says thats what always happens with faith over and over that its men who take gods message and change it to what they want to hear ben shrugged i think maybe hes right sam glanced at the distant glow coming from the other campfire maybe but it meant we had to leave iowa and come out here why the church other mormons wouldnt allow preston to preach the faith and we had to go because he wanted to sam hesitated a moment a confused anxiety spreading across his face what is it sam asked ben i shouldnt say ill get in trouble then dont i wouldnt want that sam was silent for a while before quietly turning to ben he wants to write a new book of mormon really wont there be a lot of people upset by that angry sam was silent his eyes wide its our secret because itll anger other mormons sam nodded thats why hes taking us all to the west away from the mormon church sam nodded again and then reached out grabbing bens arm ben noticed the boys hand was trembling i i told you something i shouldnt have you mustnt tell anyone please ben shook his head sam its okay i wont if they found out i ttold anyone they the elders preston mr vander mr hearst mr zimmerman my momma mr sam i promise i wont tell anyone you swear ben rested a hand on his i promise listen im not that much of a christian sam im not that much of a believer in anything to tell you the truth if someone wants to mess around with a religious text then thats their business ben felt a tug on his sleeve and turned to see emily standing beside him she showed him a woodenpeg doll its annemaries she explained pointing across the fire at mcintyres daughter she said i could keep her for the journey do you like her benjamin he took it off her and looked it over with an appreciative frown shes lovely do you have many dolls in your wagon emily emily shook her head not really none said sam momma doesnt approve of the dresses they wear says they look like dirty ladies can i keep her sam sam looked down sadly at his sister sorry em if momma sees it in the wagon shell know weve been over emily nodded sadly and turned to take it back i can look after her said ben i could keep her in my saddle bag when we stop over for noon break i could pull her out and let you play with her for a short while your mother neednt know emily swung a small arm around his neck and planted a kiss on his cheek thank you very much at that moment they heard the collective murmur of prayers coming through the still night prayer meeting will be finishing up soon said sam we should go back now emily reluctantly passed ben the doll dont worry he said ill keep her safe you can play with her tomorrow sam smiled gratefully at him and thank you for the coffee benjamin he grabbed his sisters hand and they set off a few steps towards the other wagons before he stopped and turned can i bring emily over again if you like as long as you both dont end up getting in trouble sam nodded and then they were gone ben finished his coffee as he watched them go quickly fading into the darkness soon no more than a flickering silhouette against the distant glow of the other campfire he bid goodnight to those still gathered around theirs for warmth and headed back to where his two ponies were tethered and his bedroll lay he unscrewed the lid of his inkpot and dipped his pen carefully in the people we are travelling with i know nothing about the tenets of their faith it seems so strict and very much apart from the churches i know the women folk of prestons curious style of mormonism appear obliged to be bound head to foot in modest clothing with only their faces revealed the men are all compelled to wear beards clipped from their mouths but left untrimmed beneath their chin long enough to hide a fist within and what a hold he appears to have on them that he can throw away the bible and their mormon book and start over and they will take whatever he decides to write as gospel he looked up from his journal across at the dark outlines of the preston partys wagons i find that disturbing chapter saturday blue valley california rose studied a scanned page from the journal on her laptop its so weird julian looked up from the diners very short singlesided menu what he just seems so i dont know so its like this journal was written yesterday because its not all yea and forsooth and verily rose nodded i suppose so yeah diaries and journals are informal theyre usually the most intimate of historical records no one writes a diary thinking its going to be read by anyone else let alone some historian from the future its personal and a much closer and more reliable record of a persons life than any census or public document when i was a researcher for the bbcchrist ten years ago now julian continued looking down the menu once more i went through loads of unearthed correspondence from roman soldiers dug out along hadrians wall amazing stuff that couldve been written by squaddies serving in iraq lads asking their mums for extra pairs of underwear for soap the language that normal people use and the things that fill their everyday lives what concerns them none of that ever really changes i love that about history the waitress came over with her pad flipped open and ready to go whatll you have julian puffed and bit on his lip for a moment before looking up at her with a hopeful smile i dont suppose you got anything along the lines of a lasagne or a she sighed just whats on the menu sir he nodded suitably chastened oh then um a ranch burger please rose waited until shed finished scribbling and i suppose i better have the caesar salad she said another drink with yer meals julian looked at rose another couple of beers why not the last lot went down easily rose watched her go before looking back at her laptop perched on the small table between them in their cosy corner booth weve got all the pages digitised now julian nodded i flicked through and scanned them last night the lambert journal is now tucked safely away sealed dry and covered grace would approve im sure and very soon itll make a nice exhibit for some local museum thats a relief knowing how clumsy you can be jules i had visions of you spilling coffee all over it or something julian grinned the ole girl would skin me alive rose nodded she would that julian looked around the bar empty except for a couple of young men shooting pool on the far side away from the booths a tv behind the counter was on fox news they were covering the reagan presidential library debate six candidate hopefuls for the republicans were slugging it out between them i think he sounds really sweet who this bloke benjamin lambert dont tell me youre falling for a dead guy she smiled he comes across as tender sensitive i like that rose had come across very few men in her life thus far that she could genuinely describe as tender and sensitive none that had seen past her falsely confident cheeriness and sensed the insecurity inside not even julian who seemed to know her so well not even he sensed she felt like an ugly duckling amongst the glamorous production assistants and floor managers and other media muppets that swanned around their world rose knew julian thought highly of her respected her talent trusted her judgement in fact she was certain most of the male professionals she interacted with on a regular basis were quietly impressed with her techie talk and media savviness but beyond that saw nothing more than a plainjane struggling to stay in a size twelve im no glamorous paris hilton shed moaned once sod that youre the most talented filmmaker ive ever worked with julian had replied sincerely just what an ugly duckling needs to hear the waitress returned with their food and drinks deftly dealing them out with a cheerless smile enjoy your meal she said in a flat tone and was gone rose speared a leaf of lettuce with her fork whilst looking at julians plate god i wish i could eat that sort of crap and stay whippetthin like you ive got a fast metabolism nervous energy actually i thought hitting my late thirties would slow me down a bit he said and then swigged a mouthful of beer god what were you like at my age twentyfive much the same i suppose natures been kind so far you wait till i hit my midforties then ill age ten or fifteen years overnight he picked up his ranch burger which dripped melted cheese and bacon fat she shook her head and smiled wearily i guess ill stick to eating rabbit food drinking decaf and drooling over my george clooney screensaver the only intimacy she shared these days was with things that came with an ac adaptor filming editing mixing filming editing mixing and once in a blue moon she got lucky with a bloke wearing beer goggles it always seemed to be a sound lighting or camera guy charmed more by her ability to talk kit than anything else they ate in silence for a while both hungry after the afternoons hike out of the woods to the parks camp site julian worked through his burger with his eyes on the tv over the bar absentmindedly regarding the suited carefully groomed candidates slinging uninspired soundbites at each other so okay then rosie said julian wiping his mouth with a napkin down to business we need to plan out what were going to do youre the boss she said dryly he put down his burger wiped his hands and frowned deep in thought for a moment i think we could make something more out of this much better than the usual docuchannel fodder i think we could make a featurelength documentary and we could try for something thats good enough for a theatrical release theres no reason why we shouldnt frankly what do you think her eyes widened as she chugged a mouthful of beer from her bottle theres beautiful scenery up here he continued its made for a larger screen those woods and peaks swirling morning mist the right background score god yes she replied grinning something you and i could be proud of he said picking up his bottle and clinking it on hers he finished it and wiped the suds from his lips nice drop of lager that jules love they call it beer here he waved his hand beer shmeer you want another go on then he caught the waitresss eye and ordered two more the thing is he continued i need to head back to the uk this was meant to be a quickie project cheap and cheerful now its something altogether different well need a bigger budget and some investment partners i want to pitch it to some more substantial players not just the bbc oh god this could really make us julian felt a little lightheaded he wasnt sure if it was the adrenaline rush or the budweiser what about me asked rose i need to get back to our studio to put everything weve got together he looked at her her cheeks were pink with excitement maybe you should stay here rose ill be home for no more than a week i guess and then be right back to help i just think someone needs to stick around and keep an eye on our turf if you know what i mean she nodded yeah maybe youre right whats the broadband like at our motel you tried it i think its pretty good both our rooms have got a connection the waitress brought the beers over get you guys anything else julian checked his watch it was late and he knew he needed to be up early to make his way to renotahoe international airport to catch a flight to denver and back to heathrow once they had a few interested partners and some budget money to play around with then he and rose could celebrate properly just the bill please he replied when the waitress had gone he turned back to rose whilst im in london could you knock up a short tasty showreel and send it over sure she said pushing her fringe back out of her face no problem she realised he was looking at her for longer than was comfortable for either of them rose looked away awkwardly and started peeling the label off her beer bottle julian chugged another mouthful renos about two or three hours drive ill take our hire car there if you can get another one arranged locally she nodded as she finished the last of her beer a careless trickle running down her chin as she set the bottle down on the table julian leaned forward and wiped it away with his thumb lush rose felt it she wondered if julian had a little frisson a momentary fizz of excitement he looked awkward slightly embarrassed and withdrew his hand we need to go to my room and check the bandwidth rose felt her cheeks colour i cant believe i just said that sorry of the broadband connection she quickly added the waitress came with the bill he settled it and left a tip maybe we should test it said rose quietly before you go and its too late to know if its good enough to upload a showreel julian smiled hesitantly and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose he sensed something in the invitation something that stepped outside of their tight professional partnership they were both high on the excitement of the story and several beers each was helping to leverage the mood but he knew where this had the potential to go and that in the morning theyd both regret it errr i he stammered rose quickly looked down at her bottle and carried on peeling the label or maybe not she replied uncomfortably maybe its just fine yeah im sure it probably yeah sure it uhh maybe we should check it in the morning sure they both smiled and fidgeted for a moment before reaching for their coats chapter september ben shivered despite being wrapped up in his thick woollen poncho the snow was coming down lightly a fine dusting right now but it had been coming down like that all day enough of it had settled on the ground that the wheels were slipping perilously on the sloping track he watched as a knot of men a mixture from both prestons and keatss parties struggled together with the juryrigged windlass at the top of the rugged incline stout rope was wound around the inner hub of the rear wheel of a large conestoga secured firmly at the top and several lengths ran down the short steep track to a wagon that was midway up and doubleteamed with straining oxen the men pulled on the ropes in unison working in concert with the oxen to ease the cumbersome vehicle up the slope ben eagerly wanted to be back in amongst the scrum of men working the wheel if only to build up a sweat again and get warm but there were only so many men that could fit a helping hand on the spokes without getting in each others way they pulled together with a synchronised grunt with each twist of the wheel the wagon lurched upwards and the straining oxen staggered forward all but a few of the wagons had been manoeuvred to the top of this steep section of keatss trail the shortcut this was the route the old man assured them all that would get them through these wooded peaks to the pass faster than any other trail it was a far quicker route but he had cautioned a much tougher one the process of winching the wagons up the side of the gulch had taken most of the day slowed down by the increasing lack of purchase the wheels were having on the ground as the snow had begun to settle during the overcast and gloomy afternoon mr hussein stood beside him shivering too his breath hung before him as he spoke is being uh much coldness today mr lambert yes ben nodded very bloody cold i cant believe only two days ago i was walking on salt flats with my shirtsleeves rolled up husseins face knotted with concentration for a moment as he translated and then he nodded and smiled yes very sudden is very coldness the men heaved again and the wagon suddenly lurched forward slewing alarmingly to one side of the trail shit ben hissed quietly as the wagon continued its uncontrolled sideways drift mr hussein held his breath as they watched the trail up which they were attempting to winch the wagon was narrow flanked on one side by a steep bank strewn with boulders and small bushes and trees clutching tightly to the ground on the other side the trail dropped away descending steeply to a rocky gulch through which a stream gurgled noisily below my god its going to go over the oxen were losing their footing sliding in the churnedup slick of mud and powdered snow turning to slush ben recognised the woman aboard the wagon as the wife of one of prestons council of elders mrs zimmerman she was perched anxiously on the edge of the jockey board coaxing the oxen forward she let out a shrill cry of alarm as the wagon continued its slide towards the edge the wagon finally came to a rest the left rear wheel slotting into a worn groove on the track carved by the previous wagons mr husseins breath gushed out a plume of languid vapour that hung before him in the still air as it creaked ominously uphill ben realised it was the crippled wagon oh no its the juryrigged one beg pardon hussein asked bens eyes darted to the improvised wheel the round oak tabletop just as it was beginning to buckle and splinter under the lateral weight of the wagon the wagon suddenly lurched at an angle and the wheel cracked loudly ben along with several other bystanders called out to her to jump off mrs zimmerman perched on the jockey board stared down at the gulch beside the wagon and then glanced behind her through the pursed canvas opening of the cover behind her drawn tight with a puckering string whats she doing jump woman jump the wagon slowly slid in the mush further over the edge the fractured wheel creaking alarmingly the oxen on the lefthand side of the doubled team seeing the drop right next to them began to panic scrambling to the right causing a spreading confusion amongst the others the wagon canted still further and ben could see there was an irretrievable momentum building up that was going to carry it over for gods sake jump he shouted at her mrs zimmerman suddenly turned and clawed at the tightened canvas flap she screamed something a warning as she tried to get inside he remembered then that the woman had a young daughter and that she must be inside the wagon the woman managed to loosen the ties of the canvas flap and was half inside desperately scrambling to reach for her little girl when the improvised wheel suddenly shattered with a loud crack the topheavy wagon lost its grip toppling over the edge throwing the woman out on to the ground she landed heavily at the top of the slope only to watch the wagon roll over as it tumbled down the slope crushing the hickory canvas bows and undoubtedly the poor girl inside the oxen dragged over the edge with it followed in its wake a squirming tangled mass of muscle and hide and flailing legs the wagons tumbling descent as one whole came to a shuddering halt as it slammed into a tree trunk the wooden vehicle shattered with an explosive force leaving an avalanche of debris torn and jagged planks of wood barrels and boxes and tattered cloth and shattered pottery to continue its rolling descent to the bottom of the gulch the oxen followed the same path down most of their limbs and necks already broken and flopping like lengths of ribbon skittering down the slope a moment later came a length of rope and attached to it the axle ripped from the conestoga being used as a winch at the top of the hill ben looked up the trail to see that the wagon had been pulled partway down and turned on its side leaving a trail of damaged and battered possessions strewn behind it mr hussein whispered a curse in arabic it was preston who reacted before anyone else throwing his broadbrimmed hat to the ground and beginning to scramble down the perilously steep slope with little apparent care for his own safety from the top of the hill where the men had been working together to winch up the wagon ben heard mr zimmerman bellowing with grief chapter sunday flight ua julian stared out of the window at the fluttering port wing of ua and the two very heavylooking engines that wobbled precariously beneath it he hated turbulence really hated it the seat belts on sign pinged great he muttered gripping the armrest tightly the little girl sitting beside him looked up from the game on her phone are you scared she asked he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and knotted his eyebrows sternly as he turned to her hoping he was conveying both a relaxed lack of interest in the mild buffeting and the notion that right now he really didnt need to be consoled by a maternally minded child just fine thanks she nodded satisfied he wasnt going to need babysitting and returned to her game he returned to focusing his mind off the fact he was riding a ton kerosene bomb feet above the ground kept aloft merely because they were travelling through air fast enough for now he turned away from the window and pulled down the blind if he couldnt see those waferthin wings wobbling through the turbulence it might help there was news playing on the small dropdown lcd screens more on the stilldistant us election and the republican partys continuing efforts to find a strong partnership to run against the democrats it was followed by a quick throwaway item on several independent candidates who had already thrown their hats into the ring there was the usual array of attentionseeking nuts amongst them julian noticed he decided to turn his attention to work opening up a folder of printed sheets the lambert journal but his mind swiftly drifted offpiste rose what happened there in the last few years theyd spent literally thousands of hours in each others company and a few dozen of those the worse for wear from booze but nothing like that had ever happened before on the one hand there was a tingle of desire on the other it felt wrong like looking at a sister or an auntie in a funny way julian shook his head why all of a sudden after three years of working together had this awkward situation cropped up why now for crying out loud work jules work he looked back down at the open folder and the scanned pages of the lambert journal the first entries had been few and far between sometimes days even weeks between them the handwriting was measured tidy comfortably spaced and relatively easy to read but as he flicked quickly through the pages they became longer the handwriting more erratic cramped dense and much harder to decipher like a child running out of space in a school exercise book the letters were shrinking towards the end and the ink grew fainter he found himself squinting with the folder held up almost to his nose as he tried to make out a few random sentences on the last few scanned pages there the writing was all but indecipherable careless hurried scrawls a word here a word there stood out of the dense pages he wasnt sure if his tired eyes were deciphering the spidery handwriting correctly but one word he thought he had picked out whilst digitising the pages a couple of days ago he now saw again murder he felt some instinct inside him twitch he suspected there might be something more to this story than a wayward wagon train that had got lost in the mountains as soon as he got back home he planned to set up some meetings but he was going to have to read through as much of this journal as he could in the meantime then get the story transcribed and typed up for others to read more easily more importantly reading through this diary would help him make sense of the mystery hed discovered at the very back of the journal the ragged edges of three or four pages that had been ripped out murder and mystery this just gets better and better he muttered to himself the girl beside him looked up from her phone for a moment before turning back to playing her game then there was research he was impatient to get back to his flat fire up his computer and start the process of researching this benjamin lamberts background he suspected it wasnt going to be too difficult even back in mids england it was difficult to live a life without leaving behind a forensic trail of yellowing paper records first things first though he flipped back several pages in his notebook and resumed transcribing the contents of lamberts journal stopping every now and then to interpret the faded ink scrawls the gentle buffeting of the plane soon forgotten about chapter september preston emerged onto the track where mr zimmerman stared anxiously down at the tangled wreckage below holding his sobbing wife in his arms and rocking her gently mr zimmerman looked up at him william is she preston breathless from the exertion of pulling himself up the steep slope ignored the father and looked around at the gathered faces he spotted ben mr lambert ben nodded your trail captain keats says you have some medical knowledge what just a little i was training as a doctor before i come with me now let me get my bag quickly please preston led the way back down a treacherous descent made more difficult by an inch of snow rendering every foothold slippery and unreliable near the bottom as the rush of the stream grew louder they passed the oxen wrapped around the base of a stout ponderosa pine like some manylegged manyheaded beast to bens surprise amidst the mass of tan hide one or two of them were still alive struggling and bellowing pathetically they climbed down further until ben could see the tangled remains of the wagon and the curious sight of modest undergarments and sundaybest clothing dangling from the higher branches of several trees nearby as if hung out to dry lower down he could see keats squatting over something near the stream preston stopped and turned round to face him ben could see tears in the mans normally stern eyes i think young johanna will not live he struggled to clear the emotion from his voice shes down there preston led him to the floor of the gulch strewn with boulders shards of shattered and twisted timber and scattered personal belongings the small icecold brook energetically splashed and gurgled around them carrying away with it the lighter things letters poems dried flowers keepsakes and mementoes sailed away downstream this way said preston again leading him over to where keats squatted powder snow gathering on the floppy brim of his tan hat to his credit the grizzled old guide had managed to manoeuvre his scarred and pockmarked old face into something that resembled a tender smile for the poor child ben looked down to see him stroking the ghostly white face of a young girl stretched out across a wet boulder and bathed in the freezing cold water of the stream across her narrow waist lay a large section of the wagons trap the heavy wooden frame had crushed her cutting her almost completely in half my god ben whispered and preston shot him an angry glance if you cannot help her at least let her think you can he hissed at him he nodded and then knelt down beside her johanna is it she looked up at him her blue lips quivering from the cold i i know you yyoure an outsider ben nodded and smiled thats right my names benjamin im a a doctor im going to have a little look at you see what we can do she smiled up at preston ggod aalways pprovides preston stooped down and held her hand yes he does johanna my love god saw to it that dr lambert was to travel with us where is mmy mmomma and ppapa she whispered through flickering trembling lips that were turning blue your mother is fine she leapt free and is safe at the top she sighed with relief and turned to look at preston mmomma ttried to get me ddidnt she yes she did because youre special to us johanna ben looked across at preston it was a tender thing to say she smiled faintly shivering as she did so im hhappy my mmomma is ssafe preston nodded shes fine just fine ben fumbled for her pulse it was weak and fading johanna he said were going to get you out of here then ill tend to you shortly up at the top of the hill it was a shameless lie to comfort her last few moments he looked down at her separated body the shattered timber had cut through her like a serrated blade not a clean bisection but an untidy tangle of shredded organs muscle tissue skin and fragmented bone messy yes well have you out of here very soon but first let me give you something youll feel better ben reached into his bag and pulled out a bottle of laudanum what is that asked preston an opiate it will help her bens words faded to nothing he uncorked the bottle itll make it easier he lifted the girls head and poured a modest amount through her quivering lips almost immediately the trembling began to ease there there cooed ben softly stroking her face theres a good girl youre going to be fine the young girl nodded dreamily reassured by the soothing tone of his voice and the soft touch of his hand she was slipping away now mercifully very quickly with the hint of a smile on her purple lips ben glanced across at keats seeing to his surprise tears tumbling from narrowed eyes and down his craggy cheeks into his beard the guide chewed on his lip silently as preston uttered a quiet prayer looking back down at johanna ben could see she had slipped away im sorry he muttered there was nothing i could do keats nodded nothin no one could do preston turned to them both id like a moment alone with her if you please ben put the glass bottle carefully back in his bag and stood up together he and keats made their way across the stream and a few yards up the steep hill she must have been only eight or nine years old whispered ben poor girl yup keats replied his gravelvoice still thick with emotion and these stupid sonsofbitches will consider it gods will just you see ben nodded they stood in silence awhile and watched as preston knelt down and kissed the child what you saw there lambert said keats was the elephant he knew what the guide meant and that was exactly how it felt as if some huge malevolent entity had grown tired of watching from afar and decided to announce its presence all of us seen the elephant today lambert all of us and that aint no good chapter sunday fulham london julian was glad to be home in his modest flat junk mail was piled up against the inside of his front door and the smell wafting through from the kitchen suggested some food in his waste bin had gone off in the fridge there was nothing to grab he noticed some pate had grown some blue hair and a litre jug of milk had separated into curious layers of yellow liquid and pale gunk otherwise though his flat was the tidy little sanctum sanctorum he had left behind a fortnight ago though keen to hit the sack and catch up on the sleep hed missed in the woods and on his uncomfortably hard motel bed he called soup kitchens parttime receptionist miranda to grab a handful of phone numbers that hed be calling later then he turned his attention to finding some details on be lambert three hours later he pushed himself away from the desk wandered over to the phone and ordered himself a pizza with twenty minutes to wait he sat back down at the desk and reviewed the notes hed printed out it appeared that benjamin lambert had come from a very wealthy family his father maurice had made a fortune on property in the square mile but accrued most of his wealth as a result of investments hed made in america most of this information julian had found on the website of banner house hospice formerly asylum maurice lambert had donated substantially to the institution funding the building of a wing the lambert wing naturally maurice lambert knighted later on had only one son with his wife eugenie nee eugenie davies a distant relative through marriage julian discovered to the duke of westminster their son benjamin edward lambert went to westminster boarding school and on to oxford to study medicine later specialising in the emerging discipline of psychiatry julian wondered if that was his fathers aspiration for his son to practise medicine in the hospital he paid for he also managed to find a short article in the times online archive an article dated in which it was mentioned that benjamin lambert son of sir maurice had announced that he was preparing to extricate himself from polite london society and travel to the americas to explore the wilderness of the west he planned to write a study of the frontier perhaps even a novel which he would publish on his return the paper wished him bon voyage and looked forward to serialising his work and thats where the trail of information dried up julian chewed absentmindedly on a biro that didnt necessarily mean lambert perished out in those woods there might be further biographical footprints from later on in his life elsewhere for example he might have survived and stayed in america in which case there would be a trail somewhere but for now there was nothing more he could easily find any further information on lambert would require some digging the doorbell rang and five minutes later julian was sitting in his bay window looking out past rain streaks at the evening traffic on the road below enjoying a glass of wine and tearing hungrily into a slice of pizza idly his mind kept drifting back to rose and what might have happened last night if thered been just a couple more empty beer bottles on the table between them get a grip julian you work together its best that nothing happened outside a siren bounced off the block of flats opposite as a police car tore down the wet street the noise broke the spell and he figured if it was a spell broken so easily then perhaps it wasnt meant to be back to work slacker he wiped grease from his fingers and returned to the keyboard opening up google and typing preston party he got the usual avalanche of irrelevant hits prestons bar in chicago was having a party there were photos of a preston maceys graduation and subsequent party preston towns civic hall was hosting a question and answer session with their mp from the labour party preston entertainment an online dvd store had a list of movies with party in the title and so on and so on julian sighed there was so much tat on the web these days he tried refining his search preston party mormons he got several more pages of hits to wade through the mormon tag was predominantly giving him loads of community and church pages featuring chatty reportage about recent wholesome family days out and pending prayer meetings lots of pictures of happy shiny faces pictures of church elders respectable and smart successful by the look of many of them gathered at picnics and fairs and camps and tents pictures of sandyhaired kids in smart casual clothes innocent and healthy baring happy grins as they hugged each other and goofed around for the camera julian wondered if any of these kids would one day walk into a high school dressed in black and packing an assault rifle in their shoulder bag ready to do gods work perhaps not whilst julian was not a big fan of religion he conceded that it seemed to hold communities like these together like a sturdy glue it always seemed to be the loners the kids whod floated off into their own lonely parallel universe who ended up blowing their classmates away he leafed through the printed pages of the journal looking for something finding a reference to the preachers first name he tried again william preston and for good measure he added missing wagon train the search was too specific it gave him only one hit he was about to have another go when something about the brief thumbnail description caught his eye account of a mormon wagon train on their way to oregon that went missing he hit the link and was immediately presented with a simple page a black screen topped with a banner that read tracing william prestons party beneath that was a rather dry and blandly written block of text laid out in a small and tiresome font that described little more than the early history of the mormon church if julian hadnt had a particular interest in the subject this drablooking web page would have had him clicking away very quickly the solid block of text started out by briefly describing how the church of the latter day saints was founded by joseph smith then the subsequent troubles in nauvoo the unpleasant infighting of the church the schisms how the mormon church was rounded on by nonmormon christians the outbreaks of violence and then finally describing the great mormon exodus across the great plains further down the page there was a little detail on a minister by the name of william preston who had formed one of many breakaway mormon groups and was delivering his flock from the decadent united states into gods untamed wilderness to set up their own eden the short article concluded that prestons party set out from a place called council bluffs iowa in the spring of and stopped off at an outpost named fort kearny from there they set out into the wilderness never to be heard from again julian noticed an email address at the bottom that was it there were no other links for further reading no hyperlinks to other related pages just this one page of text written by someone who clearly needed to work on his writing style there was a comment beside the email address i am working on a book about this if you have information or wish to share information please contact me at arnold zuckermanartemis com julian hovered over the link tempted to bash out a quick email to see if he could pump the person behind this page for some quick and easy details maybe if he suggested he had some loose association with the bbc the author would be flattered enough to open up and share everything with him he clicked the link and started to write an introductory email and then stopped hang on maybe i should finish up on the lambert journal first yes it would make a lot more sense if he knew how the story of the preston party was going to go before hooking up with anybody else he decided this might be someone worth contacting at a later stage if he needed to fill in some details but not right now whilst this page was most likely authored by some retired old enthusiastic amateur it might just be another journalist or god forbid another programme researcher with the scent of a story in his nostrils instead of emailing the person he bookmarked the page well talk in good time he muttered he poured himself another glass of red settled back in his bay window which was rattling with spots of rain and picked up the pages of lamberts journal chapter sunday haven ridge utah william shepherd looked out of the tall bay windows of his study over the manicured lawns of the campus kept a lush green by the regularly spaced sprinklers that stirred to life in synchronicity every evening several classes were sitting in the warm midmorning sun on the lawn noisily debating scripture or silent in prayer all of them young and earnest people radiant with purpose and gods love such a contrast to the surly groups of teenagers he noticed on every street corner these days soulless meanspirited creatures with dead eyes clustered together like cancer cells shepherd shook his head sadly there was a knock on the door to his study mr shepherd studio three is ready to record your midweek sermon thank you annie he called out tell them ill be along presently he heard the squeak of mrs walls sandals on the wooden floor outside dutifully hurrying off to inform the studio team i have things to think about he had almost missed it because it had been buried amongst all the other email he received daily shepherd had almost deleted it out of hand as a piece of spam mail the message was automated mailed by sitedog software that monitored the accessing of a nominated web page and reported back on details of who and when and how long they had been studying the page he got these notification emails very rarely one every couple of months at most the web page that sitedog was set up to monitor had deliberately been designed to be as unappealing as possible tedious for any casual surfer who might by accident stumble upon it only someone looking for something very specific would be enticed to stay a while he opened the notification mail one visitor several hours ago had loitered around the page for ten minutes and thirtyseven seconds and then clicked on the contact email link who are you then asked shepherd curiously someone else interested or just a passing surfer someone interested might just mean someone with a little information if he wanted he could find out more about this person who had stuck around on this page longer than anyone else had ever done who had even clicked to send an email but apparently decided against it sitedog presented him with an ip address with a little not entirely legal effort he could get a postal address out of that if he wanted to be cautious yes he needed to be that for sure i cant afford to make any silly mistakes now shepherd was beginning to become newsworthy a candidate that some of the news shows were quietly predicting might be worth watching for the future beyond his core audience of latter day saints worshippers beyond those that tuned in regularly to the daily message his name was beginning to register his message was beginning to hit home but unlike the other running candidates there was no party for him to hide behind no ranks of fellow democrats or republicans to close formation around him like a roman testudo to shelter him from the sticks and stones of politics there was just his name his reputation and the message i have to be whiter than white i have to be so careful i cannot afford a single skeleton in my closet chapter september ben watched another of the heavy conestogas slide uncontrollably along the churned narrow trail one wheel clunking and splintering against a jagged rock it held but even he could see it was a wheel now fit to break on the next stubborn boulder or sudden rut in the track either of which could arrive unannounced at any time beneath the thickening carpet of snow on the ground the snowfall had started with a light dusting yesterday morning a feathery weakwilled attempt by the winter to windowdress the peaks a fortnight too early but it was enough ben noticed to put the fear of god into keats and hed been driving them hard since driving them relentlessly towards this pass of his the one he swore would claw back for them days if not weeks and lead them out onto gentle valleys that sloped mercifully down the rest of the way towards the promised land keats convinced preston that a last hard dash was required a run through the night by the light of oil lamps and now through an everthickening curtain of snow a dash for the pass because hampered by snow the final assent would be impossible for the big wagons and more than likely be too much for the small traps as well they had pushed on almost thirtysix hours straight with only two short stops for cold food in that time they had made painfully slow progress uphill along a winding trail through dense woodland trees that had further down the trail held their distance either side of them now brushed against their canvasses and stung their cheeks with swipes of needles and cones not for the first time ben found himself wondering if the old guide had lost his way in the dark and led them up a dead end he led his two ponies the first bearing his personal things the second his medicine box and several sacks of cornmeal and oats he didnt trust their footing now to ride instead choosing to feel his way forward through the three or four inches of snow to the uneven and rutted ground keats likewise was on foot ahead pulling his animal behind him with a vicious determination have you bloody well lost us mr keats he wanted to call out this trail of his seemed to be little more than a narrow artery of steeply ascending ground on which the trees had mutually elected not to grow it certainly didnt feel like wagons had worn a path this way ever beside him an ox lost its footing and stumbled causing the beast behind it to step to the side pulling the conestoga askew it slid in the trampled mush and thudded into a sapling splintering its trunk and sending a shower of snow down on the canvas the oxen and the man leading them struggled to get the wagon on the move again up the incline behind them well he could barely see the glow of the oil lamp of another man leading his team of oxen through the thick veil of feathery snowflakes the train was halted ben looked uphill towards keats the old man was pressing on regardless keats he called out hey mr keats the guide glanced back quickly noting the temporary snarlup he gestured forward and said something that ben failed to understand then he carried on leading the other wagons with him uphill until ben could barely see the faint bobbing glow of the lamp swinging from the back of the rearmost wagon he wondered whether to hurry forward to catch them up or remain with the wagon here still struggling with the weary team of oxen keats he called out again but his voice bounced back off the trees either side and was quickly smothered by the heavy descending blanket of swirling snow are the others not waiting called the man with the wagon one of the mormons it seems not mr larkin what they cant leave us all here let me run ahead he may not understand youve stopped ben tied his leading pony to larkins wagon and then trotted forward stumbling as he tried to catch up as he made his way ahead the lamp at the front of the wagon behind him grew faint and within a dozen more faltering steps he found himself alone in complete darkness and wary that not being able to see anything he might veer away from the grooves in the snow and become lost in the pitchblack wilderness dammit he whispered keats he called out stepping quickly forward through snow that was ankle deep up ahead he saw the reassuring faint glow of light from the rear wagon and puffed with relief as he approached he sensed the incline of the ground lessening each step growing easier the light burned more clearly surrounded by a bloom of illuminated tumbling flakes the wagon had stopped and beside it he saw the shadowy outline of several people oh what now another mishap he drew closer and recognised the outline of keats and his indian broken wing they were talking with others the men from the wagons gathered together in some sort of impromptu meeting up ahead not far keats was saying ben joined them whats not far the pass nope keats shook his head sombrely aint gonna make the pass now he looked up at the dark sky and squinted at the thick flakes settling on his face he brushed them irritably away no way we gonna get through that now broken wing found us a space big enough we can camp up in for tonight were stopping he nodded were stopping he spat into the snow cant see for crap in this anyhow well see what kind of a mess were in in the morning he turned to the men gathered around follow broken wing its just up ahead as the men moved off to return to their wagons he stepped towards ben you head back down the hill lambert and tell the others theres a big clearing up ahead and were makin camp there right now ben nodded i suppose this is it then keats shrugged snows come real early might just be a warning an itll melt off in a day or might be the winters gone an beat us to the mountains ill see better in the mornin chapter september it seems keats was right we should have left that crippled wagon behind and moved with greater haste now with the morning i can see what sort of a predicament we are in to my inexperienced eye this doesnt look like snow that will melt away under a few hours of sunshine ben looked up from his journal and out through the open canvas flap the pale morning sun was a pitifully weak glowing disc in the white sky the forest surrounding the clearing was uniformly white the tall douglas firs and spruces each bearing their own thick burden of snow against many of the wagons thick powdery drifts had piled up almost completely burying their wheels last night as the snow came down in gusting diagonal streaks enormous flakes the size of a childs fist ben had hurriedly tried to improvise a bivouac it was too dark to hack branches from the trees around the clearing the best he could manage was to roll himself up snugly in his poncho inside his bedroll and canvas tarp moisturesealed with linseed oil and shelter beneath the trap of mr mcintyres conestoga whilst his two ponies shivered together out in the open but mcintyre wouldnt have it when he heard ben shuffling around beneath their cart and insisted he come in with them for the night the otherwise uncomfortable squirming of fidgeting children was pleasantly comforting and more importantly warm the mcintyres were kind to have offered him a space but with three children in the back of the wagon the arrangement could only be for the one night there was a stirring in the wagon and a chorus of croaky good mornings exchanged amidst plumes of condensation outside ben could see there was already a flurry of activity keats was already up and taking note of the downfall his flinty old face normally frozen into its one and only expression of tired sufferance was now drawn into a stretched scowl of concern ben watched him talking quietly with broken wing both looking up repeatedly at the featureless white sky other people were rising emerging from their wagons pushing cascades of snow off their laden canopies dropping out of the back into kneedeep drifts and yelping with surprise keats nodded firmly the discussion with broken wing concluded and a decision made goddamned snows here now he bellowed angrily his voice echoed back off the trees a moment later therell be no going anywhere now he stamped snow off his boots and deerskin britches damn it ben put away his writing things cmon everyone up weve got work to do keats was barking out orders to everyone his people and prestons to get up to get to work thats it cmon everybody up your wagons aint wagons no more they gotta be turned into winter shelters ben thanked mr and mrs mcintyre for taking him in last night considering how deep the snow was he realised he would have had to dig himself out if he hadnt frozen to death in his sleep mcintyre was already sorting through his tools mrs mcintyre flashed him a smile well now were all in this together mr lambert arent we everyone up cmon theres work to do plenty of it keatss voice echoed around the clearing get up and grab your tools ben disentangled himself from the splayed limbs of the stillsleeping children and climbed out through the canvas opening shuddering as a blast of freezing air enveloped him a contrast to the warm fug of body heat built up in the mcintyres wagon overnight he dropped off the trap kneedeep into the snow and found himself wincing at the bright upwardreflected glare all around him looking around he hadnt realised how big the clearing was last night the wagons had limped into this place after dark with snow reducing visibility to just a few dozen yards there had appeared to be space enough to spread out off the track and corral the oxen together and so they had expecting that with first light they would hitch up again and be moving on ben watched as men obediently stirred from every wagon prestons people as well as keatss each brandishing a saw or an axe they waded through the snow towards keats he saw the tall slender frame of preston amongst them almost a head taller than most of the stocky men of his church gentlemen join us here in the centre prestons voice boomed across the clearing with your tools if you please ben made his way towards keats broken wing stood silently beside him his head covered with a red woollen cap good morning said ben whats good about it spat keats angrily men gathered about him preston pushed his way through them mr keats it appears then that the weather has let us down you could say that the old guide replied dryly will this lot melt do you think keats shook his head nope this aint a warning of winter this is it for real it just arrived last night and aint goin nowhere till spring could we not at least try for your pass asked preston too goddamn steep you want the ground clear dry an hard an sure as hell it aint any of those right now so youre saying were stuck here unless we leave here on foot preston shook his head no no that would be impossible these wagons contain all my people have everything keats nodded theyd lose it all thats for sure anyway youd be a fool tryin to make it out on foot through the winter not even indians an trappersll do that if they can help keats nodded to the people emerging from their wagons an you got women and little uns to worry bout preston nodded contritely ben sensed there was an unspoken apology in the subtle tip of his head you are a man i presume who has experienced a winter in the wilderness keats snorted sarcastically reckon a few then i shall bow to your greater experience what are we to do the old man sucked a lungful of chilled air in through his bulbous pockmarked nose ben suspected that deep down the guide was probably savouring a moment of schadenfreude at prestons expense well if wed left that lame wagon wed have made it through but i reckon winters here now so best we can do preston is think about turnin this space in the woods into a winterin camp that means you gotta turn those wagons of yours into shelters there was a ripple of consternation amongst the men nearby yeah thats right youre gonna break em up for lumber that you can use to build i cant do that called out one of the mormon men my wagon cost me the best part of fifty dollars other voices murmured in agreement should we not just wait for this snow to clear asked another keats shook his head like i already said this aint clearing till march would the wagons not be shelter enough keats looked at broken wing and repeated something in an indian tongue the indian snorted with dry amusement gonna get a lot colder than last night you gonna have to build yourselves proper winterovers several more voices amongst the gathered men now numbering about forty were raised in concern ben noticed none of them neither prestons men nor keatss party were happy with the idea of admitting defeat so readily quiet there barked preston there was silence mr keats knows better than anyone here what winter in these mountains will bring preston looked around at the men we shall take his very good advice and be thankful to god that he sent this man along with us preston turned back to keats not a one of us has had to build a winter shelter in haste from a wagon how do you suggest we proceed you gotta build yourself a sturdy frame from the lumber to start keats replied without a beat gotta be a good goddamn frame too theres plenty of snow gonna drift up and that weighs some he pointed to the nearest conestoga good solid planks there along the length of the trap will do fine the canvas goes over the frame then you gotta cut yourself as much pine as you can for warmth pile it on top of the canvas thick as you can the snow thatll gather on top of that will keep you warmer still preston nodded frames gotta be strong though said keats gonna be your home for near on six months id say chapter september ben stood back exhausted by the mornings work and sweating profusely despite having stripped down to his shirt and rolled both sleeves up faint vapours of steam rose from his damp exposed forearms and out through the unbuttoned neck of his shirt he watched broken wing working with several spruce saplings bending their pliable length to form an onionshaped dome the tapering ends at the top bound tightly together the thick bottoms wedged deep into the ground meanwhile keats returned with another armful of pine branches and dropped them on a substantial pile beside the frame to their shelter you helpin lambert or just gonna sit on your ass and watch he growled sorry ben jumped broken wing finished securing the frame of their shelter and spoke in his tongue to keats hes asking for your canvas sheet oh right ill fetch it ben hurried over to where his two ponies were huddled together and pulled out his tarpaulin from a saddle pack he returned and handed it to the indian broken wing turned it over in his hands studying it and then looked up at ben flashing him a quick grin and a nod isss good he uttered in a chopped guttural manner it was the first time ben realised that hed heard the indian speak in english cmon lambert help me get some more of this we gonna need to pile it high on top of the canvas ben followed keats to the edge of the clearing looking around him as he stepped through the snow the clearing was alive with activity and noise the hacking of axes and zipping of saws through lumber bounced and echoed around their little world framed on all sides by tall spruces and firs that grew up gentle slopes surrounding their bare basin he saw a team of mormon men bring down an entire tree a barked warning then a creak and crash as it swung down amidst a cloud of dislodged powder snow then the men swarmed upon it other men worked diligently on their wagons easing out lumber nails carefully cannibalising the precious planks to use for their frames here said keats pointing to a pile of pine branches ahead at the edge of the clearing take those back to broken wing ben bent down and scooped up as much as he could carry the coarse needles and cones scratching his bare forearms he stood up and looked into the thick tree line in front of him an ascending gradual slope of tree bottoms a world of only two colours white and the dark greygreen of bark move yourself lambert grunted keats as he took an axe to a nearby fir and hacked another lowhanging and heavy branch from it ben staggered back across the clearing with his load nodding politely to mr bowen and mr mcintyre both working together on building their frames from the planks harvested from their traps he dumped his load of branches on the pile and looked at the progress broken wing had made with the canvas it was already wrapped tautly around the sapling frame and their shelter for the moment looked like a low bulbous tepee will that be strong enough do you think asked ben the indian looked up at him his face a questioning frown the frame said ben reaching over and running his fingers along one of the ridges beneath the tarpaulin he gestured at the pile of pine branches these branches are very heavy broken wing nodded isss ssstrong he whacked the frame with one hand it creaked alarmingly but barely moved its fine lambert said keats approaching with another armful of branches that he dumped down on top of the pile the weight of this lot an the weight of the snow will make it stronger he grinned a mouth with as many gaps as teeth its all in the shape lad ben nodded yes i suppose like arched brickwork spreading the load keats shrugged reckon at that moment ben spotted preston approaching the minister like every other man in the clearing had shed his long dark coat his white shirt and dark waistcoat and stood in a vanilla cotton undershirt circled with dark patches of sweat mr keats he called out breathlessly as he took the last few strides through the snow towards them mr keats he said again as he drew up beside them i suggest we have a clear plan for our camp where things should be if we are to winter here keats stroked his chin for a moment and nodded reckon so may i suggest the oxen be corralled centrally in the middle of this clearing ben looked around the clearing was roughly oval about a hundred and fifty yards maybe two hundred in length an oasis of open space in an endless sea of unbroken woodland that continued all the way up to a horizon of bare craggy peaks you unerstand the oxen will die preston theyre our food now yes indeed i suggest if we corral them all together in the centre of the clearing in the space between your shelters and ours theyll keep each other warm and last longer keats pursed his lips make better sense to kill em all now longer they live the thinner theyll get preston glanced towards the assembled herd of beasts well over a hundred of them for the moment there was meat and muscle under their tan hides id like to keep them alive a little longer just in case this early snow is a passing thing it aint passing nonetheless for now id prefer to keep them alive keats shrugged the coldll get em before they starve anyways we shall have to be sensible and fair with how we ration out the food preston uttered thoughtfully you say were likely to be stuck here until spring yup hmm keats bent down and picked up his deerskin jacket now they were just standing the cold was beginning to bite reckon we need to be careful with the food from now on he said fastening the toggles start as we mean to go on yes of course preston nodded one of my people mr stolz is a butcher by trade he might be best qualified to deal with each carcass as it becomes available i think mr bowen is as well cut in ben then i reckon they can both be in charge of the ox meat that good for you preston preston nodded even managed a faint smile that seems fair also gonna need regular firewood comin in yes i suppose we can arrange some kind of rota start a firewood pile in the centre and make sure that its kept topped up each day keats grunted agreement an we need to rrange a night watch never know whats out there in these woods even in the winter preston looked surprised is there likely to be anything out there mr keats keats glanced towards broken wing and they exchanged a few words in his language broken wing says its possible some paiute huntin party might be aroun keats looked up at the trees hell might still have a bear or two out there lookin to fatten up yet be worth havin someone awake with a loaded gun yes i agree with you keats managed a laugh whats the matter mr keats keats looked at him and shook his head with bemusement seems like we foun ourselves agreein on a whole buncha things hell never wouldve expected that perhaps its gods will mr keats that we are marooned here together preston said offering a genial smile that we can learn a little from each other keatss expression froze for a moment ben half expected a caustic reply but instead his craggy face split into a grin his laugh a loose rattle well you can put in a good word for me if you like preston preston nodded politely we shall include you and your people in our prayers this evening he turned to observe the men in his group working vigorously with their axes on the thick branches they had hacked from the trees and i will call a meeting amongst my people directly as you suggested we shall arrange things like the firewood and the allocation of meat from the oxen good keats nodded an minell do likewise preston turned to go and then stopped his eyes turning on ben mr lambert yes would your knowledge of medicine be available to all of our small community good grief yes yes of course ben replied we would of course pay for any medicines we consume and your services ben shook his head thatll not be necessary mr preston i believe were all together in this now i have a good supply of medicines in my chest and ill certainly have enough time on my hands to practise doctoring prestons long and normally severe face cracked with a goodnatured smile thats generous of you my thanks he nodded politely at keats and then turned away pushing through the deep snow towards the nearest of his men keats looked up at the darkening grey sky shit gonna start snowin again he muttered chapter sunday blue valley california rose watched the upload bar slowly creep forward there you go jules she said stretching tiredly in her chair he was going to love it she was sure shed edited together a three minute sizzle a montage of footage from the site the surrounding woods a couple of quick establishing shots of the sierra nevadas taken from a professional online image and video library and some sepia portraits of emigrants ready to set out from independence over this she had laid some of julians commentary and some of graces comments that earthy midwest marlboro voice of hers played beautifully against the images in the background she had laid down a fantastically haunting and chilling piece of music shed found on the net a piece of traditional folksy americana played on a guitar and a violin having completed the editing and composited a final build she had sat back and watched the short piece at least a dozen times every time the hair on the nape of her neck began to tingle and rise hes gonna love it rose checked her watch and realised it was three in the morning she looked around her motel room it was a tip littered with a couple of empty pizza boxes and soda cans her clothes lying in a mouldering pile at the end of her unmade bed the muted tv in the corner flickered with the images of a twentyfourhour news station it reminded her very much of her student digs from a few years ago only back then it wasnt just her mess it was the communal mess of half a dozen of them ongoingparty mess empty cider cans unwashed dishes overflowing ashtrays and halfempty packets of cigarette papers all very cool very young very groovy looking at the squalor around her right now in her silent motel room this mess made by one lonely person just looked very sad why the hell did i hit on him like that the thought came out of the blue rose winced keeping busy these last two days and nights shed managed not to think about it but now having got the job done there it was an awkward exchange of mumbled words clumsily loaded with a suggestion check out my broadband she shuddered what was i bloody well thinking julian had distinctly recoiled with embarrassment she looked in the vanity mirror above the dresser look at me a twentyfiveyearold frump her ratbrown hair was pulled back into a practical bun her redrimmed eyes fatigued from fortyeight hours of staring at a monitor were small and unappealing she hated her stubby nose and thin uninviting lips and out of view of the mirror was the onestoneover bottomheavy figure she preferred to keep hidden beneath baggy jeans on any normal high street she looked average but amongst the glamorous waiflike media moppets that populated the world of digital tv rose felt like a sack of potatoes it was a sad state of affairs that julian a man fifteen years older than her had politely turned her down and jules was hardly johnny depp with a choice of fawning waifs to choose from she looked at a segment of digital footage on her laptop julian talking to camera she smiled not so much johnny depp as a downmarket louis theroux again her mind drifted painfully back to that maladroit exchange and she cringed forget it she muttered do some more work she watched the loading bar on the screen near completion now that jules had his sizzling trailer to show off at the meetings hed arranged shed decided it might be a useful idea to research this story from the urban myth angle this small town blue valley had more than its fair share of them according to grace rose wondered if they linked back somehow to this lost wagon train inevitably most urban ghost stories tend to originate from a root event usually quite mundane she wondered whether most of the interesting tales theyd recorded last week whilst interviewing the locals stories of shrouded figures walking skeletonmen and glowing lights in the woods could ultimately be traced back to survivors of that wagon train it was a possibility there would have been survivors surely rose wondered if grace was around in town tomorrow or whether she was on duty at the national parks service camp site up in the woods maybe shed just drive up in her rental and see take some flapjacks or bagels up have a natter and a nibble rose liked grace she reminded her of a grumpy old chainsmoking aunt shed had before cancer got her chapter october ben could hear children further away in the woods their voices echoing distantly through the trees thats the stolheim children said sam theyre out collecting firewood too ben bent over picked up a fallen branch and brushed the snow off it theres a lot of dead wood and kindling in this forest a hell of a lot easier than foraging for buffalo chips out on the prairie eh sam grinned guiltily at bens casual profanity so wheres emily today he turned and glanced back through the trees towards the camp several pale columns of smoke rose lazily up into the featureless white sky from within the clearing below shes at a prayer meeting in the temple prestons people had put a lot of effort into constructing one shelter that was larger than all the others in the camp from the outside it appeared to be big enough to allow room for the quorum of elders a committee of twelve who met several times a day in there they also used it for prayer meetings and scripture studies for the younger ones it was their church or temple as they referred to it as well as prestons shelter vander hearst and preston take turns teaching scripture to some of the children directly sam picked up a branch then turned to look back down at the snowcovered mound of the temple vanders teaching her right now teaching her on her own ben detected something in his voice i dont like that said sam after a while why sam didnt answer at first instead busying himself with searching for twigs and small branches sam vander once taught me alone he said eventually more to himself than aloud to ben when i was smaller there was an uncomfortable silence ben had once experienced a similar faltering conversation with a very withdrawn firstyear boy at boarding school unpleasant things had happened there from time to time that were best left alone and not raked over you endured whatever treatment came your way and didnt cry about it thats how the best schools turned boys into men at least thats what bens father used to say ben yeah when we make it down from these mountains in the spring where will you go i shall head for portland eventually maybe ill explore a few other townships along the way then i fancy i shall spend some months enjoying the comforts of a hotel room in that finesounding town and write about the crossing and our adventure here in the mountains and see about getting it published sam smiled faintly will emily and i be in your book of course how could you not be sam smiled he liked that and what will you do after that then i suppose i ought to return to london my parents expect me to one day come back and if not become an eminent psychiatrist to at least take over my fathers business affairs ben was resigned to that ultimate fate it was waiting for him eventually in a few years time i would miss the freedom out here in the wilderness though miss it sorely but i owe my parents on a promise i made to come back soon he turned to sam what about you preston will lead us someplace where were all alone away from any other people from outsiders he replied cheerlessly and returned to the task of foraging for firewood dipping down to pull a long crooked branch from the snow and brushing it off he snapped the dry wood with several loud and brittle cracks tucking the shorter lengths into his bundle of kindling ben resumed foraging and they worked in silence for a while accompanied only by the crunch of their feet on the snow and the distant sounds of movement and chattering voices elsewhere in the woods youre not happy in prestons church sam shook his head he frightens me frightens you why the young man tightened his lips and shook his head he just does look here ben stood up straight and adjusted his bundle of kindling i suppose when youre grown up you could leave though couldnt you if youre so unhappy with them you could find your own way couldnt you sam shook his head not without emily im all shes got she has her mother sam looked at him theyd never let her go anyw they heard a raised voice ahead of them an unmistakable cry of surprise or alarm then other voices including prestons calling out something had happened ben and sam dropped their bundles and headed towards the exchanged shouts ben unslinging his rifle and sam following suit they pushed through a tangle of undergrowth and briar poking up out of the thick snow dislodging clouds of powder from the lowhanging branches above them this way said ben leading sam up a steep incline stumbling over buried knots of tree roots rocks and sapling stalks at the top the incline levelled off revealing a small glade nestling below in a dimple of land in the hillside the glade had been hacked clear of wood from the look of the old weatherworn tree stumps that poked up through the blanket of snow a task carried out by someone many years ago in the middle there was a crudely constructed shelter clearly not the work of any trained artisan there was no carpentry to be seen it was a ramshackle structure of stacked boughs held together with hide strips and the gaps between them daubed with packed mud ben and sam made their way down the slope towards the clearing to get a closer look the entrance to the shelter was a low arched gap in the uneven knobbly wall covered over by a tattered buffalo hide in the small clearing in front of the shelter frames of wood had been erected ben noticed the dried and leathery carcasses of skinned forest hares dangling in an untidy row from several of them theyd been dangling for a long long time by the look of it the hares seemed more fossilised than rotten preston and three other mormon men stood in the clearing before the shelter surveying the scene they noticed ben and sam as they emerged into the clearing mr lambert samuel preston called out it appears were not the only ones out here in these woods ben made his way over what is this is it an indian camp do you think preston casually scratched the dark beard beneath his chin is it more likely a trappers camp he replied pointing towards a wall of the shelter lined with an arrangement of differentsized skulls their smooth yellow ivory boiled and scrubbed clean by somebody long ago or perhaps merely worn away by the elements ben couldnt identify with any certainty what animals they had once been one or two of them might have belonged to deer or stags another might have belonged to a horse or a pony actually it looks like its been abandoned for a while said ben preston nodded yes it would seem so should we look inside william asked hearst one of the men with preston he nodded perhaps to be sure he held out his hand your gun please saul the man passed him his rifle and preston pulled back the hammer to half cock and slotted a percussion cap in the weapon now ready to fire you men best stay back he said as he stepped towards the entrance he lifted aside the tattered flap of canvas and called out is there anyone inside there was no answer ben watched preston stoop down low and step into the dark interior admiring the confidence and courage of the man the others stood in silence their rifles held ready listening to the whispering wind in the trees and the hiss of disturbed snow cascading down through shifting branches from inside the shelter they heard a shuffling of movement then after a few moments the canvas flapped to the side and preston emerged this is some poor souls grave he uttered solemnly by the look of it quite a few years ago preston turned round to look at the shelter he died in his cot so it seems he shook his head sadly a lonely death for this man preston bowed his head let us pray for his soul ben watched the men and sam remove their broadbrimmed hats and lower their heads he took his own felt hat off out of respect and listened to prestons sombre words he finished and the men chorused amen ben nodded towards the shelter we could use the wood preston shook his head well not strip this place for firewood let it remain to mark this unknown souls grave theres plenty enough kindling lying on the forest floor come on he led them away from the clearing up and out of the dimple standing for a moment on a small ridge of high ground and looking through a break in the trees down the sloping hillside ben could see in the distance the large clearing in which their camp nestled amidst the churned dirty white of mud and snow he spotted the small shapes of sluggish movement among the shelters the tan mass of huddled oxen stirring in the centre and the pall of a dozen wispy columns of smoke snaking up into the heavy sky ben turned to look back down into the dip at the longdead hunters shelter a forlorn sight and wondered how it must feel to die alone and not be missed by anyone chapter october i share this small space with mr keats and broken wing i have to admit they have built a very robust and surprisingly snug shelter there is no room of course to stand upright one enters on hands and knees and at best in the very centre of the shelter may stand but only if stooped over at the top where the saplings converge in a knot of coerced boughs there is a small gap that frequently needs a stick poked up through it to clear the snow this small hole in our roof allows for us to burn a modest fire inside the smoke being very efficiently sucked away through this improvised chimney not every shelter i notice anticipated this luxury and i have often seen less fortunate people spilling out of their shelters coughing and spluttering i have much to be thankful for having such experienced and knowledgeable shelter companions however i do find many of keatss personal habits quite repulsive at such close quarters his incessant ritual of snorting and spitting whilst tolerable outside is utterly unforgivable inside so much so that i gifted him with one of my own fine linen handkerchiefs a present from mother i imagine she would be mortified at the unimaginable material that gets deposited into it every hour of every day but as a small consolation now at least my hands are less likely to find congealing tarstained globules of mucus on the floor of our shelter ben looked up at them broken wing was absorbed in carving an intricate pattern of crisscrossing lines into the bark of a log keats was smoking his pipe silently ben wondered how much tobacco the man had brought with him since he seemed to be always either at the point of filling his pipe or emptying it keats looked his way and took the stem of the pipe out of his mouth what the hell you scribblin bout in there anyway i seen you doin it enough been meanin i gotta ask my journal i ben shrugged selfconsciously i have always aspired to be a writer thought you was a doctor i am at least i was studying anatomy before i changed to psychiatry siwhat study of the malaise of the mind but to be a writer of tales like charles dickens thats my dream never heard of im the fire in their shelter had died down to little more than a bed of embers which every now and then sprouted a flickering flame thats why i came across to the americas to explore the wilderness to have an adventure to write about keats chuckled reckon you got more venture than you bargained for eh ben smiled i console myself with the thought that my journal will turn out to be far more interesting than i could have hoped aye grunted keats i think ive used enough candle tonight ben closed the lid of his inkpot noting as he did that it was approaching halfempty and that hed need to weaken the mix with some water to let it stretch further he snuffed out the small candle beside him instantly throwing the shelter into complete darkness save for the occasional guttering flame from the middle that illuminated them with a staccato amber light it was then that they heard the first sound of disturbance a moan that was a note deeper than the wind then they heard the muffled scream of a woman the hell was that growled keats another more intense scream come on the flap to their shelter swung open letting in an icy blast keats scrambled out followed by broken wing ben reached for his poncho and crawled outside a gusting wind was carrying small stinging powdery granules of ice the scream came again over amongst them mormon shelters said keats immediately setting off across the clearing pulling out his hunting knife broken wing followed instinctively pulling out his tamahakan from a sheath strapped to one thigh ben looked down at his hands and what did i bring a bloody writing pen he shook his head chastising himself for not reaching for his gun then set off after them they scrambled through kneedeep snow around the huddled mass of oxen baying pitifully in the cold towards the more congested end of the clearing almost a villageworth of ramshackle shelters clustered around the only construction that looked remotely like a building their church ben could see movement in between the shelters the glow of their communal campfire provided enough light to see a confusing melange of fastmoving silhouettes but nothing he could make sense of yet they heard the deep moan and even bens untrained ears identified what he had heard bear shouted keats goddamned bear they saw it reversing out of a shelter its powerfully muscular hindquarters backpedalling its head and shoulders angrily shaking off the pine branches and snow that had tumbled onto its back as it probed inside through the low entrance the shelter shook violently as it pulled out and turned round to face the gathering circle of people immediately it reared up on its back legs bellowing furiously and waving two enormous paws in front of itself claws protruding and glistening like knife blades anyone with a primed gun shouted keats there was a confusion of panicked responses from those gathered already a dozen men had emerged most clasping a rifle but none it seemed loaded and ready to fire the night was alive with cries of alarm dancing halflight from the nearby campfire shadows darting in fear and the towering form of the bear in the midst of it all ben saw prestons tall frame emerge from their church and quickly join the crowd whos the night watch preston called out aye a voice called out from the growing cacophany can you fire yes then do so ben saw a man emerge from the confusion and take several fearful steps towards the bear he saw the long barrel level horizontally wavering for only a moment before discharging with a deafening boom amidst a cloud of powder smoke the shot missed the bear dropped down onto all fours and then with terrifying speed charged across the snow towards the man who remained frozen to the spot with fear too late he gathered his wits and turned but the bear was on him swiping both legs from beneath him with a casual blow of his forepaw the man fell on his front and flipped round onto his back to fend off what he knew was coming his hands held out before him a pitifully futile gesture the bears jaw snapped open and closed on one hand the mans voice became a scream of terror as the bear swung its muzzle ferociously from side to side snapping bones and tearing off the mans hand and forearm leaving a tattered and ragged stump at the elbow the man showed surprising prescience by taking the fleeting opportunity to try and escape as the bear mauled for a moment on its prize with his one good arm he hurled the spent rifle at the creature then attempted to pull himself to his feet there were screams of encouragement from those gathered shortlived the bear again swiped at his legs and this time collapsed its heavy weight onto his back driving the wind out of him more than likely crushing his ribcage without any hesitation this time the bears long muzzle closed on the mans head with a sickening crunch it was then that ben noticed preston stepping quickly forward from the crowd a smoking branch in one hand get away he roared angrily charging the last dozen yards forward and poking the smouldering end of the branch into the bears flank it let go of the mans head and turned to face preston roaring with wild rage at the intrusion and swinging a claw at the branch get back you fool ben found himself urging preston away shouted preston taking a step forward and jabbing the creature in the flank again the second jab was enough the bear abandoned the man on the ground who ben was surprised to see was still moving it advanced on preston rearing up on its hind legs and baring teeth red with blood from which dangled tatters of flesh can anyone fire preston called out over his shoulder his voice broken with fear ben looked around to see at least half a dozen men frantically and shakily priming their guns with powder and shot the bear dropped down on to all fours can anyone fire preston shouted again backing up slowly there were screams of alarm people begging preston to turn and run while he still had a chance but he stood his ground bending his knees in readiness holding nothing but a smoking fragile branch then the bear charged one paw swiped aside the pitiful stick the other swiped across prestons chest hurling him a couple of yards across the snow where he landed heavily and almost immediately began to stain the snow dark the bear was astride preston when another shot rang out this time punching the bear heavily in the side it reared up in rage and agony losing its balance and tumbling over it recovered its footing but the shock of the wound seemed to have been enough to change its agenda with surprising speed it raced away on all fours from the baying crowd out of the pall of light from the fire and into the darkness ben looked around to see where the shot had come from and saw keats still squinting down the levelled length of his rifle and a cloud of blue smoke languidly rolling away from the muzzle ben rushed towards preston lying on the ground and clutching his side painfully gasping short little breaths that peppered the snow with dots of blood he looked up at ben and managed to rasp im fine man you tend to james first ill wait chapter monday blue valley camp california rose found her easily she was serving in the convenience store on the camp site she had enjoyed the halfhour drive up the twisting mountain road from blue valley it was a steep incline all the way that taxed the hire cars modest engine so that it whined like a fly in a tin can but also a spectacular drive with thick firs to her left and a drop to her right revealing a sweeping and breathtaking picturepostcard vista of a broad valley and a gently winding river the camp site set alongside a small manmade lake was all but deserted this time of year most of the family cabanas were empty just one or two occupied by hardy folk who obviously enjoyed hiking national park sites all year round she imagined that in the middle of summer with a clear blue sky bathed in welcoming sunlight and alive with smoking barbecue pits and children charging into the crystalclear lake water it was the kind of camp that holiday brochures are made for but right now with the wan light of autumn and a bland tupperware sky abandoned and silent it looked a somewhat cheerless place the door to the convenience store opened with a quaint smalltown ding that reminded her of mr godseys corner shop on waltons mountain grace was perched behind the counter in her national parks service uniform stuck into a sudoku puzzle she looked up and her weatherworn face creased into a smile hey rose hi rose replied i must have taken down your cell number wrong i tried to call you problems no rose shrugged just getting a bit lonely i suppose jules has shot back to london for a few days and im taking a break from messing around with my cameras grace put down her paper howre things going with your little film very well i think i havent heard much from him he sent a text saying hes already got some good meetings lined up grace nodded and then leaned forward lowering her voice slightly louise esterfeld the park manager asked me about you guys how the field trip went oh wanted to know if her camps going to end up in your film she snorted whether you guys goin to give her an interview and such i suppose we could do that if you think itll buy us a little good will grace shook her head screw that silly woman just wants her face on tv anyways told her you were wanting another trip up into the woods sometime soon rose smiled coyly and winked and thats when well discover a very interesting find grace nodded cant leave it too much longer though i know it was juless suggestion that they give her a little thank you money there were ways and means of doing that rose imagined a proud and hardy woman like grace would find a wad of notes in a plain brown envelope distasteful although she could probably well do with it it had taken no more than a dozen mouse clicks on the internet for rose to find how little the national parks service paid their wardens a pittance they seemed to rely more on the dutiful enthusiasm of their staff to keep things running than on a properly managed budget grace leaned back on her stool and pulled a mug out from a shelf beneath the till wanna coffee thanks look grace ive got a couple of days to kill i thought id fill the time with a bit of research and gather up some local flavour for our story the older woman filled the mug from a thermos flask and placed it on the counter comes already with cream and sugar she said thats fine thanks what sort of research she passed a steaming mug over the counter to rose who took a sip it was sickeningly sweet well i suppose i could start with the various ghost stories weve heard from people in blue valley there do seem to be a lot of them grace nodded yup and all very different but i wonder whether its possible to trace their roots back to something that did actually happen youre thinking some of them might have something to do with that find out there rose nodded thats usually the case though isnt it i mean maybe some of the people who ended up stuck in those mountains made it down okay into this town theyd have stories to tell possibly some quite gruesome stories particularly if they ended up like that donner party its possible i spose i can imagine that over a hundred and fifty years those could eventually become the basis for the local ghost stories that julian and i recorded people talking about last week rose sipped her coffee i mean there was one bloke who said you know how it goes a friend of a friend was camping up in those woods and saw a walking skeleton grace laughed oh yeah the rag man story ive heard about a dozen versions of that one from my boys over the years and now my grandchildren scare each other in the playground with the same old thing ooh lets hear it not much to it really its just the name for our local boogieman the rag man a walking skeleton sometimes in a monks cowl sometimes in rags sometimes hes an escaped lunatic sometimes a drugcrazed serial killer some stories have him hacking up lonely teenage girl campers some stories have him wandering around in town stealing little girls grace shrugged kids round here regurgitate all sorts of rubbish from the crappy movies they watch and then replace freddy kruger with the rag man hmmm what about older ghost stories ones that arent hollywood inspired do you know of any grace looked up at the ceiling of the store trawling for some longforgotten fireside tales from her youth what about blue valley rose asked therell be some sort of local archives in the town right she shrugged i spose theres a onesheet free local newspaper that runs only during the holiday season you know the deal a few localissue stories some local flavour for the visitors and a bunch of adverts an old boy runs that pretty much on his own blue valley bugle its called rose sipped her coffee again do you know who yeah aaron pohenz he owns one of the motels in town valley lodge know it she nodded it was a little further down the street from hers looked a lot nicer too hes got a printing press in the basement does it all from there you could start with him im sure if he cant give you any more details least he can do is point you in the right direction rose made a note of the name and then finished up the treaclesweet brew in her mug thanks grace youve been a great help she said and turned to go hey rose rose turned back you told him yet told who what the old woman smiled knowingly how you feel rose felt her cheeks colour i youre talking about jules grace nodded you know its pretty obvious even to an old stick like me oh shit am i really that obvious tell him she said there was a man i once let go without sayin a thing long time ago hell he probably wouldve said no on the other hand she looked out of the store window at the wooded peaks might have said yes rose felt her cheeks flush oh youre mistaken grace theres nothing between me and jules were workmates is all seriously thats all hes not my type too old grace studied her and then shrugged oops im sorry i thought i detected a little chemistry there rose managed a smile nope no chemistry she bid farewell and closed the door behind her heading back across the deserted camp site towards the road leading back into town a fresh breeze played with her hair and sent a chill down her neck as she cast a glance around at the empty cabins and the sail dinghies lined up on trailers parked a few yards away from the lakes edge their nylon halyards clattered against the masts with a rhythmic tapping chapter october james lock lived for three days i was surprised he lasted that long the wounding to his head was so severe the bite crushed the righthand side of his face and skull destroying an eye in the process it would have been merciful for him and his family if the bear had bitten down that much harder and finished the poor man then and there preston however appears more promising there were a series of deep lacerations around his waist requiring that i sew them closed my fear is that fever will set in i cleansed the wounds as best i could with alcohol and checked that the claws had not proceeded any deeper than opening his skin and had not damaged his organs it does appear that he was lucky not to have suffered a greater injury nonetheless only time will tell whether the wounds were properly cleaned i have been tending to preston within their church it is perhaps a tribute to how much i am trusted or more likely how much they value him that im allowed in there these people of prestons seem completely lost without him unable to make the simplest decisions he seems to be their compass in many ways without him they are directionless and frightened each time i approach their temple there is always a gathering of people outside the entrance eagerly enquiring as to his condition despite my earlier reservations about the man i have to admit to admiring his strength and courage standing between his people and the bear armed with nothing more than a stick whilst i recall myself trembling with fear and rooted to the ground i envy a man who can stand firm in the face of terror and not yield sitting in their church i feel i have a clearer understanding about how the affairs of these people are run preston has a council a quorum of elders amongst whom decisions are made senior amongst them are two men eric vander and saul hearst it seems whilst preston remains incapacitated these two have assumed responsibility for running things on their side of the camp neither man however seems to command the same kind of respect and reverence that is freely given to preston ben leaned over and felt his forehead fever asked dorothy dreyton a slight one he replied prestons face felt hot and damp with sweat he was in a restless sleep stirring and murmuring will he live mr lambert hes strong ill say that for him a very strong and fit man but ben offered her a tired smile but there is infection in his wounds his body will fight it as best it can mrs dreytons face crumpled with poorly contained grief we would be lost without him i would be lost without him she stroked one of his hands affectionately hes our saviour in so many ways ben studied her genuine fondness for him absolute devotion he suspected she would happily surrender her life in a heartbeat if it would guarantee saving his and by the look of concern etched on the faces of those gathered outside in a night and day vigil so would any number of them how has he saved you she looked at him with an expression halfway between hostility and bemusement how from following the wrong path a path that would have led us to darkness and desolation like so many others of our church mormons she nodded we departed from that faith as we departed council bluffs the message from god was corrupted by greedy men who even now are fighting for control of the mormon faith she looked at preston lying still and breathing deeply william warned us that the faith was all wrong that it would eventually turn on itself god told him directly he looked at her oh yes william talks with god he does so through nephi nephi whos that dorothy closed her mouth but her eyes momentarily darted to a metal chest lying beyond prestons cot he talks with god directly she said again there are no other holy men who can honestly say that but doesnt every preacher say that only william does for real she replied with a whisper actually hears his voice i would surrender everything just to hear what he hears she stroked his face hes so special they sat in silence for a while listening to the mournful gusting wind play with the flap of material over the entrance why has preston led you out west she sighed we couldnt stay in council bluffs we had to leave everything behind a storm is coming a storm she looked at him and gently smiled perhaps being with us therell be mercy for you youll be safe ben shook his head im not sure i understand a judgement is coming a judgement on this wicked world william says it will soon be upon us and the earth will be swept clean so that god might start over god will destroy everything only the people his creatures need no cleansing everyone she nodded sadly i grieve for the many people with good hearts who will die but its necessary william was told this and that we must make ready for it there is work for him to do dorothy whispered glancing once more at the metal chest please mr lambert be sure to do all you can to help him he nodded of course i will she placed her hand on his and squeezed it affectionately we are so grateful to you youre a good man mr lambert maybe i am at fault for not seeing that sooner ben shrugged i have a doctors training itd be a waste for me not to use it preston stirred his deep commanding voice a pitiful whimper dorothy winced in sympathy hes in pain those wounds will be extremely painful as they heal ben opened his medicine bag and pulled out a bottle i have some laudanum for the pain he pulled out the stopper and poured a small cupful ill leave this with you to administer to him a couple of sips now to settle him mrs dreyton no more than that this is a strong medicine she nodded if later on tonight the pain stirs him again you may try another dose will you be sitting with him tonight yes mr hearst or mr vander may relieve me come midnight good then advise them about the medication it is not to be overdosed ill expect for some to be still in the cup when i return in the morning i understand he closed up his medicine bag i think hell be fine in due course mrs dreyton hes a fighter chapter october the campfire placed centrally amidst the small circle of shelters at the keats end of the clearing burned noisily crackling and hissing as it feasted eagerly on the needles and pines that had been tossed onto it never been so bleedin scared in all me life exclaimed mrs bowen such a big thing it looked like i could see it from all the way over ere ben nodded you should have seen it up close do you think itll be back again mr keats my little uns are terrified to sleep keats wrinkled his nose and snorted unlikely scared it off good an i reckon the wound will kill it eventually he spat into the fire weyland tossed a small branch on am i mistaken then in thinking that bears should be hibernating this time of year keats shrugged the snows come early maybe it caught the bear out maybe the bear aint fattened himself up enough to go sleep yet broken wing muttered something in his language and keats laughed what did your indian say asked bowen he said the woods sent the bear to frighten us whitefaces away the woods the shoshoni broken wings people believe the wood has a spirit like everythin else rivers mountains all got their own thats ridiculous said mrs mcintyre aint no more ridiculous than believin theres devils beneath the earth waitin to prod us with their little pitchforks mrs mcintyre shook her head sombrely god help us youll bring trouble on us all talking like that so you will keats smiled so your man mr keats believes the woods would like us to be gone said weyland broken wing spoke up thisss he gestured to the dark hem of trees beyond the pale moonlit snow on the ground beyond the warm glow of the fire not for whiteface thisss paiute shoshone land indians reckon we belong in our dirty cities livin on top of each other an turnin the sky grey with our smoke not out here in the wilderness broken wing cocked his head listening to keats then nodded a moment later yah hmm growled keats reckon the bear came down cause he could smell food cookin the group sat in silence for a while listening to the light wind teasing the trees all of keatss party were huddled around the fire bowen and his family mcintyre hussein and their families weyland and his negro girl keats broken wing and ben eighteen people hugging woollen blankets around themselves and gazing into the comforting flickering light of the fire hey benjamin muttered mcintyre nodding looks like your wayward friends have come to join us again ben turned round to see sam leading emily by the hand towards them they approached furtively sam looking back over his shoulder past the huddled oxen towards the distant campfire glow coming from the other end benjamin sam whispered hoarsely can we sit with your group awhile ben waved them over here squeeze in he smiled emily shuffled in close beside ben sam found some space on his other side they held their hands up to the warmth of the fire savouring it mommas sitting with preston said sam quietly yes i left her with him earlier oh ben reached round and pulled something out of his leather satchel here you are emily would you like to play with the doll her face lit up and she grasped it thank you benjamin she cast her eyes around the gathered group and spotting mcintyres daughter annemarie offered a shy wave to her across the fire keats tapped the bowl of his pipe onto the snow at his feet reckon we wanna keep a little more watchful at night people though it aint likely well see another bear any time soon better we be ready for it if we do night watch should always have least two guns good to shoot from now on that seems a sensible precaution added weyland and perhaps ladies and gentlemen we should consider doubling up on the watch a discussion stirred to life over the matter whether there were enough men to sustain that kind of rota indefinitely there were several varying opinions chorused at the same time ben settled back uninterested in the exchange you all right there sam the young lad nodded and smiled yes emily and i like coming over here emily likes those children sam replied nodding at mcintyres daughters what about the other children in your group he shook his head stolzs wont really play with anyone else the others dont really play at all poor em only has me im sorry not to have seen much of you these last few days momma says youve done a wonderful job caring for him ben hunched his shoulders i do what i can which im afraid isnt much im sorry there was nothing more i could do for mr lock sam nodded gazing at the crackling sparks from the fire lifting up into the inkblack sky i wish i were like you benjamin he said presently like me good grief why you got education you know things like medicine and science ben pulled a face i dont know enough if id stayed on a few more years i could have become a senior doctor but instead im just a travelling journeyman doctor hoping one day that ill do better as a writer ben tossed a loose cone into the fire i wish i was a little more like mr preston sam looked up at him sharply the goodnatured smile wiped from his face why it takes courage to do what he did he stood before that bear to save mr lock ben turned to sam and me well i was too damned frightened even to move sam shook his head it wasnt courage it was an incredibly brave thing to do sam didnt reply for a long while his gaze long and without focus im glad youre not like preston he said eventually or those others annemarie mcintyre came around the campfire and sat next to emily after a faltering selfconscious start both girls were soon chattering together and passing the doll between them ben sat back watching sam the boy seemed at ease content watching over his sister her eternal guardian he admired the young mans relentless devotion to her later on sam turned to him quietly and asked an awkward question when we leave these mountains would you take em and me with you what i couldnt do that sam im your mother would momma will never leave preston muttered sam not ever ben felt an overpowering sympathy for them both destined to be locked into the isolated small world that preston was promising his people in gods great wilderness as they patiently awaited an end that would never come sam i couldnt take emily from her mother you youre seventeen and a half then youre old enough to find your own way sam but emily is still just a small child your mothers child sam nodded sullenly i know ben placed a hand on his shoulder come the spring when the snow melts who knows how your mother will feel hmm perhaps shell see things differently ben sincerely doubted that but it was all he could think to say at that moment chapter monday blue valley california aaron pohenz looked at rose quizzically for a moment then smiled oh yes grace called and told me to expect a visit from you youre the english lady whos making a movie a documentary about local folklore thats right he waved his hand come on in she stepped inside the motel it smelled strongly of varnish and she wrinkled her nose whilst its quiet season and im closed up i thought id work on the wooden banister up to the rooms needed tidying up he offered by way of an explanation rose looked around the entrance hall it looked homey old sepia portraits hung on the wall alongside a few hunting trophies and a cheerful rug was spread across a wooden slat floor in the corner beside an open doorway that led into what looked like the kitchen was a rocking chair made from a rich dark wood its lovely she said he batted the compliment away with a hand its what the summer season guests expect a slice of traditional she nodded youve got that all right he gestured for her to follow and led her through the open door into the kitchen the slice of traditional motif had spread into there as well pine cupboards lined the edge of the square room and in the middle a large sturdy pockmarked and stained oak dining table surrounded by half a dozen breakfast stools beckoned them to sit down take a seat he said and then went over to the counter and poured a couple of cups of coffee from a cafetiere he sat down opposite her and slid a cup across the table thanks so he said im not real sure what it is youre after grace mentioned something about the old wives tales that get told round here she nodded yes thats what brought us here originally the number of spooky tales ufo sightings the bigfoot sightings that seem to be floating around the area she took a sip of the coffee it was black and strong as hell just how she liked it ill be honest theres a quirky internet site called darkeye that deals with all things strange and fortean they listed this region as one of the most sightingrich areas of america so she hunched her shoulders apologetically thats really what brought us here the old mans eyes narrowed suspiciously hmm see i trust grace shes a rock in this community not that she was born here mind but shes been living here long enough that we look at her as a valley girl if grace said youre all right i guess thats good with me too but he said raising a finger weve had a few news and tv people come here from time to time especially when someone starts up with a new ghost story they come up film a little interview one or two people and then go away when it comes on the tv they make us look like a bunch of simpleminded idiots rose shuffled awkwardly on the stool that was exactly the sort of crap she and julian had originally come here to make you get a lot of news people she asked no once every couple of years when one of em stories crops up is all aint all bad i suppose though brings us a little extra motel business she looked around the kitchen and noticed a corkboard with hooks in and about a dozen sets of keys dangling from them you run this motel by yourself no my sister comes up from fort casey during holiday season and helps out rest of the year when its closed its just me here rattling around like a pea in a tin can grace said you run a town newspaper of sorts as well he nodded thats right hardly a newspaper though sometimes just a page sometimes maybe i get five or six sides with some local stories a bit of history and a bunch of adverts for local businesses the papers free and the ads dont barely pay for the print its a labour of love then he smiled showing several gold teeth could say that used to be a bigger paper but then it used to be a bigger town i sort of inherited it the paper that is grace suggested you had some sort of archive and a lot of local historical knowledge aaron nodded dismissively i guess you could describe me as an amateur historian im after some details about a thing that might have happened back in i know thisll sound silly but grace mentioned blue valley has its very own boogieman she called him the rag man aaron smiled ah yes that ol chestnut yes just about all the local stories use him in some way or another could there be a grain of truth to the rag man i mean was he once based on a real person oh yes aaron said yes it was once upon a time a very real person he was a man that emerged from the mountains nothing more than skin and bones who was nursed back to health in blue valley he then took himself off never to be seen again rose smiled that sounds promising of course back then this town wasnt called blue valley it was referred to as pelorskys farm after jacob pelorsky who had built up a trade store here trading for beaver pelts with the trappers and the paiute and shoshone rose scribbled the settlement name down and then sipped her coffee theres a bit more to that particular tale really this man emerged from those woods on the point of death see somehow he managed to hang on and survive as they fed him and tended to him he recovered his strength but he didnt immediately take himself off he stayed on for about half a year a very troubled period of time that was too troubled aaron nodded swilling a mouthful of his rich aromatic coffee the man seemed to bring all sorts of bad karma with him he was very disturbed by something the family that took him in described him waking them all up repeatedly at night with his screaming anyway apart from being a very mentally disturbed individual there was a growing feeling amongst the small community around pelorsky farm that he was in some way cursed cursed i use the term cursed in preference to the term possessed i think thanks to that movie the term comes with a lot of unnecessary baggage which movie aaron shook his head im guessing looking at you youre probably way too young to remember it horrible movie horrible gave me nightmares she looked at him pen poised he sighed the exorcist rose knew of it shed seen the film once years ago and thought very little of it the flying goo and the spinning heads had amused her and her fellow room mates certainly not frightened them so they thought this man had some sort of devil possessing him well like i say id rather use the term cursed its less provocative he said sipping his drink before continuing so they thought this man was cursed in some way there were those who thought it was some kind of indian thing thinking the man had trespassed on burial grounds or something anyway the point is whilst he was with them bad things happened bad things bad things he echoed with no elaboration then it finally came to a head when a child went missing the next morning the man was gone never saw him again thats pretty creepy she whispered aaron nodded the man was evil well thats what they thought that he had evil in him and just maybe he picked it up in those mountains what do you think aaron finished his coffee with several quick gulps as he pondered an answer im not a churchgoer you understand nor am i some dumb sap wholl believe any old conspiracy or ghost story doing the rounds i think ouija boards are a load of crap i think mediums and spiritual healers and their type are a bunch of crooks okay im telling you this just sos we can be clear that im not some sort of whackedout smalltown hokey are we clear rose nodded but i think there is stuff out there that we dont have the tools to measure and explain and quantify he looked at her with grey keen and intelligent eyes and yes i think maybe theres something out there in those woods that can do something to a man change him somehow change him he shrugged turn a good man bad she finished her coffee tell me mr pohenz is there any record of this mans name because it started as a verbal tale no one really remembers if he did give a name the rag man is the only name people remember its kind of catchy he said with a smile and would you know roughly what year that happened he smiled i know exactly it was the spring of chapter october i heard it again said zimmerman he lowered the bundle of kindling in his arms to the ground and reached for the rifle slung across his broad shoulders the group stopped dead in their tracks keats swung his longbarrelled kentucky rifle down gently halfcocking the hammer and readying a percussion cap he turned to zimmerman same thing he muttered under his breath the man nodded whispering again im sure i heard whispering ahead of us keats looked to the others anyone else hear that this time bowen and the other mormon hearst shook their heads in silence im certain i heard someone whispering ahead said zimmerman again with a hushed voice theres definitely somebody here besides us they remained frozen listening to the subtle rustling of the snowcovered forest echoing from the far distance they could hear a metal cooking skillet being banged and the steady rap rap rap of someones axe on wood noises from their camp but no sounds from close by except for the rasping fluttering sound of their breathing i aint hearing nothing muttered keats uneasily i believe hes right said weyland nodding at zimmerman there is most definitely something or someone out there its been following us for a while ten minutes earlier weyland had set them on edge by claiming he thought hed seen a pair of eyes staring out at him from low down in the undergrowth now zimmerman you sure asked keats the man pointed to the trees ahead of them im sure i heard it come from over there quiet talking whispering keats swivelled his kentucky towards where the man was pointing squinting down the long barrel at the lowhanging snowcovered branches ahead the others fixed their attention on the same place he looked beneath the trees thick with ferns and bracken poking through the deep and lumpy carpet of snow his eyes picked out nothing untoward no movement at all and then he caught a flash of pale brown the colour of cowhide a colour out of place in this twinhued world of white snow and dark green pine needles he stared intently through the dark web of branches his keen sight picking out another incongruous detail a dark horizontal strip and two pale ovals within the ovals blinked eyes i see it now keats whispered over his shoulder to them nobody do nothin he hissed remain completely still he studied the eyes staring out at them perfectly motionless until they blinked again and then vanished he looked from side to side beneath the low branches trying to find them again and then spotted another pair of eyes and another and another others see em hissed keats quietly zimmerman nodded reckon i owe you a pology there zimmerman zimmerman swallowed nervously uhh dont worry the eyes glided smoothly behind the fir trees a dozen yards in front of them god preserve us muttered hearst his voice trembling what devils are these his hold on his rifle tightened were bein stalked keats said quietly theyre demons whispered hearst satan has tracked us down out here keatss eyes narrowed aint demons hearst its worse than that all of a sudden one of the lowhanging branches was yanked to one side dislodging a cascade of powder snow from the tree through the momentary blizzard something emerged crouching low coiled with enough energy to launch forward onto them at a moments notice a dark face painted still darker around wide unblinking eyes and grasping in one hand a tamahakan a warclub with a viciouslooking hooked blade in the other a short bow far worse keats muttered there was movement to the left and the others turned to see several more emerge from the trees and foliage and more to their right theyre paiute weyland leaned forward would they be the yeah the ones you dont want to run into keats replied evenly and quietly his eyes locked on them some of the paiute carried older flintlock muskets acquired handmedowns from another era others carried bows but all of them held in the other hand hunting knives or warclubs of one sort or another ready to be used with lethal efficiency at close quarters keats counted six of them six he could see that is even if the other men with him were all loaded ready to fire and managed each to bring down a target with their first and only shot he suspected thered be more who would be in amongst them within seconds wielding the serrated edges of their tamahakan to lethal effect it would be a bloody and brutal fight that keats suspected would be over even before their powder smoke cleared look at their skin muttered hearst scorched by god theyre demons shut up and be still keats hissed through clenched teeth dark skin keats had heard the mormons refer to that as the mark of evil he studied the paiute coiled and perfectly still the bone piercings and the shrivelled leathery tokens that dangled from their necks served to make them look more demonic the indian who had first emerged from the trees spoke the language was sharp and guttural but one keats recognised as the common tongue loosely shared by the paiute the shoshone the bannock he was speaking ute trapper you lead these whiteface here keats nodded i lead them through only the indian frowned and cocked his head curiously at keatss poor pronunciation whitefaces bring evil spirit with them into mountains must leave snow stops us they must leave snow stops us the indian studied them his eyes drifting from keats onto the others slowly scanning each of them in turn drinking in every small detail from head to foot the evil spirit will bring much bad before snow is gone and then barking a command to his men he turned round to step back through the undergrowth from which they had emerged the others followed backing up very slowly through the branches keeping their eyes on the whitefaces they were all young men very young and keen to prove their courage keats realised the encounter might not be over just yet what did he say asked bowen as he watched them warily withdraw through the thick veil of frosted foliage keats shook his head later listen he said quickly turning round to face the others put your guns down right now weyland shook his head incredulously are you mad keats placed his rifle gently on the snow do it before at that moment there was a shrill cry from ahead and one of the paiute charged out into the open with a ferocious speed and agility crossing the distance between them as a frightening blur of motion the indian singled out hearst his eyes locked resolutely on him as he snarled a vicious war cry the paiute scrambled across the deep snow his raised hand holding high his warclub hearst drop your gun the thickset mormon froze his face a static cast of panic the indian swooped down on him swinging the blade of his tamahakan missing hearst by no more than a foot and lightly almost tenderly tapping his shoulder with the handle of the club he whistled past hearst with a whooping cry of victory goal achieved and raced for the safety of the trees beyond hearst spun round and shakily levelled his gun at the retreating indian no dont shoot cried keats but his words were lost amidst the deafening report of the rifle in the silence they heard the crack of gunfire rattle around the forest and the startled flutter of feathered wings in the trees above them keats quickly scooped up his rifle again damn youve fuckin done it now he spat at the man dropping to one knee and shouldering his weapon ready to fire i told you to drop your gun he i thought he was countin coup you fool thats all keats looked around at them close up and ready your guns the others adopted keatss stance dropping to one knee and shouldering their rifles hearst was unready fumbling to pour a measure of powder into his gun with shaking hands then dropping his lead shot in the snow hurry hearst said keats hurry you fool the faint peel of gunfire was still echoing around the woods as the man finished ramming the shot home with a rod readied a percussion cap and shouldered his weapon then it was quiet the silence stretched out for half a minute all five of them waiting holding their breath trying to keep the long heavy barrels steady with hands that were trembling and arms that were tiring where are they weyland whispered there was no answer they were gone anyone see any of them muttered keats no check to the sides an behind said keats the bastards may try and surround us weyland obeyed the guide and turned to face towards their rear taking a few cautious steps back until he nudged up against one of the others keats what the hell are we supposed to do now he asked we sit tight an wait is what well do several minutes passed with all of them straining to detect the slightest rustle of movement amongst the trees keats glanced down to his left and saw the body of the indian lying on its side a single small hole was drilled into the back of the young mans head his face by contrast was spread out over the snow one of the young indians hands moved involuntarily slowly balling into a fist then opening then closing then opening again keats turned and hissed angrily at hearst thats why i told you to drop your fucking gun i thought his axe had struck me complained hearst i thought its done now the old guide shook his head some young men amongst them i knew one of em would try an count coup bowen looked up from the twitching hand count coup a test of manhood courage he touched him on the shoulder is all nothing more several tense minutes passed before weyland whispered mr keats what did the indian say to you you know before he turned to go keats shrugged hell if i know strangest goddamned version of ute i ever heard you must have an idea keats wondered how much to share with the others the paiute hadnt directly threatened them in fact his words had carried the cadence of a warning more than a threat although keats reflected that might change now that hearst had killed one of theirs we aint welcome here was the best i can make of it replied keats not exactly the truth but close enough chapter october prestons wounds seem to be healing well with only small indications of infection there is some inflammation around one of the wounds and a little weeping but one would have expected far worse from the unclean claws of a wild animal there are some signs of a mild fever the mans skin is hot to touch but his greatest discomfort seems to be pain from the wound inside which regarding the lacerations the bruising must be quite considerable i have given him more laudanum to which he responds well it is a potent solution which i prefer to prescribe sparingly too much can lead to a reliance upon it dorothy dreyton is with me now as a matter of fact she lies asleep on the floor her vigil is almost constant she must be at the point of exhaustion to allow herself the luxury of an hour or two to sleep i wonder if she has the slightest notion that her children have spent more time during the last few days at our end of the camp than they have in theirs preston stirred restlessly in his sleep and muttered his deep voice thick with cloying mucus ben guessed that the recently administered opiate was doing its work and had entirely banished the pain for now but it was also weaving a darker magic on an unconscious mind it conjured the most lurid nightmares he had seen firsthand the poor wretches that had found themselves admitted to banner house asylum by way of overusing laudanum and other such soothing tonics tormented by visions and delusions that hounded them in their sleeping and for the less fortunate waking hours ben leaned over and stroked his forehead feeling the warmth and dampness of his pale skin lying on a cot in this sorry condition there was still something very impressive about william preston ben decided he exuded an air of authority even as he slept a man like that in the right place with the right message could lead a people to do anything prestons murmuring continued beneath the thin parchment skin of his closed lids his eyes jerked from one side to the other rapidly then with a gasp they snapped open mr preston he licked his lips dryly thirsty ben put away his inkpot pen and journal and reached for a cup of water he placed a hand behind prestons head the mans long greyblond hair lank with sweat and lifted him to take a drink here some water he said quietly prestons glassy eyes focused away from the low canvas ceiling bulging with the weight of snow and onto bens face by the flickering light of the oil lamp it looked like the elders irises were fully dilated the laudanum mmy ggod they they they know gasped preston shhhh ben comforted him drink some water preston refused ththey know he rasped again grabbing bens hand tightly with one of his own squeezing desperately ben leaned down closer to him mr preston william its okay wwhat if they know they ssee they can see see what i am his voice was dry and soft a keening whisper that sounded like the wheezing rattle of an old man preston stared wildly at him intently but ben wondered what exactly his eyes were seeing whom he thought he was talking to i i hear nothing from it nnothing prestons head jerked round to look at the dark space behind his cot towards the metal chest nestling amongst sacks of oatmeal nothing he cried his voice cracked pitifully he turned back to face ben eric what if they know what if they know we took it that we stole it ben could have replied that he wasnt eric but he decided not to eric what if they know the angel shshuns me what whatll i do preston slumped back in the cot his head resting once more against the pillow just words he wheezed quietly his voice softening spent theyre just words just my words his eyes closed again my words he muttered slipping back into a restless and troubled sleep not gods ben sat and watched over him for a while fidgeting in his sleep several times murmuring but nothing ben could understand he knew the stronger tonics could do that take the small whispering voices at the back of a persons mind and turn them into a deafening scream he was wondering what was troubling preston in his sleep and had a mind that the answer might lie inside the metal chest just beyond him when he heard dorothy dreyton stirring on the floor and begin to rise did he wake you mrs dreyton she said nothing sitting up and staring wideeyed at preston there was something about her manner that troubled ben mrs dreyton her eyes were distant without a word she got to her feet and stooping low she pushed the flap aside letting in a gust of freezing wind that set the flame on the oil lamp dancing and stepped out into the cold day above the rumpling wind he thought he could hear distant raised voices a commotion from across the clearing and a ripple of disturbance and questioning from the mormons standing nearby something was going on ben stood up and stooped as he swept the flap aside squinting at the brilliant allwhite glare of the day what is it a man standing dutifully beside the entrance mr hollander with a dark beard almost down to his belt pointed across the clearing ben could see keats and several others moving quickly downslope and emerging from the tree line onto the open ground of the camp their guns unslung and held ready anxiously looking back over their shoulders thought i heard someone shout something about indians said mr hollander chapter monday central london julian found a number of books on the subject in the librarys index the librarian helped him locate them amongst some shelves towards the back he thanked the young man and sat down at a table to work his way through them he realised he knew absolutely nothing of the mormon church he hadnt even realised that they were otherwise referred to as the church of latter day saints it had quickly become evident to him that if he was going to be pitching this project to a commissioning editor or two it wasnt going to look good if he hadnt at least done some token research into the faith of preston and his followers at an instinctive level he wondered if there was another angle to this story an angle other than a simple survival story what if this was some kind of jonestown thing the idea was as intriguing as it was chilling that a community led by some charismatic religious nut had been steered into a remote wilderness by accident or design and there every last one of them was talked into taking their own life for some bizarre theistic rationale there were several books hed pulled up on amazon that looked interesting and he had quickly printed out the details of them before taking the district line tube into town here in the library they had copies of three out of the eight titles hed listed not bad considering how obscure some of them were to be fair it wasnt as though amazon was likely to have all of them in stock either he started by flicking through a recent edition of the book of mormon quickly becoming irritated with the confusing language and woolly meaningless terminology he moved swiftly on to the second book mormonism and departure from christian convention without drawing breath it jumped straight into a detailed theological discourse comparing the tenets of mormonism with those of conventional christianity he sighed and pushed it to one side the third book was called the first mormon by one jd pascal the opening prologue of the book dealt with the mormon churchs founder joseph smith and the story of how the book of mormon came to be written an atheist for pretty much most of his life julian had never had much time for what he considered the incomprehensible paradoxical rambling of most writing on religion a classic example of nonsensical theistic nitpicking being the eternal debate over the daily miracle that was said to occur with every communion the debate over when the bread actually became christs flesh whether it occurred in the priests hand or on the recipients tongue or in fact whether it was now meant to be considered merely a metaphor downgraded from being taken as a literal miracle because by todays standards it was too farfetched for julian the discussion at best was a waste of everyones time up there with how many angels can dance on the head of a pin however despite his irritation with that kind of nonsense he found this particular account of the birth of a brand new faith utterly fascinating joseph smiths was a tale of divine inspiration and profound discoveries in the wilderness of utah of religious relics and seer stones of ancient angels from bones and sacred golden scrolls delivered from god in a longlost language it was pure theatre my god this is priceless he muttered scribbling down notes in his jotter as he leafed through the prologue this stuff is fantastic he read on with a growing sense of astonishment at the tale affirmed regularly by the author as joseph smiths direct testimony and not enhanced or exaggerated in any way when he had finished he looked at his watch to find the afternoon had slipped away from him and that he had to make tracks to his meeting with sean he returned the books to the librarian to file away and stepped out onto basinghall street to be greeted by the jostling hubbub and rush of pedestrian traffic flowing like a human river towards mansion house tube station but his mind was on what hed just spent the last few hours reading and one circling thought kept bubbling up over and over making him shake his head with incredulity and this is the fastestgrowing faith in america chapter october the others i call them that instead of referring to them as mormons now sam has made it quite clear to me that they dont think of themselves as members of the church of latter day saints nor have they since they left iowa with preston they view themselves as quite apart from anyone else the others whilst preston is still convalescing have been prepared to take instruction from keats with regard to the setting up of night watches around the clearing there is a great concern throughout the camp that the paiute hunting party encountered three days ago might just return and seek revenge for the indian shot dead by mr hearst i suspect fear of those indians has driven them all some way towards accepting keatss way of doing things although mr vander and mr hearst being the two most senior members of the quorum prestons trusted lieutenants are nominally in charge neither carry the authority of preston and on this matter are more swayed by keatss greater experience preston continues to recover a surprisingly strong man for his middle years this morning he sat up in his cot and managed to eat a bowl of oat stew when mr vander relayed the news of this to the small gathering outside i heard a hearty cheer he complained however that the wounds were still extremely painful for him with every move i prescribed another modest dose for the pain but im reluctant for him to take too many more measures of the laudanum preston asked me why dorothy dreyton has not been to see him these last few days i had no answer ben looked up from his journal across the heat shimmer of the campfire this morning the skies were heavy and dark and promised a new inchesthick carpet of snow to rechristen the ground the women mrs bowen mrs hussein and mrs mcintyre were preparing a gruel of stewed oats flavoured with some strips of pemmican taking turns stirring the contents of a large steaming iron pot suspended over a bed of ashgrey logs by the pallid light of this morning the fire looked lifeless and spent the flames all but invisible the same fire at night though would look like a furnace casting a reassuring amber glow across their end of the clearing beyond the heat shimmer his eyes drifted onto the now utterly still mass of tan hides the last of the oxen froze last night that is it now theyre all dead which is a merciful relief for us as well as them the occasional pitiful bellowing in the freezing cold of night was an awful sound that i was struggling to ignore the oxen froze from the outside of the herd in one imagines if they were human or perhaps more intelligent they would have taken turns shuffling those on the edge to the middle to recover some warmth but they didnt the last one to freeze to death was at the very centre of their huddle no doubt hell also be the very last one we butcher to eat his eyes focused beyond the carcasses to the rounded snowcovered hump that was the dreytons shelter and he wondered what was wrong with dorothy sam and emily had spent some time around the campfire with ben last night sam had talked about his mother how worried he and emily were about her she had sunk into some kind of stupor of despair unwilling to step outside unwilling to talk unwilling to eat ben wondered if shed managed to hear prestons druginduced outburst he wondered if shed been troubled by what shed heard it was quite clear that for dorothy for many of these people devoted enough to leave everything risk everything to follow him out into the wilderness preston was the very centre of their universe to hear him talk like that what was it hed said theyre just my words not gods ben didnt believe for one moment that god came down every night to have a chat with preston he looked at the half a dozen men and women gathered outside the church shelter stamping their feet and rubbing their hands to stay warm but these people undoubtedly do believe that they believed in him completely that every stricture every instruction every word he had thus far penned in what sam had referred to as the book of new instruction were words directly from gods mouth what else had he said what if they know what if they find out what i am in the minds of these strictly faithful people ben knew there was a special place in hell for someone who might lead them astray for a false prophet and yet given what he knew of preston the genuine courage hed demonstrated the genuine compassion he had for people ben didnt believe for one moment that the mans motives were suspect that he was a charlatan those druginduced words were nothing more than a momentary crisis of faith a hallucination the babbling of a feverish man he wondered whether it might help if he were to pay mrs dreyton a visit to explain this to her that it was just the laudanum she had heard talking chapter october ben stared out into the moonlit darkness the snowy carpet on the ground and the pillows of snow on every laden branch seemed to glow phosphorescently by the quicksilver light he was relieved that his turn on watch was made easier by a clear sky and an almost full moon beside him the bowl of keatss pipe glowed as the old man pulled on it hmm the old mans voice quietly rumbled so whatll you do with all them words you been writin down ben shrugged id like to get them published back in england keats laughed quietly you mean like a proper book perhaps you specting to get rich with this book o yours oh probably not he replied with a faint smile it would just be nice to see my story printed perhaps even in a newspaper keats was quiet for a while ben watched the glow of his tobacco floating in the darkness bobbing gently you got the bear in yer book of course ben smiled keats laughed quietly bet you writ about yerself bringin it down like some big ol hero eh hardly i wrote about how terrified i was ben replied with shame in his voice i wrote about how all i could do was stand frozen to the spot like a fool you writ bout me shootin it in yer book yes you made me sound all brave an heroic ben nodded good i aint never been in a book before the ladiesll like that he snorted do you think its dead the bear keats grunted aint no bear worries me its em paiute out there you think theyre still out in those trees somewhere reckon so keats pulled on his pipe and the embers glowed and crackled gently one way or nother theyre certain were all going to die i reckon theyll be waitin on that sos they can come scavenge what they can find were you scared when you and the others ran into them scared keats considered the question for a moment well now my blood was up dont want to die just as much as you lambert the pipe glowed and ben caught the aroma of tobacco smoke wafting past him thing is he continued them paiute aint afraid to die hell they cant wait to die an join their ancestors in some milk an honey land it makes a man dangerous that whys that belief in a paradise after death the stronger your belief the more dangerous you are ben shrugged or at least thats what i think keats digested that for a moment i guess id have to agree with you on that son a man should value life enough that hes always afraid to die they listened in silence to the sounds of the woods the creak of laden branches and ancient swaying trunks the hiss of a gentle breeze through the tops of the trees that mean you dont believe in the almighty lambert ben often wondered if he did i dont know the more i learn of the mechanics of this world the less room i can see in it for something like the hand of god if you see what i mean not sure i do i have a book in my trunk a medical textbook i bought it in london before i set off you can see looking through it that we know how the body works now what each organ does for us but before we knew these things we believed our bodies were simply clay that god had breathed life into do you see it takes just a small amount of knowledge to undo so much of what weve been told to believe for centuries and centuries i dunno seen things in my time that no medicine book gonna explain of course not everything can be explained but it seems to me every week in the medical and scientific journals i used to subscribe to back in london there is more and more of gods mysterious work that we can unravel and discover the hidden cogs and gears within keats thought about that for a moment hmm mebbe so to answer your question though ben continued im not sure i do believe in a god not any more shit keats cackled then slapped him on the back you see that bear gain bet a nickel youll start praying eh i probably would he smelled another waft of tobacco smoke and then keats hawked up and spat guess i better go and check in on our other watchers keats grunted ill be back shortly and the glow of his pipe and the outline of his form disappeared into the darkness alone it was quiet save for the rustle of a fresh breeze through the trees and the hiss of shifting powder snow his eyes combed the tree line a dark wall of foliage just a dozen yards away drawn instantly to every little rustle of movement out there hurry back mr keats it was funny back home in west london in the fashionable and affluent area of holland park where his parents had purchased a considerably generous town house for him he would have turned his nose up in disgust at the sight of the grimy gaunt and bristly old man he would have considered him as something less than human part of the sea of urban misery that loitered suspiciously amongst the back streets and tradesmens entrances of soho covent garden and piccadilly square he had the same grimeencrusted and weathered face that filled the pungent main thoroughfares of the east end but right here in this clearing in the middle of this dark and forbidding mountain forest he trusted the man with his life ben heard the light crunch of snow underfoot coming from behind him he spun round to see a dark form standing a few feet away whos that he whispered the dark form took another step closer and then stopped then he heard the softest whisper its mrs dreyton my god whatre you doing out at this time mrs dreyton i i need to talk to someone she took a step closer to him by the wan light of the moon her face appeared almost as pale and luminescent as the snow her eyes dark pools of torment you were there you heard him preston she nodded i ive been to see him ben smiled thats good he was asking after you today i told him what i what i know now what her voice broke and she sobbed i gave him everything my life my love my body my children mrs dreyton i thought through him god was touching me touching emily and sam dorothy what you heard him say the other day was nothing more than the product of the medicine of a fever no she shook her head solemnly i see now his lies have led us to this place hes no prophet dorothys hands went to her face oh god forgive me for following him dorothy what did you say to him that i know he is a liar and a thief a thief she looked up at him what he has was not gifted to him it was taken he held out a hand to comfort her but she shied away what what is it he has mrs dreyton god will punish him for that she cried god will punish him and punish us all for following him what is it that he has she ignored him we have to leave here mr lambert we have to leave soon before its too late my children trust you i trust you will you help us what we cant leave here now well freeze or starve or gods vengeance will come down on us she reached out and grabbed his arm tightly he could feel the steel grip of her hand through three layers of clothing do you believe in eternal torment mr lambert what no no i cant say i because thats what awaits preston in the very depths of hell she looked back at the other camp or maybe itll come to us here in this forsaken place mrs dreyton youre not making much sense to me she shook her head maybe maybe if i tell the others warn the others she muttered turning away from ben ill be forgiven she stepped away from him crunching back across the snow mrs dreyton he called to her softly but she was gone had she really accused preston of being a liar and thief ben wondered for a moment how preston would react to his most devoted follower denouncing him as a false prophet and realised with a shiver of unease that it would lead nowhere good not for anyone chapter monday munston utah shepherd smiled at the people out in the basketball court waving to them as a rousing rendition of abide with me was being belted out by the munston homes choir for god stepping as one from side to side and clapping their hands to the infectious rhythm booking them had been a good idea his campaign coordinator duncan had said you cant beat a good ol baptist choir for feelgood factor he was right of course the rally had gone spectacularly well originally it had been booked into a local school but support was growing for the campaign so fast that duncans team had quickly needed to upgrade the venue to the sports hall of a nearby college shepherd noted with satisfaction a bank of cameras at the back not just local press photographers but some network camera crews too the town of munster home to one college a cereal processing and packing plant one shopping mall and at least seventy churches of different denominations was just the third stop in his tour of utah the state was easy territory everyone knew him now and it was obvious already that neither republicans nor democrats were going to get their foot in here his message was a fresh message that was coming right out of the blue and wasnt tainted with the titfortat baggage that the other two parties were burdened with his message didnt have the shrill sound of a party frantically hanging onto power nor the hectoring doubting thomas tone of a party impatient to get into power shepherd knew that he didnt sound like the other candidates and more and more polls were beginning to show that was going to be just about enough to cajole tentative support from the soft conservative centre shepherd bowed again to the ecstatic audiences delight and then strode defiantly off the podium flanked by a pair of security men from his ministry they walked him briskly through changing rooms that reeked of body odour and the sort of cheap aftershave that young men like to douse a little too liberally they led him out of a rear door to where a darkwindowed humvee waited patiently for him engine already idling the door was opened for him and shepherd slid inside one of his minders slipped into the front passenger seat the other climbed into the limousine waiting behind alone shepherd opened the laptop on the seat beside him and accessed his mail there it was a message he was expecting a noquestionsasked favour from a sympathetic face in the department of homeland security as requested the isp number was traced to an address in london england the address is lena garden road hammersmith london w the name against the isp number and the address is julian francis cooke cooke iswas a minor media personality presenting some current affairs programmes investigative programmes his media profile is lower than it used to be but he is still a recognisable name and face he runs a small production company called soup kitchen studios that makes lowcost documentaries recent programmes made by them include one on a radical islamic imam mohammad al bakti released from us custody a few years ago the association with this muslim cleric was for a period of two weeks for some reason this has escaped a homeland security flagging by the way i can have this guy cooke pulled in its something i can easily do for you if hes causing you any problems you might want to know fifteen days ago he passed through immigration at denver international the same day he connected on a flight to reno he then flew back from denver to london thirteen days later and is currently at his home address in london you should also know that he flew over here with an associate rosemary whitely who also flew on to reno with him and has not returned to the uk so shes still in the us as requested ive authorised a tap on cookes phone and an intercept on his internet connection not difficult justifying that because of his past association with al bakti and its relatively painless burying the paperwork since were only dealing with british intelligence and those guys will bend over backwards for us theyll ask but i dont need to give any reason all intercepted emails will be copied to your encrypted account all intercepted calls will be recorded and uploaded to the secured ftp site you listed hope this helps your friend in the big building shepherd looked out through the smoked glass of the window the town of munston little more than a highway flanked on either side by bigbox retailers fronted by acres of tarmac parking slipped past forgettably it was useful information useful to know exactly who was sniffing around perhaps he had nothing perhaps hed found something the thought triggered a tingle of excitement perhaps hes discovered them maybe there was some sort of mutual exchange he could do with this mr cooke information for information chapter october i have slept poorly worrying about sam and emilys mother i can understand for certain types of people their faith is everything hers has been shaken i have no idea what prestons story is whether he genuinely believes he is on a mission for god i suppose thats irrelevant what matters is what mrs dreyton believes or should i say believed past tense what worries me more is whether she will sow seeds of doubt amongst the others whilst i am no fan of peculiar and strict religious sects like prestons it is their faith in him that seems to hold them together and thus far i have myself found preston to be a rational and reasonable man i am troubled by this situation ben put down his pen and rubbed his hands vigorously together even with a woollen scarf wrapped tightly around his writing hand it was stiff with the cold the usually sullen grey sky was broken today allowing the heartening sight of scant patches of blue a dash of colour to their monochrome world that he much missed a weak ray of sunlight speared down from the scudding clouds dappling the clearing momentarily before racing away across the trees his gaze fell upon the pitiful sight of their dead oxen under keatss supervision the first few of the dead oxen had been towed a short distance away from the others and butchered for meat the welltrodden snow around their carvedup carcasses was pink and amongst the exposed ribcages a pile of inedible purple and grey organs was steadily growing ben wondered how long it would be before that offal was no longer considered inedible for the while food was not going to be a problem but the collective mouths of over a hundred and twenty people made short work of each carcass as it became available the mathematics of the situation was inescapably obvious to him already there werent enough oxen to keep them all going through the winter and into spring at some point they were going to have to find other food to subsist on to supplement the oxen or perhaps reduce their numbers it occurred to him that he might not be the only person already making that kind of calculation he blew on his hands cursing the aching stiffness of unrelenting cold around the campfire and tucked up in his shelter at night with the flap sealed tight and the shared body heat of keats and broken wing building up a fug of warmth inside it was tolerable but outside away from any cooking fire the bitter chill compounded by the occasional icy gust was a miserable experience ben vowed to travel to warmer climes come the spring and the end of this unfortunate ordeal and to never again stray from a temperate latitude he gazed at the small world of their clearing like an island amidst a dark forbidding ocean there were a few people stirring several meagre fires were heating water for a morning bowl of stewed oats most families still had barrels of cornmeal and oats previously used as packing insulation for fragile family possessions but now gratefully being consumed each day for breakfast giles weyland was offering to share with him a special treat this morning the last of his coffee beans there was enough he said for a canteen of it enough for him and ben and his girl they would savour it together then fill their tummies with stewed oats weyland had only himself and his negro girl to feed and had many boxes of fragile china stuffed with cornmeal packing to get through ben put away his writing things slipping them back inside his travel trunk in the shelter he wrapped his poncho around himself and squeezed out again into the scudding sunlight enjoying a fleeting moments warmth on his shoulders and back as a sunbeam raced over him then up through the trees towards the craggy peaks above them making his way towards weylands shelter he noticed that the negro girl was up already building their campfire whilst weyland was spreading out the last of his coffee beans to be roasted and cornmeal to be stewed the question had yet to be asked by anyone and ben was surprised that no one yet had the answer is this girl your property it was something ben felt he should have already asked on principle but had yet to find the right moment and the right way whilst he admired weylands southern charm and his unflappable manner ben doubted he could in all good conscience sit down and eat with a man who believed in the institution of slavery as he crossed the ground between shelters to join weyland for breakfast and was working out the wording for this delicate question he caught sight of emily and sam on the far side of the clearing both were being led by mrs dreyton up into the tree line by the look of the small canvas sack slung over sams shoulder they were off to gather firewood together but there was something about their manner that caught his eye it seemed to be a furtive departure mrs dreyton and sam looking back over their shoulders a terrible thought occurred to him theyre not leaving are they theyd die out there for certain he stopped in his tracks and half turned to race across the clearing to them to plead with mrs dreyton to stop this craziness when he realised neither she nor emily were carrying anything and sam had just the small sack and his gun slung over one shoulder mrs dreyton might have been quite mad enough to head out into the woods with nothing but the clothes on her body and the shawl around her head but sam was quite sensible at the very least sam would have called over to talk to ben first relax theyre after some firewood thats all he watched them as they climbed up the slope into the trees just before they were lost from sight behind the dense firs he saw sam look anxiously back towards the camp ben wondered what sam was glancing at when he noticed preston and vander standing side by side just outside their church silently watching the dreytons go it was an odd tableau that had ben puzzling over it as he arrived beside weyland squatting over a foillined wooden box in which nestled no more than a fistful of dark coffee beans the rich aroma of the box wafted across to him seductively and his mouth moistened in anticipation savouring it with a deep breath the odd scene was for the moment pushed far from his mind morning mr weyland ah mr lambert said weyland looking up a promise is a promise take a seat and i shall roast us these beans he turned to the negro girl violet bring me the skillet will you my dear violet was busy nursing the first flames of their cooking fire she shook her head giles get it yoself you lazy man caint you see i got my hans busy tendin to this giles turned to ben and shrugged with a worldweary flicker of his eyebrows pfft women eh ben smiled with relief glad that he could sit down and join them with a clear conscience violet was no slave that much was for sure chapter october the sun was on the way to its zenith shining through a gap in the grey sky when he heard the scream the young man was unsure of the noise at first unsure because it was not a sound he normally associated with these woods a womans cry or a childs cry in this place was as strange as a bears call out on the plains these wooded peaks were not a place for womenfolk nor children nor the old especially not in the dead of winter he heard it again this time he was certain it was a womans cry not a childs the first time had been a sharp shriek of surprise the second was protracted and drawn out and made the fine downy hair on his forearms rise the scream endured a terrible blend of pitiful agony and abject terror causing him to grimace and adrenaline to instantly flood his body entreating him to flee like a startled rabbit or stand firm a woman he heard a third scream higher pitched this time a child the young man knew the only women and children in these woods were the whitefaces the ones that had lost their way in the mountains black feather said their fate was sealed now none of them would last until the snows melted if cold and hunger didnt kill them all then the dark spirit they had brought into the woods with them would his first instinct was to drop the hare that he was gutting go find black feather and the others and tell them what hed heard but the second cry the childs cry alerted some deeper instinct in him he couldnt ignore the innocent cry of a child not even a whiteface child his thinking went no deeper than that he dropped the hare cleaned the blade of his knife with a wipe across his sleeve and strode swiftly in the direction from which the screams had come he moved with the athletic agility and speed of a young man whose feet knew the terrain well intuitively judging from the gentle undulations in the snow where lay the dips the bumps the twisted roots that could snap an ankle the womans scream came again from up ahead this time he knew from the abrupt and gargling way it came to an end that it would be the womans last scream he made an approximate best guess from which direction it had come making allowances for the acoustic tricks the forest could play he redoubled his pace his feet flicking lightly through the shallowest snow stonestepping across the mounds of firm ground from one boulder to another vaulting with graceful agility over the fallen limbs of longdead trees up ahead he glimpsed between trunks spears of weak sunlight lancing down into a small glade and he detected amidst this world of only two colours virgin white and deep wooded green an unmissable splash of bright crimson he slowed down the pace to ensure his arrival would be in complete silence darting forward another dozen yards and then abruptly settling to the ground beneath the boughs of a fir tree catching his breath in quiet controlled gasps he looked out through the needles at the clearing beyond trying to make sense of what he was seeing there was a lot of blood too much blood for whoever had lost it to live that was immediately obvious to him then he saw her stretched over a fallen trunk he could make out the body of a whiteface woman her dark clothes stained almost black with the blood spilling from her torso beside her curled up in the snow on the ground was a child a little girl hugging her knees and shuddering convulsive twitches that racked her body in ebbs and flows she was alive her eyes were wide but he could also see her mind was gone shock had rescued her sanity taken it someplace else he scanned the small clearing looking for a trace of the creature that had done this a bear it was possible although they slept through the winter black feather frequently cautioned that they could be very easily disturbed and enraged he noticed the smooth snow was trampled and flattened across the glade and stained dark with splatters and smears of blood three distinct foot profiles possibly four mingled across the glade a child a woman a male and perhaps another the story he tried reading in the snow was too complicated but it was clear that a body had been dragged from the clearing whilst bleeding leaving a trail that disappeared into the foliage on the far side an older mind would have advised caution at this point he should back away and leave this scene behind him this was the evil spirit black feather spoke of he could sense it smell it the whiteface evil only their evil could be so careless with its bloodletting so uncontrolled so savage but the young man was alone and too confident and curious to know better in any case he couldnt leave this child no older than his own sister to die in the same brutal way as her mother appeared to have done the long crooked blade of his hunting knife balanced ready for use in one hand his other hand easing out the finely crafted flintbladed tamahakan tucked into his belt he rose with one slow fluid movement and stepped out from beneath the tree into the clearing he listened carefully as he moved soundlessly in the distance echoing noisily through the forest activity coming from the whiteface camp could be heard the thakthakthak of wood being chopped a gentle breeze disturbed the snowladen pine branches overhanging the clearing and powder snow sifted lightly down with a gentle hiss from one bough to the next approaching the shuddering child and the body splayed across the log he could see more clearly how much damage had been wrought on the womans torso several deep gashes had opened her belly exposing ripped organs and tatters of those same organs were draped out across the bark of the tree trunk the gashes reminded him of the sort of wound a bear could make with one of its powerful front paws but looking at the spacing and the length and depth of these gashes it would have to have been a very large bear the girl was only a few feet away from him shuddering and rocking she didnt see him her eyes and her mind were far away he slowly reached one hand towards her not sure how she would react to his touch it was then that he heard it a deep rasping of breath coming from the edge of the clearing and circling around beyond sight in the silence of this soundinsulated glade it was deafening echoing from all sides a deep pulsing hoarse rattling like that of a male buffalo cornered and exhausted at the end of a hunt blowing foam out of each nostril he noticed a long gun on the ground beyond the girl he knew how these weapons were used but not how to feed one there had been no loud thunder before the screams and he realised the whiteface weapon would still be ready to use still deadly the third whiteface the one that had been dragged away must have dropped it which told him something useful about this creature it is a very fast creature the whiteface had no time to fire the breathing grew quiet now as if awaiting his next move daring him to reach out for the weapon and try using it chapter october ben heard a voice cry out in alarm then another there was a commotion going on outside broken wing glanced up at him what isss ben shrugged he leaned forward and poked his head out through the flap of their rabbitholelike shelter to see what was going on he saw mr bowens head poking out from the shelter next door and further away mr husseins like curious prairie dogs he heard another cry of alarm and the challenge of a couple of male voices the disturbance was coming from the far end of the camp broken wing kicked keats who was napping keatttt he shouted keats grunted unconsciously ben meanwhile reached for his medicine box pulled himself out through the flap and quickly stood up craning his neck to see what was going on he could make out a gathering group amongst the far shelters milling around something or someone ben automatically began to head towards them whats going on mr mcintyre shouted out through the flap of his familys shelter as ben strode past i dont know im just going to see weyland pulled up alongside him as they crunched across the compacted snow and waded through ankledeep drifts of fresh powder the virginians usual measured voice carried a tone of uncertainty as they approached the knot of people thought i heard one of them mormon gentlemen shout something about an indian they passed the oxen carcasses entering the mormons camp weaving their way through the snowedcovered humps of shelters and pushing their way forward through the crowd weyland made his way to the front and stopped dead good god he gasped ben followed his gaze the first thing his eyes registered was emily coated from head to foot in blood she was cradled in the arms of a young indian man ben presumed he was one of the paiute hunting party encountered a week ago he looked about the same age as sam seventeen or eighteen the indian was on his knees holding as tightly to emily it seemed as he was to life from a deep ragged gash that angled down from his left shoulder across his chest and stomach to his groin a tangled nest of his entrails had spilled onto emilys bloodsoaked lap he gasped short and shallow percussive breaths his eyes glazed mrs zimmerman knelt down in front of him and reached out for emily the young indian wideeyed and in shock looked uncertainly at her the woman offered a reassuring smile and nodded let me take her she said quietly the indian glanced down at emily before reluctantly releasing his tight hold of her mrs zimmerman scooped emily into her arms and stepped back thank you she uttered the indian swayed momentarily before collapsing onto the snow calling out something loudly to bens ears the words were unintelligible but he noticed they were the same over and over keats noisily pushed through the crowd barking at people to get out of his way the indians are still out there somebody in the crowd gasped the old guide emerged from the throng and knelt down beside the prone body of the young paiute ben stepped forward to join him crouching down quickly to examine the wound but knowing as he had with the zimmerman girl that there was too much damage to save the young man he looked at keats and shook his head the indian was still chanting something somebody in the crowd muttered those dark demonsve killed the dreytons and there was a ripple of reaction through the crowd followed by an outbreak of muttered whispered prayers amongst them whether they were praying for emily her family themselves or for the indian he couldnt tell keats grunted irritably at the growing cacophony of noise behind him the young paiute had stopped chanting and was now whispering keats crouched down close to the young man who looked now to be only a few moments away from death placing one gnarled cauliflower ear close to the indians lips ben noticed tiny flecks of dark blood dotting keatss cheek as the indian panted and desperately whispered something whats he saying ben asked quietly cant fuckin hear keats hissed he turned to face the crowd shut up he barked angrily at them the praying and hubbub of noise immediately settled down to a gentle rustle of breathing he dipped down again to listen to the dying indian the paiute seemed to rally enough strength for his tormented and distant eyes to focus for a moment on keats he grabbed the old mans arm and gasped something to him a quick rattle of ute that ben wasnt confident the old guide entirely understood then the young indians eyes rolled showing just the whites and a last fluttering breath came from his mouth flecking his lips with sprayed dots of blood they heard the distant caw of a murder of crows circling high above the trees some way into the forest and the sibilant whispering of someone still praying amidst the crowd ben reached out and closed the indians eyes even in death the look of them unsettled him he turned to keats so are you going to tell me what he was saying keats looked at him and shook his head confused didnt seem to make much sense chapter tuesday shepherds bush london so said sean holmwood tucking a fork into his pasta carbonara that sounds like an intriguing find julian returned a wry smile sean always calmly understated things that was probably what made him such a good commissioning editor he never gushed praise or approval instead he exuded it cautiously behind a poker face julian nodded its not just the story of a bunch of settlers caught out by a particularly bad winter either sean theres a lot more to this seans fork stopped midway from his plate oh julian leaned forward and lowered his voice the corner of the bistro in which they were sitting was far enough away from the other patrons that it was an unnecessary precaution but nonetheless he felt the need to keep it down this guy leading the larger of the two parties he said in a conspiratorial whisper preston hes like i dont know like some sort of a david koresh figure koresh koresh i know the name the waco siege sean rolled his eyes of course yes this guy preston he seemed to have a hold on these people a really unhealthy hold over them lambert the guy whose journal i have has written an incredibly detailed account of what happened up in those mountains and im telling you sean its really good stuff julian took a sip of wine sean nodded go on jules youve got me interested this preston bloke appears to have led his congregation into the wilds with the intention of setting up his own small community with their very own version of mormonism do you know much about the mormons the church of latter day saints sean sean frowned arent they like the amish or something wear funny hats and beards uhh no theyre not really anything like the amish maybe im thinking of quakers julian shook his head nope not even close sean shrugged well which christian sect are they then ill be honest with you sean im not even sure theyre christian sean looked confused not christian what the hell are they theyre one of a kind i suppose you could think of them as nineteenthcentury scientologists a cult julian nodded i dont know where you draw the line between a cult and a religion but yes i suppose back then it was more like a cult their religious texts are really quite incredible not the bible then julian laughed nothing like the bible hang on he said opening his satchel and pulling out a wad of foolscap covered with his handwritten notes let me read you a little on the founding of mormonism its great stuff he flicked through the pages ah here we are okay so yeah the whole thing was founded by a guy called joseph smith in the s he looked up at sean and grinned you simply couldnt make this stuff up this guy smith wasnt anyone special son of a local farming family with acres and acres of grazing land in some rural area just outside of new york anyway there was a craze going round at that time for treasure hunting apparently everyone suddenly suspected their smallholding might contain ancient native american treasure hordes well this joseph smith got bitten by the treasure bug and really got into it digging little holes all over his familys land then all of a sudden he announces the find of all finds julian paused teasing sean into splaying his hands impatiently and smith claimed he had found the word of god what do you mean word of god are we talking stone tablets no smith wanted to go one better than that not stone gold he claimed hed found the word of god on several golden scrolls just like that eh started digging and found these scrolls oh no it gets better he claimed it wasnt just blind luck he added to his story by claiming he was guided to a remote hillock on his familys farm by an angel that came to him at night and spoke inside his head giving him directions to this place ah yes the classic prophet story well yes it is arguably its no more credible or incredible than all the others but this one gets crazier and crazier smith claims he was guided to this remote place dug up an ancient stone box containing these golden scrolls the remains of the guiding angel and some things called seer stones from this point on the story reads a bit like david icke on a bad day go on at about this time like i say s early s another craze doing the rounds in england and america was a fascination with ancient egypt there were a lot of fanciful theories going around amongst hobbyist historians one for example being that the native americans were descendants of the pharaohs so guess what sean shrugged in response making his magical find sound even sexier he announced it was written in a holy language of the angels otherwise known as reformed egyptian reformed egyptian sounds vaguely legitimate though doesnt it it certainly helped to sex his story up back then smith claimed the angel was resurrected with an elaborate ritual and made flesh so that he could help him translate the scrolls and so the story goes night after night he spent time out on this hill alone with this angel translating the scrolls which were meant to be the actual spoken words of god the angel also told him the complete correct history of man from the egyptians onwards sean smiled wryly the correct history the angel told smith his name was nephi or moroni depending on varying early accounts by smith and his first followers he explained to smith that several ancient tribes sailed for the americas a couple of thousand years before christ came along back around the time of the tower of babel these people sailed for the americas settled there and built themselves a huge advanced civilisation which perhaps might be a nod to atlantis who knows anyway this civilisation did very well for itself for several hundred years until a war amongst them destroyed everything leaving absolutely no archaeological traces behind it julian smiled yup leaving no traces because according to nephi it was a ferocious war there were two groups nephites and lamanites only one of these people survived this war nephi this angel with gods help he transcribed the history of his people and the new commandments of god on these golden scrolls writing in his language this reformed egyptian and then buried these scrolls in a hill julian forked up a mouthful of his cooling dinner which many centuries later would end up being a hill in the middle of mr smiths farm wow and this history this story ive just told you is pretty much what the original book of mormon contains smith wrote it all down published it and began selling copies he revised the book over the ensuing years adding to it from further sections of the scrolls that he claimed hed yet to translate fully with this nephi guy no not after the initial translation the angel was never seen by anyone after his initial moonlit sessions on the hill smith claimed that he no longer required nephis assistance as the angel had taught him how to use the seer stones to translate the reformed egyptian so now he could do it all by himself the angel nephi presumably became dusty bones once again and vanished in a puff of makebelieve so did anyone ever see these scrolls there were written testimonies by his first followers that they had seen the scrolls firsthand albeit briefly but smith was always careful to guard them closely allowing his early followers to see them only for a moment and from afar so these scrolls where are they now no one knows smith claimed that when hed finished transcribing the symbols on them the angel returned and he handed them back and they and the angel all vanished convenient well there were rumours that he buried the scrolls back where he found them beneath a hill on his familys farm rumours that they and some of the other relics were stolen from him possibly by a follower or someone out to discredit him but they never did resurface so it makes sense that he just folded that into his story that the scrolls were returned to god the angel returned whence it came and voila we have the origins of the book of mormon julian sipped some of his wine well what do you think sean nodded its wacky and heres the thing sean theres thirteen million people in the states who are mormon who actually believe in this stuff as an article of faith so this preston bloke was a mormon then julian shook his head once perhaps the church went through a schism after joseph smith was killed something of a power struggle i suppose its not unlike the shiasunni split over who should rightfully succeed mohammed the latter day saints splintered into several groups with different ministers claiming authority brigham young was the name of the guy who wrested control of the mainstream mormon faith but amongst all this unrest and confusion preston emerged and won over a small flock of devout followers he must have had something a compelling manner a unique message enough that the mainstream mormons turned angrily on him and he and his congregation had to quickly leave iowa for the west thats how the poor buggers ended up in the sierra nevadas did any of these preston people survive well heres the thing theres no knowledge of it i mean literally nothing nada no one at the time noticed theyd vanished so i can only guess they all died up there because there were no newspaper articles no eyewitness accounts perhaps it wasnt newsworthy id imagine quite a few of those wagon trains came unstuck went missing somewhere across america not really i mean every group lost some people to sickness or malnutrition but the only other group that actually went missing was the donner party that event happened a few years earlier about a hundred miles further south of where we found prestons party but you see the donner party made news back then simply because there were a few survivors who could talk about it i mean it became a story written about in every paper of the time all over the states donner party ive heard of that there was cannibalism right julian nodded thats probably one of the main reasons it became such a huge story but it probably would never have been a story at all if thered been no one who survived now this preston party absolutely nothing not a single thing about it so thats what makes me think absolutely no one walked out except that one very odd web page julian reminded himself someone else knows about it sean nodded his pasta forgotten for now so any ideas how it all ended im working on it im still trying to make sense of this journal they may have just starved might have been attacked by indians i mean theres a mention of an encounter with indians called paiute or who knows it might have ended up as some bizarre cult suicide thing you know another jonestown seans eyes widened that would be quite a horrendous tale julian nodded im heading back out there at the end of the week we have a small window of time to scoop what we can then this site has to be called in at which point id imagine various american heritage agencies will boot us off sean smiled cautiously chewing on his food in thought julian reached for his wine and sipped what we have here is an interesting relationship between a charismatic cult leader and his ultimately doomed followers its a strong angle to play on the danger a religion can pose when its twisted radicalised thats a very relevant theme to discuss these days isnt it sean hummed in agreement he pulled out a pad and began scribbling some thoughts whilst julian finished his dinner in silence and youve read through all of this journal its quite a thing to translate why is it written in code or something no just a combination of things the handwritings hard work and gets a little more wobbly on each successive page the ink fades towards the end which makes me think the author was watering it down to make it last it gets almost illegible in places was the author do you think this lambert started losing it julian looked out of the window at the bustling foot traffic passing the bistros fogged window no i dont think so sean no i dont think hes losing it well then let me ask you this do you think the author is reliable julian had considered that possibility you can never know for sure but ill say this he comes across as very levelheaded i know it sounds like an odd thing for a researcher to say but i think i trust him sean picked up his fork and started tucking into his pasta once more julian watched him in silence anyway have i snagged your interest sean placed his fork down and clasped his hands thoughtfully yes i think i might be interested he replied softly it might be an idea to keep it to yourself for now though ill consider putting this on a fasttrack footing within our editorial group assuming of course its us you want to deal with well rose and i want to deal with you sean we worked well together on uncommon people theres no reason to think we wouldnt work well together again sean looked up and smiled yes we did didnt we it was fun he gazed out of the window at a passing bus look ill make some discreet calls tomorrow and maybe well meet again later in the week sounds good to me im flying back at the weekend so if you want to meet again before i go well youve got three more days chapter october are you certain that is what the indian said preston asked again quietly light from the oil lamp suspended from the crossbeam making his gaunt face look like a skull draped with fine silk keats shook his head nope but its the best i could make out midday was gone and the low sleepy sun already yearning again for the horizon by the time a meeting of the quorum was convened in the church ben was surprised to find himself and keats asked to attend although not surprised that broken wing whom keats insisted come along too was stopped at the entrance and sent away dark skins a mark of evil mr hollander had grunted standing like a sentry beside the flap the evil spirit took them thats what the indian said keats shrugged hell he could have said that other hand maybe the words couldve meant somethin else the indian was speakin all kinds of crazy what other things did he say mr keats the minister pressed him keats shook his head said somethin about an evil spirit reaching out from the trees wasnt makin any goddamn sense to me the indian was in a state of shock said ben his mind and his eyes were playing tricks on him the wounds across his front could have been from some wild animal ragged cuts like like a claw not clean like a blade perhaps the bear keats shook his head aint no bear they sat in silence for a few moments outside the temple they could hear the muted sound of wood being chopped and cooking fires being prepared the routine of survival went on despite the traumatic event earlier in the day preston winced painfully as he shifted his position holding a protective hand over the linen binding around his torso and where is mr hearst asked jed stolheim running a tired hand through his thinning auburn hair hes not been seen since this morning i dont know jed replied preston its been long enough that im fearful for saul its them indians out there did it someone muttered from the back im not even sure they are indians replied vander me and mr zimmerman saw em up close in the woods dark as the devil himself they were keats snorted if they aint indians what the hell are they demons keats satans imps sent to torment us there was a sharp intake of breath amongst the quorum thats enough eric snapped preston we have god on our side so we have nothing to be afraid of ben heard a tremulous note of uncertainty in the elders voice or perhaps it was his weakness or the pain that robbed his voice of authority preston turned to ben how is emily dreyton shes in deep shock her mind has gone for now has she spoken of what she saw asked vander she has said nothing nor do i imagine she will for some time replied ben so terrified was she at what she saw her mind is gone and it may never return poor girl muttered preston poor dorothy poor samuel he added with genuine remorse etched across his face whos with her now asked vander mrs zimmerman there was a murmur of approval amongst them the woman had lost a daughter emily had lost her mother mrs zimmerman was the best person to sit with her they may still be alive said ben all we have is emily and some blood most of it ill wager came from the indian boy they could still be out there preston nodded thoughtfully yes youre right lambert we should send out a search party to we aint headin out tonight lambert keats cut in and thats final i aint riskin the lives of anyone else lookin for dead people first light tomorrow we will look ben turned round to him swiftly what we cant leave them out there overnight i aint leadin out a party in the dark theyll die of the cold reckon them to be dead anyways muttered keats we go at night well miss the tracks and well not find them he looked around at the others skys clear tonight dont expect no snow so we go at first light that way we can follow the blood up to where whatever happened happened preston nodded that seems sensible mr keats ben shook his head knowing the guide was probably right that poor sam and his mother were gone and there was nothing they could do about it but try and find their bodies the small unlikely hope that sam might be lying somewhere wounded and pleading for help was nothing more than a wish that he knew was going to torment him through the night and i shall come with you mr keats vander turned to him are you well enough william ill be fine eric preston offered ben a courteous nod mr lambert has strapped me up well first light then said keats reckon we want to have at least two dozen men with guns readied to fire might want to be ready if we bump into em paiute theyre out there nearby for sure there were murmurs of agreement amongst the gathered men what are we going to tell the others asked mr larkin about what did this to the dreytons reckon well tell em its a bear for now growled keats till we know better preston cocked his head you may tell your party what you wish so whatre you goin to tell yours it was the work of those demons out there snapped vander you forget replied ben quietly that one of those demons died bringing emily back to us the devil likes to play games with the innocent mr lambert preston spoke softly theres sport in that for him for now until we know a little more we shall tell our people to pray for dorothy and samuel we shall assemble a party in the morning preston stood up his head dipped beneath the low ceiling this meeting is done now he uttered a short prayer then dismissed them the men filed out into the weakening sunlight vanilla rays lanced through the tree tops bathing their small world in cream where they landed and leaving violet shadows where they didnt preston touched ben lightly on the arm as he followed in keatss wake mr lambert yes might i have another dose of your medicine tonight for the pain ben studied his pale features is it that bad preston nodded it gives me a merciful release from it he thought about it for a moment a small dose then whatever you think is correct preston smiled ill return with the bottle after i have checked in on emily he said and then turned to catch up with keats preston watched them go then stepped back inside the church shuddering at the transition from bitter cold to the pleasant warmth left behind by the accumulated bodies im worried about saul said vander from the gloom inside prestons eyes slowly adjusted and found him sitting on the cot he sighed sadly william you know it was necessary she would have spread doubt amongst the others about you preston slumped down wearily beside vander i know they need me now more than ever but i wish in my heart it had been anyone other than dorothy who was troubled with doubt she was so devoted vander nodded and now we have to wonder what has happened to saul said preston perhaps it might have been the bear perhaps the indians and emily what did she see preston nodded regretfully what might she say he turned to vander i love her too like all my children god needs you strong william i know ben ducked down and entered the shelter its frame was sturdier than the one he shared with keats and broken wing the mormon men had constructed for dorothy and her children a firm lumber frame from their wagon large enough for three or four people to sit together in but only tall enough to kneel in by the light of a single candle he could see emily huddled away from the entrance wrapped in several blankets her knees pulled up to her chest and staring blankly into space lying beside her was mrs zimmerman sadly stroking the girls forehead and singing a lullaby she stopped to look up at him mrs zimmerman ben said politely nodding how is she shes gone far away from here he knelt down next to the girl god only knows what she witnessed ben looked closely at her face moving his hand to and fro in front of her dilated pupils with no reaction shes not spoken not a word not a single word she replied studying emilys pale face truth be mr lambert i have never seen fear so bad as that in my life he shuffled closer to her unwinding his poncho and draping it over emilys blanketcovered body ive seen shock like this before industrial accidents brought into the london hospital where i was studying shock the mind closes down to shut out the pain and yet can still function amazingly well i once witnessed a man walking in carrying his own arm under the other machinery had wrenched it out at the shoulder mrs zimmerman made a face the point is the mind is very resilient emilys has shut down for now from what shes witnessed i can only presume it was something quite horrific and now her mind is in a dormant state hiding hibernating somewhere safe but shell come back to us eventually wont she ben nodded eventually what happened mr lambert do you know eric vander thinks it was the indians did this keats says it might have been a bear mrs zimmerman nodded tiredly tomorrow morning therell be a search party and well find out all that we need to know he said ben knew it would be a hard find chancing across their bodies hard in as much as he would see sam in a horrible way if it had been a bear their bodies would be horrendously disfigured it was not a final image he wanted to have in his mind of the lad im so sorry emily so sorry he stroked her pale cheeks remembering a cheerful face around the campfire delighted with the loan of a doll ill look in on her again soon ben said to mrs zimmerman will you be with her tonight mrs zimmerman nodded all night ben smiled good chapter tuesday fulham london the phone rang only a couple of times before a deep voice answered it dr thomas griffith tom its julian cooke a moments hesitation passed julian then julian how the hell are you im well tom very well julian had worked with him a few years ago on their series uncommon people dr griffith was a forensic psychologist who freelanced for the met on occasion for the crown prosecution service and more often these days he also found himself contributing the foreword to books on hardcase east end gangsters and the criminally insane his last collaboration had been with a crime novelist cowriting a book on harold shipman the book was doing very well julian had noticed it piled high on the centre tables of waterstones and borders and spotted thomas on daytime tv shamelessly plugging it thomas was made for tv a gregarious character a large and generously covered frame and an enormously deep voice finely tuned to deliver a welsh accent it was all going very well for thomas right now what are you up to these days julian his baritone voice boomed down the line julian sucked on his teeth he knew the call was going to involve eating a small helping of humble pie not as much as id like business is still coming in but you know what its like a lot less money sloshing around the tv business these days indeed i saw your book doing very well i see yes isnt it im quite taken aback therell be more i hope julian smiled oh im sure there will be publishers love to keep backing a winner actually he was pleased for the lucky bastard good fortune couldnt have fallen into the lap of a nicer bloke tom look apart from wanting to hear the meltedchocolate tones of your voice again theres another reason i rang griffith chuckled go on its something i sort of stumbled upon by accident over in america before i go into too much detail this is between us and no one else do you understand of course im not going to need to send you a confidentiality agreement am i julian asked cautiously he trusted the man more than most thomass word had been good in the past when theyd worked together but it would be reassuring to hear him make a verbal promise on my mothers grave julian okay julian explained what he and rose had found careful not to tell him exactly where it was only grace knew the precise location and for now he wanted to keep it that way he described the lambert journal and summarised the tale he had transcribed thus far dr griffith patiently listened in silence as julian talked through it for nearly threequarters of an hour well now julian whatre you asking for a diagnosis over the phone yes but id like to back it up with a meeting perhaps if youre interested involve you in the documentary somehow well im im sorry tom i didnt mean to put you on the spot like that i know youre busy right now promoting the book no he cut in no im interested julian im fascinated id very much like to be a part of this i mean to all intents and purposes if were ruling out indian wood spirits and giant grizzly bears it sounds very much like you have a reliable account of an interesting mystery yes thats what i thought and this journal sounds like wonderfully detailed material to work from it is very detailed i mean the author obviously had a lot of time to fill waiting to die up in those mountains so look i presume were both thinking its the same person the religious leader chappie uhhuh preston he heard griffith shuffling position the sloshing of water in the background and remembered the large welshman kept his phone by his side even in the bath a fascinating character by the sound of him a classic cult patriarch isnt he yeah look tom i can email you what ive transcribed already of the journal and attach a load of jpeg images of the other pages ive yet to work through if youre interested in taking this further yes please do and then when youve had a chance to look through perhaps we can arrange to get together for lunch and talk about it that would be marvellous griffith boomed back great your email address still the same as always ill put preston as the subject heading so you dont miss it amidst all the spam very good how long do you want to have with the material thing is im here in the uk for another three days then im heading back out to the states to rejoin rose weve got to move quite quickly whys that its sat around a century and a half already weve got a grace period of a couple of weeks courtesy of a kind old park ranger whos sitting on it before she calls whatever us heritage department covers this kind of find so were scrambling around to get as much virgin footage of the site as we can i see well hmm youve caught me at a good time i could do with a break from the current routine give me a day with the notes and then well talk thanks oh and julian yup do you know how it ends what do you know of what happened as far as we can surmise no one survived theres no record of it anywhere oh thats good somewhat chilling he said the water sloshing again i like that julian smiled i thought you would well send me what you have and then well do lunch later on this week ill make sure my publicist keeps thursday and friday lunchtimes free i will its been good to speak to you again tom been a while and you dr griffith hung up abruptly and the line purred julian was about to set his phone down when he heard the faintest click over the earpiece the purring sound cut out momentarily and he thought he could detect if only for a second or two the rustling sound of movement picked up by an open microphone then another click and the purr resumed he put the phone down still looking at it thats that was odd he muttered and not the first odd thing either is it returning from a visit to the soup kitchen office earlier today he had an inexplicable feeling that his flat had been entered not quite able to put his finger on the tiny intangible details that made him think that a book out of place the mouse cable coiled differently around the back of the keyboard he hadnt been certain enough not to dismiss it as some sort of creeping paranoia but now this he looked again at the phone long enough to convince himself that all hed really heard was a digital gremlin on the network or quite possibly his line crossed with another for a fleeting moment he shook his head reproachfully come on julian get a grip chapter october a light downfall of snow during the night had not managed to fully conceal the trail left by the indian there were enough dark patches of almost black blood that had soaked into the snow and were now a frozen part of it keats led the way up through the trees his keen eyes squinting and watering from the dazzling upward reflection of sunlight off the snow the sky was a clear blue combed with one or two unthreatening clouds and the sun beat down a welcome warmth on their backs and shoulders as they went uphill moving between the trees from one splatter of frozen blood to the next a search party had not been painstakingly chosen the old guide had simply emerged from his leanto as soon as the sun had breached the tree line and bellowed out with his foghorn voice that he was ready to go and wanted some volunteers within a few minutes every single man and boy old enough to carry a gun had mustered in the centre of the camp around keats and broken wing preston joined him promptly and then they dismissed roughly half the men to stay behind and guard the camp the other half eighteen men including the two trail captains set off swiftly from the clearing and up the shallow bank of the forest floor through saplings stripped bare for kindling and into the deep foliage of older trees they followed the trail for only about ten minutes just long enough to lose sight of the camp below climb a small spur and descend the other side towards a small glade beyond when broken wing suddenly raised a hand and shouted out something in ute keats pulled his pipe out of his mouth and muttered this is where it happened all right jus up ahead they emerged from the trees even dusted with snow and no bodies to be seen it was clear a butchers blade had been hard at work here a log lying across the clearing was slick with glassy frozen blood and beside it on the ground was what looked like a small heap of offal ben took a few tentative steps towards it knelt down and inspected it more closely it reminded him fleetingly of the regular invitationonly demonstrations carried out sectio cadaveris in the lecture theatre off threadneedle street on the illegally obtained cadavers of the hanged the organs removed one by one discussed then discarded upon a growing grey and glistening pile im afraid these are human said ben im certain of that he looked at the guide so we know that at the very least one of them is dead he added sombrely feeling his voice thicken with emotion he swallowed and steadied himself i can grieve for sam later but not now keats hunkered down beside him and prodded the pile with a stick it was frozen solid guess this little guttin job mustve been done yesterday he said quietly ben nodded bear dont gut his food before eatin it not that i know of anyhow broken wing squatting on his haunches nearby perfectly still was reading the ground his eyes traced a narrative out of the disturbed snow his lips moving silently telling him the tale all of a sudden he stood up and strode across the glade past preston and the other men what is it the minister asked in the middle of the glade the snow had been trampled and disturbed more noticeably and a curved arc of spattered blood was inscribed brightly across it issss fighting here he said pointing to the blood cut bad keats joined him someone got cut bad all right he said the splatter arc was a grisly curl of dark crimson fatal bad i reckon he looked around i guess it was that paiute boy he nodded in the direction they had come its his blood we been following up here broken wing walked towards the bloodied log stooped down and studied the ground he spoke in ute to keats he says the paiute boy picked your girl up over there beside the log an ran into the woods with her in his arms keats turned to preston brave young lad he offered no response his eyes locked on the confusing tapestry of blood and suggested movements written in the hard snow the guide squatted down and studied the ground near the log for a moment his teeth clamping noisily on the stem of his pipe as he sucked a meagre mouthful of smoke from fading embers in the bowl something caught broken wings eye and he brushed aside this mornings light dusting to reveal twin grooves of compacted snow stained dark and now as solid as ice he nudged keats and pointed keats brushed more of the snow away hey lambert look at this he said ben took a couple of steps over stepping past the men who had gathered closer to see what keats was so interested in he knelt down beside him and looked at the grooves what is that keats pointed with the long stem of his pipe heel marks reckon a body was dragged away he pointed to dark stains smeared along the icehard grooves still bleedin like a stuck pig whilst it was dragged i guess ben inwardly winced at the thoughtless choice of words broken wing brushed aside more of this mornings light powder standing up and following the parallel grooves across the clearing towards the edge of the glade ben followed him and joined him there looking through the foliage in front of him he could discern a clear path of dislodged snow the crushed stems of brambles and briar flattened fern leaves and broken twigs spotted here and there with dots and splatters of blood the others joined them and stared intently at the unmistakable trail left behind whoever it was left tracks a blind man could follow said ben preston stroked his bearded chin whoever reckon were past lookin for a bear now keats nodded that leaves us indians or demons whichever you prefer aint made no effort to hide their trail neither broken wing pointed to another pair of faint parallel grooves and spoke in his tongue second trail there said keats ben could see it a second path through the undergrowth out of the clearing but along this one there were no evident spots of blood came back a while later an dragged another body away only i reckon this one was frozen up by then ben nodded and his heart sank when he realised what it meant they both died here then he uttered keats offered him a rare gesture placing a hand on his arm maybe not theres the other fella still missing seems like we only got two bodies so far he knelt down and studied the flattened path through the foliage maybe some hours passed tween taking the first body and comin for the second bowen stepped forward are you sure this is no bear keats keats shrugged carryin food away like this is jus what a bear does they do that store their food pack it in a nook somewhere like a goddamn pantry but he turned to look up at him they sure as hell dont gut an clean their kills them organs back there is just as good for a bear as the rest we should press on said ben quietly yeah keats turned round and barked over his shoulder well follow this trail gentlemen called out weyland from the back what if there is a bear up ahead keats shook his head looked at ben exasperated reckon tween our eighteen guns we might jus bring it down he shouted in response what if its them indians asked someone else then reckon we got us a fight on our hands and what if they are demons sent by satan asked levi taylor one of the younger fathers amongst prestons church what if theyre here to get us there was a murmur of assent amongst the mormon men preston quietened them down with a wave of his hand we should proceed and have no fear of the devils impish tricks trust me were on gods mission he turned to ben and keats and it is right that dorothy and sam have a proper burial when we find them i agree zimmerman piped up from the back theres no way we should leave them out for the forest animals to pick at keats stood up well we gonna sit around like a bunch of lady folk he grunted or we gonna go find em preston nodded firmly lead the way if you will mr keats keats glanced round at the group of anxious men just remember folks we got them goddamned indians out here in these woods still ben looked at the snowfrosted tangle of branches ferns and longfallen trees ahead of them and wondered whether he would shame himself if they happened across these paiute keep your guns nice an handy keats grunted loudly and dont be bunchin up right behind me neither if i need to turn an run dont want to be runnin smack into one of you fools there was a ripple of hesitant nervous mirth from one or two of the party as the old man nodded to broken wing to lead the way stepping out of the glade and pushing his way into the foliage his beady eyes locked onto the frozen dabs of blood that marked the way ahead ben followed him a few yards behind chapter october as they made their way down a shallow incline keats ten yards ahead of them broken wing ten yards further the shoshone suddenly dropped down onto one knee and waved for everyone behind to do likewise the men did so obediently broken wing studied the scene intently for a couple of minutes before silently shuffling back to keats and relaying what hed seen ben suddenly got his bearings and recognised the lay of the land the dimple in the hillside the trappers shelter around them the forest was utterly still and completely silent save for the distant and knowing cry from a cowbird he could see through the winterstripped branches of a spruce flying impatient circles high above the trees huddled low amongst frozen ferns and twisted thorny briars bens breath hung before him anxious clouds of steam that floated lazily up like smoke from the muzzle of a musket he shivered in the kneedeep snow partly from the seeping cold partly from the anticipation whatever had done for sam and his mother had dragged their bodies up here to this forlorn place he dreaded what he knew they were going to find keats finally waved an arm for the men to make their way forward and join him ben shuffled forward with the others and presently they knelt beside him looking out past shoulderhigh undergrowth down a shallow slope at the crudely constructed shack more of it concealed by drifts of recent snow than the last time hed seen it trappers place by the looks of it whispered keats no sign anybody been using it recently though its abandoned said preston keats turned to him what we came across it some days ago its not been used in years you didnt think to goddamn well mention it to me preston frowned indignantly its a mans grave why the hell aint you told me bout it id rather people didnt come up here and strip it for firewood the dead man inside deserves at least that keats shook his head hawked and spat didnt occur to you that them paiute might be camping in it now ben expected preston to thunder an angry response to save face in front of his men but instead he was impressed to see the minister nod humbly youre right keats i should have mentioned it keats scowled at him yeah perhaps you shouldve he turned to look back at the shelter preston have your men spread out and along this ridge and ready their guns we got a good field of fire on em if theyre inside preston nodded and issued the word quietly to his people keats stood up and handed his rifle to ben whatre you doing if them paiute are inside gonna go talk to em first keats strode down the incline casually broken wing beside him and called out in ute making enough noise to ensure his approach would be clearly heard by anyone inside at the bottom of the incline he walked across the clearing between the old wooden hanging frames a few yards away from the small entrance and called out again loudly from inside the shelter came a sound of startled movement ben instinctively flexed his finger on the trigger and lined his sight on the small rounded entrance at the front a moment later the dangling tatters of canvas that hung down from the doorframe fluttered to one side as several crows emerged their wings a frantic confusion of dislodged feathers and panic he watched them flap noisily away strings of crimson dangling from their beaks battlefield scavengers that was how his father used to refer to these birds as a much younger man a junior officer in the british army he had witnessed the morningafter carpet of battle he had described to ben seeing the ground undulate with the shimmering beetleblue of crows feathers as they worked on the bloated bodies and the sky darken with their startled wings swarming like flies at the sound of a discharged gun only to return moments later with a renewed vigour to feast on the soft faces of the dead ben waited anxiously along with the others his rifle braced against his shoulder and aimed at the entrance if there are indians in there they must sleep like the dead muttered weyland one eye squinting down the barrel of his gun maybe indian dead too whispered hussein in reply weyland took a deep breath and let it out in a cloud im not sure id find that entirely reassuring mr hussein broken wing called out his sharp voice cracking with the effort it was the first time ben had heard the indian speak in anything other than a soft murmur there was no further sign or sound of movement from inside with a casual hand gesture to broken wing keats stepped forward one hand resting on the hilt of his hunting knife he pushed the tattered canvas flap aside and then cautiously stepped inside and out of sight the old boys got balls of iron whispered mcintyre beside him walking in like that hussein nodded he has much kuh cour courage offered weyland yes is much courage inside him much thats for sure mcintyre whispered a full minute passed in silence before the flap finally jerked aside and keats emerged stooping low through the entrance and then standing erect ben watched him breathing deeply for a moment hands on hips like someone mustering something from inside he leaned over and spat or maybe he was heaving it was hard to tell whats he seen in there keats wiped his mouth his cheeks puffed and a languid cloud of vapour rose then he turned towards them and silently waved at them to come down and join him they rose as one and clambered down the incline stumbling carelessly on the snowblanketed branches twigs and roots dislodging little cascades of powder that sifted with a gentle hiss down the slope towards the clearing preston approached keats you found the body of the trapper in there the trapper oh yeah i noticed him as well ben regarded keatss weatherworn face and saw something in those narrow eyes hed never seen before as well preston you better come look inside with me he turned to the rest of the men gathered together in front of the entrance rest of you spread out an keep your eyes wide open he took another deep breath before stooping down pushing the canvas aside and leading the way in preston looked around for a moment at his men and nodded do as he says he said curtly he turned to vander eric you come with me he said and then followed keats inside outside the men spread out in no particular pattern gazing uncertainly at the wooden hanging frames and the bones of animals dangling from them the macabre decoration of the row of animal skulls nailed to one of the shelters walls weyland sauntered over to where ben and broken wing stood a few yards from the doorway cant say ive ever been amidst so many trees and heard it as quiet as this he almost whispered can you hear ben no birdsong at all broken wing frowned for a moment as he processed weylands drawl then nodded bad spirit ssscare birds its unnatural ben heard himself reply and then immediately cursed himself for sounding like some superstitious old crone that it most definitely is weyland said nervously stroking the handles of his moustache very unnatural they heard footsteps coming from inside the shelter a rapid scraping of feet and then vander emerged with a face as white as the snow on the ground he took several staggering steps away from the shack before vomiting lambert he heard keats calling from inside ben exchanged a look with weyland and broken wing and then headed towards the entrance he shot one last glance at vander emptying his guts onto the snow a steaming puddle of bile that quickly sank down through the fresh powder and out of sight let it not be sam please he took a final breath of crisp cold air suspecting the next breath he took would be tainted with the fetid odour of something he ducked down and pushed his way past the canvas flap chapter october for a moment he stood stock still it was too dark to make sense of his cluttered surroundings he allowed a moment for his eyes to adjust lambert he heard keatss voice growl quietly over here soon he could pick out the dark shapes around him he shuffled his foot forward finding to his surprise two very steep steps taking him down the floor of the shelter was dug out of the ground of course that made sense the shelter was more protected from the elements this way and that much more insulated ben had expected to be stooping uncomfortably as he made his way through the interior instead having taken two steps down he was standing erect he reached a hand up and found a foot clearance above his head before his fingers brushed against branches and dried mud crumbs of which rattled down through his fingers thin beams of light speared down through slender cracks in the roof and front wall dappling the uneven earthen floor with pinpricks of light his eyes adjusted he could make out some things he expected to see bales of dried and compressed beaver pelts traps hanging from hooks on the wall along with a few simple tools with which to work wood and a bag of long iron lumber nails on a crude workbench he saw skinning and gutting knives a tub of salt he heard the shuffling of feet nearby this way lambert keats grunted again quietly he looked towards where the voice had come from and saw the shack was divided by a flimsy partitioning wall no more than a row of stout branches standing vertically side by side from floor to ceiling and a wattle of strips of bark woven through them keats stood in a gap in the middle of the partition staring impatiently at him in here he said we found one of em ben felt his heart sink which one keats offered him a weak smile it aint sam he reassured him quietly he made his way towards the opening but keats remained where he was blocking his way he leaned forward so that the bristles of his beard almost tickled bens face you done a bunch of doctorin so i guess youll be readier than vander was its the hearst fella ben felt a small rush of relief and then felt immediately guilty what condition is the body in well it aint pretty he whispered ben nodded took a deep breath and vowed silently that hed remain calm and composed in front of the other two men keats stepped to one side and allowed him through this second half of the shelter was smaller it was where the trapper once slept there was a small gap in one wall a deliberate hole a window of sorts that was almost entirely plugged by the snowdrift outside it allowed enough diffused light in to the dark interior that he could immediately discern what hed been called in to examine oh my god he whispered nailed to the wall with several of the long lumber nails hed seen on the workbench was the naked body of saul hearst he was pinned upside down in a parody of the crucifixion posture his arms splayed one nail through each wrist and his feet crossed a single nail through both of them from his pelvis to his chest a knife had been at work he had been comprehensively gutted and hung against the wall like a carcass of prime beef in a butchers shop there was surprisingly little blood there and no sign of the removed organs keats looked at him quizzically ben nodded yes i presume those organs would have to be his for the first time he registered preston he was standing with his back against the partition wall and staring at the man his deep eyes locked in a silent expression of fear his lips moved soundlessly a prayer over and over ben took a reluctant step closer to the cadaver and as he did so his eyes registered something written along one of hearsts pale thighs closer still he realised the words were not written on the skin they were carved into it letters formed from the small precise slashes of a sharp blade you can read it asked keats ben nodded he glanced at the left thigh for all his dirty sins anyone know what the hell that means growled keats ben shook his head they both turned to look at preston youre a preacher said keats an that sounds to me like god talk mean anythin to you prestons eyes flickered off the corpse to look at them he was about to say something and then shook his head no i have no idea what this could mean ben studied the intense stillness of prestons face a rigid mask concealing a head full of secrets that clearly he was unprepared to share with them right now well one things for sure grunted keats reckon it aint them paiute not less they learned emselves to read an write all of a sudden prestons eyes turned back on hearsts body he looked like a condemned man taking the last few steps up a scaffold and catching his very first sight of the hangmans noose the bastards holding something back ben was about to ask preston again what those carved words meant when they heard raised voices coming from outside the shelter keats was the first to react leading the way as they stumbled clumsily through the cluttered interior up the two deep steps and emerged outside mcintyre was striding towards them we found the others he shouted breathlessly through the trees over there he said pointing past the wooden hanging frames they made their way there mcintyre leading them around a thicket of twisted and tangled brambles and presently they stood before a recently dug grave poking through last nights light snowfall could be seen the dark peaty colour of a mound of freshly turned soil there had apparently been no attempt at concealing it quite the opposite the burial mound was topped with a cross two short lengths of branch crudely lashed together with twine the entire party of men crowded around the grave as preston keats and ben pushed to the front so wheres the other grave asked keats just one grave said mcintyre theyre both in it together ben looked at him both mcintyre nodded sorry ben he pointed to the grave where two holes had already been dug into the freshly turned soil we had to dig to be sure who was here ben stepped towards the grave and saw what he recognised as the dark pattern of mrs dreytons shawl and the pale lace bonnet beneath the flowery trim of her bonnet he could see that her face had been slashed dried blood caked her cheeks and the eyes nostrils and mouth were plugged with soil another hole had been dug on the other side of the mound and already he could see sams forearm his white shirt dirty and stained one of his strong young mans hands curled up like an old mans arthritic claw and discoloured a dark brown by death ben recognised that as the inevitable pooling of immobile blood beneath the skin please cover them over now snapped preston ben nodded hed seen enough too mcintyre using the butt of his rifle as a spade began pushing the dislodged soil back into the holes gentlemen we also discovered the body of saul hearst in the shelter announced preston more for the benefit of his men than keatss people there is now im certain an evil at work in these woods the misfortune of our wagon the early snow the attack of the bear the dark savages nearby these are agents of the devil sent here to test us to torment us there were murmurs whispers amongst the men ben saw several of them bow their heads in prayer you must trust me god has a mission for us a destiny for us and the devil does not like that he has found us and now tries his tricks and strategies we will return to our camp and pray for the dreytons tonight i will talk with god and seek his guidance preston waved at his men to move out they turned away from the grave and headed across the clearing towards the shallow slope what about your man saul ben called out dont you want to bury him preston turned round well not return here again this is an evil place do you not feel it were leaving youre best coming too what about saul saul is in the same place as dorothy and sam now lambert a much better place than this preston turned back round and led his men up the slope pushing kneedeep through the snow i im leaving with them said mcintyre i can feel it too this is no place to hang around he set off after the others broken wing nodded and muttered to himself looking at the thick apron of foliage around the small clearing then followed mcintyre what did he say asked ben keats shook his head damned superstitious indian what did he say he said he could feel the whiteface spirit watching us from the trees weyland grinned nervously if youll excuse me i think i might join them keats snorted and spat might as well aint nothing we can do for em now he headed off after the others leaving ben alone ben turned to look back at the grave im so sorry sam i would have taken you with me come the spring you your mother and emily he turned to leave and then stopped and turned back round ill take care of emily for you shell come with me i promise you that chapter tuesday claremont colorado shepherd watched the soccer match with feigned interest smiling clapping and cheering at all the right moments as far as he could tell the young boys playing on the pitch before him in no more than flimsy nylon shirts and shorts looked underequipped and too willowy to his eye to be playing a proper sport a strong gust of wind would carry them all away like a bundle of red and blue twigs he preferred a good wholesome allamerican sport like football where sheer brute willpower strength of heart and tactical guile normally won the day unlike this peculiar game that seemed to turn on the mere lucky bounce of a round ball he sighed a sign of the times it seemed just about every boy and girl wanted to play this imported game these days no doubt because it looked like an easy sport to play and master unlike football the referee blew his whistle at some minor infraction the mayor leaned towards him offside he muttered shepherd nodded politely none the wiser as he watched the young boys waiting for play to resume all of them gasping clouds into the cool winter air it was a heartless grey day with a wintry bite on the breeze a light mist veiled the edge of the sports field but the strong turnout of parents and church friends on this distinctly autumnal sunday afternoon spoke of a strong local community good christian people all of them he thought with a smile despite liking this ridiculous game duncan his campaign manager had briefed him that the statistics team was reporting strong grassroots support here in this part of colorado almost as strong as it was in utah the people here liked what theyd already seen of him on the main cable stations and the prominent coverage he was beginning to get on fox perhaps even more encouraging was the fact that not many of them were members of the mormon faith his appeal was beginning to hit a wider vein thats incredibly important duncan had said thirteen million americans all members of the church of latter day saints are votes in the bank for you come polling day but that isnt enough weve got just over eighteen months of campaigning to broaden your support beyond the mormon community into the soft conservative christian right shepherd clapped along with the rest of the assembled parents at a narrowly saved shot at the goal it was a big task for an independent to try and pull off however it seemed both of the other parties up to their necks in sleaze and allegations of corruption and nasty dirty backbiting between their leading candidates were doing most of the hard work for him of course if things continued on their current trajectory sometime soon the democrats and the republicans were both going to realise they were leaking votes to him and would start working hard perhaps even together to dish the dirt on him they were going to come up emptyhanded william shepherd wasnt distracted by bubbly blonde interns or lithe young call boys his hands had never wandered where they werent wanted nor had he ever felt the need to roll a joint or snort a line of coke defraud a pension fund buy shares with inside information bribe a court official or involve himself in any spurious land deals they could dig all they liked they were going to find no skeletons in his cupboard no foulsmelling crap was going to stick to him his oldfashioned message gave him the air of some character out of a norman rockwell painting made him sound like someone from another century but that was just fine the politically correct liberal media might wince at his unfashionable values and the rabid rightwing radio jocks might scoff at his naive aphorisms but his voice was hitting all the right notes with an evergrowing audience of frightened americans their world was sliding towards increasing instability a weakened dollar punitive interest rates a plummeting jobs market a simple and reassuring message that promised redemption was all they were after a message delivered by someone who didnt reek of bullshit the large crowd of eager parents and local civil dignitaries around him in the stalls cheered jubilantly as the ball flew into the back of one of the nets shepherd nodded applauded and smiled his mind elsewhere there was something though something that hed never confided to duncan shepherd smiled if duncan only knew if his campaign supporters only knew theyd run a mile his sights were set somewhat higher than the oval office its out there somewhere in the sierras he could see it in his dreams buried somewhere in the deep woods perhaps in a secure travel chest seasons changing above it like the seconds on a ticking clock years decades drifting by and there it sat waiting to be found shepherd had tried and failed as a younger man with a lot more time on his hands there had been quite a few hikes taken into those mountains going on whatever hunch was driving him at the time listening to the inner whisper of divine guidance but there was a lot of wilderness to cover out amongst those wooded mountains it wasnt like trying to locate a downed plane at least something like that left a noticeable impact and burn scarring the preston partys camp would now he surmised be little more than barely detectable humps on the forest floor he sighed somewhere out there and now it seemed like bilbo baggins illdeservedly happening across a certain ring there was one julian cooke who had stumbled across the place where they lay buried he knew it would happen one day a hiker a party of drunken hunters a bunch of teens goofing around in tents something of a conundrum this man cooke someone he needed badly and at the same time someone he needed like a bullet in the head it seemed from his email traffic that this cooke could lead him directly to the place where prestons people had vanished which made him someone he very much wanted to sit down and talk with on the other hand this british guy was talking to other people now if he kept doing that talking to many more people he could become something of a liability the collection of meetings hed been holding with his media buddies over in london wasnt good news he suspected that none of them would probe any deeper than an intriguing survival story set during the days of the old west but there was always the possibility that someone might be clever enough intuitive enough to join together some very obscure dots the call that concerned him the most was the long one cooke had had with the forensic psychologist focusing on preston it was a little too close for comfort something like prestons story was the one and only thing that could come and bite him in the ass when he least needed it politics is about nothing more than nuance finesse another of duncans very true maxims something as trivial as a badly timed facial boil the tiniest speech fumble or a badly behaved distant nephew can lose you a million votes to be associated in any way with what had happened out there albeit over a century and a half ago could be damaging very damaging he wondered if it wouldnt be prudent to deal with cooke sooner rather than later this julian cooke a man with a modest level of success in the past something of a fading star now was running what appeared to be a failing business a single middleaged man with no close family shepherd could imagine he was probably a very lonely very discontented disillusioned person a man like that might easily have one drink too many might have a dark night of the soul and wonder if it was all worth the effort a man like that might look down at the busy street below his apartment and decide to find out what it would be like to fly for a few precious seconds no i need him just a while longer it was clear from the email exchange with his colleague rose that the man was returning to the states in a few days and then hopefully one way or another shepherd was sure he could talk him into leading him there money usually did the trick the crowd erupted with a goodnatured roar as the ball flew past the goalkeepers hands and tangled with the net shepherd smiled and clapped he knew he wanted this more than he wanted the white house i have a higher calling chapter tuesday fort casey california the librarian a bespectacled plump lady with permanently flushed cheeks and hamshank arms looked back at rose with eyes as wide as starbucks cookies youre from the bbc you mean from england rose smiled selfconsciously i work for them indirectly the woman seemed not to care too much about the distinction her friendly face broadened with a welcoming smile oh goodness i love all your tv shows and your world service my husband loves your fawlty towers and all those python programmes she offered rose a hand im daphne ryan pleasure to meet you rose reached for her hand and shook it rose whitely we dont get many visitors from so far away here in casey she continued her voice rising from a whisper with the excitement especially not from england do you live in london near that nottingham hill place rose smiled and shook her head no sadly not i live in a place called clapham its in london but not near notting hill daphne shook her head in wonder id love to live there all those quaint little book shops and buckingham palace and the big ben it must be lovely rose nodded and smiled its okay she agreed not like fort casey she continued the enthusiasm quickly draining from her face aint much going on here there never is rose shrugged its a sleepy town i really like that daphne lit up again obviously as proud of her town as she was fed up with it you do yes its a lovely place really she replied managing a sincere nod fort casey might have been a picturesque frontier town a generation ago with a square and a gazebo a town hall a corner store selling icecream sundaes and every home fronted by a white picket fence all of it perfectly framed by the distant purple peaks of the sierra nevada mountains but now it looked like every other small town a single throughroad flanked by homogenous chain stores and acres of parking tarmac unlike blue valley thirty miles east towards the mountains there was no tourist trade here no need to worry about appearances im interested in the history of this town oh youve come to the right place she said her voice beginning to carry across the small library we have an extensive local history section history of our town archives of our paper the report a section on the old army fort and garrison id like to look at that said rose your paper how far does it go back oh golly it goes back ages and ages as far back as the town does we have the archives every page of every issue on our dvd rose had already done some homework on the town it dated from the s when land was purchased for a song by the army on paiute territory to build an outpost and oversee the trickle of settlers emerging from the pass and heading northwest on the final leg towards oregon being directly on the most travelled route from emigrant pass it had developed more quickly than blue valley by the late fifties the small military outpost had been swamped by a bustling town full of traders merchants and craftsmen looking to resupply and tend to the unending procession of weary overlanders streaming out of the wilderness fort casey was an unavoidable next stop for anyone heading for oregon rose was curious where this apparently real rag man had disappeared to presumably his journey would have taken him away from the mountains from which hed emerged that meant northwest that meant passing through here can i look at this dvd sure i can fix you up on our internet station daphne said pointing towards the librarys solitary pc sitting in an illlit corner and currently being used by a sullen teenage lad lemme sort that out for you she said heading out from behind the counter she approached the boy on the computer muttered something quietly to him and pointed roses way he turned to look at her a dark mop of hair covering his face except the pout of a bottom lip he shrugged a whatever closed down the msn chat box and shuffled towards the graphic novels and manga section of the library daphne waved her over all yours she cheerfully whispered as rose sat down at the machine thats craig my nephew she nodded towards him better he hangs out here where i can keep an eye on him than elsewhere librarys a good place for him all these books and learning around him rose nodded but wondered if there was a great deal of learning going on there daphne left rose and returned a moment later with a shimmering gold disc in one hand she slotted it into the pc and a title page popped up on the screen the report archives we got two discs of material she said now our recent history from the war right up to well yesterday i guess is on the other disc you want that one as well just the first discll be fine thanks okay well then if you click on this she said moving the mouse over a search dialogue box you can enter a date here or an issue number or you can even do a word search now she clasped her hands together what specifically can i help you to look for rose felt awkward daphne ryan had been exceedingly nice but right now she needed a little space in which to think she really didnt know specifically what she was looking for not yet im just going to browse a little she looked up at her if thats all right sure daphne hovered waiting to be of further assistance rose was thinking how she was going to politely ask daphne to give her a bit of room when an old boy sidled up to the counter with a small stack of clancy novels to check out daphne placed a hand on her shoulder you shout if you need anything else okay rose nodded thanks daphne and watched her head back to the counter she faced the screen again right aaron pohenz said the rag man left the town of blue valley then known as pelorskys farm in the spring of he left on foot if he headed northwest then fort casey was only a week or so away so from perhaps february onwards she typed a broad window of time into the date fields february of that year to february of the next but what am i looking for she typed rag man into the word search hoping for an early hit the dvd drive whirred but the search threw up nothing which was what she expected the rag man was a blue valley myth unknown here she decided to think things through from another angle a paper like this a town like this back then would have focused its attention on the people passing through the overlanders coming from the east thats how news travelled back then not over some twentyfourhour news network but from the mouths of travellers on their way through every new wagon train of people stopping to resupply to repair damaged or weakened wheels reshoe horses and oxen would have a tale to tell of their journey of any indian encounters of the latest news and fashions from europe the latest political manoeuvrings back in washington she wondered if a lone traveller no doubt still gaunt from a winter of malnutrition a troubled man with little to say to anyone would have attracted the curiosity of this small town a search for loner produced an article about a local farmer who had decided to introduce sheep to graze on his land arousing the anger of local cattlemen who viewed the creatures as unamerican and had hounded the poor man out of town perhaps the rag man had talked of his experience in the hills survivor yielded a dozen eyewitness accounts of indian raids undoubtedly exaggerated to sound more heroic for the paper rose also stumbled upon a heartbreaking story of three small children dying of thirst and hunger and found clinging to the bodies of their parents a whole party of seven wagons had been stranded on the salt flats of utah after their horses had perished from drinking foul water the children two young sisters and a baby brother were picked up by the passing emigrants but died one by one over the following week cursed spewed out hundreds of printed sermons from the towns lay preacher duncan hodgekiss who it seemed spent more time admonishing the wicked and godless from the offices of the paper than he did from the pulpit of his church rose bit her lip with frustration suspecting the twentyminute drive down the interstate from blue valley and the last halfhour in the library had turned out to be something of a wild goose chase the odds of tracing a nameless man from a hundred and fifty years ago amongst the spurious tales printed in a local rag were long to say the least in all likelihood this weakened troubled man this cursed man most probably had died by the wayside traipsing northwest on foot she wondered if he had been one of the names shed picked out of the journal keats preston weyland vander hussein or perhaps even the author himself lambert there was no telling this survivor might have been one of them or one of the other mormon men or nothing at all to do with the preston party she indulged the thought for a moment and then dismissed it the rag man had wandered out of the very same mountains in the spring of the following year given the remote location off the beaten track it was unlikely the two events werent linked she sighed frustrated which one of them were you searching randomly with tag words was getting her nowhere she noticed once a week there was a regular column in the paper entitled what the wind blows in it was penned by the same author each time one theodore feillebois the papers editor it was a gossipy column that catalogued the more interesting arrivals of the week rose decided to focus her attention on those she was into may editions when she finally hit upon something that stirred the fair hair on her forearms came into town on the dawn like a ghostly phantom this intrepid reporter always the keen hunting dog for the exciting tales that can be told by these courageous citizens who have braved the elephants tail and the deadly indian savage i approached the man he was i found the most curious of passersthrough that i have encountered in the service of this paper of ours a tall gaunt silent man with eyes that appeared to have seen things that this reporter would be unable to commit to paper for fear of frightening the fair ladies of this town a pilgrim crossing this untamed continent of ours alone is either very brave or very foolish and i have no doubt that he must have experienced much that would blanch the faces of even the brave troops who garrison our fort and protect our souls day and night when i asked him for the story of his crossing the mans response was a silence and an intense stare that i can only describe as haunted i persisted in encouraging this man whom i shall refer to hereon in as the pilgrim as i have no name for him unwilling as he was to provide me with one to tell me something of his adventurous crossing but alas he declined he was dressed in illfitting clothes that appeared borrowed from another betternourished man and with not a single possession in his hands the pilgrim whoever he was is a face this scribe will never forget when i asked this mysterious traveller where he was headed his reply dear reader was one enigmatic word a word that perhaps sums up the singleminded dogged spirit and willpower of these brave hardy folk he said to me oregon he then shuffled away from me little more than a crowscare in tattered clothes and not a single thing to call his own i soon lost sight of him amongst the busy throng of traders and overlanders that fill our main thoroughfare on any given day of the week oh my god rose whispered i think ive found him chapter october preston turned to vander you saw it he nodded yes i did william for all his dirty sins he said lowering his voice outside preston could hear the muted voices of his people they were gathered around the men that had returned hearing various versions of what had been discovered uneasy rumours would be spreading amongst them the men scaring their wives their wives terrifying their children he was relieved that only he and eric from their party had gone inside and seen poor sauls body to some degree it was better that the awful things done to him were not common knowledge as only he and eric had seen he could control what his people were allowed to know preston clamped his lips tightly and swallowed someone knows eric nodded ashen faced my god what if its not one of our people what do you mean what if were being punished erics voice trembled what if hes angry with us william what we did was his will it was all wrong his church all wrong our founder took something sacred and made a mockery of it joseph smith should never have been led to it it was right that he was killed that eric that was gods anger right there but we took them they were not given to us no if the lord hadnt wished for me to take them i would not have them with me now preston turned and nodded at the metal chest theyre here with me because he wishes that to be so and joseph smith is dead beaten to death by a mob his church split amongst greedy rivals again that would not be so unless the lord wished it vander looked unconvinced we are the light eric the good be certain of that if this was not what god wanted we would have known about it a long time ago then who killed saul someone who knows but who other than dorothy preston sat down heavily wincing from the sharp tug on his bound wounds he cast his mind back to the night before last dorothy comes to me enraged and heartbroken you took me in when i had no one she cries i abandoned my faith for you dorothy listen to me i gave you my heart my soul my body i gave you my children please listen to we trusted you we trusted your message from god you told lies william you told us lies you led us away from god youve led us here to this forsaken place me my children and all the others why are you saying these things to me dorothy because in your sleep it came out the truth one night after the next fever made you tell the truth fever pushed the truth out of you as it pushed sour liquid from your wounds you and saul and eric the three of you are evil whatever i must have said was feverish nonsense dorothy shakes her head no i ive suspected some of these things before even punished myself for letting the devil put doubts in my head but you you are doing what you claim our founder did taking the words of god and making them your own dorothy your words not gods william preston looked up at eric yes if she knew because of what she heard you say in your sleep then who else might she have told preston shook his head i dont know perhaps the important question should be who else might have heard me only saul dorothy and myself sat with you vander turned to look at him and that doctor lambert preston took a deep breath and nodded slowly yes yes he was with me a few times vanders eyes widened do you think he might have done this i dont know but he would not know of your work our book preston considered that for a moment he had seen lambert become close to dorothys children over the last few months particularly samuel the lad might have shared with lambert what their mission was he might have explained the book of new instruction he might even have shown him a copy it was possible that dorothy went to lambert and told him everything she suspected but he couldnt imagine the man killing with such ferocity and anger he couldnt imagine lambert carving those letters into hearsts skin with the tip of a knife preston looked up at vander i sent saul to reason with dorothy not to upset the others with her doubts vander nodded maybe saul went too far preston shook his head gravely perhaps dorothy could have undone everything with her doubts and suspicions he must have decided he had no choice preston sighed might be that is so is it possible william that lambert came upon them dead and found saul there ready to deal with emily and killed him in anger preston nodded it was a possible scenario but one he could only imagine if some greater presence was at work eric he said after a few moments it is quite possible that the devil is acting through this man to get to us to stop our work vander trembled with fear or rage or both the devil is all around us isnt he hes in lambert the others in that group the savages out there yes thats what i sense we have in that chest what the devil fears the most gods true message waiting to be heard for the first time and we will make his words known one way or another we should kill lambert no ill not have any more blood shed i would never have sent saul if i had known he was going to take a knife to them maybe that was gods will preston sighed i dont know i need to rest and pray god will talk to me tonight we shall discuss this further in the morning vander nodded all right he turned to go will you take some broth william mrs lester is cooking some on the campfire im not hungry i just need some rest for now as you wish vander pushed aside the drape and stepped out letting in the flickering glow of the nearby campfire the cloth flapped back down shutting out the light and leaving preston in the gloom of a single guttering oil lamp he settled back on his cot and reached for the ceramic flask tucked behind it he pulled the stopper out and sighed with relief he could feel the onset of trembling a cold sweat and lightheadedness but he knew these unfortunate symptoms would be washed away with this last dose of lamberts medicine he drank the bitter tonic i must ask lambert for some more tomorrow shes unchanged yes whispered mrs zimmerman shes as she was not spoken a word nor moved at all ben knelt down beside her she was curled into a foetal ball her knees pulled up her hands clasped together between them and her chin her blue eyes lost some place far away there were still dark spots and smudges of dried blood in the creases of her skin that had resisted being sponged away he wondered how many of those dark flakes of blood had come from her mother and sam her long blonde hair was still clotted and tangled although the dress she had worn yesterday stained appallingly with the indians blood had been replaced with another mrs zimmerman had done her best to wash the dark spatters from her face leaving it clean but ghostly white my husband told me you found the others yes he looked at her wondering how much her husband had told her probably she knew of the graves but nothing about mr hearst clearly preston didnt want the awful scene to be relayed to the others it would spread a dangerous panic amongst them and more than likely distrust and enmity would be misdirected at broken wing they were all dead he replied was it the savages do you think no of course it wasnt indians dont bury the dead nor are they likely to read and write i dont think so he replied but that left him considering two very unsettling alternatives either it was something he couldnt accept something beyond science something that belonged to a time of darkness and ignorance something supernatural or or it was somebody from the camp he recalled the words inscribed into hearsts pale flesh mrs zimmerman she looked up at him her hand stopped stroking emilys hair will you be with her tonight yes ill stay with emily as long as she needs me she replied my husband and i have no children to care for now not any more the trace of bitterness in her voice was almost fully concealed but still detectable and unmistakable he could hardly imagine the pain of losing an only child something far beyond any other kind of loss he wondered whether beneath her carefully contained tightlipped grief she silently blamed someone for losing her little girl her husband preston perhaps even god ill bid you goodnight i shall come back in the morning to look in on her mrs zimmerman nodded ben reached out and stroked emilys face her eyes stared blankly ahead of her goodnight emily he said quietly chapter october from up here i can see them all the camp is quiet the sky has opened up and unleashed a silent flurry of heavy snowflakes that cascade and land without a noise down below the communal campfires have been left to burn out and all of them are tucked into their shelters except four of them in two huddled pairs the night watch i see you though i see you william preston in your shelter what are you thinking now are you afraid yet you should be long before the snow melts they will all know about you william preston they will know that you are a pretender a false prophet a charlatan a liar a thief and a murderer and when they discover this they will turn on you for leading them to this they will turn on you and burn you like a witch an idea suddenly occurs an ingenious way to torment preston before this happens im coming down there tonight the voice is nothing but a whisper im coming to take something from you chapter october why do you not speak to me preston stirred uneasily on his cot not quite asleep but not awake why everything ive done i have done for you but neither god nor his emissary the angel spoke he felt hot and restless beneath the layers of blankets over him kicking them back in his restless halfsleep the angel would only come to those he trusted those god trusted a truth he knew the words of god were so precious so very fragile so easily taken and corrupted by those with ambition by those selfappointed to speak on his behalf the bible written by a succession of men with selfish agendas greedy men arrogant men the book of mormon written by joseph smith a man who hungered to escape anonymity to author his very own religion from nothing the torah the quran an endless procession of pretenders im not like these men i dont do this for myself i do this for you god so that finally it is your words that people will hear not mine nor any other mans the silence was deafening something was wrong that was why nephi was not coming to him to translate the language of angels to one that his humble human mind could comprehend something was keeping nephi away perhaps vander was right perhaps it was the devil keeping him away there was evil all around them the dirtyfaced savages out amongst the trees the others in the camp amongst them a catholic family a muslim family a negro with skin scorched by sin keats profane ugly crude and his indian partner and lambert of course an atheist who tried to insinuate his way into dorothys family like a snake whispering dirty lies to both samuel and emily his thoughts disjointed and fleeting as they were were abruptly halted by a powerful certain knowledge that he was not alone in his temple he thought he heard the whisper of movement beside his cot something that stirred inside his metal chest the soft squeak of unoiled hinges opening the gentle clink of fragile bones is that you he muttered breathlessly in the dark have you come william the voice a quiet whisper materialised in the pitchblack emptiness just above his cot nephi yes an overpowering euphoric surge of relief pulsed through preston he felt dizzy and lightheaded oh thank the lord thank the lord i was afraid that id done something wrong preston sat up are we to start gods work this night to translate his message from the scrolls he sensed movement in the dark the brush of something passing by no the answer confused him momentarily then what are we to do first he asked i am leaving you william the words hung in the air before him incomprehensible for a moment words he never expected to hear leaving but but why there was no reply why preston felt another gentle draught of movement coming from the pitchblack space in front of him and heard the soft tinkle of the bones in their canvas sack you disappoint me how how do i what have i done wrong preston cried the angel left the question unanswered what have i done wrong preston cried again his voice raised his sweatdamp cheeks moistened further with tears he felt a sudden cold blast of air from outside chilling his damp body no he screamed no please no he jerked on the cot suddenly fully awake and trembling like a mongrel left outside on a frozen night but he was lying down not sitting up as he thought he had been and covered once more with his blankets cold and damp with his sweat was i dreaming preston realised that he must have been but it had felt so real so dreadfully painfully real he felt his heart pounding in his chest and a wave of relief wash over him just a dream then a nightmare in fact the angel hadnt spoken to him after all with that realisation there was disappointment but it was more than compensated by the relief that hed not been judged and found wanting he reached for some matches struck one and lit the wick of the oil lamp that sat on a small wooden crate beside his cot it caught flickered and glowed softly pushing the darkness back through the windteased flap and out into the cold night he turned in his cot the wooden frame creaking with the weight of his body to see the metal chest sitting wide open oh nno no he whispered chapter wednesday fulham london julian sat in what he was beginning to think of as the waiting room dr thomas griffiths offices in fulham consisted of a couple of rooms his office and another larger room in which his personal assistant sat behind a desk facing a sofa and a coffee table last time julian had worked with him his office had been a small study in his home the book was obviously doing well the phone had been answered at least four times since he had arrived and he halflistened to onesided conversations whilst flicking through the media pullout in todays times from what he could hear there was a steady traffic of public appearance requests his eyes drifted onto a copy of usa today on the cover was the image of a face he vaguely recognised he reached across the coffee table and picked up the magazine then he managed to place him it was the american businessman who had recently thrown his hat in for the presidential election it was an item on the news show hed caught during the flight back home an outsider many were calling a fool because he was campaigning so early and was bound to peak and wilt before the final showdown in about eighteen months time he recalled the man was some kind of a religious figure shepherd that was it that was his name a lay preacher of some kind with a lot of money to burn and a lot of friendly mostly religious sponsors gathering around his campaign skimming through the article inside he discovered shepherd owned a regional media network in utah and ran a string of small spiritual colleges that in the eyes of the journalist were vaguely reminiscent of the islamic madrasas in northern pakistan the door to the office swung open to reveal dr griffiths wide frame he had put on even more weight since the last time julian had seen him at a glance he guessed he must weigh sixteen or seventeen stone a lot of good living julian his rich voice boomed as he thrust out a hand towards him fantastic to see you again julian reached for his hand good to see you too tom things are looking good eh very good i should be writing more and doing less television really im becoming like those media tramps i despise julian grinned or exmedia tramps in my case tom grinned you were never a tramp jules come on in he said gesturing to the study beyond he turned to his assistant judy dont put any calls through for the next halfhour or so okay of course dr griffith julian stepped into the office and sat in a winged leather seat opposite toms expansive dark wood desk very nice sanctum sanctorum youve got here he said looking around at the tasteful decor and the glistening sheen of polished wood ive always loved quality office furniture said tom as he pulled his seat out and sat heavily down its one of my weaknesses the timber for this desk is reclaimed indonesian teak reclaimed from the hulls of fishing vessels theres no way to get your hands on that kind of wood without bribing the right official my desk by contrast is a flatpack from ikea tom laughed not unkindly i dont recall you being as vain or materialistic as i am though no i suppose not said julian with a wry smile be nice to be able to put that to the test though tom offered a conciliatory nod things will turn around for you jules youre smart and youre tenacious that girl you worked with rose was it yes rose youre still partners in crime he nodded shes an incredibly good filmmaker i really liked what you did with that series and said tom reaching across the vast expanse of his desk and pulling out a lined pad of paper from the pile in his intray i really think you two will be on your way back out of the wilderness with this he said flourishing a page of notes written in his spidery hand tom reached for an inhaler on his desk and took a hit julian remembered the man suffered with asthma bloody fascinating stuff this julian absolutely bloody fascinating youve had a chance to go through some of the stuff i sent over ive been through most of it julian i couldnt put the damn thing down even though i should be working on the foreword to a colleagues book so what do you make of it all tom settled back into his chair and pursed his lips in thought for a few moments what i think youve got there my friend is a very detailed account of a serial killer going about his business thats the obvious conclusion isnt it but heres the big question which one of them is it maybe its more than one of them tom shrugged could be so so from the account written by this lambert character it looks very much like the most likely culprit is the mormon preacher preston yeah he appears to exhibit all the obvious traits of a narcissistic messianic complex a narcissistic a what a dyedinthewool sociopath of the very worst kind im not sure how this little tale ends up julian im still working my way through the journal but tom continued id be prepared to bet bloody good money it ends with the death of most of these people in particular most if not all of his followers julian looked at him what makes you so certain of that hes a classic reverend jim jones figure you recall the jonestown incident right of course a strongwilled charismatic sociopath driven by a delusion of some messianic destiny the pattern im seeing in this lambert journal is very similar a religious patriarchal figure leading his devoted followers out into an isolated wilderness away from the interference and prying noses of authority in jim joness case it was guyana in prestons case im presuming he was heading for some unclaimed tract beyond the reach of the us government to set up his own little kingdom away from the rule of law away from the established church of latter day saints julian nodded thats about the size of it tom got up from his office chair and walked over to the door of his study fancy some coffee julian nodded and tom cracked the door open and asked judy to rustle up a cafetiere of kilimanjaro fairtrade for both of them he closed the door gently to what end though julian asked tom smiled like jim jones like david koresh or to pick a few secular examples like idi amin robert mugabe even adolf hitler to realise his manifest destiny to appease the particular malevolent imp inside him julians brows arched imp tom spread his hands apologetically forgive me its a characterisation im using way too often right now im consulting on a tv drama a supernatural version of cracker the scriptwriters have been using that phrase that metaphor in their dialogue and im finding myself doing it now its like catching someone elses cold he laughed no i mean the delusion thats driving him like i say a classic dyedinthewool sociopath julian had heard the term many times but had never been given a concise definition of it that made sense tom seemed to pick up on that its an overused word these days julian one bandied about a bit too readily by screenwriters crime novelists and daytime tv shrinks its similar in a way to autism an inability to comprehend the feelings of others a total absence of the ability to empathise but autism is an example of the brain misfiring not working properly its a disorder on the other hand the sociopathic tendency i believe is for the sake of a better word an enhancement its designed designed darwinistically speaking of course julian grinned with relief i thought for a terrifying moment there that you were going all creationist on me tom laughed no ive seen enough of how the mind works to never be in any danger of suddenly finding god no by designed i mean the sociopathic tendency has evolved amongst a minority of people every serial killer is a sociopath youd need to be able to do what they do the inability to perceive the feelings of others the suffering of a victim gives a killer an advantage the competitive edge if you like which of course in darwinistic one might even say dawkinsian terms these days makes a hell of a lot of sense if you think about it the door creaked open and judy brought in a tray of coffee and biscuits tom thanked her then waited until she had left before continuing youd be surprised how many sociopaths are out there julians dark brow arched he reflexively pushed his glasses up uh how many its a trait thats really quite common perhaps about one in ten people exhibits sociopathic tendencies to some degree what surely the streets would be awash with blood well you know where theres an absence of a controlling mechanism law and order thats exactly how it is sighed tom you only have to consider baghdad or darfur or sarajevo or kenya he dipped his biscuit swilled it around and then carefully lifted the soggy thing to his mouth but listen its a mistake to think that violent behaviour is always a natural followon for those who have this inability to pity to empathise you ever watch the apprentice on the telly julian nodded guiltily yeah i hate to admit i got sucked into the last series no one got sliced open or garrotted with piano wire at least not that im aware of but id say a very high proportion of those contestants had a sociopathic tendency of one sort or another prepared to do anything to anybody just to be the winner there now said julian half joking i always knew there was a reason i didnt like suits well thats a fair comment the corporate world is an ecosystem that rewards the most sociopathic competitors and punishes the most altruistic even the phrases commonly used in the business world dog eat dog its a jungle who dares wins hostile takeover are all very aggressive the business language is a very predatorial language by logical extraction its likely that the most successful businessmen the ceos the senior executives the city traders captains of industry are the most ruthless of them the most extreme sociopaths said julian tom nodded yup julian sipped his coffee kind of puts a different spin on the whole thatcherism thing doesnt it of course it does there is no such thing as society any more spoken like a true sociopath eh yes julian chuckled if you believe that she sent this country of ours to war in order to stir up the patriotic vote and win herself another term resulting in the deaths of over two hundred and fifty british servicemen then in my book that puts her serial killers scorecard up there above harold shipmans and tony blair tom smiled there you go arguably another coldblooded bastard in fact the world of politics is an even more fertile place for them to flourish more so than the world of business even the worlds of sport fashion and celebrities attract sociopaths to the very top like bees to honey i imagine flipping through the glossy pages of hello heat and ok magazines the majority of those perfect suntanned smiling faces have got where they are by happily trampling on the shoulders of others tom leaned forward let me put it to you this way julian i wonder how many of them would be prepared to quietly stick the knife into someone in their way hmm a competitor a rival a particularly nasty critic julian nodded sure i suppose how far would they go to hang on to their fame and success heres a question for you how many celebrities do you think would actually kill to keep their status or climb further if they knew they could get away with it hmm toms voice had begun to grow wheezy he reached for his inhaler and took another puff whilst julian dwelled on that idea for a moment the thought of those endless supermarket celebrity magazines being populated by a procession of potential serial killers left him feeling decidedly uneasy let me ask you tom continued whom would you kill to ensure you hung on to this particular story what would you kill me if i threatened to pick up the phone on my desk here ring the editor of the mirror and totally blow your scoop toms beefy hand reached teasingly across towards his desk phone and picked it up no of course i wouldnt but id be really flippin pissed off with you if you did julian answered testily toms laugh filled the small office as he put the phone back down in its cradle there you go then youre not one of them you lack the killer instinct my friend he smiled thats what makes you one of the good guys very funny julian mumbled irritably tom gestured at his pad full of notes this chap preston strikes me as the type who would easily kill to see out his goal which from what lambert writes seems like an attempt to rebrand the mormon faith in his own way casting himself in the role of prophet he stroked his chin in thought a man like that would kill again and again and again maybe by his own hand but just as likely by getting into the heads of his followers and having them do his dirty work youre not a big fan of the religious type are you he laughed you kidding the underbelly of religious fanaticism is thick on the ground with narcissistic freaks rasputin tomas de torquemada most of the early popes the crusadeera popes innocent iii who decreed a crusade against other christians never mind muslims the imams who groom children to blow themselves to pieces if ever you wanted a definition of hell julian its the inner landscape of minds like these a messianic narcissistic sociopath tom smiled my phrase by the way you can use it in your documentary if you want just make sure to attribute the quote to me julian nodded ill make certain yes added tom looking back down at his notes very nasty very manipulative and very dangerous people chapter wednesday wimbledon london sean holmwood tossed the stick for watson out across wimbledon common and watched the labrador chase after it kicking up flecks of mud behind him as he tore across the welltended grass towards the spinney an acre of mixed trees most of them bare and patiently awaiting winter a few of them hanging on to the last of their golden leaves normally taking watson for his evening walk was a daily chore that his wife was happy to do but this evening he had volunteered as soon as he came home grabbing the lead and setting out with watson eagerly pulling all the way sean needed some thinking time julian cookes project sounded intriguing watson returned with the stick wedged in his teeth flecks of saliva across his muzzle he dropped it at seans feet and sat obediently good boy sean muttered perfunctorily as he scooped it up and tossed it as far as he could towards the spinney it seemed julian had landed on his feet with this find from what sean had been told of the story and from the compilation of fantastically moody footage he had seen on the laptop there was easily the makings of an hours worth of finelooking documentary but julian was quite right to be thinking bigger this could also be written up as a docudrama there were film rights and book rights that could be sold on the back of it the mormon angle of the story was also very intriguing with increasing media attention being focused on the wildcard mormon independent presidential candidate william shepherd there was a topical relevance to this story he looked up at the darkening sky it was near six and the dull glow of a drab october day was fast fading watsons walk was going to be a short one this evening sean wanted to get back and put together some notes if he wanted to fasttrack an editorial decision he needed to sell the project internally tonight hed put together a sales pitch which he would float across a few desks first thing in the morning watson returned with the stick and this time sean tossed it hard into the undergrowth of the spinney let him work off some energy rooting around for it in there the labrador hurled himself in amongst the trees in hot pursuit kicking up fallen leaves and twigs in his wake sean pulled a small plastic freezer baggie out of his pocket and shoved his hand in pulling it back over his wrist so it was like a glove he grimaced slightly still not entirely used to the unpleasant task of scooping up a warm one watson should be just about ready to deliver the goods he heard the dog scampering around in amongst the trees and bushes cracking twigs underpaw and gruffing and growling with frustration looking for the correct branch sean felt a tingle of excitement at the prospect of taking off with this project julians pitch had sold it but then seeing roses showreel moody footage of thick and dark woods mist undulating through the trees the haunted feel of a clearing in the woods the mosscovered humps the slow and steady zoomin on the rotting wood of a wagon wheel marvellous stuff he muttered to himself up ahead deep amongst the undergrowth he could hear watson still scampering about like an idiot he laughed quietly a truly thick dog come on dummy one sticks just as good as another yes tomorrow morning sean would get the ball rolling and return to julian with a firm offer within a day they needed to be quick whilst there was a good working relationship between them he was certain julian wouldnt walk away from a better offer elsewhere after all moneys mon watson yelped watson here boy sean called out it was silent across the manicured lawns except for the rustling of a light breeze through the branches and dry leaves and the distant rumble of traffic around the three distant sides of the common watson he called out with a singsong timbre that usually brought the daft dog to him here boy nothing sean felt a prickling of concern watson never ever ignored him like that he half walked half jogged over towards the edge of the spinney and looked inside for the telltale flash of his chestnutcoloured coat in amongst the foliage there was no sign of him watson he took several quick steps forward off the wellclipped grass onto a thickening mat of dead crispy leaves twigs acorn husks and conker shells sean wasnt terribly keen on stepping too much further inside he turned to look back out at the common there were a few people around a couple rollerblading along one of the tarmac paths another two or three dog owners walking their dogs a group of teenagers chatting on a bench several hundred yards away he wasnt exactly alone but in the gathering gloom of early evening he might as well be watson dammit come here shit it was on wimbledon common not so long ago that a woman had been stabbed to death by a careinthecommunity type a lost and tormented man whod been convinced that every blondehaired woman was an agent of satan coming to extract his soul and take it down to the underworld sean instinctively reached down and fumbled for a twig big enough to call a branch and grabbed hold of it it felt reassuring in his hand just in case emboldened he advanced further in pushing through a thorny bush that effectively obscured him from view to those few people out on the common something must have happened to watson if he wasnt answering perhaps he had found a rabbit hole and taken a tumble or run headlong into a tree trunk and stunned himself he was that stupid a dog or maybe hed found a bitch willing to take the silly old bugger on watson he called out again there was a rustling to one side of him and the dull muffled crack of an acorn underfoot it sounded very much like someone shifting weight from one foot to another okay who the fucks in here sean called out hoping his polished boardroom voice sounded more menacing than it did to him the rustling ceased immediately but somehow that made it seem a million times worse sean sensed that this was the moment he ought to back quietly out of the trees past the bush and onto the common and walk away without his dog watson he called out once more im going you stupid hound he had turned round to head out of the undergrowth towards the open green when he heard movement in front of him his eyes picked out a dark silhouette against the edge of the spinney and the darkening grey sky beyond any further detail was lost to the last of the earlyevening light but unmistakably it was a man wearing a hood yes he said and then as an afterthought can i help you the silhouette remained perfectly still you after some money no a dry voice answered stay calm sean cautioned himself control the situation my dog came in here did you see him the man advanced a step forward you spoke with someone ive been watching sean shrugged ive spoken to a lot of people today you spoke to him about a story in america playing dumb probably wasnt going to help how do you know about that who are you the silhouette was silent what the hell do you want im here to tidy things up said the man chapter october this morning for the first time i sense the others looking at us with distrust i dont know whether they have collectively discussed who or what killed dorothy sam and mr hearst and decided it is one of us or whether they each privately harbour that suspicion but i can see it in the quick wary glances the shortest possible exchange of pleasantries with us keats spoke of mr larkin their butcher not wanting to work alongside mr bowen and visiting emilys shelter this morning i was silently watched by a group of five men gathered around their breakfast fire watched intently moments after entering and talking with mrs zimmerman mr vander stuck his head in and made it clear i was to check on her as quickly as possible then leave i do wonder whether a buffeting wind shook and rattled the creaking wooden framework of their shelter whilst the flap over their entrance tied down against the gusting wind rustled and whipped complaining like a tethered dog a blizzard was coming down almost horizontally small dry sandlike beads of ice that stung against bare skin above the rumpling thud of wind he heard a muffled voice mr lambert he recognised it as preston yes a word if you dont mind uh yes of course ben closed his inkpot and put away his journal before readying himself to step outside ill come in said preston ben saw fingers work on the tie and a moment later the wind whipped it open snow hurled in chased by a vicious biting blast of freezing air preston stooped down low pushed his way through the flap and settled down on his haunches inside securing the flap once more are we alone he asked quietly squinting in the dark interior mr keats and broken wing are foraging for wood with some others good i wished to speak to you in private ben felt his skin run cold realising he was alone with someone who might just be capable of violent murder and barbaric mutilation hed not do something to me here now surely unlikely as that was he found his hand subconsciously reaching for the handle of his hunting knife tucked away under his poncho in his belt what do you wish to talk about i find the discomfort of my injury is continuing to be unbearable and i would like to take with me a complete bottle of your medication that i need not keep bothering you to personally administer it well it is no bother ben lied his mind recalling the openly hostile glances he had drawn earlier this morning approaching the dreyton shelter thats as may be however there are those amongst my people who would rather your party remain from now on on your side of the camp mr preston i think i should advise you that this medication is really best only prescribed a few times there are unfortunate sideeffects that can occur when used repeatedly prestons face hardened make no mistake lambert i do need this medication the discomfort is such that i am unable to lead prayers and services my people need me to be strong more than ever now not for me to be laid up as invalid ben nodded yes well i can continue to give it to you but i think its best that i measure it out for you i can manage well enough with the measuring but it requires a steady reduction in measure to ensure lambert ben hushed there was a brittle anger in his voice that sounded like the fracturing of dangerously thin ice over a deep rushing river i will have a bottle if you please ben could see something in the stern glare of his deepset eyes you understand i could return here with several of my men and help myself to all of your medicines dont you yyes i i suppose you could there are those who think the butchering of our people was your handiwork lambert they know you have training as a doctor and would have skill with a surgeons tools what there are those who think you were becoming unnaturally close with young samuel unnaturally preston managed a humourless predatory smile thats what some of them are saying but but what are they what do they mean by tha ive overheard some of my men suggest you might have been rejected by samuel that you became enraged and what i killed him preston nodded and his mother that mr hearst intervened and that you took your surgeons knife to him too thats crazy as for myself prestons smile softened slightly i dont see that kind of evil in you you are godless and arrogant for that you are eternally doomed but what i dont see before me is a murderer then you must tell the others that and i must have my medicine he replied preston stared in silence at him whilst outside the wind buffeted and whistled impatiently eager to get in i see said ben good the understanding was passed in silence ben turned around and rummaged in his medicine bag a moment later producing a stoppered dark green glass bottle i have only this last bottle of the laudanum thats it preston reached for it but ben held it back mr preston do please be aware of what this tonic can do in some it can stimulate alarming visions and an increasing dependency i have had many visions before now visions of god yes he comes to me talks with me only he doesnt does he whispered ben immediately regretting it preston looked sharply up at him a look that chilled ben to the core that was very very stupid you heard the things dorothy heard he asked ben nodded dorothy came to me the night before she died and what did she tell you he wondered how much more to reveal that she had lost her faith in you i see prestons jaw set and you think i saw to it she was killed ben refused to respond he found his hand tightening around the handle of his knife once more whether hed be able to use it was another matter i loved her lambert i loved her more than any of my followers and i loved her children too they were mine you you mean what you were sams father preston nodded and emilys in fact many of the children in my church are mine i would never allow any of them to be hurt my people know that the other men the fathers they know this of course they understand this as our way i am the closest to god on this evil world the closest living soul to god who else would you rather have seed your child ben shook his head they they would turn on you wouldnt they theyd turn on you if they knew the icecold facade slipped for a moment from prestons face revealing for only a second fear if they knew what lambert dont push him into a corner what exactly are you talking about mr lambert he realised it was already too late to back away now that you are a a fraud the word hung for too long on its own in the space between them before preston spoke i dont know what you know or what you think you know but you are no longer to visit our camp none of your group in fact will be permitted to step beyond the dead oxen in the middle is that understood what of emily she is being cared for well enough by mrs zimmerman i must look in on her surely youll let me do that preston leaned closer to ben his long slim nose only inches away from bens face he could feel the tickle of the mans stale breath if i hear of you visiting emily he whispered who knows what will happen to you perhaps you will find yourself gutted and hung like so much butchers meat ben struggled to contain the trembling that coursed through his body mmy god it it was you wasnt it preston reached for the bottle we are two separate camps now be sure to tell keats that be sure to tell him none of your people are to talk to mine he pushed his way out through the flap letting in a small blizzard of hale that veiled his exit chapter wednesday blue valley california the call connected and rose heard the ringing tone it was gone three in the afternoon here it would be gone eleven in the evening back home in london she wondered what he was up to julian cooke he answered crisply its rose she replied an awkward pause followed the memory of the other nights momentary frisson still vivid for both of them julian broke the silence all right yeah fine and you im good you know keeping busy rose fiddled uncomfortably with a tress of her hair you asked me to call the email had come through an hour ago two perfunctory and polite lines from julian suggesting they should quickly hook up and update each other on their progress uh yeah i just wanted to see what youre up to and let you know how thingsre going from my end uhhuh so so shall i go first or do you no er fine you go first and update me if you like julian coughed okay well good meetings so far weve got sean on board hes putting together a deal as we speak and with the bbc signing on itll make it a shitload easier to sign up another partner thats great so money soon shouldnt be quite such an issue what else oh yeah i spoke to dr griffith you remember tom the shrink we interviewed for uncommon people thats the fella hes doing very well with his book by the way lucky tom hes really hooked by this wants to do something with us okay hes not going to hijack it is he no but he may be a useful authoritative talking head it really depends whether we do a straight documentary or a docudrama which is what sean is suggesting anyway toms convinced preston is some kind of whackedout religious nutjob thats hardly a difficult diagnosis julian laughed nope but he made some very interesting comparisons with other similar whackedout nuts from history itll make for a good angle to play around with plus his reputation carries some authority if hes happy to say prestons a sociopathic killer prepared to murder all his followers just to satisfy delusions of destiny then he said that yup rose felt the skin on her arms tingle oh my god it is kind of creepy isnt it she wondered whether to confess to julian exactly how spooked she was beginning to feel about the whole thing what we may have according to tom is one of the earliest most detailed accounts of a serial killer going about his business courtesy of our good friend lambert julian yeah it gets better better or weirder rose didnt like the fact that the story was beginning to get to her how so im almost certain one of the preston party emerged from the hills she said what ive been following up on some of the blue valley folklore theres an account of a survivor who emerged the spring after lamberts diary entries emaciated at deaths door and quite out of his mind by the sound of it who well thats the mystery it was a man they called him the rag man he never gave a name they nursed him back onto his feet and he left blue valley early april then i picked up his trail in a town called fort casey about forty miles northwest where he attracted some attention he entered the town and a curious reporter tried to collar him for an interview she read the article to julian thats really quite weird he said isnt it but how can we be sure its someone from the preston party we cant but blue valley pelorskys farm was well off the beaten track for emigrants the only people back then that they encountered were trappers and traders and occasional indians its too big a coincidence that a starving white man emerged from the mountains a few months after those people got caught by the snow dont you think hmm and that article was dated midapril so it would fit the timescale of someone making forty miles westward on foot you know having a mysterious survivor emerge from the mountains and into enigmatic obscurity would really add a lot to our story it certainly would she replied whoever it was yeah if that person survived what if that man had children it would be one helluva coup to track down a descendant and interview him or her yes said julian look weve got quite a few names from lamberts journal keats weyland preston bowen larkin zimmerman stolz stolheim to name just a few it would be worth a shot if youre up for it to comb through the archived press of the time like you did in fort casey thatll be like looking for a needle in a haystack maybe but we could filter this down a bit if this rag man was headed northwest there were only a few destinations for him back then werent there i mean you had portland astoria and fort vancouver none of those settlements would have been that big back then perhaps only a few thousand if we ran all the names mentioned in lamberts journal through their local press archives their parish records we might get a hit true and ill help you with this as soon as i join you out there meantime im going to follow prestons trail i mentioned to you theres a guy out there on the internet whos set up a page on preston yeah i saw your mail theres an email address on his page im going to see if we can squeeze him for some detail be careful jules rose blurted uh well you know dont sound too interested who knows it might be another journalist whos on the same story julian chuckled ill be sure to sound extremely casual about everything then the conversation came to an unexpected halt this time rose stepped in so when are you coming back i booked a flight back on friday we should arrange with grace to have another visit up to the site see what other bits and pieces we can dig up she wont like it if i say it like that well obviously were not going to run a jcb across the place just a little trowel work thats all actually having read most of the journal i think i understand the layout of that clearing i think itd be a cinch for example to locate prestons shelter yes and julian let slip a nervous chuckle who knows what crazy stuff well find if we do hmm rose shuddered spooky stuff oh thats for sure chapter october he listened to the howling wind outside knowing that it was bringing with it many inches of snow that would be covering the entrance to the shelter but it was a warm shelter so much better than the hastily erected leantos down the hillside in the clearing a good place from which to do work yes a good place to become something more he looked around at the tools hanging from lumber nail hooks sharp tools unused for many decades on the floor beneath them nestled an ancientlooking flintlock weapon from another time perhaps even a previous century no good to anyone now the tools however he could use you are strong the voice inside him made him shiver with delight i hope so he looked down at the canvas sack of bones daring to pull open the threaded mouth of the bag he glimpsed the small cluster of darkcoloured almost black bones inside you came to me yes i chose you the other was wicked preston you are a good man i try so hard to be he resumed his work with the sharp tools the dry brittle scrape of metal on dry bone rasp rasp rasp you will help me i will we can help each other cant we yes he resumed his work shards of bone gathering on the dry earth floor at his feet his work at becoming chapter october it has been some days since the split i am losing track of how many days now i think i might be wrong on todays date but how would i know we are like two tribes now warily regarding each other across a rapidly diminishing island of ox meat the others will no longer take keatss supervision on the sharing of the meat they help themselves too readily to whats there and even i can see that this store of food will be exhausted long before the snow clears keats and broken wing have attempted to forage for additional food but there is little that one can feed on during the winter what we fear now is that the others will decide not to share the oxen any longer that surely is a matter of certainty ben shuddered with the cold seeping relentlessly through his poncho seeping into and tightening his fingers so that it made holding his pen difficult we are posting our own guards now as much to keep an eye on the others as to keep an eye on the woods i share the early watch this morning with mr hussein he studied the stocky brownskinned man standing next to him and staring out into the featureless misty grey before them ben found him to be an interesting man from an exotic world far away through the still early hours of the morning they had talked in quiet whispers as long a conversation as ben had yet had with the man hussein told him how he and his family had travelled here from persia to discover for themselves this new world they had come he said because several years ago hussein had read a book about the war with the british and had read a translation of the declaration of independence in arabic the words had proven so powerful and so moving to him that he resolved then and there to sell his businesses and home gather his family and come to this faraway place that promised freedom and tolerance for all regardless of creed or colour ben was curious about husseins faith it was a religion of which he knew precious little hussein had shown him a small beautifully decorated book his quran and told him of the articles of faith the pillars of islam listening to the man describe his faith it occurred to him how practical it sounded compared with the doom and gloom of sermons hed heard from so many school chapels that harked back to a medieval past of bloodshed and brimstone depictions of hell and demons and raging fires stoked to sear the souls of those not worthy enough of gods dominion by contrast mr husseins description of his faith sounded refreshingly forgiving peaceful tolerant perhaps the thing he was most taken aback by was the profound elevation of women as almost sacred to be protected and revered ben closed his journal and tucked it away into his satchel tell me do you believe the devil is out there he asked quietly husseins eyes remained on the wall of mist as he considered the question my book tell of many evil the most evil is shaitan but i believe is much more evil is more haram in hearts of men he replied talking quietly he turned to look at ben and you ben looked out at the mist managing only to detect the faint outlines of the tree tops surrounding them i dont believe in such things mr hussein the image of hearsts gutted suspended body flickered across his mind but yes i think i believe an almost limitless evil can dwell in the hearts of men you are think is man did those thing kill woman and boy he shrugged unwilling to speak aloud the tangle of suspicions and thoughts in his head preston truly frightened him there was a chilling ruthlessness in the mans eyes on his last visit and yet he struggled to imagine the same man whod been prepared to place himself between his people and the bear being able to kill his own so brutally his own son sam and dorothy his lover none of it made sense to him i honestly dont know he replied and looked at him i cant believe in a devil i just dont but perhaps the evil we carry in our hearts if its strong if theres enough of it can take some sort of physical form ben shrugged it sounded unconvincing even as he gave words to the thought its just an idea husseins eyes narrowed as he briefly struggled to make sense of what hed said i see he nodded after a few moments considering the idea shaitan is the haram of heart of man evil in our heart ben nodded perhaps husseins eyes suddenly widened ben thought that the man had a further thought on the subject but then hussein swiftly raised his gun and pointed look he said a finger jabbing out of the camp towards the blank and pale wall of freezing mist before them ben turned to look at where he was pointing and saw absolutely nothing what is it i see moving ben scooped up his musket placed the weatherworn butt against his shoulder slipped a percussion cap in place and cocked it then he continued to study the formless mist in the direction the man was pointing are you sure he whispered yes they watched and waited in silence the only sounds ben could hear were the thumping of his heart and the fluttering rustle of his breath the mist was a deadening blanket wrapped around the woods killing every natural sound beneath its weight he only hoped the freezing moisture in the air hadnt percolated down the barrel and dampened the compacted charge of powder inside his eyes picked out nothing and then he heard the crack of a branch its brittle snap echoed through the mist beyond the edge of the clearing in amongst the trees something was moving do you see anything he whispered hussein shook his head not see nothing now he wished keats was standing alongside them charmless and vulgar with his revolting snorting and spitting but unflinchingly steady with his gun even the rancid smell of his cheap tobacco seemed vaguely reassuring he heard more movement further along to their right did you hear that hussein nodded silently somethings moving out there circling the camp he brought his gun up again shouldering the butt and continuing to search for a ghostly outline of movement beyond its long barrel directly he could pick out nothing but then his peripheral vision detected the faintest flicker of movement to the right he swung his aim in that direction and for the briefest moment thought he saw the faint silhouette of some tall lumbering tusked or horned creature moving slowly between the trees then it was gone oh my god did you see it he hissed through clenched teeth see nothing i thought i saw thought you saw what exactly damn i dont know what i saw there was another crack of a branch louder and closer much closer perhaps only a dozen yards away hussein grunted some foreign curse under his breath and his aim swung round towards where the noise had come from is near he said then ben caught an outline again a darker smudge of grey that was moving directly towards them his eyes struggled to discern the shape but it very quickly became distinct it looked vaguely crucifixlike a short vertical and a longer horizontal cross bar that drooped and flapped as if broken in several places ben lined his aim up on the thing and gently applied pressure to the trigger with a clack the hammer came down the percussion cap ignited sending a puff of acrid blue smoke and a shower of sparks towards his face a mere fraction of a second later the weapon boomed deafeningly punching his shoulder hard as it kicked upwards obscuring his target with a thick pall of powder smoke as the smoke cleared and the shot echoed off the trees around the camp he realised keats was standing right next to him holding the end of his barrel up and to one side what the old man called out a sharp challenge in the harsh percussive language ben now recognised as ute there was no immediate reply as the last tendrils of smoke from his gun drifted up and out of sight he noticed that the dark crossshaped smudge remained before him it stood perfectly still now he noticed another dark smudge to the right of it and another keats called out again and this time after a moments hesitation a reply echoed back a young mans voice with the brittle sound of fear in it there was another much longer reply from someone further away keats listened with his head cocked and then replied he turned to hussein and ben lower your guns them indians we met last week theyre comin in chapter october the paiute emerged from the mist like half a dozen ghosts ben watched the nearest of them step cautiously forward becoming gradually more defined through the thinning wisps of cold air he held a weapon in each hand a tamahakan in one a knife in the other keats barked something out and the indian stopped where he stood in the snow the other five joined him and ben noticed two of them struggling with something held between them as they drew nearer and their outline became more distinct he could see it was a body the sound of bens shot and keatss barked challenge was drawing others from around the camp he could hear the crunch of feet on snow and the smothered sound of questioning voices emerging from the mist tell the indians im a doctor i can take a look at their man muttered ben shouldering his rifle keats nodded and uttered a phrase in ute the nearest paiute to ben seemed to be the one to whom the others deferred he appeared to be no more than eighteen or nineteen a man just the others closer now he could see were a few years younger they struggled to understand keats the leader cocking his head and frowning from a few feet behind him ben heard broken wing call out sharply making the language sound far less ugly than the guide had ben pointed to the body can you tell them i can look at him broken wing nodded and spoke at length to them there was an exchange amongst the young men and then the eldest nodded the others stepped back from the body as ben warily approached he knelt down and by the wan light of early morning most of it lost behind the carpet of mist he quickly inspected it an older man much older he was dead his skin cold and clammy ben looked up at keats and broken wing dead blood congealed and sticky had flowed down out of his greystreaked hair and across his face and neck ben carefully probed the matted hair and found a jagged section of bone held by a flap of scalp and a hole a blow to the head a small penetration i suppose something like a pickaxe or he said gesturing at the tamahakan held by the nearest paiute one of those might have done this i would say he died several hours ago ask them what happened said keats to broken wing the shoshone spoke briefly and the eldest paiute spoke at length making up for the gap in their shared vocabulary with elaborate hand gestures that seemed to tell as much of the story as the words keats had told ben that ute was a universal language shared by the paiute the shoshone the ute and several other tribes west of the nevadas but they each spoke their own language a bastardised hybrid of their shared tongue consequently there was plenty of room for misunderstanding broken wing turned to keats he sssay whiteface demon it hunt he struggled to find words in english then finally relayed the rest to keats in the version of ute they seemed to share well between them the crowd was growing one huddle keatss party another prestons people warily emerging from their end and suspiciously regarding the others keats nodded digesting it all before turning to ben stroking his beard distractedly for a moment what did he say he spoke quietly for bens ears only he said somethin about a whiteface demon has been well huntin them playin with them last few days there was a ripple of disturbance amongst the gathered people as preston pushed through to the front he took one look at the body his face frozen expressionless the paiute spoke again with broken wing who translated for keats he said the whiteface demons been watchin them for the last two days and then this morning as they were spread out foraging it attacked their elder white eagle they found him already dead there was a murmuring amongst those close enough to hear what was being said ben looked up at them to see women and children their faces all radiating fear as they stared at the young indian men keats pointed to the one whod done the talking theyre afraid of the demon hes askin if well let em in prestons gaze fell on the paiute to stay amongst us a ripple of unrest stirred the crowd keats nodded theyre scared of whats out there the indian gestured with his hands the message was clear enough that ben had the gist of it before keats began translating he says they fear what is out there more than they distrust us they cant stay in this clearing said preston firmly that is out of the question keats didnt bother to translate that for the indian instead he turned to preston speaking quietly look we need em moren they need us they know how to survive in these mountains better n we do and he said nodding towards the dwindling pile of oxen carcasses what we got there aint gonna last us much longer preston glared at keats his eyes widened a damp sheen of sweat on his pale face you dont understand keats those he looked over keatss shoulder at the nearest indian there was a manic undercurrent to the way he spoke an edgy fidgeting in the way he moved those creatures cannot stay with us damned lickfingered fool theyre not a danger theyre more scared than we are preston shook his head they cannot stay not here not in this camp keats hawked spat and turned away from him fuck it theyre staying with us preston cast a glance towards ben and then to mr hussein and one or two other faces in the crowd that were not of his party and shook his head we foolishly allowed ourselves to mix freely with you to share food and comfort with you and this after god came directly to me he said thumping his chest with an open palm to me and told me i must lead my people away from the contamination of outsiders look at us now he said sweeping them all with his dark eyes my people are living cheek by jowl with papists he said directing his gaze at mcintyre and then down at ben atheists he looked at hussein and infidels he then turned to study the six indians their dark tattooed skin their heads shaven like mohawks the shrivelled and dried totems of a longago raid dangling from leather thongs making them appear grotesque and now we are to add satans gargoyles to the list prestons voice drew quiet and ragged for the benefit of keats only its not a demon out there fool its something far more frightening he smiled for you that is whatre you talkin bout preston a force you cant begin to imagine gods rage its out there now in those trees looking down upon us all your people will all die badly keats mark this warning a force you cant begin to imagine will come for these demons and rip to shreds anyone it finds with them theyre not demons keats snapped goddamn indian savages maybe but they aint no demons or gargoyles or nothing ben glanced at the paiute standing silently bewildered as they watched the heated exchange you welcome evil into your home and you become evil do you understand that both men remained silent for a moment their eyes locked on each other the guide turned his back on preston and took several steps towards the eldest indian he spoke in ute and gestured and the indian replied but bens attention remained on preston who looked on in silence taut muscles working beneath his gaunt cheeks as he bit down on his anger ben wondered how much of his bottle of laudanum was left standing behind preston he noticed a small group of the mormon men amongst them vander zimmerman and hollander had brought guns and held them ready undoubtedly loaded and primed to fire this isnt good just a nod or a word from preston and he suspected every one of them would open fire on the paiute perhaps on them without a second thought of that he had no doubt and thats what prestons considering right now isnt it the exchange in ute between keats and the indian continued both of them it seemed oblivious to the growing current of tension and whatever conclusion preston was silently and very rapidly approaching zimmerman cocked the hammer on his rifle the click sounded deafening even through the deadening wisps of mist that were swirling about them keats ben shouted out automatically swinging his own gun up from the ground hussein standing beside him also armed for guard duty did likewise weyland stepped forward pulling a colt revolver from beneath his long winter coat the guide stopped turned and saw the hesitant standoff guns readied on both sides raised but not quite aimed not yet the threat of an immediate exchange of gunfire was implicit it remained just a few badly chosen words away he laughed a wheezing convivial campfire cackle that instantly made the frozen tableau look ridiculous oh dear he said grinning and shaking his head well this aint a smart way to go now is it goddamn stupid if you ask me he looked at the halfdozen rifles held ready amongst the men standing behind preston see reckon it would be you and me preston wholl be the first to get a lead shot eh dont make no sense that preston said nothing grinding his jaw in silence how bout we all lower our guns an we put this down as a little misunderstandin the men standing behind preston looked to him for a sign a word of command see we all need each other biggest thing we need to be considerin now aint no demons or monsters but this winter and makin do til spring keats turned to look out at the faint outline of the trees an whatevers out there in them woods the more eyes we have he nodded towards the paiute keepin a watch out the better for everyone right ben noticed some murmurs of agreement amongst their people but a stony silence from preston and the gathered crowd behind him keats slowly stepped forward stretching out a hand preston you know im talkin sense here them paiute can stay with us on our side an well keep it like it is aint none of my people nor these indians goin to step beyond them oxen hows that sound ben was close enough to preston to see he was trembling subtle repeated tics on his face and hands that shook gave him the air of a badly stacked lumber pile ready to tumble preston shook his head almost imperceptibly a storm is coming keats he turned away from them towards his people and spread his hands he spoke quietly to the armed men standing next to him and gently ushered them away the crowd men women and children drew away into the mist heading back towards their side of the camp the rumpling sound of boots on compacted snow slowly diminished as they faded into the grey ben thought he saw prestons tall frame lingering on in the mist as his people trooped back and thought he heard whispered words perhaps intended for his ears perhaps not he will come for you all and soon chapter thursday palo cedro california can i top your coffee up yes please she answered eyes still locked on the laptops screen and the lengthy email she was tapping out real good brew the waiter added ground the beans myself just for you irritated at her train of thought being broken she looked up and caught her breath here you go he poured a rich dark blend into the dregs of her cup she figured he was three or four years younger at a guess still at college gorgeous didnt do justice to his sculpted cheeks and warm travolta eyes beneath a floppy fringe of dark brown hair thank you she said his eyes narrowed curiously you british yeah well uh english actually he grinned god i love that roses cheeks burned caught off guard by such intimacy what what do you the way you guys say that actually thats just sooo british oh god thats embarrassing she muttered selfconsciously ill remember not to use that word again no way i love it he said you staying in town she shook her head no im just passing really where you going where im going you probably havent heard of but ive just been up to portland cool he said thats where i go to college linguistics and media rose smiled and nodded wondering what to say to that so are you like on holiday um no not really its work im doing some research yeah cool he said he glanced over his shoulder quickly look uh my shift manager would kick my ass if he heard me but are you like in town tonight she felt the colour drain from her face as she looked up at him a lean young man with the chiselled contours of a calvin kline model what is he actually hitting on me umm im she looked out at the midafternoon sky it was still several hours drive back to blue valley and whether she grabbed a motel room here or booked back into the room she had been occupying for the last fortnight it was still thirtynine bucks out of the dwindling slush fund only i know a nice bar nearby the waiter continued nice food nice place just a drink and a burger im buying i uh i really im i wasnt she stammered awkwardly dammit rose get a grip you sound like a retard the young man shrugged apologetically realising hed caught her on the hop sorry theres me diving in like that he said quietly i just fell in love with that accent when you asked for a table earlier he added taking a step back with the coffee pot in his hand i finish up here at six if you wanna go get something rose managed a composed smile ill think about it she watched him head back to the counter irritated with herself for being caught off balance and coming across as a gibbering idiot she slurped a mouthful of her coffee and sneaked a discreet glance at him gorgeous though isnt he he was but she reminded herself that she was just a frumpy plain jane and that after he got over the novelty accent and got his cookies hed be off just like every other bloke back to work girl there was an email that needed writing and sending asap what shed uncovered this morning was rich pickings very rich pickings indeed julian ive just driven back from portland oregon i got a hit on benjamin lambert you wont believe what i found okay let me do this in order so it makes sense my thinking was that if it was lambert who survived hed turn up at some point in their press hes english a posh guy an aspiring writer lets not forget a writer with one hell of a story at the back of my mind i was thinking that maybe at some point he might have taken his story to the penny press now you said you researched uk records up to the point he set sail for the americas right and then thats it according to you he vanished im guessing you let the trail go there because youve been too busy to take it any further what with shmoozing with the suits for money but heres the thing jules lamberts story continues oh boy does it continue let me give it to you as best i can make it out from the paper archives ive been rummaging through it most definitely was lambert who got out alive there may have been others but im almost certain that lambert was the rag man apparently he made it all the way to portland and stayed there for a long while a very long while it seems like he managed to recover from his traumatic experience in the mountains he settled there and made a life in portland he found god by the way which is interesting given how much of an atheist he sounds in the journal mind you perhaps its also understandable given what he went through anyway local archives show he became a lay preacher he also became something of a successful local businessman making money from property he also wrote articles from time to time in the papers some preachy stuff and become a local civic leader a councillor he married had kids and made more money the lambert family exists today as a very wealthy family they own a lot of property around portland and have a lot of money in various big companies but its all very discreet like the barclay brothers there just isnt much out there on the family you might do better than me point is ben survived and if we approach it right we might get a chance to interview some reclusive billionaire and hand over the journal to him filming his reaction of course rose nodded happy with that checked her laptop was still getting a decent wifi link and then hit send she knew julian would be jumping up and down with excitement over this she smiled pleased with her legwork up in portland it would be satisfying to show jules she could do just as well as him at trawling for facts maybe he might start thinking of her as more than the technology geek in their partnership she looked up and caught sight of the waiter gracefully weaving his way between some tables to deliver an order to a table of truckers he handed out several plates of food and tossed the men some false small talk before heading back to the counter he caught her sneaking a glance and offered her a snatched coy smile as he rounded the counter and headed into the kitchen through swing doors rose felt an uninvited tingle of excitement and a momentary stab of guilt just a burger and a beer then im heading off chapter october snow cascaded down giant feathery flakes that tumbled from the heavy sky above and settled with a whisper the afternoon was almost as dim as night the weak and lethargic sun hidden away from sight behind the surging grey blanket of cloud the gathering around the fire in the middle of the keats party camp was well attended the flames licking high pushing out an undulating envelope of warmth that embraced the small gathering the flickering light of the fire glinted in the eyes of everyone intense and wide with anxiety as they listened to the burning crack of damp wood and fir cones and considered what needed to be discussed in silence they stared at the six paiute who in turn warily stared back so their leader the olderlookin one keats gestured towards him is called somethin like three hawks thats if i was understandin him right mr bowen regarded them unhappily see ow do we know we can trust em i got a wife and little uns to worry about these ere bastards were going to do for us last time we ran into them but they didnt though said ben did they bowen curled his lip uncertainly theyll do us in our sleep take what we got and disappear just you see fact is said keats theyre here because somethin out in those trees scared em into our camp bowen maybe theyre wonderin whether they can trust us eh bowen said nothing ben looked at broken wing can you ask them whether theyve actually seen whats out there broken wing asked the question three hawks listened and then nodded and conferred quietly for a moment with the younger ones sitting either side of him mr keats can you tell us what theyre saying asked weyland dunno theyre talkin too fast wait a minute let em talk it out after a few moments it seemed some consensus was arrived at three hawks turned to broken wing and keats speaking slowly and signing at the same time none of them have seen it clearly keats translated but one of them he nodded towards one of the younger paiute said he caught a glimpse of it in the woods he was the one who found their elder white feather three hawks spoke again with broken wing keats waited until theyd finished then asked broken wing in ute what the man had said he ssssay demon large said broken wing his hands gesturing around his head isss like bone a skull offered ben broken wing nodded ya ssskull large ssskull and bonesss broken wings hands mimed protrusions all over his body like ssspines keats spoke quickly with broken wing in the shoshone dialect scowling with disbelief before he repeated what hed heard they said it is a giant three men tall yet moving silently like a spirit ben shook his head i cant believe he saw that keats waved a hand dismissively hell youre right not to damned indian folk have a habit of exaggeratin everythin ben remembered reading the journals of an explorer in africa he had made the same observation of tribes hed encountered it was not that these savages were deliberately exaggerating their tales it was simply that they didnt have an agreed metric for measuring and comparing big basically meant anything bigger than the storyteller big could mean any size and stories that passed from one teller to another had a habit of inflating keats was listening to broken wing again then when the man had finished he relayed what had been said they believe its a white mans devil a devil that came into the woods with us he looked across the clearing at the shifting silhouetted figures on the far side of the camp he believes it came from amongst the others ben nodded and muttered that i can believe keats pulled on his pipe sending up an acrid puff of tobacco smoke fact of the matter is i dont think its no demon one of them peoples gone bad in the head thats what it is i reckon not bad said ben but mad quite insane keats wiped his gnarled nose reckon youre talkin bout preston ben nodded yes maybe keats shrugged same difference could be him could be any other its one of em mormon folk what worries me most said ben is what prestons telling his people their devotion to him is fanatical weyland nodded gravely and tossed a branch on the fire they sure looked ready to use their guns today if hed told them to they would have fired of that im sure not necessarily just on these indians added ben everyone around the fire looked at him i think if thered been shooting those guns would have been turned on us just as soon as these paiute had been dealt with yup muttered mcintyre thats how it looked to me too it was quiet for a moment the crackle pop and hiss of burning twigs and cones filling the silence somethings changed in preston said ben he wondered if it would be wise to tell them that the minister had most probably been pushed over the edge by the laudanum hed helped himself to that it was his fault for allowing him enough doses to become addicted to it hes become unstable his mind is playing tricks on him the bear attack the fever hes been through the burden of leading his people i believe these things have combined to send him quite mad these indians said bowen he said they was evil demons keats shook his head preston been lookin at us different since them people was killed were all outsiders to em all evil to em including these paiute its not just about survival fear of what they thinks out there said ben its about manifest destiny preston and his people are out here for a reason what reason they werent just travelling west for a new life theyre on a mission prestons led them on what he believes is a divine mission i have to admit ive never come across religious folk as peculiar as these uttered weyland theyre mormons said mcintyre with distaste what else do you expect thats no form of christianity i recognise theyre not mormons said ben theyre something else something of prestons creation the others looked at him thats whats happening hes led them away to write a new faith a new book of god mr hussein shook his head and spoke quietly in farsi to his family whatre you saying there mr hussein asked bowen he stopped and turned to the others around the fire i say man cannot rewrite words of allah the words hung on a silence broken only by the spit and hiss of a log in the fire im not sure im happy with the idea of some madman so close to us said weyland glancing at the distant glow on the far side conjuring up his own religion from nothing keats grunted in agreement well whatever crazy hokum that prestons come up with reckon we gotta now consider them folks as somethin of a problem for us he tapped the embers of his pipe out into the fire sending up a shower of sparks them oxen lyin between us and them will be gone long before spring long before any one of us can think of makin our way out of here he locked his gaze on them all therell be fightin long before then i can assure you he looked towards three hawks and the five other young men sat with him watching the discussion dispassionately hell thats why we need these paiute folks with us cause if when the fightin comes well need every ablebodied man we got mrs mcintyre grasped her husbands hand tightly mr keats will it really come to that a fight between us and them the old mans wrinkled face softened with pity he could see the woman and the children whose arms were wrapped around her were trembling fear makes people do some terrible things maam its what folk like preston use to make the rest of us do exactly what they want ben turned and looked towards the distant flames of the other campfire and the indistinct silhouettes of people moving around it you frighten a bunch o people enough keats continued i mean really really put the fear of god into them reckon theyll do just about anythin for you if youre right mr keats said weyland then we should be asking ourselves what it is preston might ask them to do chapter thursday over utah shafts of autumn sunlight shone across the oval office dappling the thick rug with light and shade he could see it was a glorious afternoon out there on the white house lawn mr president he stirred drawing his eyes away from the explosion of rustcoloured leaves on the elms and maple trees to the dim interior of the office and matters at hand mr president his aidedecamp pressed him we need a decision shepherd looked up at him im afraid i really cant let this slide any longer can i the people need to know where we go from here mr president he nodded yes these uncertain times required a strong leader and a clear message to those who would stand in the way of gods will youve already threatened the use of the ultimate deterrent sir perhaps its time to shepherd cut in smiling to use the words of the washington post time to shit or get off the potty his aide made a face thats putting it in unnecessarily blunt terms sir there is still room for negotiation with these people shepherd shook his head no i dont believe there is what were looking at duncan is a clash of faiths these people will not listen to gods message he stood up flexing his tired and aching back and what can you do to those who continue to refuse to sit at gods table beyond the light of his love it is cold and dark and barbaric these people these nonbelievers burn in torment there duncan and they know no better sir ive extended the hand of friendship and love opened the doors of our church for them to enter what more can i do yes mr president but you understand escalating this situation now would be very dangerous theres a delicate geopolitical balance around the middle duncan he turned to him this is where faith in god comes into the equation we will have a world under his new dominion by hook or by crook mark my words he will unite us all under one faith or he will leave ashes he looked out at the carefully manicured lawn and beyond that at the gathered protestors bearing placards held at bay by a cordon of marines above the pure blue sky was dotted with helicopters and the smudge of smoke columns rising from the distant city riots now is not the time to walk away from destiny he turned round if they wont open their eyes to his love then let them feel his wrath sir well send the missiles mr president we cant do that send the missiles duncan mr president shepherd felt the warmth of the sun through the bay windows on his cheeks and closed his eyes and imagined he could hear the roar of a thousand propulsion systems stirring to life in their silos mr president mr shepherd eyes still closed he heard the rumble of the jet a steady monotonous whine and in the background the trill of somebodys cell phone several rows of seats further back one of his entourage of campaign workers mr shepherd sir im sorry to disturb you but we need to review the figures ahead of the meeting this afternoon he opened his tired eyes blinking back the glare coming in through the round window on his right duncan was leaning forward in the seat opposite im sorry but we do need to go over the projected spending again for the next six months before the meeting duncan said shepherd yes you do believe in god dont you he looked confused of course he gestured towards the other workers dotted around the seats of the commercial airliner most of them industriously tapping away on laptops or speaking animatedly on their phones everyone on this plane believes in god mr shepherd everyones behind you and if the polls really are giving us a true picture millions more every day he added with a reassuring smile shepherd nodded and smiled im sorry forgive me you helped me see his light brought me across to your ministry shepherd smiled he could see the words were coming from duncans heart ive never once looked back sir id follow you anywhere mr shepherd he smiled youre a good man duncan but uh if i can press on were looking duncan consulted his pda tapping the small screen lightly with the tip of his pen at about two hundred million dollars media spend on campaigning for the next six months thats if we want to stay in the game with the big two parties shepherd gazed wearily out of the window as his campaign manager began a tedious breakdown of fund allocations and what additional funding support they would need to secure to stay the distance but shepherds focus drifted off piste were getting a lot of support pledged from churches outside ours a broad spectrum of christian right i think both the republicans and democrats really damaged themselves through the primaries with all that backbiting and bitching between candidates duncans voice droned on ive been waiting so long for this waiting so long to find them the recorded cell phone conversation between cooke and his female associate whitely indicated they were both heading out once more into the wilds very soon shepherd needed to ensure he could find a way to locate the site nothing short of exact gps coordinates would do he knew what it was like up there in those thick woods he could be fifty yards away from those mouldering remains and quite easily never find them cooke and whitely were going to lead him straight there but only if he played his cards right were poaching a lot of support from both of them right now but thats theoretical support protest support the trick will be turning that into genuine cardcarrying support for your campaign and sustaining that loyalty through the next eighteen months shepherd realised he was going to have to find an opportunity to slip away for a few days prayer time thats what hed call it a little sojourn away from the seedy world of politics to find communion with god to seek guidance that would play well with his audience he decided hed announce that tomorrow on his next faith tv broadcast this needs to be handled so carefully his special man sent over to the united kingdom carl was doing a very thorough job as always julian cookes first business contact the bbc editor had already been dealt with effectively according to carl the bumbling british police were baffled by the motiveless stabbing and were already investigating a local suspect with a previous conviction for a similar offence and a history of violent mental illness the other contact cooke had made however might be a bit more of a problem he had more of a public profile he trusted carl to handle this intelligently in total though were going to need to chase down at least another six or seven hundred million dollars in campaign funds to take us through to the finishing line next year ive lined up several meetings this afternoon in austin mr shepherd theyre all interested in getting behind your campaign but youll need to assure them that yours is not exclusively a mormon message but a christian message that means youre going to have to equivocate a little on the abortion issue shepherd nodded absentmindedly and settled back in his chair he looked out at the patchwork of farmland a chequerboard of olive and yellow squares passing below iowa utah ohio all those bioethanolcorn states were lining up nicely he could sense that momentum was building already carrying him forward to an inevitable appointment with destiny he smiled and turned to his financial coordinator are you ready to serve your country in office duncan duncan hope looked up from his pda i think so sir he replied hesitantly adding do you think we can really do it shepherds gaunt cheeks creased with a winning television smile this is where faith in god comes into the equation my friend chapter thursday hammersmith london julian was still playing the news through his head as he let himself in through the glass doors of the small industrial unit that was soup kitchens office sean dead hed seen on the local news last night that a man had been stabbed to death whilst walking his dog on wimbledon common and like every other viewer at home he had sighed at yet another sign of the times this was the result of allowing britains troubled and tormented souls to wander the streets at will with no one supervising their care and medication then this morning hed emailed sean at his work address for an update on how things were proceeding only to get a response from a harried colleague that sean was the unfortunate man who had been attacked miranda came in for only a few hours every other day today wasnt one of them which was just as well he wasnt ready for a cheerful good morning and some bright and breezy banter he flipped on the dim overhead lights of their front office filled up the coffee maker and put it on then booted up his pc as he waited his mind raced with conflicting threads of thought on the one hand he was surprised at how shaken he was sean and he went back quite a few years and the poor bastard was leaving behind his wife and a little girl sean had been an allround good egg and now out of the blue he was gone shit like that always seemed to happen so quickly death just sneaked in and changed lives in the blink of an eye he made a mental note to order a wreath and write a few words to seans wife before he headed to heathrow tomorrow what is wrong with this evil fucking world he reluctantly pushed his mind onto other matters and felt like a mercenary bastard for doing so there was now no fasttracked contract with the bbc being steered through the decision process with sean dead the deal was dead too even if whoever replaced him finally got round to dealing with the intray and liked the sound of the project it would probably be far too late to be of any use to julian and rose money was running out and theyd both need to go scare up some other work to keep the business going he was halfway through a mental stocktake of clients they could tap for some quick tidemeover work when another unwelcome thought fluttered into his mind and settled like a crow on a telegraph pole you told sean about the find and now hes dead he shook his head oh come on and was there not a click on your phone the coffee maker burbled and steamed that it was ready and he poured himself a cup black and someone was in your flat werent they oh for fucks sake julian he muttered now really isnt the right time to start becoming a paranoid twat his old office pc finally finished choking on vista and connected to the internet to pick up his mail thirtythree spams chased each other into his inbox one after the other most promising to turn him into a sexual leviathan but there was one email that attracted his attention he clicked on it mr cooke yes i would be interested in exchanging information with you i am fascinated by the untold unheard story of the preston party it remains a profoundly interesting mystery what happened to all those people its a story that has intrigued me for many years and in all this time i have encountered no one else who has heard of it let alone is actively investigating it so it was very exciting for me to receive your email yesterday i am based in america i have business that takes me back and forth between the east and west coasts on a regular basis if you are planning a trip to the states any time soon im sure i can coordinate my travels to coincide with yours so that we can meet somewhere and discuss what we both have for my part i have more biographical detail on william preston than i have presented on the web page i look forward to hearing back from you very best arnold zuckerman julian sat back and sipped his coffee now that was something he really hadnt been expecting the web page hed stumbled on at the beginning of the week had looked like a dead site something put up by someone long ago and forgotten about perhaps it would be something of a consolation if he could tie in a meeting with this zuckerman whilst returning to pack things up it might help fill a hole in the research to julians chagrin hed been unable to come up with anything at all on preston the mans background was a gap theyd need to fill whether they made a documentary or a drama especially if as dr griffith had suggested they were looking at a psychotic cult leader who had led his people to their deaths he hastily typed a response mr zuckerman im due to fly out to the states tomorrow whilst im researching this story my base of operations is a small town called blue valley north end of california its a quiet place where people go for camping and hiking holidays these days its the nearest settlement to the site i mentioned in my previous mail a days hike from it ill be honest with you i wont reveal the exact location of the site as its a site of historical importance and it would be inappropriate for me to share that information willynilly however id be willing to share with you the story of what happened out there we have recovered a detailed account of the events a journal written by one of the party almost perfectly preserved and for the most part legible i will be in blue valley for three or four days if you wish to arrange a meeting julian cooke documentary maker chapter october it has been snowing constantly for three or four days now several feet of it has covered the old trampled snow the gutted ribcages of the oxen now lie mercifully beneath a thick carpet the remaining untouched carcasses were hauled away by prestons people at some point during the last few days as we shivered in our shelters listening to the buffeting wind they must have all been out there working in conspiratorial silence to drag them to their end of the clearing there were those in our group who suggested we march across en masse to reclaim a fair share of the meat but keats was not amongst them he advised caution i must say i agree they number more than a hundred thirty or more of them men able to wield a weapon of some sort we however including our new guests the paiute number less than a dozen who could fight we still have packing oats to eat and the indians have managed to bring in small amounts of foraged food hares a few birds some root bulbs that are barely palatable after being boiled interminably it is hardly enough without the meat i believe we will eventually starve ben looked at the ominous words he had just scribbled on the page the diluted ink was a pale blue and hard to read against the page by the flickering light of the small fire inside broken wing placed another small branch thick with fir needles on and almost immediately the fire crackled and roared to life the smoke sucked effectively up through the hole at the top by the wind gusting outside three hawks shared the warmth with them there being just enough squat room for the four of them keats worked his knife on the inside of his pipes bowl scraping away a residue that was building up and blocking the stem ben could tell he was doing his best to catch one word in ten as broken wing and three hawks talked fluently in ute but by the frustrated frown on his face was failing miserably grey hair trapper called keeet answered broken wing you travel with him yes two seasons why whitefaces pay dollars three hawks nodded he knew dollars were much better to trade with than beaver pelts grey hair is friend broken wing regarded keats silently for a while yes three hawks studied the old man his eyes drawn to his bushy salt and pepper beard and then to ben his chin framed by a dark blonde fuzz of hair why do whitefaces grow tails on their mouths broken wing shrugged the great chief gave them only to white men ah i think i know why three hawks raised his finger so they can tickle their bossy wives broken wing looked at him confused then three hawks stuck his tongue out and waggled it both indians dissolved with laughter whats so funny asked ben roused from his writing by their snorting keats shook his head some dumbass indian joke he muttered grumpily he watched them both rocking on their haunches their dark faces split with carefree schoolyard grins there was an assurance about them he envied a cool fatalism in the way they squared up to face death that he wished he could emulate they dont fear it that was something keats had told him that they didnt have a concept of death to them it was a journey just a transition to another place in their minds it was a much better place ben supposed that kind of belief could make any man brave ive not seen a single one of the others for a while now said ben snow had been coming down heavily since the paiute had arrived a heavy blizzard that had reduced visibility through the thick silent curtains of flakes to a distance of yards keats nodded i can see their fires at night theyre still there all right its been three days since weve had any kind of contact with them the guide nodded solemnly that aint so good what do you think is going on over there hell if i know maybe prestons writing his new faith his new bible sonofabitch is as mad as a mongoose ben nodded that much was for sure that kinda crazy aint what you need out in the wilds keats the guide looked up from cleaning his pipe what are we going to do the food we have wont last us until spring we sit tight for now lambert whatever killed em folk gonna come back an do it again i reckon he smiled an if its happy killin them not us i aint complainin broken wing translated for three hawks the paiute said something and broken wing nodded whats that he said asked ben three hawks sssay whiteface devil came with others will kill others as the fire settled to embers three hawks left to rejoin the paiute no doubt to exchange bemused observations on the whitefaces broken wing and keats wrapped themselves tightly in blankets and hides and were soon asleep keats with his thick and irritating nasal rumble broken wing soft and even like a woman ben lay awake troubled by what the indian had said whether a devil or as keats said craziness he knew somehow that preston was going to bring death to this clearing and he realised with certainty that there was perhaps only one way it might be prevented if he wasnt already too late that was ben stepped out into the gusting night immediately blinking back soft clotted flakes of snow blown across the ground and into his face he could hear the clatter and whack of something loose amongst their shelters being bullied by the wind and the muted roar of trees around the clearing sounding very much like a restless sea as they swayed in unison he could see virtually nothing just the next few yards in front of his feet which disappeared through the new snow down to the older compacted and icehard layer below ben oriented himself and headed for the far side stooped low and leaning into the freezing blasts tears welling in his eyes and freezing on his cheeks he decided to give the oxens graveyard a wide berth wary of tangling his feet amidst the ribcages and creating a commotion that might be heard above the restless weather he suspected they would still have a man or two on watch at night but with visibility down to little more than the stretch of an arm amidst the swirling flurry it would be for no more reason than to guard the appropriated meat shes up ahead not far ben was familiar enough with the lie of the land perhaps more so than any other person camped here having made plenty of visits across this nomansland to care for preston and emily the first of their shelters lay ahead of him a hummock of snow the entrance marked only by a corner of tarpaulin flapping noisily like a pennant beyond it another and another all looking like identical mole hills if she can talk tell them whom she saw who killed her mother and sam ben wondered if that would be enough though he had no idea for sure how tightly they were holding on to the idea that preston might be some prophet that only by his side lay salvation and the way out of this wilderness i can tell them about the laudanum the fevered confession dorothy coming to me even as he considered that he knew the odds were against him especially if there had already been suspicions voiced that he might have been responsible for killing the dreytons the thought filled him with an intense anger and revulsion there had been nothing inappropriate in his friendship with sam he had merely seen himself in the boy a younger version of himself a curious young mind questioning the world yet being suffocated inside prestons bizarre religious strictures even if he could not get emily to talk he resolved to take her away from these people perhaps if he took her with him tonight and preston arrived on their side with a posse in the morning to reclaim her he could quietly do a deal with the man it would be one less mouth for his people to feed and should she begin to talk about what she had seen better for him maybe that she be talking to outsiders instead of to his loyal flock crouching low in the snow his poncho fluttering around him he looked from one shelter to the next watching for any signs of movement he could see no one ahead of him lay the hump he recognised as the dreytons shelter he took several quick loping strides towards it kneeling down and preparing to lift aside the canvas flap he hoped to find only mrs zimmerman inside the woman had seemed just about the only one of these people he could reason with perhaps shed come with him too i thought youd return a voice hissed over the rumple of wind ben turned to see the broad and stout outline of a man whos that he whispered you know who said vander leaning forward he held a longbladed knife in one hand and you have no business here ben stood up i thought i should look in on emily william told you all of you that you are to stay to your side i know but listen perhaps i can make him see she must know who killed her family we have to try to bring her out of this shock vander didnt immediately respond and ben allowed himself to hope the short dutchman was considering that seriously shes witnessed the face of gods rage lambert you think anyone can come back from seeing that her mind is completely gone ben shook his head shes in shock vander stepped forward his knife held in front of him i see the devil in you lambert you should leave now before someone guts you like a pig its preston isnt it ben blurted what its preston who killed them he did it to convince you all that vander reached out and grabbed him angrily gods rage will be visited on you next he spat if you say that again and if not gods then mine he pushed ben away back to your side and keep your sick poison over there you have indian boys to befriend now vander listen to me this will end in all of us dying unless emily talks to us and tells us what she saw i think preston has gone insane the man reached out with frightening speed grabbed the gathered layers of clothing around bens neck and pulled him forward he could feel the tip of vanders knife pressed into one ear i could push this in and kill you just like that ben felt his bladder loosen a warm trickle that quickly cooled i could cut the tongue from your mouth lambert but he smiled id much rather watch you starve with the others he pushed ben away the storm is coming and itll wash you away like so much shit ben took a step back go vander hissed ben turned and headed back to his side of the camp wondering if vander would run along and tell preston of this incursion he could imagine preston marching over in the morning accompanied by an armed guard to make some punitive example of him there would undoubtedly be a standoff once more he wondered if it would go beyond that and turn into a bloody massacre he cursed his bad luck at being discovered by vander and wondered if hed made things worse by attempting to sneak across under the cover of night and the gusting wind therell be consequences tomorrow ben decided he was going to sleep with his gun loaded and right beside him tonight if he slept at all vander waited outside the shelter until he was sure the englishman had gone then he stooped down pushed the fluttering canvas flap aside and entered the muted warmth of emilys shelter mrs zimmerman stirred what was that i heard whispers outside it was nothing he said pulling the flap down and weighting the bottom of it with a log he knelt down beside the huddled form of the girl you can go now ill mind her she looked at him emily has not eaten again today i keep trying her with broth vander shook his head she is already dead her body just hasnt learned of that yet he shuffled to one side to allow mrs zimmerman to squeeze past go on and be with your husband tonight ill watch over her she nodded obediently and manoeuvred passed him then she stopped an expression of concern on her face youre not planning to planning to what mrs zimmerman swallowed nervously shell be all right come morning wont she thats up to the lord now isnt it she studied him uncertainly go now he said she will be fine she nodded and then after affectionately stroking emilys still face one last time she left the shelter securing the flap behind her vander sat perfectly still for a while listening to the sound of the moaning wind waiting to be sure mrs zimmerman had gone he looked at the sleeping girl awake her small oval face was just as expressionless those eyes of hers locked into an unmoving gaze that never broke or wandered well emily what did those eyes of yours see hmm enough that tongues may start wagging her breathing remained regular and quiet theres no longer a human soul there he decided looking down at her pallid skin and along the length of her huddled form covered by several thick blankets youre just an empty shell now arent you emily something that looks like a little girl but no longer is a guilty tickling urge stirred inside him an urge he had promised himself not to allow out again a promise he had also made to preston some years back not to play with the children in that way any more he lay down beside her so that his face was only inches away from hers he could feel her short breath on his cheeks at regular intervals emily dreyton he whispered her sleep remained deep and undisturbed uncle eric is here he said softly theres no harm in this just once more before i smother her preston knew about the particular interest he had in the children both eric and the late saul hearst shared different preferences of that same interest preston knew what went on on rare occasions and disapproved it wasnt spoken of provided they both kept their playing with the children discreet and out of his sight he looked down at her and knew she was going to be dead very soon preston would be none the wiser if he took his pleasure with her first he reached out and grasped the edge of the thick blankets slowly pulling them down to reveal her pale woollen dress theres no harm im just playing is all he pushed the blankets down to her booted feet and then his trembling excited hand wandered back up to the topmost button of her dress just beneath her chin and was working it open when he felt a chilled draught that sent the oil lamp beside her head guttering and spitting it went out who is that vander snarled angrily quickly withdrawing his hand there was no answer it was probably mrs zimmerman he decided having forgotten something he reached for the box of matches beside the glowing wick of the lamp and shuddered from the chill as he fumbled for a match youve let too much cold in he snapped irritably as he struck the match it flared brightly for a second throwing the snug shelter into sharp relief he turned to scowl towards mrs zimmerman only to find himself staring at two dark holes for eyes the match flickered out chapter november ben heard the very first scream from the other camp only a short while after hed noticed the grey light of dawn stealing into the womblike shelter the scream was shrill and feminine and followed shortly after by the cry of several children he grabbed his gun already carefully loaded and ready to fire something hed done quietly last night whilst the other two slept his head throbbed from weariness not certain whether hed actually managed any sleep last night or not since climbing back inside after his encounter with vander another piercing scream shook away the last of the fatigue he wrapped his poncho around his head and shoulders and struggled to push the snow away from his opening like some small rodent emerging from its burrow clambering to his feet outside he noticed the wrappedup heads of several others emerging pushing aside drifts of fresh snow as the screaming continued the six paiute had already climbed out of the shelter they had made their blades drawn keats squeezed out of the shelter and joined them what the hells goin on he muttered irritably coming from their side replied ben ben took a step up a drift of snow gaining just a few inches height as it squeaked and compacted beneath him he craned his neck to look towards where the screaming was coming from there was plenty of activity on the other side a milling crowd of men woman and children agitated pacing praying somethings happened over there uttered ben keats called out to broken wing the shoshone nodded he turned around to look for the others mcintyre weyland hussein bowen all of you come with me and bring your guns keats barked loudly they converged as they rounded the smooth nodules of white that marked the oxen boneyard below then spread out warily as they drew closer guns cocked and ready but under keatss instruction barrels aimed downward ben could hear no more screaming as they drew nearer instead there was a keening moan from several women rocking back and forth on their knees and amongst the others the frantic whispered rattle of prayer above them he had noticed from the far side of the clearing was what he presumed was a shank of meat suspended from a tree to keep it from scavenging animals keats led them forward stepping through them whats goin on he barked out loud none of them seemed to notice keats or the others their attention directed towards the carcass dangling above them as they drew closer bens eyes made sense of the gently swinging object oh my god he whispered he recognised the man despite some disfiguration of the face and dried blood caked around his mouth it was eric vander his naked body suspended from a noose strung up to the overhanging bare branch of a large dogwood tree the body swung with the creak of the rope twenty feet off the ground a blade had worked on his bowels and beneath the tangled string of intestinal cord that dangled down from his gut almost to the ground lay a small pool of blood and offal frozen solid during the night oh god help us muttered mcintyre his voice muffled through the woollen scarf wrapped around his head ben could see a blade had also been at work on the mans groin his genitals had been removed looking up at vanders face he realised where theyd been placed for christs sake someone cut him down keats shouted angrily at the muttering praying crowd mr zimmerman emerged and climbed up into the tree his boots slipping perilously on the frosted branch that stretched a couple of dozen feet over the clearing from the forests edge ben watched the man hunker down halfway along the branch and produce a knife he swiped a couple of times at the rope cinched around the branch with a crack of twine snapping the branch lurched upwards several inches freed of the dead weight as vanders body tumbled down there were cries and whimpers at the appalling sight of his stiff body buckling on impact with the ground and lolling over at an awkward angle a rigid arm pointing to the sky one leg snapped and twisted like brittle firewood by the fall the crowd drew back from it instinctively ben moved forward into the cleared space keats quickly beside him as he knelt down beside the body vanders eyes stared lifelessly back at ben wide and terrified and milky from death he leaned forward studying them closely whatre you doin lambert keats muttered the eyes i believe sometimes they can capture an image like a photograph of the last thing a victim sees really keats sounded impressed ben nodded leaning closer still something i read before i came out scotland yard police routinely photograph the eyes of the dead he studied them intently but could see nothing in the clouded iris the expression on vanders face told him more whats that stickin out of his mouth asked keats see if you can guess the guides eyebrows locked in thought for a moment then he looked down at the jagged wounds around vanders groin and nodded his own genitals in his mouth ben was wondering what the hell that meant it had to signify something surely when he heard a commotion coming from the back of the crowd he heard a womans voice shrill and sobbing it drew closer the crowd parted and he saw preston leading through a woman his arm around her narrow shoulders he saw the body and calmly turned her around so that her back was facing the ghastly sight sophia again tell these people here what you told me he said gently she nodded i i saw the angel she muttered between sobs last night i saw it ben saw eyes widen and lips move amongst the gathered faces i i was out to relieve myself i saw it her small voice crumpled into a mewling whimper preston rubbed her back encouragingly go on mrs rutherford tell them she nodded again and took a breath it it was made of bones she shook her head trembling as she struggled to recall what shed seen i ththought i was having a nightmare tall tall it was mmoving through our camp she looked up at preston and shook her head please please dont let it come for my chchildren she pleaded with her hoarse broken voice preston nodded whispered an encouragement then held her tightly for a moment before letting her step back through the crowd towards her husband the minister turned and took in the sight of vanders crumpled body contorted twisted and brittle for the briefest moment there was no reaction on his face a dull lifeless response that seemed at odds with the tender reassurance he had offered the woman a moment earlier then his face darkened and he turned to address his people another judgement on us a second judgement this is his warning preston spun round to look at ben and keats and it is you he is warning us of an uneasy murmur stirred through the gathered people like an autumn draft through dry leaves the outsiders are poisoning this place like bad water he spat angrily and here they are bringing those evil demons right into the heart of our camp he pointed to his shelter within just a few yards of our sacred place he took a step forward youve walked the devils servants his eyes and ears his scouts right up to our door dont you see what youve done he pointed at broken wing dont you see the face of the devil in his eyes broken wing defiantly returned prestons glare dont you see him looking out at us mocking us enjoying the spectacle thats enough shouted keats youve tainted us with those devilish creatures he said thrusting a finger towards the paiute standing back from the crowd that youve foolishly embraced into our camp preston gestured towards the crumpled cadaver in the snow that i fear will be the last of our warnings all the outsiders must leave this place today keats stood up dont be a fool preston you must leave before night no ones leavin here wed die without shelter and food preston strode forward until his face was only inches from keatss dont you see keats preston muttered quietly so that only keats could hear ben could see that his eyes were intense bloodshot and dilated with fear anger or excitement it was impossible to tell flecks of spittle dotted his dark beard my god dont you see im doing what i can to save you save us if you and your people stay another night youll test the lords patience too far hell come like a storm his angel will descend and rip you perhaps even us into bloody coils of flesh what goddamned angel preston ignored him my people have a mission that cannot be started with you here you have to leave for a fleeting moment his face softened and he spoke quietly im sorry but that is how it is he shook his head with regret i have been foolish and far more tolerant than i should have been your people are not welcome here any longer keatss face darkened angrily my folks have every right to winter here you cant make us leave you have to we try an make our way outta these mountains whilst winters on us well die out there preston took several steps back from them and raised his voice they must leave our side of the camp now he commanded then pointing towards the indians he added take those dark creatures with you i can no longer ask my people to tolerate them near this place mutterings of agreement rippled across the crowd and one of prestons men pushed his way to the front shouldered his rifle and aimed it squarely at keatss head ill not let you bring gods anger to my familys door mr stolz called out preston hold your fire we need no more blood spilled this morning another couple of men stepped forward each holding a rifle and from the stern expression on their faces they were prepared to use them you must return to your side and prepare to leave before god decides to make an example of you right here and now ben stood up come on keats he spoke quietly we should go the guide nodded they both backed away from vanders body and began to pick their way through the gathered crowd ben could sense the cold steely gaze of their eyes on them as they made their way through to join the rest of their group waiting in a small huddle their weapons held ready my god thought ben this is a hairtrigger away from being a massacre as they drew up beside the others the silence was broken by one of the younger paiute who suddenly began shouting ben turned to see what was going on the young man was pointing towards the gathered mormons and hurling a stream of ute at them whats he saying keats shook his head i aint getting it all too fast the indian took several threatening steps forward his tamahakan raised threateningly and pointed once again ben followed the direction of the young mans glare and saw that it was zimmerman he was addressing with another screamed release of anger i sssee you broken wing hastily translated the paiutes words out of the side of his mouth killer of lazy wolf keats shook his head and muttered to ben it was hearst shot the indian not zimmerman the boys mistaken the paiute took a dozen intimidating steps forward and then tossed his weapon into the ground the handle sticking up out of the snow he screamed in ute again lazy wolf hold no weapon he took another couple of steps forward until he stood opposite the man mr zimmerman aimed his gun stay where you are he yelled the indian understood and stopped in his tracks then he spoke loudly the gestures that came with it werent hard to decipher but then the indian finished turned round and headed back towards his tamahakan zimmerman called out what the hell did the thing say keats bit his lip i said zimmerman swung the long barrel of his musket towards keats what the hell did it say the indian said when the fighting starts he will find you and cut your heart out without hesitation the musket in zimmermans hands swung back towards the paiute and then a plume of blue smoke erupted with a deafening boom a large starshaped exit wound erupted from the top of the indians torso hurling out on to the snow tatters of deer hide skin and blood the indian staggered a foot forward reaching out for the handle of his warclub sticking up out of the snow then collapsed a second deafening boom erupted from behind ben he turned and saw three hawks with his ancient flintlock raised and a ring of gunsmoke rolling away from the tip of its fourfootlong barrel zimmerman fell backwards amidst a puff of crimson another shot rang out from amongst prestons men and a lead shot hummed between the paiute and the others like a hornet stop keats bellowed angrily bowen and weyland both discharged their weapons one shot failing to find a target the other clipping the arm of a woman she dropped to her knees and screamed in the momentary lull before another shot could be fired preston strode forward in front of his people stop this keats echoed that by turning round and knocking mcintyres barrel up in the air the gun boomed noisily and another pale blue cloud of smoke erupted to dissipate amidst a thinning strata of powdersmoke hanging above them as the peal of gunfire faded a stillness descended over both groups the woman was moaning in agony on the ground her two children whimpering pitifully by her side go now barked preston before its too late he shouted enraged ben stared down at the white snow crisscrossed with fresh and dark splatter marks now shouted preston keats turned to face the others lets go broken wing nodded echoing the command to three hawks and the other paiute they began a slow retreat across the clearing hussein and ben keeping their loaded guns ready bowen mcintyre and weyland attempting to clumsily pour powder from their horns as they walked backwards spilling it in dark trails save it you idiots muttered keats youre wastin yer powder were going to need it thought ben ben kept his eyes on preston and his men there were more of them mustering spreading out in a long line muskets being loaded the metallic clattering of ramrods and rolling lead shot filling the air shit theyre going to fire a volley at us ben counted about two dozen of them spreading out either side of their leader in a scruffy irregular line that looked chillingly like a firing squad ramrods being tucked away several of the muskets were levelled out ready to fire once more my god theyre going to fire ben cried goddamn it keep moving keats shouted turning and breaking from a steady plodding retreat into a jog keep moving most of prestons men had levelled their muskets by now and patiently awaited his say so to fire instead preston raised his hands and cupped them around his mouth be gone from this place his words echoed off the tree line around them as they retreated around the lumpy carpet of snowcovered bones in the middle of the clearing keats slowed down satisfied they were far enough away that most shots would fall wide we aint leaving folks ben turned to him but we have to keats ignored that we have work to do every man woman an child chapter thursday notting hill london dr griffith turned the hot water off and settled back in the bath enjoying the tickle of bubbles against his skin and the soothing sound of water gently sloshed by his movements echoing back off the expensive granite tiles his home was modest a nondescript terraced house in a quiet mews in a villagelike enclave a minutes walk from notting hill high street he had considered moving to something more prestigious but hed made the place comfortable over the years particularly his bathroom on which hed spent at least fifteen thousand pounds getting it exactly how he wanted it he spent a lot of time in there his asthma aggravated by the airborne particles of city life meant every day ended in a hot and steamy bath to settle his chest his inhaler resting on the soap tray at the side along with the tv remote and his cordless phone it would be fair to say this bathroom was the most used room in his home he picked up the remote and muted the small plasma tv hanging on the wall and then picked up his phone since speaking with julian earlier in the week and reading further into the journal there were some more thoughts he wanted to pass on before he got sidetracked with other things he dialled and julian answered almost immediately hi hello julian its tom listen i thought id talk with you a bit more about this story of yours you got time sure whats on your mind well ive read a little more of that journal and im increasingly certain that prestons a sticking strictly to medical terminology a monster a very dangerous individual capable of well frankly anything yeah i think were both agreed on that anyway theres something worth taking a moment to consider here whats that whose toes you might be treading on what do you mean i mean that there may be descendants of prestons who might not take too kindly to having their greatgreatgranddad portrayed as some kind of charles manson figure a serialkilling cult leader who very likely murdered his entire parish you could quite easily find yourself in some legal tangle over there on the grounds of defamation apart from anything else youll want to be careful that you define a very clear line between the church of the latter day saints and whatever preston was preaching to his people otherwise youll have them on your back pretty quickly and believe me they have money to burn on lawyers yes thats true seriously for example i would be careful in your use of the word cult in favour of the word faith there are significant implications over in the states least of all tax implications which faith groups will defend with a certain ferocity you quite often see that kind of issue being fought aggressively in court by very expensive lawyers on behalf of the church of scientology yes i can do without that kind of hassle something else what just something i was theorising about in a column recently go on that sociopathic tendencies are a darwinian strong suit meaning meaning its very likely a hereditary handmedown like being lefthanded artistically inclined having a musical ear tom reached for his inhaler and took a wheezy pull before continuing anyway the point i want to make is this just be careful what sort of people you piss off over there with your story okay well its not like weve had any real luck digging up anything on preston he remains something of an enigma ive certainly not got any greatgreatgrandchildren lined up to do a doorstep interview tom nodded well thats probably for the best you might end up getting a bloody nose julian laughed so youre heading back to the us tomorrow yes okay have a good flight and say hi to rose for me i will oh julian by the way im away for a couple of weeks my agents flogging overseas rights to some european publishers so ill be part of the dog and pony show meetandgreet then some talks some signings but well hook up again when you get back yes for sure because whether you manage to put a production together or not id dearly love to work with you on this as a book we could coauthor if you like or you write and ill consult whatever want to talk about that downstream yeah sounds good excellent happy flying then ill speak to you soon thanks speak soon tom disconnected and placed his cordless phone back on the soap shelf then settled back in the bath yes a book he muttered to himself his deep voice resonating off the granite tiles and around the bathroom he was reaching for the tv remote when he heard a noise from downstairs chapter thursday notting hill london it was a soft clack he froze for a moment then realised that it was probably the wind playing with the letterbox flap outside through the top unfrosted panel of his bathroom window he could see the tip of the solitary withered and miserablelooking innercity poplar that grew outside the back of next doors house uplit by the amber glow of street lights swaying gently he watched it gently undulating from side to side and listened to the pleasing tinkle of a wind chime he left the tv muted not that he was the twitchy sort but there had been several burglaries along their culdesac in recent months in any case it was relaxing listening to the hiss of a breeze through the leaves and the gentle random musical notes despite being so central in london and so close to the high street he was constantly amazed at how quiet their little piece of backstreet notting hill was in the distance a police siren wailed and a dog barked in reply but other than that so peaceful another noise it sounded like the slightest scrape of one of his kitchen stools across the parquet floor that was all it was a nudge not a sound that could be mistaken for the central heating coming on or any of the other plethora of tickings and creakings a house will make in the night it was the sound of someone else in his house shit he felt the first cold prickle of anxiety and a quickening of his breath he reached out and took a pull on his inhaler just a kid a chav looking for something easy to swipe and run he knew from past dealings with young offenders that they were at least as frightened as the people they robbed or mugged if there was someone down there a confident boo would have him running like a startled rabbit you have exactly ten seconds to piss off before i call the police his voice boomed out of the bathroom he listened intently for the sound of trainers skidding on his waxed floor the clatter and slam of a door or window being opened and the diminishing slap of running feet outside on the pavement but he heard nothing all right screw it im calling now he bellowed again this time there was a wheezy signature to his baritone voice he picked up his cordless dialled all the nines held it to his ear waiting to hear the trill of the call ringing through but there was nothing just a rustle and crackling and then something that sounded very much like a breath being taken i can hear you up there a voice muttered out of the earpiece whuh he blurted dropping the phone onto his wet belly he heard footsteps across the downstairs hall what do you want tom called out his troubled breathing beginning to rob his voice of its natural authority the lights upstairs suddenly went out leaving the bathroom illuminated only by the flickering glow of his plasma screen some light spilled up the stairs from the kitchen and hallway lights and he thought he caught the momentary fluttering of a shadow cast up the stairway and onto the wall outside his bathroom then it darted out of sight oh fuck fuck fuck the lights downstairs went out and finally his tv winked off please take what you want and go he gasped in the darkness his eyes struggling to adjust he heard the creak of weight settling on one of the stairs oh god oh fuck look he puffed between laboured breaths my wallet is in my jacket down in the kitchen theres at least a couple of hundred pounds in there no reply theres a cash card in there too he said and sucked quickly from his inhaler the pin is one four six six he heard creaking again on the stairs and knew that was the other wonky step near the top please take what you want and go his eyes began to pick out some details around him lit by the diffused amber glow of the street light outside ive come to kill you tom a voice whispered from just outside his open bathroom door who are you tom replied not that important who i am now is it he pulled himself with some difficulty up out of the warm soapy water stay in the bath ookay play along tom play along he desperately searched his memory for someone who might have a reason to come after him like this hed contributed to the arrest and conviction of perhaps a dozen murderers in some small way but he couldnt imagine how they could have im afraid you know a little too much about things right now wwhat i i know what sorry im not here to discuss that im here to kill you what pplease i have money he stammered struggling with difficulty to find his breath if you ttell me how much then his eyes detected something shifting it was low down squat in the doorway swaying from side to side a rocking movement compulsive tom trawled his memory for the most likely criminally insane candidates there were one or two over the years whom he had written notes on interviewed but not necessarily been instrumental in putting away no revenge motive he could think of whats your worst fear the voice whispered my my worst why what why are you come on what do you fear the most i pplease dont let me guess then tom felt his lungs clench like a fist and a wave of lightheadedness caused him to sway he sat down heavily in the bath water splashed noisily out of the tub and onto the floor i hear you wheezing whispered the voice youre asthmatic arent you tom refused to answer hmm i had a cousin who was worst thing she feared was suffocating she used to have nightmares about that night after night screaming gasping oh god please no he pleaded subconsciously fumbling in the dark for his inhaler the voice laughed a dry brittle rattle that sounded sly and childlike so im afraid thats how it has to be dr thomas griffith oh god oh god oh god this can be very quick ive done it a few times before the voice laughed softly they call it waterboarding sounds like something fun doesnt it please not drowning please shhh listen i can make it easy for you ill hold you under while you breathe in that water thirty seconds of thrashing and its over the longer you hold your breath the more your body will fight it oh fuck nno or i guess you can struggle and thisll take us both a lot longer itll be harder on you tom pulled himself unsteadily up onto his knees in the bath and suddenly felt his bowels open wide above the roar of blood in his ears and the deafening rasp of air struggling through a pinhole gap in his throat he heard the tumbling of his own shit into the bath water decision time do i have to wrestle you under or are you going to lie down like a good man toms vision clouded and the world skewed sideways he toppled over into the water banging his head against the porcelain he felt the impact and saw stars warm water rolled over his face and he snorted as water ran up his nose dazed and lightheaded he was still lucid enough to instinctively pull himself back out of the water he suddenly felt a heavy weight on his broad chest holding him under through the turbulent swirling veil of bath water as his arms and legs scissored desperately he thought he could just make out the pale face of his killer he held the man under for a full five minutes after the movement had ceased enough to satisfy himself that the man was dead he nodded with satisfaction there would be little noticeable bruising on the mans body hed been careful not to hold him down under the water with his hands around the neck instead hed applied the weight of his body across the chest no telltale thumb or finger marks hed been taught by the best he fumbled in the water for the mans inhaler fished it out and then held down the dispenser button listening to the rush of medication whistling out it took a solid minute before the thing exhausted itself he then tossed it casually on the floor of the bathroom make it look natural he went downstairs flipped all the fuses back on and returned to the bathroom he studied the scene with the bright bathroom spotlights on the pools of water that had splashed out of the tub the dark clot of blood on the edge of the bath the empty inhaler tossed angrily aside he was looking at the scene of an overweight and unhealthy man whod had an asthma attack found his medication had run out panicked getting out of the bath slipped fell hit his head and drowned he smiled good enough the british police were amateur enough to read this as an unhappy accident he doubted whether the two murders would be linked anytime soon if some bright young gogetter in the cid intelligence office did eventually get round to noticing they both shared an acquaintance by the name of julian cooke it would be too late to haul him in for questioning because mr cooke was about to become a statistic another poor unfortunate illprepared trekker who had vanished in the wilderness of the sierra nevadas he unmuted the tv recessed expensively in the granite wall a news programme was on he stopped for a few seconds to watch intrigued by how differently news appeared to be presented and packaged here in the uk the british like their presenters ugly and old he was bemused by that contrasting the pair of presenters on screen with the tanned and wellgroomed young studiobrats he was used to watching back home interesting he wandered downstairs checking that hed left no telltale signs of intrusion then went back through the lounge into the kitchen to the window hed eased open out into the yard over a fence and was gone into the night chapter thursday palo cedro california rose smiled and slurped on an iced becks so im not exactly sure what forensic linguistics is it sounds impressive the young man grinned a chiselled dimple in each cheek made him look like a youthful brad pitt yeah he said its real interesting theyre just beginning to use it more in other countries the fbis been using it for years rose smiled lance the guy from the diner was goodlooking pretty smart too but already she was finding him a little on the selfabsorbed side lets talk about me me me they use it in corporate security too filtering emails for phrases and communication patterns that are suspicious he nodded his head thats where i wanna be at big dollars in corporate security fuck yeah wow she offered its really clever shit though rose he said chugging his becks from the bottle the way people communicate the choice of words they use when theyre like talking the truth and when telling a lie going through a bogus email or a fabricated suicide note when you know how it works how the brain processes stuff its so obvious he leaned forward putting his feet up on the rungs of her bar stool either side of her legs and casually planted a hand on her thigh take a faked suicide note we studied one taken from an actual real crime this husband knew his wife was cheating on him so he decided to kill her cause he was pissed about it but also because he had a big ol life insurance policy on her so one night when he had an alibi covering his ass he sneaked home and forced her to write her own suicide note before blowing her brains out with the family shotgun nice lance grinned he went out again then came home from his alibi found her body and called the police this guy nearly got away with it the police were sure they were looking at a suicide until the note was run past the feds and this is the cool bit he said nodding they didnt find any tissue fibre or prints to link to her husband the handwriting was hers of course there was nothing there they could get him on except the language she used in the note the language rose was intrigued how do you mean it wasnt suicide language uh well he said the language was like too depressed to be genuine too depressed rose shook her head er she supposedly shot herself surely depressed is exactly how shed sound in her note no see thats the common mistake most people think a person about to take their own life is miserable as shit but that isnt the case because theyve found a way through whats troubling them see theyve found a solution so its like all right now everything is you know cool i got myself a way out the solution being suicide thats right so when theyre writing the note its full of like positives its optimistic happy even he grinned that winning sexy smile of his inches away from her face and thats a genuine suicide note this husband guy forced his wife to write a doomngloom ihatethisevilworldandimgonnaenditallrightnow kind of letter he sat back and laughed dude was a dumbass thats how the feds got him she looked at him an idea germinating so youre telling me you can look at the language of a written piece of work and tell whether the writer is telling the truth or making it up sure like i say forensic linguistics is the future he took another swig planting the bottle heavily on the counter see somebody lying will use one of two or three deception strategies its just a case of spotting which strategy is being used counting the ratio of adjectives to nouns stuff like that simple when you know how it works all right then she said delving into her bag she took out a folder flipped through a dozen pages settled on one and then pulled it out would you have a look at this he looked at the sheet of paper bemused now here rose looked around the bar being early evening it was relatively quiet she imagined in a small nowhere place like this it wasnt likely to get much busier tonight yeah why not he smiled and shrugged yeah okay ill take a look at what you got if you like she passed him the sheet of paper and immediately he frowned as his eyes scanned the page what is it its transcript taken from a diary that im busy researching id love to know whether the author was writing what he saw or she looked at him whether this might be made up lance nodded just this page right if youre game for it she said smiling sweetly right take me about five minutes at a guess okay ill order us another beer whilst youre at it he asked the barman for a pen need some quiet ill be there he said pointing to an alcove away from the bar and the noisy television sitting on a shelf behind it she watched him go sit down and begin to examine the words underlining one every now and then with the pen rose felt a further twinge of guilt watching him the kid clearly thought he was going to score tonight but rose had decided at least an hour ago that this had been something of a mistake he was after a novelty notch to put on his bed that was all she had been on the point of deploying a polite exit strategy when hed moved on from regaling her about his fratboy lifestyle to discussing his course on linguistics and that had most definitely piqued her interest she turned back round to the bar and ordered another two beers as promised her attention drifted to the tv behind the bar report card was on a satirical news show that featured a couple of vaguely recognisable comedians as news anchors and in a surprising announcement this week william shepherd the mormon independent candidate from utah decided to take time out from his early campaigning to talk with his strategy team god there was a ripple of laughter that rose recognised as canned thats right steve it seems shepherds taking a rest between rounds like rocky balboa and grabbing a little coach time the image on tv changed to show the corner of a boxing ring and one of the comedians sweating and gasping with the iconic rocky bruisedandbattered makeup job a wellgroomed silver wig on his head and a bible under one arm signalled that they were spoofing shepherd into shot appeared the other comedian sporting an impossibly bushy white beard and monstrous old testament eyebrows beneath a grubby woollen hat he vigorously worked on shepherds shoulders ya gotta get out there again sheppy he barked with a grizzly philly accent them big bastardsll drop like a sack o grain if you land em one on the kisser i dunno god gasped sheppy theyre killin me out there man god held a spittoon out and sheppy spat ya gots ta hit em where it hurts sheppy ya unnerstand hit em where it hurts but wheres that god shrugged hell i dont know use ya damned brain fool dats why i gave ya people one a bell rang and sheppy disappeared out of shot god watched and winced at the sound of heavy blows being traded another bell and shepherd limped back into shot even more battered and bruised theyre big sonsofbitches god theyre kickin my ass god scratched his bristles for a moment sheeeit wan me to tag for ya sheppy nodded i gotta rest up the bell rang and god climbed through the ropes wish me luck out of shot for a few seconds there was the sound of blows being traded then a blinding flash flickered on screen followed by the sound of thunder a waft of smoke crossed in front of sheppys face god walked back into shot with smoke rising from sooty boxing gloves bunch a pussies canned laughter mixed in as the image cut back to the two comedian anchors sheeeesh steve you get god pitching on your side you just cant lose eh sright god and about two billion pledged campaign dollars the image on the screen cut to footage of shepherd talking at a rally earlier in the week camera flashes popping and strobing shepherd talked energetically flinging his hands in the air but his voice was dubbed over by one of the comedians and ah promise you good folks out there that ahm gonna have me a big ol talk with god about a bunch a things oh yeah we gonna talk about puttin things straight here in the us of a first up ahm putting god in charge of the federal reeserve maybe he can go rustle us up some real dollars stead of the paper sheeit we call money now then ahm gonna get him to do some asswhuppin over in the middle east the barman leaned across and switched channels assholes he mumbled you a fan asked rose of the show or shepherd the show usually those two guysre pretty funny but not tonight no he switched over to a sports channel that guy shepherds the only fella runnin for the job whos worth a red cent the others bunch of parasites or bleedin heart liberals dont trust either party any more she sipped her beer do you think he stands a chance i hope so hes sure as hell got my vote the barman said rose heard the muted trill of a phone coming from the other end of the bar the man excused himself and went to answer it a moment later lance joined her and reached for the beer shed got him wow she said that was bloody quick he grinned hell im in a bar with like a real sexy english lady he said i can work real quick when i have to rose smiled his clumsy fratboy smoothtalk had a certain charm so whats your verdict lance he shook his head laying the sheet of paper out on the bar and sitting down again on the stool beside her she could see words circled and underlined and a tally of something in the margin you know this is pretty gross reading he said shaking his head this something that happened a while back cos the language is a bit you know like old style rose nodded it was written about a century and a half ago his eyes widened hey thats cool so so you wanna know if the person who wrote this was writing the truth yes lance bit his lip for a moment well it aint conclusive but looking at some of the words the writer has chosen id say some of this could be made up theres words here that sort of distance the author and what we call displacement details where the writer is focusing too much on small irrelevant stuff instead of the main thing which he looked up at her would be like describing this body i guess so youre saying this might be an untruthful account of what happened hey some of it might be is what im saying thats all rose surprised herself by feeling a stab of disappointment shed read enough of lamberts journal so far to feel she somehow knew him as a person perhaps knew him better than she knew a lot of her friends back home trusted him lance placed his hand back on her thigh once more but look its just a quick assessment in a bar and shit ive had a couple of beers he shrugged casually and flashed her a mischievous smile my minds on other things here aint going to be a hundred per cent accurate you know yes she smiled i suppose youre right his hand wandered a little too far along her thigh in the wrong direction and she gently grabbed a hold of it and squeezed look uh lance she said awkwardly youre a gorgeous guy and im sure you break hearts right across the state and ive really been enjoying talking to you his friendly grin slackened a little but but she nodded i dont want to come back with you tonight she forced a rueful smile onto her lips if thats all right he sighed shit thats a kicker she guessed by the look on his perfectly chiselled face that being knocked back wasnt an experience he was too familiar with she felt the slightest pang of guilt for exploiting the boys hormones and despite lances chivalrous protest she settled the bar tab she thanked him for a lovely evening wandered out of the bar to where her car was parked and decided she was more than sober enough to drive back to blue valley all the while she was wondering about the seed of doubt the young man had inadvertently placed in her head chapter november theyll be coming for us some time today thats what keats has been saying to the others i cant help but think he is right there are some mr weyland and mr bowen who have been arguing that we should all do as preston demanded and leave immediately but keats said to do so would mean freezing to death instead of leaving we are preparing to defend ourselves keats assures us that with a small enough space to defend we could hold them off indefinitely the morning has been spent by every available hand ripping apart our sorry cluster of shelters and using the materials to build a small enclave a barricade of branches and wood ripped from what remains of our wagons which begs the question what shall we sleep in tonight the air had been thick with heavy tumbling snowflakes jostling each other on the way down throughout the morning and reducing visibility to no more than a few dozen yards it was letting up now the downfall little more than sporadic dust motes and the sky above them showed teasing glimpses of cerulean blue once more they could see to the far side of the clearing ben studied the crowd of people gathered around the other campfire and listened to the murmured chant of prayer if he could see them then surely they could see the frantic activity going on here ben was surprised they had been left alone to build a stronghold in plain sight he wondered if preston was simply being very shrewd watching them pull apart their shelters so all he had to do was wait by tomorrow morning theyd be nothing more than two dozen frozen statues inside their hastily erected barricade exposed as they now were to the elements once the sun went down they would suffer the bitter freezing night unprotected as he watched the prayer meeting finally began to dissolve as people got to their feet and groups families meandered back to their shelters for warmth many of their faces from this distance no more than pale ovals framed by tightly wrapped shawls dark beards or bundled scarves peered furtively their way he could feel their suspicion and anger wafting over the icy nomansland towards them like a toxic cloud he wondered what prestons words throughout the morning had turned them into a vengeful crowd a lynch mob behind him leaning against their frail waisthigh barricade of stacked branches and lumber he heard keats frantically barking orders to the others as they men women and even the youngest children worked industriously to finish shoring up their defences what do you see lambert keats had entrusted the watching of prestons people to ben whom he considered to be the keenest pair of eyes in their group the meetings broken up and theyre dispersing for now prestons people filtered away into their various shelters leaving a few clusters of men brandishing guns and staring back at them he scanned the men for sight of preston even now he wondered whether a lastminute dash across the empty ground between them and a plea at his feet for common sense and mercy to prevail would sway the man and allow them all to weather this ordeal together of course not his eyes finally picked out the tall slender figure of preston as the others clambered back inside for warmth and shelter he pushed his way through kneedeep drifts towards the edge of the clearing walking beneath the big cedar tree from which vander had been dangling this morning and stepped up the incline his head was lowered abstracted in thought and prayer or perhaps internal debate ben could visualise the bloodshot and dilated eyes the numerous little tics in his face and skin slick with sweat very much his last closeup recollection of the man he climbed the gentle slope and without a moments hesitation or any apparent fear for what might be out there in the woods he disappeared amidst the thick tree line of snowladen spruces where are you going ben whispered to himself ben looked down at his journal and for the first time realised how much the cold seeping into his aching hand affected his writing or perhaps it was fear of what was to come the jagged lines struggled illegibly across the page in a slant descending towards the bottom the diluted ink spreading and blotting making his words look uncontrolled like the scrawl of a child undeterred he continued his pen scratching dryly across the page guided by fingers numb and struggling to hold the pen i believe im right in thinking now that it was preston who killed the dreytons i had harboured a suspicion for a while that it might have been vander but clearly the butchers blade was not held by him preston i suspect is the kind of man who can kill with brutal efficiency and bury awful deeds behind the most compelling facade he is a powerful man powerful in his hold over those who follow him that kind of man is dangerous but what makes him a magnitude more terrifying is that he is also afraid a man like that will do anything did emily see this man carve her brother and mother to pieces like a shop butcher ben looked down at his journal at the childish marks his stiff hand was making he suspected the scribbled lines would make sense to no one else at the end of the last line the pens nib running dry had scratched a groove into the paper the last few words etched rather than written he shakily dipped his nib one last time in the diluted dregs of the inkpot now no more than a ring of dirty blue water that settled in the rim at the bottom of the pot keats is right tonight they will come for us but i believe hes wrong to think we stand a chance the pen scratched dry on the paper again he shook the pen to dislodge the last droplet held in the nib theres ink for no more thats it if none of us survive this night let it be known it was no demon in a spiritual sense that did for us just the madman william preston i am sure of it he closed the leatherbound book and placed it in the small travel trunk on the ground beside him he had dragged that out along with his other meagre possessions just before his shelter had been pulled apart for its materials from within the trunk he took out the photographic portrait of himself and his mother taken the day before he set sail for the americas for a moment he caressed the plate with his fingers sorry mother he suspected he wouldnt be bringing this book home for her to read and the times to publish after all he put the photograph back in snapped the lid shut and locked it keats called across to him you keepin a watch lambert ben stirred aware that he had momentarily abandoned his duty he turned to look across the clearing their meetings over theyve mostly headed back to their shelters he looked again at them bemused that their efforts at building a defence were not being prevented half a dozen faces watched them from afar guns at hand the snow falling this morning had disguised what they were up to the noises might have been construed as the sound of them packing up but now with an unburdened sky and clear air between them prestons men looked on they his train of thought stopped dead in its tracks disguise wheres preston keats called out but ben ignored him oh my god a disguise he recalled mrs rutherfords faltering description a description preston had clearly wanted his people to hear a description that sounded terrifying coming from the womans trembling lips made of bones lambert if you aint watchin you can give us a goddamn hand keats called impatiently as he bowen hussein and weyland pulled the remnants of a wagon chassis out of a bank of hardened snow a disguise there would be proof of it surely in that moment ben was convinced that evidence of prestons bloody guilt would be up in the hills in that place evidence everywhere bloodspattered tools clothes drips and smears over the snow screaming out his guilt as loudly as it stained darkly it was preston who had decided unequivocally that the trappers shelter be left well alone my god yes ben stood up and reached for his gun keats looked on confused lambert he didnt want to stop and explain what he was up to there wasnt time he had seen preston head into the trees and could only imagine the insane bastard was on his way up to the trappers place to ready his appearance darkness was coming soon and he could imagine preston appearing with the twilight as the avenging angel of an enraged god exhorting those frightened people of his to attack them eric vanders body would be fresh in their minds the likeness of themselves their loved ones their children superimposed on the mans contorted face i can stop this he strode quickly across the small enclosed space of their stronghold and clambered over the rear wall of their pitiful barricade keeping low as he scuttled away across the clearing to avoid being spotted by any of prestons men watching from the far side lambert keats called after him where the fuck are you goin ben reached the tree line and glanced back it appeared that his scuttling departure had gone unnoticed by the distant men keats however was shouting all manner of colourful profanities at ben for running away like a coward he looked up at the thick mesh of fir branches and the rising incline of the ground dark and forbidding in the deep shadows of such a pale and lifeless afternoon and reassured himself again therere no demons or angels out there just a madman that wasnt the comforting thought hed hoped it might be he crawled up into the tree line a few moments later the clearing behind was lost from sight and he was alone in the snowdampened silence of the wood chapter november speak to me preston whispered hoarsely he pushed through a waisthigh thicket of thorny briar that scratched at his hands as he stepped through into the small glade almost a weeks worth of snow had transformed it from a grisly butchers shop to a virginwhite sylvan idyll there remained no exposed sign of the frozen slick on the log or the violence that had been perpetrated here he walked forward across the snow resting his hand on the log and brushing aside the fresh powder until he saw the jetblack slick of dorothys blood he felt a solitary tear roll warmly down his cold sallow cheek and instinctively checked that he was alone before allowing his grief to emerge with an audible sob why dorothy his voice broke with grief why dorothy why sam he cried why do you punish me like this havent i done everything you asked of me his words faded into the stillness and remained unanswered eric and saul were not pure of heart i know that now more tears rolled down his cheeks and settled into the dark bristles of his beard but dorothy was a good woman she gave herself to you gave herself to me he wiped his face with one grubby sleeve gave me a son and a daughter both of them such good children he looked up at the grey tumbling sky i had to sacrifice them you know that i had to dorothy had doubts doubts that would have spread amongst my people and destroyed them preston sobbed overhead the startled flutter of wings from the topmost branch of a tree punctuated the silence the bird flapped noisily across the clearing and away over the trees i loved her and my children and i gave them up for you preston dropped to his knees for the first time in his entire life feeling utterly alone god has turned his back on me he closed his eyes accepting a truth that drained away the very last of his will to live any longer i am not the one he wants to spread his new gospel ive angered you somehow he whispered unspoken he sensed he knew what it was the plates those sacred plates of joseph smiths were not his to have have perhaps steal would be a better word no he cried i didnt steal them i i thought it was your will that they came to me i thought it was your wish that i take them prestons vague memory of a dark night and a deed done with the help of two other men came from another life another time the true memory had almost completely gone and had been replaced with a far more palatable one in which divine inspiration had brought to him two wayward men eric and saul carrying with them a gift from god of which they had no understanding only he had understood the true value of the book of metal plates and the small canvas sack of bones they carried and yet here it was the truth he had almost managed to hide from to forget coming back to taunt him they the three of them had stolen from god and now his angel was here nephi risen from the canvas sack and fully formed ready to implement gods wrath preston felt tears of shame and fear roll down his cheeks i im sorry i im so sorry i took those things his broken voice echoed off the silent trees around him the bones the remains of nephi had never whispered to him as hed confidently announced they would they had never risen as the angel sat with him and read to him from the plates in a language he could understand and yet impatiently preston had made a start his book of new instruction oh god forgive my arrogance he whimpered but i had to begin the work i had to my children needed guidance i thought you were steering my hand i thought he pulled a knife out of the pocket of his long coat and unsheathed it his eyes still closed he felt the cold sharp edge of the blade in his hands ive done wrong ill take my life right now if you will spare them he waited eyes closed sensing a freshening breeze on his skin the whisper of the branches stirring and knew it was the draught of something approaching i hear it he remembered a voice of wisdom from one of his many turbulent visions never look on the face of his anger or your soul is doomed for eternity his eyes remained firmly clamped shut as the breeze intensified and the trees swayed he thought he sensed the ground beneath him vibrate with the footfall of something large approaching the glade its near he heard the crack of branches splitting being pushed aside by something large and powerful all of a sudden he was certain it was there in the glade with him standing before him his eyes remained tightly shut do not look preston had no need to open his eyes though in his mind he already knew what it must look like a presence as tall and as wide as a building crackling and shimmering with the raw energy of gods rage in his mind he saw a giant skulllike head the horns the spines of bone towering over him ttake me he whispered his thin lips trembling awaiting a powerful swipe that would empty his stomach onto the ground in front of him spare the others pplease there was stillness in response he could hear only the deep panting breath of the giant apparition in front of him sensed its giant form swaying looking down on this pitiful human who thought he was pure enough in heart to channel the word of god to mankind preston could see that now it was his heart stained by arrogance that had condemned him and perhaps condemned his people too he wondered if the angel had hesitated like this before emptying saul before gutting eric whether it had listened dispassionately to their tremulous pleas for forgiveness before finally cruelly ripping them apart preston realised poor emilys eyes must have been open in this glade shed seen this apparition and in that moment was eternally doomed her mind emptied by the horror of it leaving behind the breathing carcass they had been tending this last week my god poor girl a violent and messy death right now would be preferable to that an eternity of torment to a moment of agony seeing his insides steaming on the snow beside him as his consciousness ebbed away this death certainly no more than seconds away was going to be a hard death but infinitely preferable to the fate his daughter had suffered poor poor emily end my life he whispered its worth nothing he sensed it moving around him from the front to his right then behind circling studying him silently he felt the vibration of its steps through the ground the monstrous weight shifting from one foot to the other and the energy radiating from it heat trickled down his thighs and preston realised that his shame was complete lord im ready to die a gust of wind swept through the branches above with a hiss the leaves and firneedles rustling in tacit agreement he heard the angel shift heavily in front of him felt the warm blast of breath on his face and smelled the sulphurous fetid odour of death sspare them pplease his own breath hissed past trembling lips it was silent except for the deep rumbling panting breath then he heard the angel deep inside his head in a dark corner a quiet whispered voice prove yourself kill the outsiders kill them all chapter friday heathrow airport im boarding now i think julian cocked his head and listened to the repeated announcement for a moment amidst the garbled words he thought he detected his flight number and the phrase now boarding there was movement from around the departure lounge and almost instantly the beginnings of a queue formed in front of the boarding gate yeah this is my flight youll meet me at reno rose sounded tired yup she mumbled okay then ill see you later on today he replied then as an afterthought weve got a lot to talk about it was a probing throwaway comment of course there was much to talk about and not all of it would be about work sure she replied in a noncommittal way be good to have you back she said they said goodbye in the same professionally familiar way that they always had before before the other night of course friendly and laissezfaire as always he got up grabbed his bag and ambled towards the growing illdefined meandering queue in front of the gate pondering that last comment of hers good to have you back he found himself replaying that in his head and trying to analyse the tone and timbre of her voice for the slightest clue on how exactly she meant that how she felt about him he shook his head at the ridiculousness of it all saturday night in that diner theyd been mildly juiced on the beer well and truly on a high over the discovery of lamberts journal and yes theyd flirted a little thats all end of story this is getting stupid they knew each other well better perhaps than most married couples theyd worked out of each others back pockets these last few years on too many occasions wearily propping each other up with black coffee and trenchbanter as they pushed a thirtysixhour shift to rush together a lastminute edit there had been the unavoidable intimacy of shooting footage from a variety of uncomfortable places arms legs and cables tangled round each other for lack of wriggle room they had shared the exhilaration of seeing their work aired on bbc and the disappointment of sliding into the obscurity of various digital channels they had got pissed together god knows how many times swapped cds and regularly derided each others taste in music slept together in the back of a touring transit van with a sweaty teenage grunge band and cowered together at the back of an equally sweaty bnp rally not once had they ever flirted with the idea of something more until the other night that is since then hed been troubled with the notion that he felt a lot more for her than hed realised the idea scared him he enjoyed the security of the tight solitary bubble in which he had lived most of his life no one ever getting too close no one ever hurting him now here was rose the thought of folding her in his arms stooping down to kiss her feeling the tickle of her hair on his face the trembling warmth of her body pressed against his terrified him this is ridiculous we need to talk he muttered to himself a bullnecked man with a shaved head and a rooney football shirt standing to his left shot him a bemused expression uh sorry julian smiled awkwardly just talking to myself i uh do that sometimes the man shook his head and pressed forward into the shuffling queue with his boarding pass ready julian decided enough was enough the first thing he and rose were going to discuss in the car on the way back to blue valley was whether there was something more between them and whether they wanted that or not hey julian felt a tap on his arm and turned round to see a man holding something out to him what you left this on the seat julian looked down to see the man was holding his blackberry oh bugger that was stupid he admitted and smiled dumbly as he grabbed it hey thanks for the man had already turned away in a hurry to get where he was going julian wanted to thank him for not running off with it he watched the man push his way out of the scrum just another executive drone in a dark suit nothing visible but the back of his head and his raised hand holding a boarding pass his eyes picked out an incongruous detail a faint and blurred tattoo across the back of his hand it looked very much like a foxs head odd tattoo he thought and then his mind was back again on rose he had an ideal seat across the aisle and two rows back from cooke it allowed him to keep an eye on him but remain outside cookes field of vision for the duration of the flight important fact on an eighthour flight one can get very familiar with the few faces visible between the headrests familiar enough to recognise that face for quite some time afterwards even in an entirely different context a crowded street a shopping mall on a bus or a train he studied the man cooke he preferred never to use the christian name of a target just the surname it preserved a formal distance it made a great deal of sense to maintain that distance for a target he would be required at some point to finish off he allowed himself to relax cooke was tagged now the discreet little pin hed inserted beneath the blackberrys fascia had a minute lithium battery that kept the thing quietly chirping a signal for months it was good only for a short range of a few miles depending on lineofsight intrusions but good enough for the job and perhaps not even necessary in the circumstances cooke was behaving as planned and heading where he was wanted a discreet meeting with mr shepherd in some middleofnowhere blinkandyoullmissit place called blue valley he wondered whether mr shepherd was taking an exceptional risk agreeing to meet cooke like this even under the pseudonym and a little disguise shepherds face was becoming too recognisable he closed his eyes mr shepherd knows best the man had a keen tactical mind one of the many things carl respected about him that and the courage to say the things most of the other parasites running for office this time around were too frightened to say even if this wasnt a paid job hed happily consider doing this one for free to ensure a smooth ride for his man into the white house shepherd was exactly what this ailing fuckedup country needed someone driven solely by the crackling energy of belief instead of flipflopping over the latest fickle issueoftheday poll results in many ways thought carl shepherd reminded him of kennedy a conviction politician a man ready to jump up grab the steering wheel and pull this lumbering juggernaut back on track before it was too late as far as carl was concerned the clintons and the bushes had between them fucked over his country good and proper someone fresh someone new was needed to break the backandforth grasp the two main parties had over the reins of power two different flavours of gofuckyou he smiled that was one of the favourite trashtalk sayings of his squad now who the hell had first come up with it he racked his mind sidestepping fleeting memories images hed rather not call to mind and finally it came to him steve technical sergeant st petray it was his crackedarse version of between a rock and a hard place another time another life hed left too many of those strong patriotic young men of his squad dead or dying in the shitsmelling back streets of a fucking iraqi town the name of which nobody on fox cnn or msnbc had ever needed to learn how to pronounce carl absentmindedly caressed the fading tattoo on the back of his hand the personal motif of their team a desert fox he watched cooke tucking into his inflight meal and saw in the willowy bespectacled darkhaired man across the aisle the personification of everything that was fucking well strangling his country goddamned liberal media more concerned with the rights of terrorists than the families of fallen servicemen more concerned with nielsen viewer ratings than a moral message cooke and his ilk and the kids they were brainwashing with their flashy tv programmes that peddled explicit sexual content mefirst greed and selfishness and a fastfood mulch of politically correct propaganda those fuckers were eating away at americas christian heritage they were destroying the ethos of hard work loyalty good oldfashioned love for god and ones country the american way fuckers like cooke wouldnt understand that he suspected cooke would sneer and deride that kind of quaint notion he suspected cooke didnt care a flying shit for what was right because people like him cared about only one thing themselves making money selling advertising space hitting the ratings selling sneakers nailing a prospect iding a demographic people like cooke were filthy fucking whores fuck him when shepherd gave him the nod that it was time he was going to make the bastard understand what it feels like to see everything you value chipped away he was going to make that bastard squirm before he died chapter november ben scrambled through the snow tripping and tumbling into virgin drifts that had fallen since hed last headed this way over a week ago it felt like a lifetime had passed since he and sam had stumbled upon the place along with preston and vander he was sure he was heading in the right direction though uphill and drifting to the right he passed the twisted and dying trunk of a leafless cedar a tree he had unconsciously registered on that day as theyd been foraging for firewood the greying afternoon pall beyond its splayed black branches and twigs urged him to hurry on time was running out the short day had already been showing signs of waning as hed stumbled out of the camp there was perhaps just another hour of light to make use of keep your wits about you prestons out here somewhere perhaps he was already at the hunters shelter doing what he could only guess but he was certain that was where preston was headed his mind played snapshot images of the man preparing to kill once more donning some crudely made demonic disguise to drive his people into a heightened frenzy of fear and panic ben stopped to check once more that the long barrel of his kentucky rifle wasnt plugged with snow that it was ready to fire immediately should he stumble upon preston i need to be ready for him he muttered he struggled another fifteen minutes in the direction he hoped the shelter lay and then a recognisable slope in the ground rose out of the gathering gloom he scaled it as quietly as he could dropping down to his haunches as he reached the brow and looked down into the dip towards the shelter he breathed as quietly as he could his rifle raised squinting down the barrel and fully prepared now to fire at preston on sight but there appeared to be no movement down there it was silent and still he took several cautious steps down the shallow slope towards the shelter listening intently for movement coming from within it nothing he moved across the clearing his gun trained on the ragged flap over the entrance every now and then the slightest innocent stir of movement in the woods a breeze the sloughing hiss of snow off a branch triggered a panicridden threehundredandsixtydegree whirl from him stay calm there was no sign of preston here not outside and not the slightest sound from within he was about to concede that his suspicions had been ill conceived that the mormon leader might merely have left the camp to seek solitude perhaps to pray when his eyes flagged an incongruous detail it took another second for his mind to understand what they had picked out he strode towards the shelter along the wall hanging from lumber nails was that curious assortment of skulls cleaned and bleached white by the hunters hand long ago they hung in no particular order in no particular pattern the hunters trophies a proud proclamation of his skills as a trapper and a hunter close to the wall he could see what it was that had caught his attention not so obvious across the clearing but much more so now he spotted a faint outline against the weathered wood of the wall and a single nail protruding one of the larger skulls had been removed when he tried to recall whether there had been this gap in the row the last time they had come up here to this desolate spot but his mind like everyone elses that day had been on the bodies he took a step back and felt something brittle crack beneath his feet in the muted silence the noise startled him under several inches of new snow that had drifted against the bottom of the wall the toe of his boot had found something hard and sharp ben knelt down and quickly brushed the powder aside his hand found a small pile of flecks of bone and jagged shards for a moment he wondered whether the missing skull had dropped and shattered on the ground it seemed unlikely the ground was a soft cushion of decaying needles cones and snow there was nothing more of the skull to be found he realised that someone must have had to work it loose from the nail dislodging crumbling fragments of bone wheres the rest of it he muttered quietly amidst a fluttering plume of evaporating breath you need to go inside ben looked warily up at the sky through the bare web of branches darkness was coming he had no oil lamp to illuminate his way inside if he dared go in and investigate further he decided he had better do it now before too much more of the light was gone he moved cautiously towards the entrance girding himself with a deep breath he swept the canvas flap aside the meagre daylight seeped into the exposed interior and he waited for a moment allowing his eyes to adjust before stepping down he was familiar with the layout from last time a crude workbench to his right a stack of traps rotten pelt bales and paraphernalia against the rear wall to his left the flimsy wattle and daub partition leading to the cot and the bones of the hunter his first step across the soft peaty ground found the same brittle flecks of bone that hed encountered outside he looked down and saw more jagged pieces of bone around the workbench he looked at the bench itself and saw it was dusted with more fragments whittled pieces ben fleetingly recalled visiting the cell of an asylum inmate who carved the most exquisite chess pieces from the bones of a sow donated by the kitchens every friday hamshank broth day my god he whispered he felt his scalp prickle and the hair on his neck rise as his nebulous suspicions found firmer footing here was evidence that something had been crafted in this place recently ben tried to recall how the young paiute had described what hed seen in the woods a giant head a skull with horns a body of bone and spines he looked at the workbench and the floor and could now clearly visualise preston feverishly at work by the light of a solitary oil lamp fashioning a mask from the giant skull of a bison or a stag and all the while reassuring himself over and over in the muttered voice of a man utterly insane that he was engineering gods will for the good of his people and yes he thought a mask of bone would be enough wouldnt it the mere fleeting glimpse of such a crudely fashioned mask amidst the bedevilling halflight of this forbidding place and the low visibility of a gusting snowstorm would certainly be enough to convince someone already terrified someone already believing in such things as angels and demons that something awful was in these woods there was no sign of such a thing here which he supposed could only mean that preston had already been and gone what do i do now presumably he was already on his way back to the camp he could try to pursue him and intercept him before they got back just the two of them alone in the woods one shot and this could all be over if prestons followers didnt lynch him first ben could show them the trappers hut the skull mask he could explain to them that the medicine preston had been taking had sent him mad he could tell them of the confession the elder had made which dorothy had heard and planned to tell the others he could tell them all those things and perhaps it would be enough if i hurry he emerged from the shelter with relief filling his lungs with the clear cool breeze outside he exhaled a large cloud of fetid air purging the dank coppery odour of rotting vegetation and dried blood ben cast a hurried glance towards the subtle mound across the clearing the grave of sam and dorothy lying side by side now only a faint hummock beneath the thick blanket of snow beside their graves was mr hearsts hed been laid to rest not by his own people but by keats he wished emily was standing with him right now he wished he could show her the grave that she could see both her brother and mother at rest side by side properly buried marked and prayed over instead he imagined her last vision of them was an endless loop of sudden barbaric butchery that dutifully played a performance for her time after time night after night i have to go he whispered ill save her from this madness sam and come the spring ill take her out of this place with me i promise you that chapter november as the last of the suns rays shone daggers over the tree tops and purple shadows like the claws of a giant hand grasped their way across the clearing preston emerged from the temple with his dark eyes seeming lost and far away the whispered prayers of his people quickly hushed to silence as they all looked up at him from their clasped hands the campfire crackled and spat and around them there was quiet save for the gentle hiss of shifting trees his remote disengaged manner unsettled them right now they needed to know their first elder was still empowered with certainty righteousness touched by the almighty mr stolz was the first to speak up and break the silence william what are we to do another spoke night is almost upon us and theyre still there the flickering light from their campfire reflected in the deep sockets of his eyes i entered the woods and prayed for guidance he said i was ready to die for you for god to come to me to take my life and spare yours a tear glistened on his sallow cheek i would do that for you because i love you all like my children his voice faltered i thought we had been forsaken abandoned by him abandoned by his angel nephi and left alone in this empty place with those outsiders i thought wed failed him i feared he had judged us through eric and saul and found us wanting but then it came out of the trees it came to me large and powerful he took a deep breath and smiled at them all i was with the angel across the assembled crowd he could hear the sharp intake of breath whispered amens and the keening tears of relief and joy from both men and women god is with us god has a mission for us still one of the women dropped to her knees and cried with relief there will be no vengeance wrought upon us tonight well not face erics fate nor sauls nor dorothys thank you lord mr hollander bellowed he asks of us one thing to flush away those others across from us they must be gone and when what needs to be done here is done we can finally begin work on gods beautiful message remember this well because tonight will be the night the first true faith of our lord is born and the apostasy of all the false faiths will be at an end several voices cried out and a feverish sound of lips and tongues at prayer spread across his people like the roll and hiss of a wave across a shingle beach he allowed them time to pray and give thanks before continuing there was need for that now to show god their humble gratitude when he could hear the concluding mutterings of amen uttered from the gathering gloom he spoke once more the angel confirmed what i feared we have allowed devils to gather around us like jackals they may look like people they may walk and talk like people they may bleed just like people but they are nothing more than an evil deception he shook his head the devil nearly fooled us with them didnt he with their fair skins little ones resembling sweet innocent children looking so much like we do but all along the devil was mocking us with his clues the darkskinned family the negro woman the savages from the woods the devil was laughing at our stupidity showing his presence amongst them and mocking god i heard say that the white men over there have been sharing their wives with the savages called out mr larkin several women gasped preston nodded i fear it might be true jed i too have glimpsed things at night over there gatherings around the fire the noise of cloven feet the chattering voices of evil an uneasy murmur spread amongst them i have seen preston lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper that carried loudly across the gathering i have seen the curved horns of the devil emerge from amidst their fire his head that of a goat turning towards us staring across the way at us challenging us oh lord please please be with us someone cried preston clamped his eyes shut and clasped his hands together pray now with me his voice commanded deafeningly pray with me now they chorused his words oh lord forgive us our weaknesses we see now how we have let you down we see now that those of us who died that was your warning that you are prepared to spare the rest of us we are eternally grateful that you are prepared to let us prove ourselves to you this night we are eternally grateful that we will be your first true followers of the true word of god we shall be eternally grateful tonight we make amends tonight as you ask of us so we shall obey now we will purge this place amen amen a hundred voices rumbled preston unclasped and lowered his hands breathing deeply sending tendrils of vapour out through his nose gentlemen gather your guns mothers wives sons and daughters gather what tools you can find tonight we have to cleanse this place of poison make it a sacred place so that nephi can come in from those trees out there and finally be with us amen several of them chorused together amen he replied he shook his head and lowered his voice tempering it with regret it is grim work he asks of us but necessary work none of them can remain here alive he looked up at them you understand what god is instructing us to do to kill them a woman called out yes thats correct to kill all those agents of satan go now get your guns and return here prestons people rose swiftly and disbanded in different directions a hustle of activity of boots crunching on compacted snow chapter friday reno nevada rose glanced across at him as she overtook a sluggish container truck on the interstate i still cant believe seans dead yeah apparently he was stabbed by some careinthecommunity type while he was walking his dog thats awful she said shaking her head my god poor sean she hadnt seen him in the last year and a half since hed worked with them on preparing to air uncommon people hed almost been another member of the team providing them with guidance on what they could get away with airing and what they couldnt nowheres safe in london these days is it sometimes feels that way if it isnt someone who should be on meds its a pissedoff hoodie carrying a shank it depresses the hell out of me she looked across at him but thats so creepy isnt it what you met him then a couple of days later hes dead he puffed air creepy and bloody awful i still cant quite believe it either his fingers drummed on the dashboard they sat in silence for a while both uncertain what to say next thisll sound shitty rose but it needs to be said what i was relying on sean to fasttrack a deal thats not going to happen now youre right it does sound shitty well sorry thats the way it is as im sure youve worked out were going to have to pull out of this story for now and head back home i suspected as much she replied how much is left in the bank account its not good just under four thousand great ill get my agent to pull in some work well do some crappy corporate stuff and then head back out here again in a few months time how does that sound i dont suppose

well need to check out of the motel and head back what guy what julian looked at her you got the mail she shook her head oh its no big deal some guy who has an interest in preston i hit upon his

grumbled i couldve done with a liein cant we start off a little later lets not forget shes doing us the favour jules fair point they drove on in silence for a while long enough that rose suspected from julians awkward shuffling that he was on the cusp of raising a particular awkward subject hows the good dr griffith she asked julian smiled looking well doing well he sends his best he thinks highly of you as he should actually julian uttered pulling out his cell phone i tried him earlier but hes not answering he checked his log not called back was he interested in the preston story very perhaps theres something we can do with him thats a followup meeting we can have when we get back hes putting some money in julian made a face not sure maybe more likely hed want in on a book of some sort great rose wilted well thats me cut out of the loop then he turned to her not at all rose not at all we discovered this as a team anything that comes from it we share i promise you that he paused and she knew he was putting together some thoughts theres too much weve shared too much between us that id cut you out like that too much between us she wondered what julian meant by that they both spoke at the same time julian i did we nearly she felt her cheeks flush in the deafening silence that followed julian shuffled uncomfortably something almost happened between us or am i misremembering and making a fool of myself no she snapped quickly nothing almost happened we had a few beers and we were buzzed on the story just having a laugh as we always do yeah he nodded looking out of the window at the passing peaks carpeted with a veil of dark green firs and dotted here and there with cedars and oaks turning a rich burning autumn gold against the october sky was there a hint of disappointment in his voice or was she reaching that wasnt disappointment that was relief she knew julian was the kind of guy who didnt like anyone getting too close to him that awkward little moment back in the diner last week had most probably frightened him back inside his reinforced shell nearly four years working together building a trust a tight friendship a robust partnership and shed nearly blown it all because for a moment shed let her guard down and shown him how she felt she sighed it had been a stupid moment a stupid impulse and she ground her teeth angry with herself chapter november ben tumbled over a root and fell to his knees in the snow shit he cursed quickly picking himself up and pressing on dammit he cursed again he stumbled downhill towards the camp through the tightly packed fir trees coarse pine needles whipping and scratching his face as he pushed his way along by the last fading grey twilight hed found no freshly disturbed snow no sign of preston his hope of coming across the man alone had not happened if he had he wondered if hed have been able to shoot him in cold blood perhaps but now it looked as though he was going to arrive back at the camp with nothing to show with only an unsubstantiated accusation to make ben had no idea as yet what he would do when he emerged into the clearing no plan at all perhaps if he threw his gun down and crossed the clearing with his hands raised high they might let him approach them without shooting him down and what if preston is there amongst them you think hes going to let you talk for long i have to try he gasped under his breath if he was right if this was prestons work if preston did have some crudely fashioned devilish disguise and it was not being kept in the trappers shelter then perhaps it was stowed in the temple perhaps even stowed in that metal chest the man kept behind his cot all of a sudden that seemed a certainty to him in that chest he was sure to find something that would expose preston a bloodstained knife a gorespattered mask of bone something he wondered if there might be a way to creep around the edge of the clearing to await a moment of distraction and steal inside the temple hoping to remain undiscovered long enough to wrench the chest open and pull something out that would bring everyone immediately to their senses it was a pitiful plan but short of running away into the woods alone and freezing to death or joining keats in some futile last stand he could think of nothing else to do he caught a glimpse of light through the trees the flickering orange of a flame keats had built a large pyre in the middle of their blockade to provide enough illumination that theyd clearly be able to see anyone coming for them the pyre it seemed had now been lit and was already burning well it was then that he heard the first echoing crack of gunfire oh god no he gasped its started already he watched lambert struggling past wheezing and panting staggering through the branches and drifts of snow making enough noise to awaken even the hibernating creatures of the woods squatting in the branches he watched the man pass beneath him towards the camp whimpering and muttering to himself youre too late benjamin lambert this man will try to stop them the voice whispered to him from a dark corner of his mind he didnt mind the voice being there in his head with him it was comforting in a way it knew just what to do this man might stop it kill him its too late now theyre all going to kill each other he watched lambert stagger blindly forward through the undergrowth and low branches towards the peeling echo of an opening salvo of gunfire and the distant undulating twinkle of firelight the angel was right of course lambert might yet put an end to this before it got going the angel always offered the best advice the best guidance a voice to listen to and learn from alone his own anger would have been the end of him the angel had helped him channel the energy of his rage very cleverly ingeniously it had become fun watching the fear and paranoia eat into those people watching the elders become like frightened children and preston descend into madness he smiled beneath the mask listening to vander beg whimper and squeal like a pig had been the most fun of all kill him he dropped down from the tree into the snow he was hesitant to follow the angels whispered instruction lambert was further away now making better speed through the thinning trees drawing closer to the clearing he is getting away from us he found an inner reserve to dare to confront the angel i wish for him to get away the bones stirred uneasily and for a moment he thought he felt the warm smoulder of disapproval burning through the canvas sack to touch and scorch his skin the warmth intensified for a moment then the sensation quickly faded perhaps he is a good man they watched him stagger out of view wading through kneedeep snow calling out desperately to those in the clearing to cease but the crackle of gunfire had intensified and there was a growing cacophony of voices coming from the clearing some taunting some pleading some screaming men women and children all joining in a chorus of chaos i want to get closer so that we can see the voice was silent in agreement he stood up spines of bone clinking softly against each other then he stepped forward and followed with quiet lithe grace in lamberts tracks tonight the one we both want will die yes i want his death to be worse than that of the others i hate him then we should be closer chapter friday blue valley california julian checked the email on his blackberry to remind himself of the agreed time as he stepped inside it was as he thought four pm he looked around angels muffin house a small and cosy teahouse with lace doilies chequered tablecloths and a faux brass oil lamp adorning each table several small windows with net curtains allowed in some of the dull pallor of late afternoon but it was dim enough inside that he needed a moment for his outdoor eyes to adjust it appeared to be deserted not a single customer not that that surprised him like the rest of this quaint little holidayseason town he imagined angels muffin house bustled with trade in the summer but tumbleweed rolled through it the rest of the year it was a wellchosen spot for a discreet meeting this had been arnold zuckermans emailed suggestion julian hadnt noticed this cake shop tucked away off blue valleys one quiet high street the guys visited this town before then julian was busy wondering why the proprietor of angels would bother to keep it open like this when he spotted movement in a dimly lit corner he noticed a middleaged man sitting alone at a table selfconsciously he wove his way past several tidily laid tables towards him arnold he asked holding out a hand yes the man replied with a warm smile and a rich deep vaguely familiar voice mr cooke julian nodded and they shook hands formally please the man said pull up a seat i ordered us a pot of earl grey and some deliciouslooking cinnamon muffins he spoke with the warm oldworld charm of a storekeeper very appealing and welcoming in a comeandjoinmebythefiremboy kind of way julian sat down and the man poured tea into his cup from the pot you flew in from britain today he asked julian nodded into denver earlier this morning you must be tired julian added milk and spooned in some sugar yes i am a bit an awkward silence passed between them as julian decided how to open up the discussion look said the man this is a bit awkward im not particularly good at playing games with people mr cooke i lie very badly which believe me is a real handicap in the line of work ive chosen im afraid im not who i said i was julian looked up at him the man smiled a little guiltily you might recognise me or you might not depends how well youve been following the news lately julian realised he knew the face from somewhere distinguished in the way a mature character actor might be in the news yes he replied now you say it i think i have seen you on tv the man sighed and his smile widened i suspect you probably have its getting harder and harder these days to find a quiet corner where i can be myself im sorry he shook his head dont be i should apologise for not being on the level with you mr cooke okay arnold zuckerman is an alias julian smiled i thought it sounded like a badly madeup name yes the man acknowledged with a soft laugh if i place a cap on my head and a pair of glasses on my nose and try a change of clothes i can still just about walk up a street without being accosted by someone but he sipped his tea not for much longer i imagine julian looked at him intently trying to place this mans face in the right context he remembered seeing that face recently as a still image a picture on the front of a magaz then it came to him oh shit he whispered youre youre the independent candidate uh shepperton he nodded william shepherd julians jaw dropped open oh my god shepherd laughed not quite im just a parttime lay preacher julian grinned there was a warm disarming familiarity to the man which he found quite charming im sitting across the table from a man who may well be the next president of the united states shepherd noticed julians sudden stiffness relax he laughed warmly and please call me william you know despite being demonised or lionised depending on which news network you want to watch im just a tired old guy trying to muddle through one day after the next and do whats right for my country you seem to be doing well though its still early days theres another whole year of campaigning to go theres a lot of work to do yet to convince the american people it aint the end of the world if they go and vote a mormon into office a costly business shepherd sighed tell me about it i believe the predicted spend on political campaigning by the others is likely to top two billion dollars by the time election day rolls around im hoping to rely on the message instead of slick campaigning shepherd leaned forward and offered a sly wink you know what i think people are beginning to see through all that glossy crap these days do you think you stand a chance im making a lot of new friends he replied therere a lot of backers out there beginning to smell a good bet shepherd shrugged in any case the democrats and republicans are both looking dirty the amount of mud theyve been slinging at each other all i need do is convince middle america that voting for me wont let in the party they despise the most he waved his hand dismissively but look if youll forgive me im bored witless of discussing campaign tactics i have a man called duncan who drives me up the wall with that kind of tedium no im here because we share a fascination with a certain obscure historical character yes julian reached for a muffin he pulled it apart in his hands and picked at the hardbaked crust not hungry but needing something to fiddle with so then i suppose the obvious question from me is why your interest in this william preston character shepherd took a moment to consider the question ill level with you its not so much preston himself that im specifically interested in as you saw on my web page i managed to put together some background on the man but its what happened to the group of people that were travelling west with him that id like to learn more about so what do you know they vanished in the mountains he looked out of the window through the net curtains at the panorama of peaks towering over the small town somewhere out there shepherd turned to look at julian one of them was my greatgreatgrandfather julians eyes widened no seriously shepherd nodded my greatgreatgrandfather preston shepherd hesitated lord no it was a young man would his name have been lambert yes replied shepherd his turn to look astonished yes it was how on earth would you know that he asked his deep voice dropping to a whisper julian wondered how much of the truth he wanted to pay out to this man he decided there was no harm in giving him a little bit more for free we discovered what happened to those people we found where they ended up oh my shepherds deep eyes widened julian smiled better still we found the journal of one benjamin lambert a very detailed account of what happened out there shepherd gasped thats an incredible discovery julian nodded yes yes it is shepherd spread his hands and would you tell me what happened to them julian sipped his tea silently how much do i give this guy for free well this is a little awkward mr shepherd william william im sitting on a historical tale i believe to be worth a lot of money julian sighed look im crap at talking money but shepherd smiled but youre a journalist youve worked hard to unearth the details and youre not that keen on giving it all away for nothing i can understand that yeah thats about it julian shrugged except now theres something of a topical link into this story eh shepherd added with a wry smile you could say that julian remained pokerfaced but his mind was racing to catch up with the situation more information on this man was coming to him bits and pieces hed unintentionally picked up from the background noise of daily news william shepherd the independent mormon candidate from utah the preacher the businessman the voice of common sense broadcast twice a week to tens of millions of the faithful and a voice that broadly appealed to christians from many other churches the one and only candidate untainted by corruption and sleaze and the guy who all of a sudden in recent weeks had started looking like a real contender i imagine your concern is how your greatgreatgrandfather conducted himself shepherd nodded id be lying if i said it wasnt a concern in this ridiculous business we call politics public perception is everything he sighed if my greatgreatgrandfather went and ate someone in order to survive well i think my campaign manager duncan would have a hissy fit julian appreciated his candour and his sense of humour i can imagine so im sure you can see shepherd continued i have a very cynical vested interest in how my ancestor behaved he reached for the teapot and topped them both up you could imagine for instance how much mileage the republicans and the democrats would get out of something that resembled another donner party incident eh yes i can see how that would bugger things up for you shepherd looked at him anxiously raising an eyebrow and did he julian shook his head no there was no cannibalism at all shepherd closed his eyes and sighed with relief im sure you understand how important that is its such a taboo word and any kind of association with it julian understood politics is an awful game one i genuinely detest in some ways im not looking forward to the prospect that i might just win this election and have to play the political game in office for four years but im doing it because someone has to someone has to show our people that theres another way that they dont have to vote for one of two groups of corrupt sonsofbitches to be honest it might be a relief not to make it to the white house shepherd sighed and laughed gently but dont tell my backers that eh theyre bankrolling my campaign to win and nothing less will do for them i can put your mind to rest said julian your ancestor comes across in the journal as a very good man but he said choosing his next words carefully some very twisted things happened up there really very dark unsettling stuff all of it revolved around preston ill be honest with you whilst you personally may benefit from how benjamin lambert conducted himself the mormon faith may take a hit from prestons behaviour shepherd pursed his lips deep in thought yes but i believe from the little ive been able to research on the man that he abandoned the church of the latter day saints to follow his own path he took his followers into a wilderness literally and spiritually julian took his glasses off and wiped them yes very much so he said lamberts description depicts a man tormented by something by horrendous visions capable of anything even murder and mutilation ive had a criminal psychologist examine the journal and without getting into a longwinded profile julian smiled edgily theres something of the charles manson about him lord really the psychologists phrase was a messianic narcissistic sociopath bit of a mouthful he smiled perhaps its just easier to say that he lost it went quite mad out there yes shepherd replied quietly his eyes focused out of the window and on the mountains so mr cooke what do you plan to do with this story i dont know i really dont i had plans for a documentary but at the moment thats not looking so good perhaps a book well said shepherd his gaze returning to the room to julian youve certainly got my attention and he added with a candid smile im a man known to have quite a bit of money perhaps we can help each other out here chapter saturday blue valley california i still cant believe you did that rose said shaking her head angrily after all the care weve taken to keep this to ourselves to keep this story under our hats and you go and invite along some guy who might be the next president of the united states she swung the hire car left onto the road leading out of town and up into the woods not only that this guys a media owner hes the godsquad version of rupert murdoch and here he is in blue valley skulking around anonymously like some sort of howard hughes doesnt his keen interest in this strike you as odd at all julian shrugged its understandable given his position think of it in a country where a blob of semen in the wrong place can get you impeached dont you think shepherd is going to be somewhat cautious about a potential ancestral skeleton in the closet he wants to stagemanage our story thats what he wants jules he wants to be sure its got a spin on it that makes him look good julian shrugged then theres not a lot he needs to do is there benjamin lambert seems to have behaved like a gent what if he wants to backpedal the mormon angle what if he wants us to gloss over preston being a psychotic nut we wont rose pursed her lips yeah she dropped a gear as the car wound its way slowly around a hairpin turn taking them up a steep singlelane road that hugged the contours of a rockstrewn gulch ive got a question for you jules what what if we find something up there that turns things around eh what if we find something that points to lambert being responsible for those killings the morning sun shone down through the tops of the douglas firs lining the side of the road dappling the windscreen with splashes of light and shade oh come on rose youre not still chewing over the rag man angle are you im considering it lambert survived we know that but he came out of those mountains a a haunted man of course he did but i mean wouldnt you be changed by that sort of an experience traumatised even i suppose its just what rose pursed her lips well what if the story was very different what do you mean what if i dont know what if lambert killed those people but simply decided to leave a fictional account behind what on the off chance it might be discovered a hundred and fifty years later very funny smartarse no on the off chance he might be rescued by some other settlers or trappers and need something to corroborate his tale julian made a face possibly come on dont you think its odd that lambert chose to write it all up in so much detail surely he would have invested more of his effort in surviving rather than writing unless of course he had something to hide he was a writer rose remember thats what he wanted to do he squinted out of the passengerside window at the flickering sunlight in some ways just like an embedded journalist in afghanistan you dont stop documenting what youre seeing hearing feeling when the bullets start flying thats when you really start she shrugged maybe they drove on in silence for a while both of them drinking in the splendour of the mountainside and the wooded valley below scenery that demanded their attention with every twist and turn of the road ten minutes later the car rounded a corner and the tarmac gave way to a potholed gravel track that the bouncy japanese suspension began to struggle with a roadside sign announced the national parks campsite was not much further but what if she abandoned the thought unfinished and unformed what if what the track curved to the right and a moment later a wooden board above them welcomed them to blue valley camp beyond they saw the parking lot two cars parked apart from each other one of them rose recognised as graces and sitting in the front she spotted her reading a paper smoking a cigarette and enjoying the warmth of her car heater the sound of tyres on gravel caught her attention and she perked up offering rose a smile as she parked their car snugly beside hers the unsinkable molly brown julian muttered under his breath waving at her as he unplugged his seat belt what never mind its just a line from a movie rose snorted geek she replied looking over her shoulder at the other car is that julian followed her gaze it was a creamcoloured lincoln navigator with shaded windows it looks like the kind of car a presidentinwaiting might drive hmm they let themselves out and joined grace on the gravel as she opened the boot of her battered jeep morning grace said rose savouring the crisp cool mountain air and exhaling a plume of steam grace squinted up at the deep blue sky it was patched with a smattering of combedout clouds painted a dazzling vanilla by the rising sun lovely mornin it is too she sucked in the air and blew it out snow shoulda come before the end of the month i reckon its more than due thats definitely a sky readying for the winter hey grace julian waved at her hey mr cooke the old woman replied with a cordial nod and a wave then shot a quick questioning glance at rose she shook her head almost imperceptibly grace shrugged so we set off now well be there midafternoon she announced pulling her backpack out of the boot of her jeep you two tourists good to go julian pointed towards the lincoln weve got someone coming along with us grace turned to look as the driver and passenger doors opened and a couple of men climbed out both hauling backpacks of camping equipment out after them i thought it was going to be just shepherd rose muttered julian pulled a face as a matter of fact so did i their feet crunched across the gravel towards them mr cooke shepherd called out i should have mentioned that id have company with me he closed the gap between them this is agent barns i recently qualified for a free fed of my own apparently when you hit a certain poll rating you automatically trigger fbi protection he grimaced at the man barns has been my shadow for the last week agent barns nodded politely to julian rose and grace and automatically produced his id for them you can call me agent barns or carl im easy with either ill try and keep out of your way just keeping an eye out for mr shepherd is all he explained matteroffactly grace studied shepherd with suspicion anyone tell you you look a lot like that guy from utah running for her words trailed away quickly as her eyes widened with growing recognition yup julian nodded hes exactly who you think he is shepherd extended his hand pleased to make your acquaintance maam her jaw fell open mr shepherd mr barns said julian this is grace simms the national parks ranger whos going to take us out and this is rose whitely my business partner and cameraman a brief exchange of clumsy handshakes filled the silence and then julian turned to grace still thrown by their guest shall we make a move then grace she stirred okay yes you folks all ready to go they nodded mr shepherd he smiled warmly ready when you are grace right then she said her voice finding its backtobusiness gruffness its about a six to eighthour hike up into the peaks from here well stop halfway for a brief rest and then press on that should get us to where we want to go by about three in the afternoon that gives us a couple of hours of daylight to set up camp she turned around and pointed to a worn footpath that led through the deserted camp site and up into the lowest apron of trees running down to the edge of the camping area were heading thisaway she barked turning round and setting off along the path at a brisk pace julian looked up it was a solid carpet of woodland as far as the eye could see topped by the purple and jagged slategrey crowns of the nearest peaks they looked deceptively close towering over them like a gathering of curious giants shepherd broke into a brisk walk swiftly catching up with grace a few moments later he had her laughing loudly the bray of her coarse voice bouncing merrily off the hillside the fed followed behind them dutifully keeping close to shepherd but not crowding him rose what was that little thing between you and grace uh what when we were getting out of the car she gave you a look i dont know what youre talking about she replied oh there was definitely a look youre getting paranoid in your old age jules julian shook his head pffft chapter november ben emerged from the trees and stumbled into the clearing illuminated by the flickering amber glow of flames in several places around the barricade erected that afternoon flames licked up from inside the tangle of branches and cannibalised lumber he saw small faggots of kindling and flaming torches being hurled onto keatss defences by prestons people stop stop it he shouted but his voice was lost amidst the sporadic crack of gunfire the chanting coming from one side and the screams of fear from the other above all of that he heard the loud roar of prestons raging voice burn them out burn out the servants of satan the evil imps the evil ones in our midst a musket fired through the flames from inside the barricade and he saw one of prestons men double over grabbing his stomach he looked back at the barricade again to see one of the paiute frantically reloading a rifle several retaliatory shots rang out from amongst the mormons he saw half a dozen billowing clouds of bluetinged smoke from the muzzle flash within and showers of sparking gunpowder erupt from amongst them the shots whistled through the smoke and flames and he heard the thwack and splinter of a shot finding wood somewhere inside the besieged enclave youll burn here and then in hell he heard a womans shrill voice in a momentary lull this has gone too far to stop surround them dont let them escape it was prestons voice his followers began to move thinning out in both directions beginning to spread out around keatss small redoubt dotted with small fires that were beginning to take hold of the dry wood and converge on each other dont let them escape preston called again this morning he had made it clear they werent welcome in this place any longer now ben realised prestons resolve had gone one step further preston wants us all dead standing where he was on the edge of the clearing he realised that they were moving swiftly towards him and would soon be close enough that one of them might stumble into him and be sure to recognise his face by the increasing brightness of the dancing firelight another couple of loud cracks signalled gunfire coming from the flaming middle both shots were aimed frantically and whistled high over their heads lancing whitehot into the night sky like shooting stars above the increasingly ferocious flames amidst the barricade the sky was filling with a host of bright embers climbing fluttering and dancing like fireflies ben slowly stepped back up the slope into the tree line aware that any sudden movement would catch someones eye once there he hunkered down behind the tall straight trunk of a spruce hidden enough for now and watched with a growing sense of horror the fate that was awaiting all the others of his party out in the clearing theyll burn to death in there or die if they try to come out god help them he whispered this is madness the barricade was almost entirely alight now a bright ring of flame whose heat he could feel on his face where he crouched in the middle the heat surely had to be unbearable scorching he could see a couple of the women mrs bowen and mrs mcintyre shielding their young ones as best they could from the searing heat scraping hardpacked snow from the ground with their hands onto the exposed blistering skin of their children then inevitably it happened a section of the barricade collapsed amidst a shower of sparks a few seconds passed during which he heard the distinct bark of keatss voice shouting a string of commands from somewhere amongst the flames then through the burning gap they emerged a vanguard of the paiute led by broken wing their handmedown muskets from another era abandoned in favour of their tamahakan now raised with savage readiness as they hurtled out towards the nearest startled members of prestons party keats and several of the other men he recognised weyland mcintyre hussein fired a volley of shots past the indians a couple of which found a target one knocking a woman to the ground the other clipping the side of a young man the paiute were almost amongst prestons people before the first crack of returning gunfire threw one of them off his feet and onto his back scrambling through the gap in the flames the rest of the party tumbled out some of the youngsters wrapped in smouldering blankets keats and the menfolk emerged last reloading rifles as they ran in the wake of their families towards the ferocious melee being spearheaded by the paiute preston was quick to respond over there stop them breaking out he heard the man bellow the mormons spread thin around the flaming redoubt began to abandon the idea of surrounding it and instead converged on where the fight was happening ben suddenly realised he was sobbing with grief his cheeks stinging from the salt of his tears rolling down his winterraw skin the screams of agony and the snarling of anger intensified he saw one of the mormon women on her knees rocking back and forth holding the still body of a teenage boy in her arms he watched as one of the mcintyre children annemarie the girl who had given emily her doll ran tearfully amidst the heaving bodies calling out for her parents she was suddenly caught by the vicious backswing of one of the indians his tamahakan caught her neck as it swung ripping a bloody chunk free before continuing its savage sweep and lodging itself in the face of a man he recognised as mr holbein one of prestons quorum annemarie dropped to her knees clutching at her throat holbein spasmed firing his musket at pointblank range ripping a jagged hole out of the back of the young paiute ben saw keats push through to join the other paiute forcing their way forward their ferocious struggle had opened a gap in the loose tangle of people standing warily back from their flickering blades he called out for the others to follow him but his voice was lost amidst the cacophony bowen mcintyre and their families had coalesced into one tight pack fighting tooth and nail back to back doing their best to fend off the lashing blows of a taunting goading circle of men and women and some of the older children ben spotted hussein and his extended family in an identical predicament a few dozen yards away he watched as stolheim one of the elders aimed a pistol and knocked husseins eldest son omar down with a pointblank shot in the chest hussein screamed with grief and swung the butt of his musket catching the old man squarely on the chin as he dropped to his knees dazed husseins meek and shy wife stepped forward and stove his head in with a mallet more of prestons folk joined the churning mass of people the swirling limbs the dancing flames the sporadic flicker of muzzle flash made the scene look like some bizarre occult square dance and preston amidst it all screaming encouragement goading his people on but no disguise not that it mattered perhaps preston realised it was no longer necessary to play the avenging angel his people were ready to do whatever he asked of them now theyre all going to die then a thought occurred to ben a promise that he felt like hed made a lifetime ago a promise to sam he looked away from the fighting towards the far end of the clearing and there he picked out the mound of the dreytons shelter emily this is gods will he felt the angel stir in a quiet corner of his mind as he watched from the edge of the clearing bloodied women wrenched out the hair of other bloodied women children punctured each other over and over with sharpened sticks the snow darkening with sodden patches of freshly spilled blood no it is prestons will the fight was beginning to wane now there were as many people squirming in pain on the ground as left standing and locked in the ugly struggle cries of anger grief pain and fear filled the night they kill in gods name like trained dogs he ignored the angel for the moment scanning the bodies the squirming wounded those still standing recognising the faces but no longer knowing them curious what people will do in his name he nodded holding on firmly to the tree branch and looking down at the scene yes a child squatted on the chest of a dead man screaming and slashing repeatedly at the face with a hunting knife leaving just a bloody chaotic pattern of fleshy ribbons there is hate in them all yes not like you i see only good in you i hope so these could never have been the chosen people why they are sick with a sin it is a poison in them it is in everything they do he was unsure what the angel meant you know the name of the sin you have had to live amongst it breathe it all of your life he nodded silently beginning to understand it is this sin that defines these people is it pride he sensed the angel approving his answer for believing themselves chosen they are guilty of pride he nodded nephi was right you were always different from them i was thats why i let you take me away from him preston his mind jumped to a certain matter pending preston you promised me him yes this you deserve his eyes picked the man out loading a rifle as he urged his people onwards three of the savages remained alive along with the guide keats they now decided the fight was up turned and fled for the trees they passed right below the branch he was crouched upon any one of them would have seen him if theyd chanced to look up preston called out to several of his people nearby dont let them escape they must all be purged from here he screamed leading the pursuit into the trees followed by half a dozen men he is yours to do with as you wish thank you chapter november ben stepped lightly between the shelters afraid that preston might have thought to station one or two of his people as guards but it seemed no one had been left behind and he wondered whether he would find emily left unsupervised lost in her trance unaware of the slaughter going on outside he made his way to the snowburied hump of the dreytons shelter and squatted beside the low entrance listening for the sound of anyone else inside it was difficult to tell against the appalling sounds coming across the clearing the hysterical cries of fighting had gone and now he could hear voices dotted around voices that were starting to wail mournfully in the growing stillness he suspected the fervour preston had whipped up prior to the fighting was at the point of being exhausted now it occurred to him that preston may well have induced such mania amongst them with the help of the medicine watered down and shared in a broth ben suspected its effect might have been enough to excite a certain tingling sense of euphoria amongst them prestons powerful exhortation would have done the rest he wondered if some of them might start drifting back towards the camp perhaps to pray he decided there was no more time to waste on caution and pushed his way through the canvas flap inside he heard a gasp and by the weak light of a candle saw the wideeyed tearstained face of mrs zimmerman beside emily her lips trembled with grief as much as surprise at his sudden intrusion she looked at him panting heavily the red rims of her eyes sore with grief preston he hes turned us all into mmurderers she whispered between sobs ben shook his head he spoke softly no not all of you mrs zimmerman she sniffed and wiped her nose this place has has become evil i can feel the devil out there it has ben looked down at emily ive come to take her away she nodded yes yes she must go with you she cant stay here he squeezed up inside the shelter and gathered the girl in his arms emily murmured something drowsily and her eyes darted anxiously around for a moment before lapsing back into a vacant torpid stare mrs zimmerman reached out and stroked the girl once more please promise me youll keep her safe she cried fresh tears streaming down her cheeks shes all i live for now i have no one family then come with me said ben help me with her she stared at him uncertainly where will you take her i have no idea all i know is we have to get away from here you should come emily needs you they could hear wailing outside tormented grief and rage tinged with madness her eyes met his uncertainly ive seen depictions of hell said ben painted by asylum inmates and great painters alike and they are what ive seen outside a distant piercing scream echoed from the woods if you stay here mrs zimmerman prestons madness will kill you and all the others one way or another you will all die hes lost his mind he placed a hand on her arm and ill need your help with her bens eyes met hers theres nothing for you here not any more she looked around still uncertain biting her lip agonising for the briefest moment then she nodded ill come we must go now ben shuffled clumsily on his knees with the girl in his arms towards the entrance he pushed the flap aside with his head and peered out the fire in the middle was now beginning to dwindle and the circular barricade had collapsed in on itself leaving a ring of glowing sparking embers and languid flames he could see silhouettes of people moving amongst the bodies he hoped it was comfort being offered to those wounded or dying but he suspected raw grief and rage was driving some to exact a cruel revenge on those not yet dead no one had drifted back towards the camp just yet he scrambled to his feet with difficulty encumbered by the dead weight of emily and loped across the space between shelters directly towards the nearest trees mrs zimmerman followed anxiously looking behind her at people she no longer recognised she caught up with ben kneeling down on the edge of the clearing waiting for her we will freeze outside tonight she whispered hoarsely well keep moving tonight that will save us from freezing by daylight tomorrow we should be far enough away to consider our other needs and make a shelter he wondered which way to head having no idea where they were in the mountains or how far away and in which direction the nearest humble outpost of civilisation lay there might be other trappers out in these woods but he realised that coming across one was unlikely they were going to have to find their own means of survival mrs zimmerman placed a hand on his arm head west mr lambert we should head west she was right he looked up at the clear night sky and made a rough calculation on where he recalled noticing the pale milky sun rise and set these last few weeks west is that way i think he said pointing across the clearing well need to move quietly round the edge of the camp are you ready she nodded come on then he whispered scooping up emily in his arms keats struggled against the gradient of the gentle upward slope winded and exhausted by the exertion of the last ten minutes the desperate handtohand fight and the ensuing escape his tortured breath came in ragged gasps and wisps of steam rose from his hot body into the cold night air he stopped for a moment to catch his breath and turned round to look back the way he had come the sky was mostly clear tonight and in between the floating islands of dark cloud the full moon shone brightly bathing the night with a quicksilver that made the snows glow almost luminescent a hunters light a hunters moon he cursed the tracks of dislodged powder snow in his wake were unmissable even without the aid of lamplight the dark spatters of blood he was leaving beside them black by the light of the moon only served to further betray the way he had come the gash down his forearm caused by the vicious swinging impact of a hoe was still bleeding but the flow of blood had slowed from a gush to a viscous trickle he needed to bandage the wound so that it wouldnt get caught on something tugged open and the bleeding renewed but he also needed to keep moving behind him some way further down the hillside he could hear someones laboured breathing the cracking of branches and twigs being pushed desperately aside someone rapidly approaching him further down the hill beyond he could see the muted flicker of lamps and flaming torches moving swiftly between the trees the sound of panting breath and the cracking of hasty strides taken carelessly was almost upon him keats hadnt time to mess with pouring powder and wadding a lead ball ready to fire he dropped his rifle and pulled out his hunting knife the panting quickly drew upon him and by the pale glare of moonlight he saw a silhouette stagger out of the darkness and cross the clear luminescent snowcovered ground between them keats sighed with relief when he recognised the outline and managed a dry and wheezy laugh broken wing he said in ute keeet you live the indian replied in english they stared in silence for a few moments both gasping hungrily for air keats pointed downhill others with you broken wing nodded one paiute brother and the whiteface with buffaloskin squaw no one else they all dead he heard weyland and the others approaching now making enough noise between them that keats found himself grimacing and wincing with each deafening snap and rustle they emerged into the moonlight weyland and a paiute carrying between them the negro girl who flopped lifelessly in their arms keats focused his attention again on the distant glimmer of torchlight he counted at least a couple of dozen flickering orange auras moving amongst the trees he watched as they halted then a few moments later began to converge a meeting my little girls hurt badly weylands soft voice broke the silence as he lay down with the girl in his arms my little darling violet they hurt you but youre going to be fine he whispered rocking her gently in his arms youre going to be fine my little angel well get you out of here out of these mountains and down down into the land we came here for he muttered his voice thick with grief the young paiute looked up at broken wing and shook his head slowly buffalo skin is dead broken wing nodded keats ripped a strip off the faded polkadot shirt beneath his deerskin jacket and tied a bandage around his arm as he studied the distant gathering of light undulating in the darkness they will come keeet announced broken wing in english for the benefit of weyland following keatss gaze he continued in ute even blind fool can follow there was some movement from down below the gathering appeared to be splitting in two one of the groups changed direction and began to diverge into a dozen pinpricks of light spreading out and covering the woods around the camp keats realised they were looking for any escapees who had decided to hide and not flee the other group delayed a while longer before starting up the slope towards them keats balled his fist theyve found our tracks weyland continued making whispered assurances to his girl promising a future that wasnt going to happen for her we have to go hissed keats the virginian ignored him whispering promises into her ear weyland he looked up at keats shes gone weyland shes dead we have to go now weyland shook his head violets tired i need to let her rest here for a while and then the girls dead he snapped aint no time to argue bout it look he said pointing downhill the glow of lights was already growing brighter and more distinct they were making better speed up the hill with the benefit of the light from their flaming torches and oil lamps showing the way why do whitefaces still come asked the paiute in ute broken wing glanced at the distant lights whiteface spirit has taken them keats placed a hand on weylands arm say goodbye to her weyland were movin along weyland nodded kissed her still mouth and held her tightly burying his face into her shoulder and rocking backwards and forwards we gotta go keats barked now broken wing uttered a clipped command to the young paiute he then punched weyland roughly in the small of his back come or you die he nodded let her head down on the snow and got to his feet this way said keats pointing uphill he turned once more to look back down behind them as they filed silently past their pursuers were getting closer beyond them he saw the muted glow of a smouldering circle the fading embers of their hastily constructed defences his assumption that the wood would be too damp to easily catch fire had been an error they should have used the day to pack what they could and leave as preston had demanded of them instead of digging in it was my mistake lambert had seen sense had seen they were doomed and left before it was too late the rest of them could have should have done the same he realised now that there was plenty worse to be frightened of in these hills than the weather mebbe them preacher types are right he muttered to himself maybe there are demons and angels a god and a devil chapter november oh no no that wont do we cant have them skulking around in these woods preston called out to the nearest of his people you hear me the men nearby nodded find them for me we cant let them slip away and then come back spread out and find them the swinging lights of dozens of oil lamps and flickering sputtering torches filled the space around them with dancing shadows as they beat multiple paths through the coarse undergrowth and pushed through thick boughs of fir needles and be careful he cautioned raising his voice above the murmur of other voices the snap of branches and the rustle and tumble of dislodged snow around him theyre evil spirits they will jump at you and cut you if they can be aware he said with a chilling certainty if you corner them they will try to confuse you whatever you do do not listen to them do not look into their eyes do not let them into your head they may look like people but theyre not preston pushed forward with renewed determination frantically scouring the ground in front of him looking for signs of a recent footfall we cannot let any escape this place must be purged the noises of movement from either side diminished as the men around him began to fan out making their own way through the thickening woods he turned to look over his shoulder and saw the familiar faces of two men following too closely in his wake pieter jacob you must spread out some more we must turning forward again the light from his lamp suddenly picked out a trail of kickedup snow crossing directly in front of him look there more tracks several people by the looks of it running together a drift of snow was disturbed and flattened to one side of the tracks someone weakened and fell perhaps stumbled we have them he smiled the three of them veered to their right following the recently made tracks taking them up the gradually increasing gradient their breathing grew more laboured as they pushed onwards and after a while the noises of the other men out combing through the trees were all but lost except for the occasional distant voice calling out a find calling to each other the tracks suddenly separated preston stopped and studied them four of them i would say three went this way and one has gone to the right pieter brumbaugh squatted down and pushed a lock of long dark hair from his square face look can you see one of the three is hurt do you see it he said pointing to a train of inkblack stains in the snow he dipped a gloved finger in one and held it close to the lamp he looked up at them invigorated by the chase his eyes wide its blood all right then you and jacob hunt them down preston said and mark my words theres trickery in them dont let them talk be quick when you find them kill them immediately theyll try to trick you get inside your head and turn you on each other do you understand both men nodded breathing hard with exhaustion fear and excitement god will be with you both now go both men set off following the larger set of tracks preston turned right to follow the one heading off on its own he watched preston hunched forward his oil lamp held aloft in one hand lighting the way ahead the man moved with the clumsiness of one unused to tracking through woods unable to find firm footing on the bumps and troughs beneath the deep snow he lacked agility he lacked grace there is no beauty in him he is as ugly on the outside as he is within my promise to you he is yours thank you he moved with effortless speed up behind the man following delicately in his wake stepping only on the compressed footsteps in the snow no crunch no noise at all and now only a dozen yards from him if you turned around you would see me preston you might even have one chance to fire your gun at me if you were quick enough he smiled this was fun he had been following the outsiders like this only a few minutes ago the indian the tall southern man and his dying negro girl listening to their ragged breathing the terror in their muted whispers to be so close as to smell the odour of fear that trailed behind them and yet remain unseen was such good sport he had to struggle not to laugh out loud with the excitement of the chase hed been close enough to kill them but the angel was wise the angel told him to use them as bait the tracks suddenly ceased preston stopped dead confused he knelt down moving the lamp closer to the ruffled folds of snow the hurried carelessly placed footsteps of one fleeing alone simply ended what he muttered to his right he noticed the thick gnarled trunk of a cedar tree he looked up at the bare branches above him each coated with undisturbed snow like icing on a layer cake except one bough directly above him the snow had been brushed off this branch where two hands must have grasped it tricky devil the angel nephi had often warned him of that the trickery of evil the games of deception that satan and his advocates played for their amusement he stood up craned his neck to look up into the dark branches above him raising his lamp as high as he could to project the dim amber light further i know youre up there he called out only one of the smaller imps one of the ones daring to masquerade as a child would have had the agility to pull itself effortlessly up into the tree like that like a monkey child he used the word though the taste of it curdled in his mouth come down this instant the trees limbs swayed with the clicking of twigs on each other in the gentle breeze child he called out again softening the cadence of his voice this time come down and i will help you eject the wickedness that has crawled inside you preston knew the lord would forgive him that small lie there was no cure for these creatures but he was a man of compassion and love he would make its death a mercifully swift one how can a man be so blind so unaware of the space around him he stood behind preston now no more than an arms reach away swaying silently and struggling to keep from laughing aloud he couldnt wait for the stupid arrogant idiot to turn round and see him you are so blind preston the tall man in front of him calling up a tree like a fool was going to die in just a few moments but before he died he wanted preston to know who it was that was going to kill him as hed managed to do with eric vander saul hearsts killing had been unprepared it had happened in the blink of an eye amidst a red rage that had clouded the moment he would have liked to have taken his time with saul to let the dirty old man understand what fear truly was for him to comprehend what a despicable creature he was but most of all to have him know for certain before he died that he would burn in the pits of hell for eternity hed had that exquisite pleasure with eric and now it was prestons turn a gentle breeze tickled his bare skin as he rose up from his hunched posture now standing straight the soft clink of bones unheard he whispered william preston spun round at the sound of the gentle hiss of his name oh my his voice froze in his throat instantly the headrush of fear and awe terror and elation left him momentarily rigid and silent his pursuit of the childimp in the tree completely dismissed from his mind preston the apparition before him hissed again quietly he dropped to his knees and looked up in stunned silent awe at the tall skeletal form standing over him love joy and elation forced a choked sob from his throat nephi is it you you youve come to me at last his voice quivered with gratitude tears rolled from the corner of his deep eyes down hollow cheeks into the dark thatch of bristles beneath his jaw oh thank the lord i thought i had disappointed him disappointed you somehow that youd sought someone else for this work the angel remained still prestons eyes wandered up the pale form over the spines and bones that protruded from it up to the long horned skull and two dark eye sockets through which he thought he saw the reflected glint of his flickering oil lamp its done we we have cleansed this place as you asked cleansed it of devilish parasites theyve all gone his voice trembled with excitement pure enough that yyouve come back to us the angel raised a long bony finger up to a jagged row of teeth shhhhh preston felt the dark eye sockets studying him intently and was certain he sensed the angel was pleased with him proud of him for having the strength of purpose to see through what needed to be done do you wish to bbegin our work preston asked ending the still and silent tableau the golden plates are wwaiting in our temple ready for us tto begin shhhhh preston stopped you have waited long for this william to revive me he nodded feeling tears of joy welling in his eyes ive wanted to see you to talk with you to hear the voice of an angel but william why would an angel come to you what why would god trust you to deliver his word from those sacred plates hmm preston shook his head confused because he he brought them to me asked of me that i no you are a fake a liar a thief no eric saul and you the false prophet you know what happens to false prophets preston shook his head the angel suddenly took a step forward one hand swiping across prestons belly preston was startled and confused by the sudden movement it was only when a twisting tendril of warm steam flickered past his eyes a couple of seconds later that he understood the angel had just cut him open he looked down to see a growing pool of dark viscous blood soaking into the snow at his feet and a coil of glistening intestine protruding from the ripped gash in his clothes hanging pendulously towards the ground he looked up at nephi why did there are so many interesting things inside you youre going to see them all before you die the angel giggled like a naughty child preston felt an emerging sting of pain from his opened belly but his confused struggling mind was trying to comprehend a more important thing why why do this the angel swung a hand of long razorsharp fingers across the open wound catching the bulge of intestine and pulling a long loop of it out onto the snow preston felt the tender tug pulling him forward he collapsed onto his knees because you are not a good man not good enough for god another swipe and preston felt more of himself being eviscerated landing with a wet splash on the ground between his legs his mind dully registered that in one hand he held a gun loaded and ready to fire but that was irrelevant now it was too late he knew he was dying what mattered more to him right now more than anything else was trying to comprehend why this was happening to him and what fate awaited him in the hereafter have i not been good have i not youre a bastard the angels whispered voice had suddenly transformed into an alltoohuman scream filled with anguish and hate preston flinched he rocked back drunkenly on his knees the little world around them both this small space of snow and bare branches lit an amber hue by the flickering glow of his solitary oil lamp was beginning to sway and spin he felt lightheaded that screaming voice certainly didnt sound like an angel i hate you the skeletal creature screamed your dark fucking evil soul is going to burn in hell i want you to know that before i rip your heart out youre gonna burn and burn and burn for ever it screamed with a shrill voice for the first time in prestons fogged mind confusion gave way to fear and the first inkling of suspicion no he whispered the world suddenly keeled over to one side preston felt cool snow pressed against one side of his hot face as he lay supine he turned to see this creature of bones and spines step over him and then kneel down one knee planted either side of his pelvis do you understand now william it screamed again a spiny hand disappeared into his gaping belly and preston felt the pull and rupture of tender things tearing inside of him he gasped convulsed and vomited blood his eyes were losing focus beginning to cross and roll uncontrollably and then close look at me the thing screamed angrily leaning down towards him its face so close that the ragged teeth at the bottom of the long skull rested on prestons bearded chin hot gasps of fetid air billowing out into the space between them see what i am prestons eyelids obediently fluttered open he tried to focus on the boneyellow face and the dark empty sockets inches away from him one hand of long spines came into view covered in dark blood and shreds of tissue dangling from serrated edges and prestons dying mind vaguely noticed the leather straps tied tautly around a gloved hand securing the sharpened blades of bone to it in an abstract moment he wondered why an angel would want to construct such a strange device i want you to see who i am it snarled with a keening whine before those eyes of yours come out i want you to see me the hand grasped hold of the jagged teeth and pushed the long boneface upwards the skull prestons dulled mind managed to comprehend was just a facade a mask and beneath that mask dimly lit by the flickering amber hues of his oil lamp he saw a face contorted with rage every bit as terrifying as hed imagined an angel might look it was his face he saw only younger sam smiled you thought i was dead buried preston could only nod and gurgle in response sam laughed at the pitiful confused look on prestons face no it wasnt me that was the angels idea hes so very clever the angel had so deftly taken charge when he most needed it his mind fogged with anger and grief he had been incapable of thinking clearly his memory of it was vague now mr hearsts attack had been brutal and without warning momma had been slashed open once twice and again a deliberately barbaric attack to look like an indians handiwork and as momma collapsed saul had turned towards sam and emily sams memory was jumbled he had killed hearst in a rage hacking and hacking at his open bowels as emily stared in horror at him he remembered a lone indian arriving and turning on the savage with hearsts blade the indian snatching emily from him and running these things had been a confused web of halfmemories until nephi came to him and helped him make sense of it all advising him with a quiet whisper like a much wiser older sibling a father a mentor the angel told him there was work to do and that work was not the translation of sacred metal plates not immediately anyway the task at hand was to punish those arrogant people who presumed they spoke for god and the charlatan who was leading them the grave for momma the same grave for the dead indian shot by saul a week earlier and buried wearing sams clothes making an example of hearsts body an example that let preston know his secret was out all of this sam knew hed not have been smart enough to conceive of by himself the angel was so so clever im glad you came to me you have a good soul his mind returned to the here and now looking down at prestons flickering confused face the mans lips were wet with blood and twitched struggling to form what would prove to be his last word why he gasped im doing this for emily sam replied for me for johanna and all your other bastard children preston squirmed and gurgled im doing this for momma she was going to tell them all about you but you had saul kill her i hate you take his eyes sam raised his clawed hand and smiled so now youve seen with a sudden thrust the sharpened point of the bone claw strapped to his index finger penetrated prestons left eye it burst with a soft wet pop he pushed the claw in all the way to the knuckle feeling cartilage and bone crack and surrender preston thrashed convulsively for a moment and then was still chapter saturday sierra nevada mountains california and this ladies and gents is it said grace stepping down over the mosscovered hump of a fallen tree into the clearing shepherd followed her over and then stopped surveying the open expanse of grooves and bumps covered with an undulating blanket of smooth green moss oh i assumed there would be more to see he said with a look of disappointment dont worry its all there buried said julian quickly and surprisingly well preserved because of that and this place is where you found that journal julian nodded and pointed across the clearing over on the other side youll see where the moss has been disturbed grace looked up at the sinking sun were not goin to have time for playing around in the muck today people we should get the tents out whilst weve got some light to work with she looked across at shepherd if thats okay with you mr shepherd sure he smiled genially youre the boss out here grace grace smiled she liked that he said that as they stepped cautiously across the uneven clearing rose sidled up to julian shepherds doing a good job of winning over grace isnt he julian shrugged of course he is he might end up being her next president he turned to her do i detect a whiff of jealousy rose wrinkled her nose no its its just that i dunno she didnt bow and scrape quite so much for us she smiled yeah i suppose julian looked up at the man ahead of them and his bodyguard walking along warily to one side power does that the smell of it stimulates our inner serf grace led them to the same relatively flat area theyd camped on last time it was surrounded by a subtle roughly circular hump the blackened soot from their last campfire a week ago remained undisturbed weve got about an hour of light to pitch our tents lets do that then ill get a campfire going for some coffee she turned to shepherd you okay putting up your tent mr shepherd im okay my dear he laughed ive done my fair share of hiking in my time mr barns you okay with that the fed nodded im good maam grace put together a surprisingly tasty stew from the contents of several tins and a perforated bag of spices that she threw into the bubbling pot a few minutes before serving my word this is delicious said shepherd blowing onto a steaming spoon nothing like a stew when youve been walkin out in the fresh grace replied the fire crackled warmly between them julian felt it was noticeably cooler this time around than a week ago but then it was into november and according to the local weather man this morning snow several weeks overdue would be covering these hills soon julian shuffled slightly closer to the fire and blew a cloud of steam out of his bowl you said youve done a bit of hiking before yes my father and i a long time ago now im afraid we took quite a few trips to the rockies and the sierra nevadas i dont seem to have much time these days to spend it like this away from the end of a phone network its hard to truly get away from that julian smiled i can imagine not that long ago it wasnt so hard to find somewhere off the grid but he pulled out his blackberry and checked for a signal nope nothing well there you go i guess you can still find places off the grid so you were sayin youve come along because youre interested in this story of rose and julians said grace yes ive an interest in history from this time particularly early mormon history fascinating thing the birth of a brand new faith so recently historically speaking rose blew on her spoon isnt it awkward timing for you to duck out from campaigning just to join our field trip shepherd chuckled i guess theres no such thing as a good time but i felt like i needed time to recharge my batteries have some quiet he looked across at julian and your colleagues email arrived at just the right moment it gave me an excuse to get away from things for a short while they ate in silence for a few moments listening to the hiss of a breeze through the swaying branches around them so said julian youre a mormon yourself thats right isnt it mr shepherd he nodded i was born and raised one how does that factor into your voter appeal shepherd sighed i was hoping to get away from work he replied with a weary smile jules let the poor man eat in peace rose chided him gently shepherd raised a hand no i dont really mind he looked at julian as long as youre not interviewing me he smiled and shook his head no dictaphone off the record im just curious shepherd shuffled to get comfortable its definitely a factor therere about thirteen million mormons out there and to be honest not all of them would put a vote my way but i hope the people im getting through to are not necessarily mormons not necessarily baptists but a large quiet groundswell of middleground voters who are tired of the other two parties the sleaze the corruption all that selfserving manoeuvring they do on every issue but your core voters the ones youre aiming at are are what protestant christians not at all i hope im talking to people of every faith i hope im getting through to catholics muslims hindus people of all faiths julian people who see beyond the immediate i am therefore i will have rose frowned what do you mean this selfish mefirst society weve gone and built theres no social bond left in this country of ours no sense of community of a greater good we all go our own separate ways grabbing what we can for ourselves and screw everyone else yup grace muttered thats about it shepherd nodded weve spawned a generation of selfish selfobsessed product consumers a younger generation who know nothing more than their local mall the internet mcdonalds and their ipods kids who dont care a damn for their community for their family even moms and dads both working double shifts to pay for the shiny gadgets the tv tells their kids they need to have shepherd shook his head the great big capitalist experiment he sighed went and broke our society big time theres no thanks in thanksgiving no god left in christmas those days are nothing more than carefully branded herding to drive the cattle into the mall twice a year and hell we do it all over again for easter the world has become too commercial agreed rose with no faith left in our lives no meaning to our lives shepherd replied all that is left is he shrugged buying things julian finished his stew and placed the bowl on the ground you know what youre saying sounds refreshingly left wing for america at least dont you worry you might sound too i dunno socialist for voters to accept shepherd shrugged people know whats right in their hearts they do our broken country needs some kind of glue to put it back together to reconnect kids with their parents and rebuild all those fragmented dysfunctional families to rebuild those isolated families into communities and those communities into a country that once more understands the notion of a common good and that glue is faith shepherd nodded its all we have left let me ask you a question mr cooke who would you prefer as your neighbour homer simpson or ned flanders julian laughed and pushed his glasses up seriously shepherd nodded well its got to be homer annoying though he is because its the god thing im afraid sorry i struggle with the ridiculous beliefs most religions insist on slavishly subscribing to you know the world being created in seven days and being only six thousand years old that kind of thing if were talking about the other faiths too rose cut in how about the idea of women being the property of men or heaven being a place where a man can get satisfaction from seventytwo virgins or to take another faith that any sin no matter how awful can be instantly written off by muttering a hail mary to their surprise shepherd nodded youre right both of you julian looked up from the fire what its all a load of crap the crackle of burning firewood filled a long silence the worlds faiths are contaminated with ageold superstitions most irrelevant and many very dangerous after all every one of them was formulated and prescribed at least a thousand years ago how in gods name could any of them be relevant to our lives now what we need shepherd stopped short and looked around at them im sorry you got me whipped up into preacher mode julian sat back uhh im pretty sure youve never preached that kind of message on your tv station shepherd shifted uncomfortably no youre right i havent no ones ready to hear that kind of thing it would sink my campaign in a heartbeat if they knew how i felt julian shook his head what you say out here is off the record im not interested in who becomes president eighteen months from now its prestons story that im interested in the kettle on the fire began whistling and bubbling grace leaned forward and carefully unhooked it from a small a frame suspended over the fire mr shepherd she topped up the stewing coffee with steaming hot water i believe you were going to tell us what we need you know before you stopped short there she stared at him you were just beginning to make some sense to me rose nodded im intrigued too i believe you just rubbished all the worlds major religions and yet you are a man of faith right i am she shrugged well uh isnt that a problem for you he reached for the coffee pot and refilled the chipped enamel mug on the ground beside him in silence he sipped the black brew hesitantly his mind elsewhere for a moment he spoke quietly id like to see those old faiths swept aside and all the malice the hatred the bigotry the ignorance that goes with them more than anything he said the slightest hint of passion stealing into the timbre of his measured voice more than anything this broken world needs to have a new conversation with god what do you mean by that asked julian grace emptied the dregs from her mug youre talkin about a new faith shepherd nodded and mormonism is that faith he shook his head i was brought up to believe that and perhaps i once did but not any longer the lords word was corrupted by ambitious men not good men not pure men weve been living in a state of apostasy for too long he took a deep breath i believe this tired troubled world of ours needs to hear from god again in a language that makes sense of the twentyfirst century rose stared at shepherd quiet now lost in his thoughts a detached faraway look in his eyes the silence continued long enough that grace finally decided to cut in im beat ill be turnin in the fire needs to be completely dowsed before we sleep and the pan properly covered and if any of you need a pee before bed be sure to do it well way from the tents she stood up and gathered their empty bowls mr barns give me a hand agent barns nodded sure they headed across the moonlit clearing a flashlight lancing out into the darkness before them with bowls and cutlery in hand and grace carrying a twolitre plastic jug of water rose watched them stop at the edge of the clearing grace began to rinse the bowls and spoons so mr shepherd do you mind if i ask something rose spoke quietly he looked up at her and smiled of course would you consider yourself pure enough pure enough to interpret the message of god to listen to his quiet voice in the darkest hours of night and not twist it to suit my own ends she nodded yeah i suppose thats what im asking id like to think so he laughed after all im a very good listener he looked at his watch look its late ive had a long day a hectic week in fact and im bushed i think ill turn in well see you in the morning said julian they watched him head over to his tent unzip it and climb inside for a politician he does seem refreshingly honest said rose quietly makes for a change huh julian nodded hes got it whatever it is charm charisma hes got it he sure has she replied gazing back at the fire chapter october haven ridge utah william im glad we have this chance to talk alone the old man spoke with a frail voice you know i can see the burning light in you grandfather the old man smiled you remind me of my own grandfather he added what do you mean the burning light the passion william the passion the faith that zeal the knowledge that youre special that god has marked you out for great things william looked out of the window of his grandfathers study i do feel a calling he admitted yes i see that in you you have a talent for communicating the word of god im sorry to say i never had that kind of strength of purpose or faith and nor does your father weve both been good businessmen hard workers and weve made plenty of money in portland and here but theres something in you that i know will take you so much further william felt it too in a way i have something i wish to share with you his grandfather uttered quietly something i never shared with your father what is it the old man turned to look at his grandson a handsome young man whose recent devotion to the faith speaking publicly with such passion that he was becoming a regular attraction at the local temple made him proud and it made him feel guilty for merely paying lip service to the church throughout his life i have a secret william stirred uneasily its to do with our past our family william knew a little of the family history from his father you know that my grandfather said the old man travelled west during the migrations that his group under an elder called william preston ran into trouble in the mountains william nodded they got snowed in didnt they thats right they did and many people died the old man sat back in his winged chair it creaked the only one of them who did manage to make it out of the mountains was my grandfather he was young and fit otherwise he would have died im sure dad told me the story he emerged starving and in rags didnt he grandfather nodded stroking his chin thoughtfully yes thats right i do believe it was his faith alone that saw him through that nightmare faith in god can get you through anything william replied earnestly well see lad theres a little more to that tale than you know william sat forward his curiosity piqued preston led his followers out into the wilderness for a reason he had with him some very special things what things his grandfathers eyes narrowed sacred things chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california the words came back to him as his fingers traced the outline of the chest in the peaty soil sacred things shepherd whispered quietly scrabbling in the pitchblack dirt by the light of his torch he imagined himself looking very much like some small forest animal scratching in the earth for its first catch of the day a pig snuffling for truffles a wry smile sloped momentarily across his lips as he tried to imagine what sort of pithy headline leonard roth the washington posts political editor would come up with if he could see him now instinctively he looked around its always a possibility some industrious paparazzi might just have managed to successfully track him down out here and be even now lining up the crosshairs of a telephoto lens upon him he quickly dismissed the thought for what it was unnecessary paranoia no one knew where he was right now not even duncan as it needed to be sacred things he said again quietly his breath a plume in the cold morning air he turned to look at the dayglo tents across the clearing none of the others had risen yet it was still before seven and the grey light of predawn was just enough now that he no longer needed his torch he switched it off not wanting to attract any unnecessary attention just yet he wanted this to be a private moment to share it with no one else to perhaps feel that sense of epiphany and revelation that joseph smith must have once felt unearthing these precious things from the hill cumorah his fingers felt the hard metal surface pitted rusted and caked with soil it was beautiful prestons chest this was the thing he really sought getting into the white house getting his hands on political power to ready everyone for the future that was all very important but this this putting his hands on the plates the actual spoken words of god and interpreting them into modern american english this he thought looking down at the dark lid of the metal chest this is destiny you seem like a good man a voice shepherd froze it had come from somewhere inside his mind a gentle whisper at once familiar but also strange like his own thinking voice but quieter he remained still listening intently for a while hearing nothing but the gentle ballad of shifting branches you seem like a good man so quiet anything but a still mind would miss it it seemed to come both from within his head and from the chest in the ground open it do i hear you he whispered there was no reply he was no stranger to voices thered always been voices as long as he could remember nasty spiteful ones ones that urged him to test his faith and steer into an oncoming truck ones that teased and mocked him ones that soothed and encouraged but this one had a curious cadence to it he remained still emptying his mind and listened for a while but it was gone shepherd craned his neck to look out of the excavated dip there was still no sign that the others were about to rise they were all zipped up snugly in their tents glistening wet with morning dew amidst the lazy tendrils of a cool mist lying in pools across the clearing shepherd had risen an hour earlier with the sky still dark eager to make a start and unearth those precious things hed had a fair idea where to search his grandfathers handmedown tale had contained enough detail that he knew the largest shelter was prestons temple and that his people had the larger camp his eyes had easily picked out the most prominent ridge of humps beneath the moss it sat almost beneath the twisted form of an old cedar tree one branch strangled by a creeping vine stretching out over the clearing a solitary crow pierced the quiet woods with an impatient caw as if urging him to get on with his work he dug his fingers deep into the soil pulling it away from the sides of the chest the metal was scarred with corrosion but still robust still intact its inside i can feel it his fingers stumbled upon the latch at the front triggering a tremor of adrenalinecharged exhilaration this is it open it he took a deep breath aware that both his hands were shaking forgivable given how long he had been searching for this place given how many times he had tried to find it over the years always praying for guidance that god would lead him here hed always known the probability of his finding it by chance was one in a million the proverbial needle in a haystack but he also knew that one day a group of beeredup hunters a family on a hiking holiday some teenagers goofing around somebody would eventually stumble upon it find the decaying remnants of the camp dig up some longlost personal keepsake with a name still legible on it and eventually somebody would end up typing prestons name into a search engine shepherd smiled and here we are his heart thudded at the thought of what lay within the metal trunk before him and his mind momentarily dwelled on a folly hed watched on fox news before coming to meet with cooke he had listened to a catholic priest and an amateur archaeologist discuss with lightheaded exhilaration the spreading ripple of anticipation amongst theologians and archaeologists around the world at the promise of a technology that would finally allow the last few dead sea scrolls to be read spectroscopically shepherd smiled at the ridiculous interest those worthless rolls of papyrus attracted they were nothing but the words of mere scribes templemen inconsequential judaean politicians of the time authoring their manifestos supposedly with the endorsement of a higher authority not the words of god here before me however his heart pounded in his chest i have the real thing the holy spirit the angel nephi was here too ready to read to him from the plates he was almost certain now that the quiet whisper hed heard in his mind was that of the angel yes i can hear you yes shepherd felt a tear roll down his cheek youre with me now yes he realised he was soon going to bear witness to the original undoctored unchanged words of the lord as the angel read to him it would be almost like peering into the actual mind of god its going to be wonderful open it he slid his fingers under the ridge of the lid and lifted it up rust flakes crackled and fell from all four sides as it creaked open and a dry stale not unpleasant musky odour welcomed him inside chapter november ben shivered beneath his thick woollen poncho wrapped tightly around the three of them there was a growing fug of body warmth in the small spaces between them enough to keep at bay the worst of the earlymorning chill he raised his face from the faint warmth inside to look up at the sky a steely grey light was straining through the clouds the nights nearly gone he whispered the last faint glowing signs of pursuit had disappeared hours ago were safe from them now mrs zimmerman stirred and shuddered with the cold thank goodness she muttered her trembling lips almost blue ben turned to look down inside the poncho at emily nestled between them her head resting on mrs zimmermans ample chest her small frame shivered in an inadequate cotton dress her breath rattled and chattered the occasional unintelligible murmur stealing past her lips her eyes were closed she was sleeping the devil came to our ccamp last night said mrs zimmerman he came into our camp and turned people people ive known for years into demons ben shook his head it was fear that did that he turned to look at her a stocky ruddyfaced woman of middle years her skin chapped and sore with the cold thats all fear of the unknown ben looked out from the nook theyd found between two spurs of rock the snow covered rocky uneven ground that sloped downhill towards a treefilled gulch beyond that an uninterrupted carpet of woodland shrouded the way they had come during the night from one small valley they had stumbled into the next they were sheltered here from the sporadic gusts of icecold wind that was good for now it was preston he whispered preston he nodded i saw his handiwork he crafted some disguise out of animal bones and skulls he wore this disguise and im almost certain it was he who killed vander hearst sam and his mother no the voice came from inside the poncho emily spoke dear lord emily gasped mrs zimmerman she pushed aside the woollen cover and looked down at the girls pale face stroking her hair aside emily she turned to ben god be praised i thought she would never speak again he hunched over to look closely at her emily he said its benjamin here the girls eyes remained closed and her breathing even she seemed to be still asleep emily can you hear me beneath her parchmentthin skin her eyes moved back and forth following the progress of some horrendous scene being played out again her dry lips twitched and parted angel an angel she muttered sleepily emily its ben can you hear me killing momma sam hes killing momma her voice faded into a sleepy nonsensical drone and then she was silent shes coming back to us mrs zimmerman said a tear trickling down a crimsonblotched cheek thank the lord she cried quietly shes finding her way home ill thank the lord mrs zimmerman when we make it down from these mountains and find our way home we will wont we she asked he managed a confident nod of course we will later on the sky broke up into a mixed chequerboard of heavy clouds and fleeting strips of blue sky that mercifully permitted the respite of the suns warming rays through every now and then they made some faltering progress westward and through a treacherous rocky pass that led down into a much broader valley ben wondered if this was the pass keats had been taking them towards the pass hed assured them was his selfdiscovered shortcut through the peaks the shortcut he hoped would one day bear his name keats pass the snowcovered hillside sloped gently down through a continuing canopy of firs towards the distant glinting ribbon of a river that snaked gracefully along the valley floor ben felt his heart lift at the sight of it the river pointed their way out of the mountains flowing downhill and westward hopefully leading them towards somebody else a trappers cabin the winter stopover of an indian tribe the moored resting place of a riverraft piled high with beaver pelts perhaps even the crudely constructed homestead of a hardy family of settlers the river was going to lead them eventually to someone by midday they had shambled their way down to a flat shingle bank overlooking the surging flow of fresh water and ben confident they had travelled further than they were likely to be pursued dug away a space in the snow and set about building a fire around which the three of them now gratefully huddled emily stared wideeyed at the flickering flames dancing around the crackling wood the thick smoke of pine needles and moist bark slowly catching she was humming a tune to herself a hymn little by little shes coming back to us mrs zimmerman smiled ben nodded for now though his mind was on the gnawing tightness in his belly there was food to be had amongst the trees he was sure if only he knew how to find it catch it and kill it i have to eat he said rocking gently to take his mind off the discomfort preston denied our people any of the oxen after we took in those indians weve been living off packing oats and whatever they could forage for us mrs zimmerman shook her head ashamed im so sorry he was trying to make us leave he looked at her we should have the kindness of a fleeting blue sky had deserted them once more as a seamless grey blanket of cloud rolled over they had the fire though and enough firewood at least we wont freeze tonight eh he said cheerfully itll be better than last night was for us mrs zimmerman was about to reply when they heard the rustle of movement amongst the trees their eyes met you hear that she nodded and ben jumped to his feet they heard it again it was not the gentle rustle and dart of a startled animal theyd heard but the steadily approaching noise of careless feet oh please no he muttered under his breath there was no hiding out here on this snowdusted frozen bank of shingle and silt they were trapped he looked down at the fire and up at the twisting column of smoke curling languidly up into the sky stupid we led preston right to us mrs zimmerman came to the same conclusion please she called out william preston its ellie zimmerman here please dont hurt us the noise was increasing picking up pace mr lamberts been very kind caring for us she called out again hes been very kind please dont hurt him they heard the crack of a branch snapping and briar roughly trampled beneath hasty feet almost certainly the sound of more than one person moving through the trees towards them ben pulled a branch from the fire one end smouldering and smoking and held it before him then he caught sight of some movement a man two men weaving their way through coarse undergrowth in the darkness beneath the trees stooping beneath the low heavy branches of a squat fir tree emerging blinking into the daylight oh god ben whispered chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california shepherd reached into the metal chest and placed his hand gently on the faded cotton sack feeling the hard metal plates through the perished material the dents and grooves on their surface reminded him of braille his fingers tingled as he felt the subtle contours of ornate curls this is the language of angels he puffed out a cloud of air and felt momentarily dizzy from the exhilaration of it all you okay mr shepherd shepherd looked up to see the sturdy outline of carl squatting beside the shallow ditch im fine carl this is what you came for shepherd nodded carl looked over his shoulder at the tents in the distance i should warn you the others are stirring now its gone seven shepherds mind was elsewhere thank you he answered absentmindedly as his fingers gently grasped hold of the threadbare cotton he delicately lifted the bag out of the chest warily holding one hand beneath it in case the frail bag ripped and dropped its precious contents could you open that for me he said nodding towards a reinforced aluminium travel case on the ground beside him carl flipped the latches on the side and opened it revealing a layer of black cushioning foam shepherd gently rested the tattered cotton sack inside can i see asked carl studying the bag with a puzzled expression on his face shepherd nodded as he carefully opened the bag to reveal a glimpse of the tablets they were each roughly the size of a sheet of foolscap copper sheets green with corrosion and richly textured with rows of indented glyphs thats really the word of god he asked you sound disappointed i guess i expected the word of god to look more important carl nodded yes thats why i know this is genuine carl the lord speaks with the quietest whisper not a shrill cry if this were a shimmering golden tablet i would be sceptical the man considered that i guess youre right shepherd turned back to the dark metal chest in the ground carefully he reached in and pulled out another tattered canvas sack from within came the soft clink of fragile bones whats that the remains of an angel carl the man looked at him an an angel shepherd smiled thats right a real angel one of gods own these tablets are written in a language that you or i would never understand the language of angels shepherd gently placed the sack alongside the other in the case this angel is called nephi and when im ready to transcribe these tablets hell appear to me in the flesh and read to me so that i can write it down carls eyes widened my god mr shepherd he whispered this this is for real isnt it shepherd placed a reassuring hand on his arm oh yes carl this is the real deal he closed the lid of the travel case carl glanced back at the tents leaned forward slightly and whispered mr shepherd theyre up now shepherd stretched up to look out of the shallow ditch hed excavated he could see cooke ambling casually towards them across the clearing yawning out a cloud of breath as he made his way over and the park ranger grace heading into the trees to forage for some firewood you have it now yes they are no longer needed the voice in his head was just a little louder than earlier a little more insistent as if it had emerged from a dark corner at the back of his mind and moved a step or two towards the front shepherd hesitated there was something implied in what it had whispered would that be necessary the voice was quiet for a moment i have what we both want now theres no need for anyone else to die do not be weak its not weakness its common sense we dont need any more bodies not with what lies ahead for us you understand the importance of my campaign the potential to be president how that can help us spread the new word of god there was no reply shepherd sensed it stirring distracted with thought perhaps he could argue it round is this what god wants for us to start work on his message with blood freshly on our hands shepherd sensed the simmering heat of anger disapproval somewhere amongst the dark recesses of his mind i wonder have i chosen wisely yes you have then do as i say carl was watching him mr shepherd you okay shepherd looked up at him his eyes barely registering the man he stood up slowly feeling an ache in his back from having crouched for too long and watched as cooke covered the last few yards towards them with a look of growing curiosity on his face morning julian called out approaching the edge of the ditch youve started already weve not even had breakfast shepherd offered him a tired smile yes yes i wanted to uh make a start julian looked down into the dark trench and spotted the open metal chest his eyes instantly widened he looked around at the faint outline of a much larger shelter than the others and instantly realised that this was the temple lambert had frequently mentioned in his journal shit he looked at shepherd is that prestons yes he replied evenly i believe it is prestons belongings julian shook his head how the hell did you find it so easily i prayed shepherd shrugged and offered a hazy smile and the lord showed me the way julian grinned well however you managed it this is fantastic you know having read through lamberts journal last week and reading about this he pointed to the ditch the nubs of dark rotten wood poking through the soil and moss and here it is yes shepherd replied dully you know what needs to be done perhaps mr cooke shepherd continued you should gather up the other two and we shall celebrate this find properly yeah julian grinned yes of course shepherds slack face came to life with a generous smile then i think you and i should discuss how much money youre going to need for your documentary how does that sound cookes grin widened that would be good excellent shepherd replied pulling himself up out of the muddy trench carl reached out a hand to help him off you go and get the others then julian turned away and headed back towards the tents shepherd watched him silently for a moment the false smile draining away swiftly carl he said you know what needs to be done now he nodded sadly yes im afraid so julian picked his way slowly across the clearing confused by all rights he figured he shouldve been tapdancing across to tell rose the news but he wasnt instead his mind was on something else something that was troubling him something hed just caught a glimpse of the faint flash of a dull blue tattoo across the back of agent barnss hand ive seen that tattoo before it was distinctive a fox damnit whereve i seen that on whose bloody hand did i a cold loop of realisation suddenly curled through his stomach that man was at heathrow he glanced back over his shoulder and saw barns watching him if barns was in london hes been following me other things that he had almost managed to forget about to dismiss as the product of an overactive imagination came back to mind a noise on his phone line the suspicion that somebody had entered his flat the unsettling curl of anxiety in his stomach turned into something more acidic and uncomfortable and sean dead twentyfour hours after doing lunch with me he remembered toms caution about looking for skeletons in the closets of the powerful oh christ he muttered to himself as he stepped across a gentle hump in the ground he knelt down outside roses tent and fumbled for the zip or am i being paranoid shit i dunno rose he called out softly there was no answer no noise at all coming from inside rose its me coming in he said pulling the zipper up chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california rose looked up at him as he stooped inside her tent still snuggled up in her sleeping bag she had her laptop on and was staring intently at the screen jules theres something that isnt right he squatted down beside her rose i need to a slither of bright morning sunlight streamed across the floor and into her eyes close the zip i cant see anything he reached round and pulled it down jules you have to see this she said turning the laptop round so he could see the screen she moved the mouse across to the tab of another image i got an email back yesterday morning before we set off to meet grace at the camp i just didnt have the time to read it and open the attachment before we set off she waved her hand at the unnecessary digression anyway theres a small museum well its nothing more than a photographic archive in fort kearny julian shook his head impatiently rose look can this wait a jules just listen its an archive of portraits taken of groups of settlers on the eve of departure it seems nearly everyone at the point of stepping out into the wilderness had one of these portraits done so she clicked the mouse button on the image tab and a muddy brown portrait of a group of people standing proudly in front of a wagon filled the screen they had one image in their database of a certain preston party stepping out in which they kindly sent me julian studied the group portrait several dozen men and a few women all of the men bearded the women wearing bonnets that modestly covered their hair each had a face betraying grim determination and a readiness for everything nature could throw at them clearly not the entire group just those elders senior enough to warrant being in the photograph to one side stood another man tall and gaunt my god he whispered thats preston rose nodded and who do you think he looks a helluva lot like oh shit yes he does he whispered shepherd it was the eyes unmistakably deep and intense the distinct brow above and the long clearly defined jaw she flipped the screen of the laptop down im really not comfortable with this jules getting so into bed with this guy julian raised a finger to his lips to shush her and then spoke quietly i think were way past not feeling comfortable what do you mean julian pulled off his glasses and wiped the lenses a stress habit he was vaguely aware of but he felt too distracted to correct himself right now rose studied him with a growing expression of concern julian shepherd is prestons descendant rose nodded yes that means hell want to bury this story he looked at her i think we might need to leave leave as in drop everything no explanations just leave julian why what its something our friend dr griffith said he whispered something he said thats really really spooked me and i want to get out of here like right now julian youre spooking me now get dressed ill explain this all later on julian pulled the zip down slowly and peered outside there was now no sign of shepherd in the ditch nor agent barns although he wondered whether the id badge was genuine and whether barns was really his name shit where are they he turned round rose was dressed now ready and crouching anxiously behind him wheres grace she whispered and then as an afterthought grace has a gun i cant see her or them jules i said shepherd might want to bury this thats all why the hell are you so jumpy all of a sudden he turned round i was being followed in london rose i just recognised that guy barns i think he was tailing me i think he might even have broken into my apartment and bugged the phone she froze seriously and now seans dead he added killed the day after i had lunch with him roses jaw slowly dropped open oh fuck he nodded so what are we going to do we cant just run out into the woods without our stuff well get lost and this isnt the time of year to go doing that rose consider where we are right now were alone in the deepest darkest wilderness with a man who stands to lose everything if we emerge from these woods alive with this story i cant be a hundred per cent sure that seans stabbing is linked but you know what im not prepared to hang around here a moment longer and you know ask jules im scared me too she placed a hand on his back okay ill go with the leave idea right he peered out again were going to climb out very calmly and casually make like were going to the trees for a toilet visit okay what about grace shes out there collecting firewood well try to find her and explain we need to make a sharp exit all right ready not really julian lowered the zip the rest of the way pushed himself out through the flap of the tent and stepped into the morning sunlight dazzled and blinking he stood up slowly stretching and yawning halfaware the whole routine looked pathetically theatrical rose stood up beside him shielding her eyes from the morning glare where are they she muttered quietly were right here replied shepherd flatly standing to the side of the tent chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california julian spun round at the sound of his voice oh he gasped and then managed a faltering smile i believe we were all going to celebrate finding prestons things werent we shall i brew us a nice pot of coffee shepherd cocked his head in an odd unsettling way a distracted faroff expression on his face barns looked at him one hand sliding discreetly into his jacket pocket for something mr shepherd sir shepherd shook his head silently his lips fluttering in silent debate rose and i will get some firewood julian added reaching for roses hand get a nice fire going for the coffee have some breakfast too okay julian wondered if shepherd had heard any of that but then the mans troubled eyes returned from far away and locked onto his his thin lips spread slightly with a hardfought and weary smile yes he said his face flinching and flickering do that go get some firewood barnss hand hesitated in his jacket pocket he looked confused sir julian turned to rose and mouthed lets go they backed away from the two men turned and walked struggling with an instinctive urge to break into a desperate run julian heard barnss voice again sir are you sure about letting them go rose whispered from the side of her mouth shit jules im sure they know they know we know keep walking he hissed back behind them barnss voice came again insistent mr shepherd are you all right they stepped a little more quickly over the undulating mounds of moss both desperately trying not to give in to the growing rush of panic for some reason shepherd seemed to have slipped into a listless state right now he was letting them walk julian figured if they started to sprint that might snap him out of it twenty yards ahead of them were the first saplings that marked the edge of the clearing and the start of woodland rising from it to their left in amongst them making her way down the slope weaving through the trunks he caught the briefest glimpse of graces red anorak look theres grace up ahead his words were interrupted by a highpitched shriek of rage from behind them it was shepherds voice but somehow not shepherd kill them julian turned to see barns react instantly whipping out a gun and adopting the wellpractised firing stance of a trained killer oh shit run he heard several cracks of gunfire and felt the throb of a bullet passing his ear an instant later rose yelped beside him as they raced for the trees the sound of two more cracks came in quick succession he felt the sleeve of his jacket tugged viciously and saw the white puff of inner lining exploding from a ragged hole shit they reached the first narrow tree trunks as a third doubletapped volley was fired sending splinters of young wood into the air julian and rose ducked down and scrambled under the low branches into the undergrowth he lost his footing on a root and tumbled over jules get up get up rose held out a hand he grabbed it and pulled himself up just in time to see grace emerge from the trees clearly confused by the ruckus she started jogging towards the two men unslinging her rifle julian realised that in all innocence she must have been thinking the shots were being fired at a bear grace run rose screamed grace turned their way confused by roses call she turned to shepherd her gravelly voice raised urgently as she asked them what the hell was going on julian watched in horror as shepherds hired killer swiftly raised his pistol and shot the old woman pointblank no screamed rose they watched in shocked stillness as grace flopped lifelessly to the ground shepherd casually reached down and scooped up her gun oh shitshitshit julian muttered he grabbed roses hand and pulled her after him come on they scrambled up the hillside alternately weaving their way through dense clusters of undergrowth and brambles that scratched and grabbed at them then bursting into small isolated clearings encircled by a thick tall wall of dark green fir trees julian stopped in one of them and turned to look downhill through a gap in the trees towards the clearing he could see the dayglo colours of their tents clustered together in the middle and amongst them the darker navyblue anoraks of shepherd and barns they seemed in no immediate hurry to pursue instead barns was picking through his backpack and shepherd was slowly scanning the hillside a hand cupped over his eyes to keep out the lowangle glare of the morning sun suddenly his other hand shot up and pointed directly towards them he heard the distant bark of the mans voice a second later shit snapped julian hes spotted us jules rose whispered look at us she pointed at her anorak and his one was lemon yellow the other orange weve got to lose these youre right they pushed their way out of the clearing back into dense foliage and there hidden from view for the moment they shed their anoraks he tucked his into a small bundle and pushed it under his jumper creating a pregnant bulge we need to hang onto them he said it gets cold at night she nodded and did likewise okay then he said gasping for air after the last few minutes of exertion youre better with directions which way rose nodded up hill that way is west i think and perhaps well get a signal on your blackberry at the top right they pushed on again stopping to rest momentarily in a small rockstrewn glade a few minutes later julian looked back down at the camp clearing and saw the dark outlines of both men walking calmly across it towards them and the tree line theyve stopped fucking around down there now theyre coming for us she turned to look can they find us julian shrugged i dont know its possible weve left tracks behind us that could be followed shit what do i know i doubt it though yeah she whispered its not like hes some indian mastertracker right he watched them as they disappeared from view beneath the forest canopy below to begin their ascent up the hillside towards them he didnt like the calm unhurried way they had made their way out of the clearing if shepherds body language said anything it was i know exactly where you two are and im coming for you lets just hope not he grabbed her heaving shoulder come on lets move rose nodded wordlessly they turned and continued scrambling uphill an hour later the trees thinned out before them and they found themselves standing in the open threequarters of the way up one of the bare peaks that looked down on the valley in which theyd camped above them dry brown tufts of grass gradually gave way to a sharp and steepening slope of bare rock that rose to culminate in a jagged horizon rose sighed with relief to see a break in the peaks to their right a quarter of a mile along the side of the slope a narrow pass there she said pointing to it i guess thatll take us into the next valley julian nodded as he pulled out his blackberry and tried for a signal anything rose asked hopefully he shook his head lets go she rasped between breaths maybe well pick up a signal on the other side the pass was little more than a modest gulch hacked like the very first cut of an axe into a tree trunk it was just about wide enough that a x might have made it through if it werent for the many fractured boulders and slides of rubble that clattered noisily and shifted unnervingly beneath their feet the sun was high in the sky as they emerged and looked down on a much broader valley anything now asked rose julian snapped his phone shut and shook his head no she scanned the world below looking for some sign of civilisation even an empty road would have been worth heading for then she spotted it look julian followed her finger what is that a wide shallow slowmoving river wound its way westward down the valley and on a major horseshoe bend in the river they could see a row of squat wooden buildings looks like some kind of logging camp said rose abandoned though do you think yeah we should still make for that there might be something there there might be someone there julian nodded chapter november my god keats youre alive cried ben the old guide clung to the shoulder of broken wing as they hobbled out of the woods into the open ben rushed towards them the gutwrenching plummeting sensation of fear hed been experiencing a moment earlier replaced by an energetic surge of relief oh bloody christ he yelled with a grin smeared across his face as his feet carried him across the snow towards them i thought only the three of us had managed to esc then his eyes took in the pertinent detail a broad strip of keatss longfaded polkadot shirt was crudely wrapped around his waist soaked with his blood and almost as dark as ink keats looked up at ben his face normally the rich golden tan of worn saddle leather was now ashen broken wing helped him across to the fire then gently laid him down keats groaned with the pain holding his hands protectively against the front of his body several new dark blotches of crimson bloomed across the material as beneath the wrap a large wound flexed and opened ben looked up at the shoshone his face a question mark broken wing understood and uttered a rapid burst of ute gesturing back at the dark apron of trees from which theyd emerged his hands telling a story ben couldnt quite decipher something back in there did this to keats ben needed to know more keats what happened the old man breathed deeply gathering his wits and what was left of his failing strength i seen it lambert i seen the fuckin thing he gasped desperately his eyes normally narrow flinty slits were wide and dilated with fear they flickered from ben to the trees then back again seen what keats puffed clouds and clenched his eyes shut grimacing at the pain from his torso ben noticed there was even more blood coming down his left leg soaking through the deerskin a torn gash in the worn hide above his knee revealed a protruding tatter of bloodied skin ben knelt down beside him knowing instinctively there was not a lot his medical knowledge could do for the old man let me have a look at this for you the bandage needs rewrapping keats shook his head vigorously leave it be he held a hand out only thing holdin me in one piece is this here bandage he looked down at it and grimaced you loosen that an everythin insidell come tumblin out ben suspected it was the same kind of wound hed seen on the paiute boy who had carried emily into the camp the same deep horizontal gash that would have lacerated the organs opened up the stomach lining and intestines spilling digestive acids and faecal matter inside him even if he could completely staunch the flow of blood now keats was going to die painfully from the internal damage looking at him now however it was obvious most of the dying was done what happened to you keats licked his lips dry and chapped we heard them mormons durin the early mornin he wheezed the ones followin after us there was screamin an shootin behind every now an then kept happenin through the dark hours and we got to seein less an less of their torches until eventually there was none keats opened his eyes again scanning the tree line he panted like a winded beast struggling with the effort of talking me broken wing and weyland kept movin uphill thought maybe it was others of our group who had escaped was fightin back or somethin broken wing squatted down and muttered something in his language nodding towards emily keats replied in the same language falteringly slowly what what did he say keats shook his head ignoring the question we was near the pass when it happened when it came right out the darkness at us he closed his eyes again panting rhythmically replaying something in his head ben noticed he was shaking his leathery tobaccostained lips trembled the sight of that rattled ben he considered keats unflappable his gruff unpolished demeanour impervious to anything and yet here he was looking frail and frightened and all of a sudden a very old man he leaned closer to him come on what tell me what was it keatss eyes flickered open focused on something a thousand miles away then his gaze drifted across to bens face the here and now i saw it with my own eyes lambert aint no man aint that sonofawhore preston did those killins like you was sayin he licked his dry lips again saw somethin i cant explain broken wing spoke a word ben had heard the paiute men utter sombrely amongst themselves over the last few days keats nodded weakly thats right goddamn right it aint nothin natural nothin that by rights should be walkin this world ben heard mrs zimmerman gasp the angel she whispered come down to punish us whiteface ssspirit said broken wing thats what i saw lambert gasped keats goddamned fuckin demon no angel came out of the trees and took weylands head clean off what did it look like bones an a skull goddamned graveyard come to life he snorted with a dry scaffold smile bones fuckin thing moved so fast i got me a little powder but no shot left mightve put a ball in it if i had if i got me another few ben placed a hand on his shoulder keats listen to me i think it might be preston it has to be he looked around at the others preston in some sort of of a disguise keats grabbed his side and cackled aint that fuckin zealot fool he grunted maybe them paiutes was right after all what do you mean keats smiled mebbe we took a little madness into the woods with us keats grunted painfully looking down at his seeping bandage gonna have me a one helluva fuckin scar to show off broken wing spoke and gestured with some urgency towards emily what whats that youre saying he said looking up at the indian he gestured to the trees it comess iss come for ameelee what ben looked to mrs zimmerman why why would preston want her she shook her head confused emily is his daughter most of the children were his broken wing shook his head not pressston then its the angel whimpered mrs zimmerman the angel wants us all all of ththose that followed preston its nothing of the sort snapped ben its a man thats all and if it isnt preston then its someone else amongst your group someone whos gone mad it come uttered broken wing it come this way youve been followed broken wing pointed to the fire the column of smoke it seee sssmoke oh god have mercy on us cried mrs zimmerman burying her face in her hands and sobbing ben turned back to keats perhaps the only other person here he felt he could engage with rationally keats what the hell do we do there was no reply the old man was lying perfectly still keats broken wing knelt down and held a hand above the guides nose and mouth feeling tentatively for the warmth of his breath ben could see by the pallor of his skin that it was too late the shoshones expressionless eyes met bens keeeet isss he splayed the fingers of one hand instinctively ben comprehended the unfamiliar gesture dead broken wing anxiously looked over his shoulder back into the woods speaking rapidly in ute he pointed at the fire the rising smoke and then gestured towards the trees and ben realised what he was pointing out the smoke will attract him it to this place we go now said broken wing pointing towards the riverbank as he stepped around the fire towards mrs zimmerman reaching out to grab an arm to lift her off the ground hes right we must stick to the riverbank stay in the open the apron of ground between where the trees petered out and the river flowed afforded them a chance to react if it attempted to rush them come on ben said to mrs zimmerman we have to go now hes telling us this things nearby and coming for us for emily we have to move now he bent down to pick up emily but she seemed no longer so listless and was able to pull herself up as if inch by inch she was returning to this world follow riverrr said broken wing pulling mrs zimmerman to her feet all of a sudden the stillness of the woods was shattered by something moving deep within beyond sight something moving too quickly to concern itself with stealth oh shit he whispered emily looked towards the trees no more than fifty yards away from where they stood on the riverbank her pale blue eyes came alive she seemed to be almost back in this world with them a small hand reached out for bens poncho and tugged on it mr lambert she said in a quiet voice there really are angels broken wing snapped out something in ute and pulled a knife from his hide belt he pointed along the bank and ben understood it was the only way for them to run ben bent down and pulled keatss hunting knife out of its sheath the heavy blade felt reassuring in his grasp he placed a hand on keatss stillwarm face he would have liked to have a moment to assure the old man that he had brought his journal with him that hed make it out of the woods eventually back to london and keatss name would end up in print immortalised that would have given the guide something to smile about goodbye keats whispered ben broken wing meanwhile pulling mrs zimmerman along with him began to make his way close to the waters edge keeping his eyes on the tree line running parallel to the river come on emily ben said grabbing her hand we have to go chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california julian stared at the row of bunkhouses they were utilitarian but robust almost a century of abandonment but they looked to be firmly intact and ready to face another nature had made good use of the last hundred years in reclaiming the land the drab wooden huts sat on small christmastreesized saplings sprang out of the ground in and around the buildings whilst patches of briar hiphigh tangled in and out of the support struts beneath each bunkhouse pushing fronds of green up through loose and warped floorboards hed naively hoped there might have been someone here a lone caretaker in a portakabin some other hardy allyearround trekkers a party of japanese tourists even and still no fucking cell phone signal at least its shelter said rose shivering she looked at him do you think theyre still on our tail god knows id say theyre probably still picking their way through the trees in the other valley he replied giving roses shoulder a reassuring squeeze im pretty sure we lost em he added hoping he sounded more confident than he felt the sun was fast approaching the jagged line of peaks on the far side of the valley casting long cool shadows that were sliding across the gentle valley floor towards the river and them it was going to be cold tonight come on rose lets get inside see if we cant find a cosy nook somewhere they stepped up onto a wooden porch and pushed aside a thick wooden door that creaked dryly skylights in the sloping roof one broken the other fogged with a green filter of algae and moss provided enough light for them to find their way around the dim interior the bunkhouse was one long communal space a row of coarse wooden bunkbed frames lined each lengthways wall an iron woodburning stove sat against the far wall above them several thick gable beams ran across from one side to the other protruding metal pegs from which dangled coils of heavy rope a loop of twine tied from one beam to another most probably once upon a time a clothes line and several rusting tools including a band saw a rotary saw your basic twostar accommodation he muttered and managed a humourless laugh that trailed off quickly rose wandered over to a bunk in the corner and hunkered down on the floor beside it pulling her knees up to her chin and wrapping her arms around them im shit scared jules he reached up to one of the crossbeams and lifted a large rusty canting hook off a peg he held it by its wooden handle and examined the long curved hook he hefted it in his hand it looked vicious but unwieldy it felt good to hold he wandered across the floor towards her examining the hook yeah got to admit im a little scared too how scared amigoingtodie scared or just sort of a bit anxious he laughed skittishly remember the time we followed that candidate to the bnp rally she nodded or the time we got death threats from that jihadi cleric she nodded again well more scared than that he replied sliding down the wall to hunch up next to her they sat in silence a while watching the coppery hue of the evening sun stream in through the fogged skylight windows the shadows slowly climbing up the opposite wall jules when you came into my tent this morning you definitely had something to say to me didnt you but i was too busy yapping on about the photo what were you going to say he shook his head and laughed that i was beginning to have a bad feeling about things rose smiled little earlier next time hmm dr griffith warned me about this that insanity like prestons can carry down the line rose nodded i must have got it wrong then she sighed the rag man story the survivor who emerged from the woods i thought that was lambert well maybe it was julian leaned his head back against the rough wooden wall perhaps preston left behind some descendants in iowa before he set off with his followers and shepherds family link is to one of them yeah i suppose either way shepherds unstable right did you notice right before we ran how weird he was no i didnt really its a bit of a blur he seemed out of it vacant like he was slightly stoned i dont remember that i wouldnt be entirely surprised if hes got a few skeletons of his own to hide somewhere what some bodies buried in his basement julian hugged his knees for warmth who knows maybe hes got himself a typical serialkiller basement complete with a gothic well where hes been busy stitching together a womansuit rose snorted he seemed prepared to kill us just to bury a story about his what his greatgreatgrandfather it would have damaged his campaign i can believe someone like that would do what he could to stop it maybe but would you kill someone for that rose shrugged i wouldnt would any normal politician murder someone just to bury a negative story shepherd looked up at the deep blue sky robbed of the sun and left only with a stain of its memory on the horizon it was going to be a freezing cold night the thinly combed clouds stretched in front of a growing early audience of stars made that solemn promise several paces ahead a small piece of glowing technology was leading carl forward he held something no bigger than a slim cell phone with a pale backlit screen displaying a direction and a distance hed assured shepherd that although the tracker was a few years out of date cia surplus it was more than adequate for the job out here trackers good for five to ten miles depending on lineofsight obstructions that had been carls crisp and businesslike explanation of the gadgets efficacy as they set out from the clearing after them not so good for urban detection hed added lot of walls and electrical interference but more than good enough for the job out here thisll lead us right to them mr shepherd you disapprove shepherd winced at the sudden intrusion of the voice in his head it seemed a little louder than last time more insistent shrill even certainly so much louder than any others hed played host to we dont need to kill any more people he replied its an unnecessary risk we didnt need to kill that old woman there was no response he managed an edgy smile in the failing light if duncan knew if any of his campaign sponsors knew if those millions of voters out there knew that his mind played out such terrible dialogues that suggestions malicious ones spiteful ones murderous ones genocidal ones were quietly whispered to him every day and then cautiously argued down well he could imagine spilling it all to dr phil or oprah on live tv what a release that would be to share his burdens with someone they will talk i can persuade them not to are you a good man yes yes i think i am you are also a weak man the hectoring disapproving tone in its voice sent a sharp pain through his head im not weak the voice was quiet again several yards ahead of shepherd carl suddenly cursed under his breath and stopped the damned signal keeps dropping hang on a second we need to let it pick up again while he waited for his tracker to sweep for the signal he looked out at the wide graceful valley below them silently scanning it with snipers eyes for any signs of life evening was settling across it fast and amidst the muted tones of dusk he was reassured to see no pinpricks of light anywhere just more endless wilderness and no one else around no one for miles and miles his eyes however picked out the artificially straight lines of a manmade construction down by the river some buildings down there mr shepherd he called out pointing towards a horseshoe bend in the river shepherd shook away his thoughts and looked at where carl was pointing he could see a dark huddle of huts nestled close to the rivers edge in an area swept clean of trees he was familiar with the history of this area he knew what it was the trees down there had gone a long time ago its a logging camp closed down like all the others round here back when they started moving logs on rails instead of along the river carl nodded then looked back down at the tracker display fucking mountains here are playing havoc with the lineofsight signal i should imagine theyll be hiding in that camp said shepherd its where i would head if i was running carl looked up from the display and nodded yeah i guess thats where id head too ahhh there it is he said signals picked up he studied it silently for a moment and then nodded yes youre right theyre in there somewhere mr shepherd good then lets not waste any time if we can run them to ground there thatll do just fine this is a straightforward locate and terminate right shepherd turned to him id like to talk with them first but if an instant kill is required then so be it carl nodded understood chapter november broken wing stopped and pointed ahead ben understood what he was drawing their attention to what mrs zimmerman asked breathlessly the river they were running alongside curled to the left and where it did the trees they were so desperate to keep a distance from ran all the way down to the rivers edge if we want to go any further well have to go through those trees mrs zimmerman stared unhappily at them there was no indication whether it would be a short interlude through a thin spur of wood or whether from this point on the safe margin of ground between them and the woods was gone broken wing still carried his ancient flintlock musket a horn of powder and some shot if there was just the one thing pursuing them he trusted the indians marksmanship to take a single quickly aimed shot across open ground should it emerge suddenly and charge towards them in amongst the trees however should they be ambushed he suspected the gun would never get to be fired ben cast a glance at the tree line to the left of them running parallel with the riverbank and knew it was in there somewhere looking out at them and urging them to go forward into the trees ahead to their right the river flowed swiftly swollen with freezing water that would numb them the moment they stepped into it it would swallow them up and certainly kill them all broken wing spotted his gaze and shook his head not cross here he gestured west down river cross five day north to shoshone what does he mean asked mrs zimmerman ben understood he can take us to the shoshone indians but wed need to cross this river and head north broken wing nodded but he turned to mrs zimmerman we need to carry on through those trees she shook her head vigorously i cant i dont want to go in th neither do i but we cant stay here broken wing stabbed his finger impatiently forwards yes were wasting time said ben he smiled reassuringly at mrs zimmerman and emily itll only be a thin strip of woodland and then well be out in the open again well be fine emily stirred dont worry mrs zimmerman she said with a small voice benjamin will keep us safe she smiled up at ben and tightened her grasp on his hand we should go she added mrs zimmerman nodded at her all right they approached the trees cautiously huddled closely together broken wing was ahead his musket held ready loaded with shot and powder ready in the flashpan his tamahakan was tucked into a leather belt ben had seen how quickly the indian could pull it out and use it during the struggle back at the camp he wondered though if hed be quick enough this time mrs zimmerman and emily followed the indian the womans arms wrapped protectively around the young girl both of them staring at the trees with eyes as round as saucers ben walked a few paces behind them keatss large knife in one hand and a thick and heavy stick for what it was worth held in the other together they stepped beneath the darkening canopy of branches from a bed of crunching snow onto a spongy carpet of dry cones and needles through the gaps in the branches he watched them move with slow deliberation only a few dozen yards away so close to him now his hot breath blasted back off the bone mask onto his face warming his cheeks emily he missed her missed her so much before everything had changed there had been him and her just the two of them momma only had time for preston never for them momma didnt care about them not as much as she cared for god momma didnt want to know about the games hearst and vander played with the children its always been just you and me emily but there was ben he had shown some kindness sam had even let himself believe that come the spring the three of them might leave the wilderness together an odd family like three siblings big brother little brother and little sister emily liked ben she would have adored the idea of doing that leaving prestons temple and exploring the world alongside benjamin lambert you have me now yes i do sam owed so much to the angel he knew he wouldnt have survived alone he would have gone mad he would have been stupid the day mr hearst came to kill them he would have returned to the camp and tried to attack preston and he would have failed mr hollander always stood guard ready to protect him he would have failed and been killed you need me yes do you trust me yes sam watched them moving steadily and quietly through the wood emily dropping back to clutch benjamins hand the indian ahead of them mrs zimmerman beside do you see how she clings to him he did he saw her holding tightly and peering out at the darkness in fear of me you are different now im sam you were sam you are much more now the thick canopy above them had kept all but the slightest dusting of snow from reaching the ground beneath through occasional gaps lances of light speared down ahead of them dappling the brown forest floor they stepped forward in silence the muffled crackle of dry twigs beneath their feet and the soft muted gurgle of the river to their right the only sounds the wood allowed looking hopefully ahead for any sign that the wood was thinning out once more ben could see only an endless forest of tall lodgepole pine trunks with a high canopy of branches punctuated by clusters of squat spruce trees hugging the ground where the sun came through im scared mrs zimmerman whispered broken wing looked back at them and frowned at her just keep going ben replied softly quiet as you can they walked in silence for another five minutes before the indian suddenly stopped and cocked his head listening to something then he turned to face them with the slightest smile on his stern face ben shrugged broken wing pointed to their right and cupped an ear listen ben did so noticing nothing at first mrs zimmerman frowned i hear something then he did too the faint sound of rumbling he felt it more through his feet than he heard it with his ears thats the river isnt it he whispered she nodded yes yes i think it is broken wing pointed ahead its coming from that way said ben crosss rivuhh ahead broken wing pointed insistently the rumble of water could only mean the river had narrowed perhaps offering them the opportunity to cross the sound was heartening ben placed a hand on mrs zimmermans shoulder come on then it cant be that much further through the trees she nodded and set off after the indian eager that the shoshone not leave them too far behind ben turned to emily come on well be out of the girl was rooted to the spot her eyes wide her jaw slackened and hanging open emily her eyes remained fixed on something above them hes here she whispered ben turned round and looked up at the branches for no more than half a second he saw the outline of something crouching on a branch pale like a ghost but with spines or spikes emerging from its silhouette and a long skeletal face it uncurled from the branch dropping soundlessly down to the floor of the wood and out of sight beyond a tangled veil of undergrowth oh god he shouted its here broken wing stopped and whipped round ben pointed towards where hed seen it drop there the indian swiftly levelled his musket and dropped to one knee with practised and elegant swiftness mrs zimmerman stumbled towards the indian sobbing with fear as she dropped to her knees at his feet and started muttering in prayer ben reached out a hand for emily come on he whispered quietly her small hand grasped his obediently and they moved slowly towards the others anyone see it ben called out his eyes darting left and right where is it his voice echoed around the wood then diminished in the stillness there was only the continuous muted rumble of the river and the sound of the four of them breathing im right here a whispered voice hissed from somewhere nearby the sibilant hiss echoed in the silence bouncing from tree trunk to tree trunk broken wings aim darted swiftly from a bramble to a cluster of ferns to another he muttered something under his breath a curse this is fun the voice hissed again ben and emily quickly joined the other two and he let her hand go mrs zimmerman reached out a comforting arm to the little girl and held her tight ben stood beside broken wing scanning the forest around them the hunting knife and his stick held ready what do you want ben called out hating the warbling sound of fear in his voice emily the whisper seemed to come at them from all sides quiet yet deafening in the thick silence of the wood there was a long pause he would have been happier with complete silence but instead he could just about detect the quiet muttering of a voice coming from somewhere a small plaintive voice arguing under its breath pleading with some kind of silent partner it sounded like the insane onesided conversations hed heard echoing from the cells of banner house asylum pathetic quiet voices that asked nonsensical questions and moments later riposted the silent replies he knew this was no angel no demon it was the pitiful sound of someone who had lost their mind he swallowed nervously who are you there was no answer the question peeled around the wood and as the echo died away he could hear the whispered debate had ceased ben had been sure he knew who this was last night but now he was not so sure there was a timidity to that small voice that just didnt square with the man youre not preston said ben i know that much no came a hissed reply the dirty man is dead now the voice of the thing was changing from a chilling hiss to something that sounded more human he had it coming the voice continued to drift gradually becoming the emotionally strangled cry of a person struggling to hold back tears of rage he was a bad man bad all the way through even the angel couldnt stand to be with him any longer ben looked from side to side trying to work out where the voice was coming from but the bewitching acoustics of the wood played tricks with it he let eric vander play his games with all the children the voice laughed without joy bitter and hollow well i cut it off didnt i i cut his thing off and shoved it into his mouth before he died there was something in the voice that ben recognised some signature beneath the visceral snarl of hate that he remembered from what felt like a lifetime ago it was a voice he had once taken pleasure in listening to a young man he enjoyed being in the company of sam is that you silence sam is it you out there there was no reply a long moment passed in silence ben strained to listen to the noises of the wood and then he heard it so quiet the whispered onesided conversation of madness once more coming from somewhere ahead of them somewhere behind a dense cluster of twisted and dead vines and brambles long starved of sunlight and sustenance sam he called out sam were going to take her away from this place take her away from prestons madness the man was insane whatever it was he was planning to do it was the product of a very sick mind there was something sam had once asked of him an awkward request that back then hed had to turn down listen ill take you both out of these woods with me you and me and emily you and i well both look after her and well leave all this behind us in the woods where it belongs the sibilant whispered conversation was at once quietened sam just come out where we can see you put down whatever weapon youve made and join us its all over now preston cant get to emily shes safe the silence continued a minute two long enough that ben was beginning to suspect the boy had left them and returned into the darkness of the wood when a familiar voice called out emily please come back with us back to the camp it was sam as ben remembered him from weeks ago a voice utterly without malice broken with emotion pleading please emily please emily began to cry at the sound of his voice sam you said us who else is there with you asked ben the answer came after a few seconds she belongs with us there is gods work still to do back there the voice replied you belong with us emily screamed at those words dont want to go back she grasped bens hand please dont make me go back let go of him the voice hissed angrily no ben shouted back shes coming with us there was a rustle of movement to their right followed by the deafening boom from broken wings musket and the startled flutter of departing birds from the branches above them ben spun round to look towards where the end of the indians musket still pointed as the thick haze of powder smoke around both men cleared ben anxiously peered into the darkness ahead expecting to see a slumped form but there was nothing to be seen sam he called out sam sam is gone the voice hissed back in an instant ben realised they were in trouble the musket had been discharged and nothing hit he turned to broken wing take them and go the shoshone hesitated run ben barked to the others run for the river broken wing hurled the empty musket to the ground and pulled his tamahakan out ready to bloody its small jagged blade he pulled mrs zimmerman roughly to her feet and pushed the woman ahead of him turning to ben and emily he beckoned to them urgently lambert come emily said ben go with him she shook her head no i want to stay with you she cried anxiously reaching for his hand go he shouted angrily shaking her off now she was about to turn and run when the low bough of a squat spruce lurched to one side sending a shower of snow to the ground it stepped out into the open emily gasped at the sight a tall thin figure he stood before them coiled ready to leap forward and disembowel them at any moment strapped to one hand were several long serrated blades whittled and sharpened from bone on his body the ribs of a host of unidentifiable creatures had been stitched to a hide shirt with careless and unskilled haste the head was half the skull of some larger creature perhaps an ox or a stag it appeared that broken wings shot had found the target shattering one side of the skull behind the jagged halfmask of fractured bone he could see the bloodflecked face of samuel dreyton staring out sam emily shrieked recognition relief and fear mixed into her shrill cry he took one small uncertain step forward emily his young voice cracked with emotion not the evil hiss of some demon but the voice of a troubled young man the side of his face that ben could see was pulled into the tight grimace of someone fighting to hold back a flow of emotion emily suddenly shook uncontrollably oh no i i remember i killed him em he admitted his voice choked with a sob i killed saul i had to he would have killed you he would have killed me i i had to em you cut she whispered her eyes wide replaying that day once more yyou cut and cut and cut and cut a tear rolled down sams cheek hhe deserved it saul and eric you ddid those ththings those things to mr vander she gasped he nodded ben thought he saw the slightest hint of revulsion and regret in his face yes i did he uttered and preston too oh sam emily whispered quietly i did it for you em for me too he took a step forward and she whimpered in fear recoiling from him its me he pleaded tearfully stretching out his hand to her her eyes were drawn to the serrated blades strapped to his hand clogged with dry blood and shreds of tissue she screamed it was a brittle highpitched scream that tore to pieces the cushioned silence of the wood emily wrapped her arms around ben terrified of her brother sams face changed in that instant the last sign of the boy replaced with the listless bland face of a killer emily ben looked down at her run she let go of his hand and took a dozen uncertain steps towards broken wing and mrs zimmerman run she turned and fled towards them ben faced sam sam the face he could see behind the fractured bone was still and lifeless not sam not any more it whispered and advanced several steps towards ben from behind him ben heard broken wing call out lammbit come ben waved go dammit go the creature in front of him eyed the longbladed knife ben held in his hand and smiled sam he said quietly let her go broken wing will take her to the shoshone theyll care for her there shell be safe it shook its head not sam i am the angel it added one hand gently patting a canvas sack that hung from a belt ben heard the soft clink of bones as it swung gently in that bag sam is that something preston had is it what was in his chest the creature managed a smile i chose to leave him i chose sam ben could hear the crack of a branch echoing from the trees behind him the others were getting away the longer he could delay sam here the more chance theyd have you are sam he replied take off the skull take off the bones he pointed to the canvas sack undo that let it go sam these things are affecting your mind making you something youre not it stood there in silence the one eye ben could see was no longer glancing distractedly over his shoulder at the others they were out of view now i know you sam before the bad things happened you and i we were friends and we can still be if you take all these bones off and leave them behind you the creature cocked its head curiously sam is telling me he once liked you the voice hissed wanted to be like you ben glanced at the long viciously jagged blades attached to the hand as the fingers flexed and the sharp serrated bones clinked together thats going to cut me to bloody pieces sam listen to me he uttered his mouth dry something very wrong has found its way inside you inside your head something bad but we can make it go away sam is not listening any more it hissed he needs to rest ben looked at the eyes one he could see clearly the other twinkled through the skulls dark orbital socket i can cut you up like i cut all the others it took another step towards him stay where you are its twinkling eye appraised him silently for a moment you seem like a good man ben left that unanswered keatss blade held out in front of him watching the creature ease forward another step only three yards separated them now stay where you are you seem like a good man with love in your heart and so are you sam i told you sam is not here now let me talk to him again no sam sam talk to me he is not here now the creature took another step closer ben backed up sam for gods sake wake up the creature stopped its head cocked slightly listening for a moment sam is that sam talking to you the angel ignored him still listening sam are you there the angel shook its head no i am still here but sam asked me to tell you something what it was fast it crossed the ground between them with liquid grace a blur of movement that left bens sluggish reaction in its wake the lunge was aimed high across his chest and throat before he had a chance to understand what had happened ben was on his knees looking down and watching ribbons of dark red sputter out onto the snow in front of him keatss knife fell to the ground and a moment later he dropped down onto his hands his mind now caught up with events my god im dying the angel squatted down so that the shattered jaw of the long skull was inches from his face it pushed the skullmask off and threw it on the ground ben stared into sams young face smudged with dirt and flecks of drying blood from the small shards of bone that had exploded into his face a few minutes ago it was sams face that not much more than a week ago had been full of the silly dreams that young people have now it was listless expressionless even more terrifying than the skull on the ground beside him ben felt lightheaded the blood gushing out from his throat was bringing his life to a rapid conclusion sam asked me to say he liked you you were his favourite ben fell to the side and instantly felt the press of the cold ground against the side of his face the angel stepped over him and then was gone sprinting lightly in pursuit of the others then it was quiet save for the rumble of the river and a shifting breeze in the canopy of boughs high above he watched the swaying movement of bare twigs and branches and the featureless white winter sky beyond calmly savouring his last few moments then finally in a distracted way he chastised himself that hed not been able to bring his journal full of adventures as promised back home to mother chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california rose shivered sitting on the rough wooden floor beside him im freezing she pulled her anorak further down her legs huddled up inside it like a minitent weve just got to sit tight for tonight and tomorrow tomorrow if we stick to the river and follow it down well come across somebody sooner or later i guess roses lips twitched with the cold they wont find us here julian couldnt work out whether it was a question or a statement no no way theyll find us i just i just i cant believe they shot grace like that i know jules ive never been so flipping terrified i know i know but i think its going to be okay now he said squeezing her shoulder weve lost them as soon as i get a bloody signal on my phone well call someone the police a newspaper and let them know what happened shepherd wont touch us then itll be all over for him they endured the creeping cold in silence listening to the gentle breeze play with the loose things it could find around the camp and the chattering of each others teeth what the hell have we found out here jules what do you mean this story i get the feeling theres more to it than weve worked out i dont understand why shepherds doing this hes risking everything just because of some ancestral skeleton maybe hes got some skeleton of his own to hide he replied you think julian shrugged who knows i think its safe to say the guys unhinged just like his greatgreatgrandfather if hes happy to see us dead maybe hes killed with his own hands before who knows what goes on in that guys basement if you know what i mean but what about the rag man lambert i dont know rose that may have nothing to do with shepherd so that guy survived so what right now weve got a bloody psychopathic preacher whos running for president chasing after us with his hitman ill be honest with you right now thats my main concern she shivered you want to huddle up im freezing okay julian shuffled up against her and placed one arm round her shoulders rose sighed her tremulous breath blowing out a cloud in front of her to think someone like that could end up being president a very scary thought yeah rose replied thoughtfully another very good reason for us to make sure we get out of these mountains ali julian grabbed her arm ouch shh what she whispered thought i heard something windblowingstuffaround something or he squeezed her arm tighter she got the point and hushed then listening intently for any other noises over the clatter of debris being teased by the occasional gust they heard it faintly at first but quickly growing more distinct two voices talking quietly and the sound of footsteps approaching oh shitshitshit whispered rose how the hell did they find us julian shook his head i dont know i dont know it was impossible unless unless theres some kind of tracking device stuck on either of us but there was nothing on them other than the clothes they were wearing and and my fucking blackberry carl studied the small screen right in this bunkhouse id say he muttered quietly yeah theyre definitely in here he pulled something out of his backpack and with a click attached it to the top of his gun a green glowing light spilled from it its quite a long building ill take point carl said quietly and well sweep it from one end to the other you best stay a few yards behind me mr shepherd i understand are you proficient with that firearm he said pointing towards the rifle shepherd was holding ive fired a few hunting rifles in my time good keep it muzzle down sir unless i shout for backup fire shepherd sighed were dealing with a television researcher and a camera girl carl turned to him with respect were dealing with two people who saw their friend shot dead theyll fight or flee either way weve got to be ready to bag em shepherd conceded the point yes youre right carl shall we carl took a step towards the huts entrance his pistol with mounted nightscope raised before him in his other hand the tracking device still counting down the distance but now only tens of yards away he took a step up into the hut his boots clunking on the dry wooden floor shepherd watched him whip sharply from side to side checking the corners checking every angle clear he reported quietly room full of bunkbed frames a long bench each side wood stove at this end some lockers the signals coming from the far end he stepped further inside making his way slowly to the middle of the floor between the two facing rows of bunk frames shepherd stepped up to the doorway of the hut it was the only way in and the only way out as good a place as any to hold position he knelt down in the doorway holding the rifle muzzle down as carl had told him imagining for a fleeting moment that he was a real soldier doing a housetohouse through some baghdad back street he grinned in the dark this is fun checking this end first whispered carl sweeping his nightscope across the stove and around the nearest bunks he crouched down low and looked quickly beneath the bottom bunks signals here cant see anyone though shepherd decided to flush them out julian rose we know youre in here your phone was tagged im sorry but theres no getting away you best come out there was no response a gust of wind played with the skylight shutter in another bunkhouse further along why dont you come out i dont really want to add to the body count if i can help it nothing grace was a mistake carl reacted too quickly he didnt need to shoot her im truly sorry about that shepherd held his breath and listened more closely to the faint sounds coming from inside the hut the rustling skittering sound of a rat the soft moan of a gentle wind eddying inside amongst the rafters and yes he could hear it now the stuttering breath of someone trying to be ever ever so quiet come on out weve got some matters to discuss well come to some arrangement carl took another few steps forward panning his scope left and right between the bunks that he passed by the signals ten yards from my position right ahead shepherd swallowed back a nervous giggle this was getting to be too much fun oh you know what screw this im lying youre both going to die i might kill you quickly or i might decide to have some fun first it really depends how much you piss me off right now shepherd listened intently again as the last vibration of his voice faded he could hear that staccato breathing faster now fluttering with fear carl took another few steps forward whippanning leftright im nearly on the signal cant see em yet though one of them at least is in here cant you hear the breathing its the young woman carl listened no not yet he looked at the display in his hand the signals just ahead to the left between two bunks carl took another few steps forward crouching low to sweep beneath the bunks on both sides then finally he drew up to where the signal was coming from his display read just over two yards through the nightscope he saw something lying on the floor shit he snapped out angrily it was the blackberry he knelt down to pick it up the fuckers ditched it and ran no shepherd called out from the doorway i can hear i can hear her breathing the girls right in here with us carl held his breath and listened he could hear nothing he picked up the phone and then heard something else the soft puff of exhaled air and the rustle of sudden movement from right beside him he swung the nightscope to his left just in time to catch a blurred streak of movement from the top bunk of the frame beside him with a sickening penetrative crunch his eyes saw stars and his ears whistled and rang with a deafening white noise the sound of his mind going into traumatic shock his finger convulsed on the trigger and fired off half a dozen rapid rounds julians right thigh was punched hard he heard the crack of his femur rose get out of here run he screamed letting go of the wooden handle and watching barns slump to the floor with the large rusty canting hook through the back of his skull little rapid breaths puffing out of his mouth like a steam train he heard the clump and scrape of feet on the wooden floor someone scrambling then he heard rose whimper and cry out in the dark on the other side of the hut the sound of a struggle and her desperate muffled cries then a heavy thud oh christ no julian struggled with the pain in his leg trying to pull himself out of the bunk rose he called out it was quiet rose grimacing he managed to swing his leg over the wooden bunk frame and lower himself to the floor by the faint ghostly blue glow of light from a device in barnss twitching hand julian could see the metallic glint of something smooth on the floor the mans gun as he reached down for it everything went black chapter sunday sierra nevada mountains california the young woman was crying her eyes fixed on the gun cooke lying beside her in a small pool of blood from a cut on his scalp was unconscious he was breathing noisily blowing bubbles in his own blood he looked at carl he was quite clearly dead pity the man had been an extremely loyal and useful acolyte william shepherd sat on the bunk in silent contemplation carls pistol held in one hand resting in his lap the more cumbersome rifle on the bunk beside him whwhat are yyou going tto do whimpered the woman shepherd put a finger to his lips shh he needed quiet to think there were considerations to make risk assessments he had to think this through logically before he did something that couldnt be undone why are you waiting the voice was very loud now in his head almost uncomfortably so i have to think shepherd replied aloud kill them is it necessary he uttered and then realised he was speaking is it necessary im certain their silence can be bought what if it cant its a risk i know he nodded but im not prepared to have blood on my hands you already do no i dont carl exceeded his authority he killed unnecessarily the voice laughed unkindly its true i never asked him to kill i asked him to tidy things up shepherd winced yes hed used those words and left carl to interpret them knowing full well what that would mean the man had been fiercely loyal loyal enough that he would happily have taken a bullet for him deep down shepherd had been aware that there would be a body or two before this was all satisfactorily resolved your hands are already bloodied i have never killed anyone im a man of faith you are a man with ambition thats why im here i only wish to do gods will they need to die then shepherds gaze drifted onto them the voice was right of course money most certainly wouldnt silence them a threat might but he couldnt take that chance no if you want the things your heart desires you must kill his hand tightened around the pistol but he resisted the urge to raise it aim it and pull the trigger i wonder are you a good man i am i wonder ive just ive never had to shoot someone before certainly not like this in cold blood so close that he could hear her heart pounding it took an iron will to kill so deliberately so intimately it would be easier if she were running or struggling but like this that is why you need me shepherds hand tightened on the gun i am what you need what do you mean strength william lambert strength lambert that wasnt a name hed used in a long time not since hed started preaching as a young man he always preferred his mothers maiden name shepherd was so much more appropriate for his calling whats more the family name was one his father and grandfather preferred maintain a low profile well away from the tittletattle of newspaper columns and latterly glossy kiosk magazines i have all the strength i need yes then finish the job this isnt this isnt what the lord wants of me he uttered not if he wants me to make his word known i cant do that with blood on me rose stifled a whimper as he said that you can cooke stirred drowsily on the floor hurry now the man is waking up this cant be what god wants of me yes it is he wants them dead he wants you to lead the world to him and im here to help you no im not sure yes god sent me to you now do it if he wants them dead then let him do it the voice was silent cooke opened his eyes blearily and moaned he squinted drunkenly at shepherd wheres m glasses he mumbled with a thick clogged voice julian hissed rose quietly keeping her eyes warily on shepherd shh just be still jules william shepherd turned to look down at the tattered canvas sack on the wooden bunk frame to his side his hand reached for it feeling the small infantsized bones inside through the threadbare cloth its an angel in there he said quietly to rose and julian an angel rose nodded obediently we need him he explained in a quiet abstracted voice we need him to read the words julian was still squinting trying to make sense of what was going on thats right whispered rose encouragingly we need him ignore the bitch do it shepherd shook his head a nervous shake that looked more like a tic no i cant he couldnt murder two people in cold blood and in the next moment turn to the holiest relic in the world and paw at it with his bloodied hands that couldnt be what god would want that couldnt be do it he raised the gun from his lap slowly heavily shepherd cried out julian stop i got a signal earlier i got a signal shepherd hesitated i made a call he held the gun on cooke i made a call shepherd its going to be enough to sink you said julian its enough information to have the press sniffing around you he lowered his voice making it sound as reasoned and calm as he could thats enough to fuck your campaign up its over do it shepherds finger slid onto the trigger wait cried julian raising his hands listen the gun remained on him shepherds finger trembling on the trigger listen the point is you havent killed anyone have you it was barns who did it not you we saw that the voice fell silent in his head what happened with grace yes thats going to look bad i know but but youre not guilty of murder barns is said julian do you understand lower the gun rose and i we can still help you shepherd stared silently at him the gun still aimed but wavering i know youre a good man julian whispered i know you just want to spread gods word he said shooting a curious glance at the linen and tattered canvas bags on the bunk and managing to force a smile through the jagged pain in his leg thats a noble thing this story what happened out here in the past is the past its just that youre not preston youre not evil i know that shepherds hand was shaking who did you call i wont tell you said julian struggling to keep his voice even you know that would be very stupid of me what did you say enough what did you say enough to make you look too unstable to elect shepherd bit his lip angrily the muzzle of the gun twitched and trembled erratically fuck you he snarled fuck you but its not murder shepherd listen ive damaged your reputation okay forget about the white house its over i had to make the call but look youre not guilty of murder not yet shepherds eyes flicked from the gun down to the sack of bones beside him you dont know what youve done he hissed angrily this man has ruined you shepherd winced at the voice if you lower the gun said julian please we can still help each other theres a story he pointed at the linen sack on the bunk theres a message there we can help each other rose nodded earnestly we can help spread your word this man has ruined you please julian slowly held out a hand lower the gun please the gun did feel heavy in his hand now heavier with each passing second he lowered the weapon by a fraction but the voice returned angry and shrill god has no use for you william what youre pathetic ive given my life to god but you are no use to him now please let me prove myself to him all right kill yourself he cocked his head and stared out into the dark his troubled mind taken aback by the sudden request a final test of faith yes he could understand that with the most important task in the history of mankind yet to do yes it made sense it made a lot of sense okay he whispered and slowly raised the gun shepherd cried julian whatre you doing he pointed the gun towards his face you know id do this for him he said quietly i told you id do anything for him he placed the short stub of the barrel in his mouth his lips clasped around it dutifully you know i would do this if he asked it of me kill yourself shepherd obediently placed a finger on the trigger and began to gently squeeze do you see id do it if he wanted im prepared to do anything to die for the lord if he wanted it do you see that now he knew god had once stopped abraham from sacrificing his son at the very last possible moment that the patriarch had to have every intention of killing his own child in order to make evident his fealty shepherd knew god would stop him too but only if he could demonstrate his complete sincerity in this test of faith shepherd pushed his promise a little further with another ounce of pressure on the trigger ill do anything do you see now god was right to choose me god was right to lead me here and another ounce of pressure do you see and another god is this really what you want the small delicately balanced trip lever inside barnss pistol answered the question prematurely chapter april i am alone now i finally worked out how to stop the voice in my head i put him back in the chest with the plates but i am alone he looked up from the journal on his lap his measured handwriting contrasted with the deteriorating childlike scrawl of bens on the previous pages the snow across the camp was melting in the warm light it was warm enough in fact that he sat on a cushion of blankets in the open with his shirt off taking some small pleasure from the heat on his pale back the snow still remained in deep slushy piles but in the places where it had not been so thick dark muddy patches showed there is a smell here in this place that i cannot take any longer he wrote across the mottled ground of mud and snow the bodies lay rotting and bloated both oxen and human the meat from the beasts had turned too bad to eat he saw faces in the dirty slush that were once families he knew faces that had once had names jeremiah stolheim sophia lester aaron hollander but were now swollen and purple and anonymous the angel killed so many of them he came back here to this place and killed them all i tried to stop him but he wouldnt listen he wanted to make an example of them sams hand stopped scratching words across the page there were things sitting before him in front of the temple carefully stacked beside the campfire like logs his eyes momentarily rested on them grisly things that his hand refused to transcribe on the page the angels rage had been complete the deeds that had been done on his return to the camp sam had managed to erase or at least dull most of those memories from his mind the screams the panic of slaughter all that remained now rotting in the melting snow was the aftermath now he is gone i can see with my own eyes the bad things he did to the bodies i see with my own eyes the heads carefully placed in a pile i see with my own eyes the cuts the gashes the fear in those bloated dead faces i see now what the angel is he looked towards the temple the lumber frame no longer supported around the base by dense tightly packed drifts of snow had sagged to one side everything askew inside the angel was sealed away in prestons metal chest there had been a night one particular night late in december as he dined alone on frozen meat in the musky darkness of his shelter when his wretched grief and the angels tormenting voice had proved too much for him he had pulled the canvas sack from his belt staggered into the temple and as the shrill and suspicious voice screamed accusations at him in his mind he had opened the chest and dropped the sack inside sam hadnt dare venture within the slanting shelter since he knew if he did hed hear it whispering to him to be let out again i think i understand what the angel is now it is the darkness in our hearts made a thousand times worse it made sense in a cruel unforgiving way it made sense to him that guarding those precious plates on which gods true message was inscribed were those bones he realised now that they were a test of purity and intent as a magnifying glass could be to the suns rays so those angels bones were to a mans soul sams grief at losing emily his rage had been turned by the angel into a storm of wrath visited back here in the camp on those poor people who had remained i see now that it was a good thing emily left me that she escaped with the indian and mrs zimmerman i fear if she hadnt i might find her head stacked here amongst the others he looked up at the sky clear and blue promising an unbroken day of warmth today he decided was the day he was going to leave another night alone in this forsaken place and he imagined madness would finally take him completely he looked at the space left on the last page of this journal benjamin lamberts journal this last page was dark with new ink a bottle hed discovered a few days ago whilst scavenging through one of the other shelters i have read all of benjamins words in here of all the bad things the angel did killing him was the worst he was my friend he was a good man sam wondered how different things might have been if the angel had chosen ben to come to his heart had seemed purest it was a cruel joke he considered that the person most worthy of doing the lords work most pure in heart and capable of making good of the angels influence was the one person who had no belief at all in god sam had a wish i wish i were like ben i wish i could be him a solitary tear rolled down his hollowed cheek and dropped onto the bottom of the page dotting his last scribbled line like a full stop he looked at his words the testimony of samuel dreyton and realised in that moment that perhaps he could have something of what he desired samuel dreyton could die as perhaps he should and ben could in a way live once more sam realised his freshly written words should be the first thing to go he ripped the page out of the journal and tossed it into the muddy slushy snow my name is ben he uttered with a voice weak and cracked and sounding like the frail rattle of an old man he stood up painfully thin and uncertain in his mind whether hed make a mile from this place before collapsing let alone finding civilisation once more he returned the journal to benjamins chest and sealed it with the solemnity of someone burying someone dearly beloved my name is benjamin he whispered as he stepped out of the clearing and into the trees he looked back one last time at the browning humps of dead firtree branches that had once sheltered people through an unseasonably early winter my name is benjamin lambert he croaked one last time and set off into the wilderness heading west chapter monday sierra nevada mountains california the sky above them was stained grey and overcast as they stumbled awkwardly along the silted bank of the gently burbling river the water seemed as black as ink and moved smoothly and calmly past them showing the way out of the mountains west towards safety shit i need another rest please gasped julian rose eased him down onto the ground aghhh shit he cried legs killing me its broken in several places said rose i think i can hear it grating he winced as he lay back in the coarse grass looking up at the sky it was tumbling with thick winter clouds that threatened to open up at any moment yeah thanks for telling me that rose i can damn well feel it grating he grunted through gritted teeth she offered him a pitiful smile hang in there jules ill get you out of here you thirsty he nodded she opened the backpack it had belonged to agent barns inside was a survival pack foil wrap a couple of highprotein bars and a flask of water she pulled out the flask and gave it to julian she caught sight of the linen sack inside and eased it carefully out opening it to reveal half a dozen corroded plates of metal beneath her fingers she felt the indentations and bumps of unintelligible letters and shapes stamped into the metal what do you think she asked passing him one of them julian turned the plate over in his hands inspecting it sceptically some kids metalwork project looks like he snorted wearily passing it back a sheet of scrap metal with a few interesting shapes banged into it im going to be honest here he said im pretty sure its not the word of god written in the language of angels and this she asked pulling out the threadbare canvas sack the bones inside clinked softly ten quid says they were once somebodys bloody pet cat theyre old she said the canvas bag looks like its seen a lot of years julian shrugged i dont know an old pet cat then rose laughed yeah maybe whatre we going to do with em dunno well get someone to take a look if theyre genuinely joseph smiths scrolls then i suppose they have some historical value im sure the mormon church wouldnt mind having them back rose nodded i guess ridiculous though isnt it what that there are people out there people like shepherd who would kill for a bag of old cat bones and a few pieces of scrap metal julian laughed weakly its a world full of crazy people she looked up at the sky the first few snowflakes were coming down towards them light and carried like pollen on the gentle breeze starting to snow she said cmon we better get going i dont want to be caught out here overnight no julian winced she put the two cloth sacks back in the pack and slung it over her shoulder then grimacing at the pain she was about to inflict on julian began to help him to his feet shit he howled ow slowly rose slowly sorry sorry she cooed apologetically he gasped took a few deep breaths okay all right im good to go this river will lead us down to the camp site she assured him well make it there by evening im sure he nodded yeah they proceeded along the silted riverbank puffing clouds of laboured breath and watching the winter sky above unleash the first tentative snowfall of the season julian managed to conjure a faint sanguine smile if it wasnt for the jarring agony in his leg this would be quite a pleasant hike it was peaceful almost silent except for the gentle muted hiss of the river the swish and thump of the backpack against roses shoulder with each staggered step and something else the soft reassuring whisper of a breeze through the naked branches of elms and cedars along the riverbank a whisper that sounded almost human almost like words
